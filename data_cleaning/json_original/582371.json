This time I felt compelled to write a review. The front desk surprised us by upgrading our room and they didn't even know it was our anniversary. We walked in to a beautiful and well appointed jacuzzi room with a view of the water, down town and The Space Needle to the North. We utilized the free shuttle. The driver was very curteous, friendly and helpful with a good recommendation on where to dine. We also visited the brewery across the street and had excellent service there. We were pleasantly surprised once again when we checked out the outdoor roof top pool and jacuzzi. Fabulous! As if all this weren't enough, the next morning we asked for a late check out and they allowed us to stay until 2 PM!

Yes - as per previous review - this is considered \"downtown\" but it is definitely outside the downtown area being right across the street from Safeco Fields. For my girlfriends weekend away - it would've been nice to be in the Pike Street area but Silver Cloud has a fantastic shuttle. We got the shuttle at 9am and it dropped us off right at Pike Place Market. We shopped all day, had a massage and a fantastic dinner at Purple Cafe. After dinner we called the shuttle and it picked us up right outside the restaurant. The shuttle goes ANYWHERE in a designated zone and you don't have to walk to certain spot - it'll pick you up right outside where you are. The shuttle driver on Sat night (Feb 18th) - I wish I got his name - was such a great guy. Chatted and made jokes about the # of bags we had. The hotel is in the night club/bar area of town so there are some seedy guys but if you walk past them, they don't bother you. We easily walked to the waterfront for dinner and back. The hotel is clean with a safe in the room and beds were extremely comfortable. Love the blackout curtains as we really needed to sleep in on Sunday! Front desk staff was also really great. When we checked out Sunday the lady took our valet receipt and got the guys to bring out the car while we were checking out so we barely had to wait for our car. Good job on the customer service.

CONS: -Some of the other little touches were missing - no minibar, no bottled water in the room; -the Stadium area is a bit industrial - not the best place for a walk after dark; -the wi-fi was a little slow at times (but hey, it was FREE and there's also a FREE business centre with computers and internet access that's faster); -the beds are totally comfortable but they're just not quite as good as Marriott, Sheraton or Westin beds (those ones are just fantastic)... on the other hand, this hotel is priced better; -Room service ends at 11:00pm.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNot a great choice for those who drive\u201d", "Author": "dougers79", "ReviewID": "UR120381313", "Content": "This hotel was literally like day and night.

Not quite sure I needed the in-room \"kitchenette\" -- sink, fridge and microwave -- or the laundry on the 8th floor, but I imagine these are useful for some travelers. And I'm certainly not complaining about additional facilities! There were no Mariners, Seahawks or Sounders games going on so the place was quiet and I was allowed to check in right away as I arrived pretty early. The restaurant in the lobby was decent -- but a little lacking in charm, maybe because it was empty. But, yeah, overall this hotel is nice. Definitely worth the $100 or so a night that I paid on Priceline. The only drawback about this place is its location -- that's why I rate it 3 instead of 4. Other than the lobby restaurant and Pyramid brew pub across the street, you're in nowheresville. Super useful, I imagine, if you're in town for one day just to see a game. I'm a single guy who enjoys a good healthy walk and doesn't mind slightly gritty parts of town -- but my 70-year old parents would find this location inconvenient and a little sketchy. On the other hand, they might use the free shuttle bus, but that's no my style. It's a fairly bleak 10 minute walk to get from the hotel to Pioneer Square -- although there are one or two interesting old bars along the way. From the airport, the light rail is pretty convenient, although the 10 minute walk from the station to the hotel is a little tough to navigate -- again, something my parents just wouldn't do.

The restaurant Jimmy's is super, fun clientele, super waitstaff. Complimentary wi-fi as well as courtesy van. I used the van once when the power was off for over 2 hours because of event out of the hotel's control. Unfortunately, I found management lacking during the crisis and they made no effort to make guests comfortable while power was off and restaurant closed. Staff was huddled around the gas fireplace in the lobby and the only guest offer made was to show them where to walk up the stairs to enter room. Since the outage occurred from 11-1:30pm - the most frequent question was \"where can i go to get something to eat?\" I sat in the lobby for over an hour and it would have been a nice touch for the hotel to have offered hot beverages or a snack in the lobby. At around 5pm when i returned, my room on the 6th floor had no heat. Engineering was called and they responded promptly by resetting a HVAC button in the closet. Traffic noise, sirens were loud and my husband wore ear plugs to sleep. There is some sort of clean air window in the room but the clips were broken off so it was not soundproof. In spite of the issues, the room was comfortable, clean, in good shape - well the shower curtain was ripped but other than that for a hotel with high occupancy it was good value.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cClean hotel, friendly staff but far away from the city core\u201d", "Author": "Gnomixa", "ReviewID": "UR94536054", "Content": "I liked the hotel overall - it's newish, clean and the staff are friendly.

Otherwise, you would have to spend your time and money getting to and from downtown Seattle. The hotel has a shuttle (free) that can drop you off and pick you up (you have to arrange both) from downtown, which is nice, but again requires making arrangements = hassle/waiting.

I forgot to write the review until I needed to look up hotels for our next trip! :) We flew in to Seattle to attend a Seahawks VS Giants game, and wanted the proximity to the stadium, since we hadn't been to Seattle before. What we actually got was a WHOLE lot more! Yes, it is literally right next to both the Seahawks stadium AND the Mariners stadium, but its really a short walk to anything, though if you dont feel like walking, they have a FREE SHUTTLE! I spoke to Chris to book my reservation, and he was BEYOND friendly and helpful, and made me feel very comfortable about the hotel and area in which it is located. He suggested restaurants and things to do, and boasted on their shuttle service, which has service pickup/drop-off points, though if they are not busy when you call, they may be able to pick up/drop you somewhere specific. The rooms are great! We originally booked just a normal king room, on the 9th floor, which was perfect, great size, and CLEAN! :) (see pics) Our TV, however, kept turning itself on and off...hmmm... so they moved us to a fantastic SUITE (!) on the same floor. This particular suite had windows that allowed a view of both stadiums, and the street below. On game day, we LOVED this! You could feel the excitement coming up from the street. :) The beds (in both rooms, actually) were comfortable, not too hard, not too soft. Great pillows. iPod docking alarm clock radio. Seattle's Best coffee with a coffee maker, flat screen TV's (in the suite, there were 2) a mini-fridge, and a GREAT SHOWER! Big, adjustable shower head with excellent flow. Hair dryer, great toiletries (no need to bring your own!) and soft towels. (see more pics! :) We did hear our neighbors on one night, but only for a little while and the rest of our stay was really quiet. Rooms are clean, still in new condition. I really loved this hotel!!! There is a pool and spa on the 9th floor. We did use the spa, but not the pool. The spa was big, with great jets, and it was HOT! Perfect for after a flight in! There is a restaurant (Jimmy's On First) on the main floor, but we are impatient folk and didnt want to wait (it was PACKED ever morning), so we walked a few blocks in to Starbucks. (What?! Its SEATTLE! LOL!!!) However, if you walk out the main lobby door and turn right, there is a little walk-up window cafe right there on the street, about half a block up. Muffins, coffee, etc. The first time we left the hotel on foot, we followed the route along the water, suggested by the reception desk clerk. We love to walk new cities; there is no better way to see ALLLL of it. This was not a bad route, if you want to see the more industrial side of Seattle/freeway/backs of beautiful buildings. We suggest, however, walking out the doors, turning toward Seahawks stadium and walking into the city that way. You get lots of storefronts and interesting things to see. Seattle is just gorgeous! We used the shuttle service several times. They prefer you use their appointment system to use the shuttle, but you forget (as we did) they are very flexible with it. When it took us to the Space Needle/Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Museum one morning, we noticed a McDonalds kitty-corner from us and had breakfast there. There is a magazine in the room, with restaurant suggestions, and we took them. LOL! We tried il Forniao, an Italian restaurant downtown at the mall, which the shuttle was kind enough to drop us at. Another night we tried Elliots, on the pier. YUMMMMMMM! Both were fantastic, reasonably priced, and had GREAT service. We recommend both. On last note, I was unaware the Seattle had LOTS of breweries. LOL! Incidentally, there is even one located kitty-corner from the hotels lobby, Pyramid Alehouse, though we never went in. We were told they had great food, as well as brews. Anyway, we booked a brewery tour, through Great Pacific Northwest Brewery Tours. SOOOO FUN!!! I recommend that as well. They take you to 3 breweries, and you get to try several beers at each. Be aware, they are NOT sample size! :) Bottom line, we LOVED Seattle, and LOVED Silver Cloud Hotel-Stadium.

We did use it to drop us off at the Harry Potter exhibit near the Space Needle. We ended up taking a cab back to the hotel after we had dinner downtown ($10 including tip).

I had room 442, facing directly across the street to Safeco Field. (Even though it's across the street, you're so close you feel like you're inside the stadium.) I had enjoyed the Silver Cloud Stadium before, and it was great for a return visit because it's directly between Qwest Field (football) and Safeco Field (baseball). There are basically two kinds of rooms at this hotel, ones with a \"view\" and the rest which face an interior brick wall. The interior rooms are definitely quieter, but you feel kind of crammed in. The exterior facing rooms are more enjoyable, but you definitely hear street noise, people, cars and trains...and ESPECIALLY noise from Safeco Field. Even when there isn't a sporting event going on there, they play baseball radio snippets at LOUD VOLUME from speakers outside which point directly at the hotel. It's a little weird. But the hotel is new and modern and everything worked. Clean and convenient and the restaurant/bar downstairs (Jimmy's on First) has pretty much everything you need. For this visit, I tried taking the new, light rail in from the airport. It was cheap, fast and convenient. $2.50 vs. $40 or so for a cab. But when you get off at the Stadium Station, it was a little confusing trying to figure out exactly how to walk to the hotel. It wasn't marked. Even though it's only about a two block walk, you can't get directly there in a straight line. From the light rail stop, you walk across the street and down the block towards the stadiums. Then cross the street again, and walk up a curved ramp to your left...then past Safeco Field and then down some stairs or take an elevator back to street level. It's another block to the Hotel.

The Stadium property is aptly named, since it is the only hotel located between Safeco and Quest Fields in Seattle and is perhaps a 4 1/2 rating, if that were available. How it came to be located there would be an interesting story- but it does enjoy the perfect definition of \"Location, Location, Location\". The location of the two stadiums, and the hotel, brings the love/hate relationship to bear. They are all located in the rail yards and industrial area south of the Seattle downtown core; and there is industrial and train traffic in the vicinity. So if that bothers you don't stay there- there are thousands of rooms 10 minutes north in downtown. But if you want to be within a few steps of the two fields, this is THE ( actually the only) place to stay. On the plus side: The property is fairly new and has been well maintained. The staff, from valet to front desk to housekeeping to the restaurant and bar was top notch- great attitudes and very good skills. The property is a full service business location in addition to supporting the sports venues. The rooms are large and fully equipped: large plasma TV with every sports station imaginable, refer, micro, complementary internet, wet bar with good coffee, morning newspaper, large bath with lots of counter space and good toiletries. The bed was better than average with good linens. While the rooms are not soundproof, they are good enough considering the cacophony present outside. We ate and beveraged at Jimmy's, the hotel restaurant and bar- service was excellent, food and beverage above average. This is a very good house so the improvement list is relatively short. The hotel has only two public elevators for a nine story building; there are regular lines to use them. And when an event lets out the lines get very long. But this would be a tough fix on a completed building. And the bath towels should be better for a property of this caliber and price. We rated the value down a notch, but they may be debatable. At a minimum of $250 per night and $20 per day for parking that adds a lot to the price of a Mariner, Seahawk or Sounder game. The restaurant prices were stiff but again not out of line for downtown. Keep in mind that Seattle adds plenty of sales/ excise taxes to each of these - 10% for food, 15% for hotels and 19% for parking- so the tariff for a couple of day stay is not insignificant.

Yes, that fat wet snow almost like rain it is was not a warm day at all, They tried to open the roof but it was rough. I need another layer and left my seat and went to my room across the street and was back in 3 outs. I missed a half inning something most people do going to the restroom anyway so you can see why the location is perfect. The rooms are standard but not chain like. They are not the Kimpton style I love but they are not the cookie cutter feel either. With Ipod docks and flat screen HDTVs they are on the cutting edge and the suite with the hot tub cannot be beat after a long day walking the city streets and getting ready for the night game. I like the rooms alot and have no issues at all with them. I can stock the fridge with a few beverages of choice and that is always a plus! The front desk every time is just great and getting them to hold my bags for the red eye home with my pre-arranged car waiting makes it a snap to catch the game and fly out after. In 08 I had to do that and they helped me line up my return to the airport following the game. This year I had plenty of time to unwind before my cab to the airport after the day game. Jimmy's the hotel bar/restaurant is great and one of the bar tenders remembered me from the year before. This year I did less on the town tourist wise but the shuttle will get you around downtown with no problem and the after hours the cabs are just 6 bucks or so back if you are out later than when the shuttle runs. I cannot say enough what a perfect location it is and what a great place to stay it is. I almost always stay with one of my partner hotels to get miles or in many places I look at Kimpton first then everyone else but Seattle is different.

It is now past 11:00PM, we are still locked out of the room and the maintenance person is gone for the night. Front desk stated that the hotel was at its full capacity and they could not provide us with a courtesy room to spend the night, therefore; we had to wait for the maintenace guy to come back from his home, at that time of the night , and see what was wrong with the door lock. We went back to the front lobby to wait there, were given two small bottles of Minute Maid orange juice for consolation, and were told that maintenance had been contacted and that within 15 minutes the problem was going to be solved. At 12:30 AM, after 2 hours and 45 minutes locked out of our room, tired and sleepy, front desk finally told us that our door had been opened by maintenance and that the problem was that the lock since it is electric, had run out of batteries. WHAT!!!!???? Don't they perform preventive maintenance or their equipment???? Don't they change the door lock batteries periodically?? For the price they charge for their rooms, the lock ran out of batteries, that's it??????. How do they explain that someone opened that door, left it open, placed a \"privacy please\" sign on the door, but no one reported that the lock was having problems? Needless to say my night was trashed, ruined, wasted. Next morning we were able to speak to Mr. Mark Lee, director of guest services, he was very kind and understanding of our situation.

Had a nice view of the ballpark, when we stayed the team was not in town. Pool with hot tub on top floor, very nice, pool wasn't huge, but we were there mainly to soak in the hot tub.

Everything we needed was provided, answered, or arranged. Used the shuttle service twice without a problem (just make a reservation at the front desk), though we chose to use a taxi back each time. The hotel also arranged a Towne Car to take us back to the airport for a flat $40, as opposed to the $45 we paid for a taxi upon arrival. Used the business center to print out our boarding passes for the return flights. Our King Suite had a sleeper sofa that my niece used, and the maids made it up for her the next day. We were also provided with comfy robes, which we used on our way up to the pool. The pool was small, but great fun. We had glorious weather, and wanted to eat our lunch while sunning. No problem! Ordered burgers and cocktails downstairs, and it was delivered by the time we had changed into our suits and spread the pool towels on our chaise lounges. Even re-ordered a round or two of the cocktails. The pool was heated, but we didn't go in. There's also a good-sized hot tub. Did not visit the fitness room, partly because it looked kinda small. Our room had a mini-fridge big enough for two sandwiches, two ceasar salads, two yogurts, two waters, and four diet cokes. Microwave came in handy for instant oatmeal in the morning.

My husband just moved here a year and a half ago and I figured this would be a great cheaper vacation and he could become more familiar with the city. Location-This location was perfect for going to Safeco for Mariner games, you literally cross the street and are there getting your ticket scanned. Qwest field is also just across the street, so great for Seahawk and Sounder games as well. As for seeing other things, the closest area of interest is Pioneer Square which was a very doable walk, I'd say about 12 blocks. Just make sure you have some nice walking shoes on. We even walked back to the room from the downtown waterfront and it wasn't bad at all. Of course they have the shuttle though which will take you two miles within the hotel. Pick up the maps in the hotel lobby that have all the tourist destinations. Very helpful. Room-We stayed in a King room, it was smaller, what you'd expect from city hotels these days, but was comfortable for the two of us. Granite counter in the bathroom, a big tub, a wet bar with mini fridge and microwave and sink (also granite) with a very large flat screen TV and lots of free movie channels. The windows in the room opened, which was great because the room felt a little claustrophobic at night with the curtains closed (which are great for sleeping in-they completely block out the light). As far as noise, we definitely heard our fair share of trains during our five night stay, but it wasn't loud enough to wake me up once I was asleep, and I am a VERY light sleeper. Also, the windows do a great job of keeping out noise, there is a huge difference with them open and shut. Free wifi in the room too. Food-So the hotel has a restaurant on the first floor, Jimmy's on First, which we had dinner and breakfast at once. Dinner was okay, the food was just way too expensive for the quality it was. Breakfast was also expensive, I had the Sodo continental one morning and the amount of fruit was tiny, but the muffin was good. Service was great here though, the staff was always friendly. This place was never too crowded either, didn't have to wait for a table even before and after games. The Pyramid Alehouse is right across the street, we ate here twice and like it, but it's definitely bar food. If you want something fancy head up First Ave about 10 blocks to Il Terrazzo Carmine, expensive but amazing italian food. Shuttle-We used the shuttle frequently, and the shuttle drivers were always friendly even though they had to drive in hectic Seattle traffic all day long. You have to call ahead and reserve seats in the shuttle and they leave in 30 minute intervals. They do stop at 10:30PM which is kind of early, especially for the weekend so a lot of times we took the shuttle out and a cab back. Be aware that you can ride in the shuttle for a long time, for example we got picked up after walking around the city all day, got in and had to stop at five other places. We weren't counting on it taking that long and missed a dinner reservation. Service-Room was always clean, the staff was always friendly, especially at the front desk. Everyone from the waiters in the restaurant to the valet was nice and attentive. We were able to check out an hour late free of charge. No problems here. Parking-20$ valet only. Very cheap compared to the rest of the hotels in the city.

Everything updated. Huge flat screens in the rooms, the lobby is all new, has a warm cozy fireplace. The restaurant Jimmy's downstairs looked awesome however we didn't eat there. Looked like the BEST place to go before a game. The hotel is literally across the street, and I imagine on game days, Seahawks or Mariners that place is packed with fans/clientele who like nice things. Pyramid brewery is also across the street, never made it over there but I think you can take a tour and it has a restaurant... The Best part of the hotel was the shuttle, I know you think shuttle...blah...no way, this shuttle took you everywhere you wanted to go. They had 4 drop off points but one night the driver took us right to the place we wanted to eat. Then said, call us when you are done and literally he asked me where I was and they picked us up. We only spent money on a taxi to and from the Airport. I called the hotel and they suggested a towncar and had the driver call me within 2 minutes, it was so easy. towncar was 45 dollars to hotel and 40 dollars back. Much nicer than a cab... meets you where you want, no taxi lines. Its just nicer. After reading some of the reviews we did hear those trains and yes they were loud, I'm not exactly sure how long they were making noise but we were confused on why they were going off and was it a boat, so we noticed it, but as you will see Downtown Seattle its all very port like, train like...you should expect noise.

I will admit the trains, well mostly the crossings, were loud and constant but then we were facing the train crossings. The first night I hardly slept, BUT that was not enough to deter me to move from the nice room. I got used to it quick. The valet parking is quite convenient but a little expensive.

Firstly the hotel was about 5 minutes walk from the railway station, which means The rooms were new and clean. I stayed in a room with a huge king bed, with a huge flatscreen TV on the wall. The bathrooms are roomy, with a very nice shower. One note, the hotel does not provide shower gel in the rooms. As for the location, it was excellent for the train station and also of course for the stadia. I was staying in a room with a direct view of one of the scoreboards (Safeco Field ... as I live in UK I don't know which sport this is ... I think it's baseball!). However it is not really near anything else, certainly I could find no convenience stores etc. The hotel restaurant was nice. We had a good (if a little pricey) breakfast, but it was a la carte. Room service in the evening was excellent value and good quality. The hotel is really let down by its reception staff. When I arrived to check in, I gave my name, the guy on reception looked up my reservation and laughed. I asked him what was funny, he said there was a note on my reservation, I asked what it said he said he couldn't tell me. Made me feel a little uncomfortable. Then later asked another guy at reception for directions - he couldn't even find the hotel on the map. And in the morning checking out I had to wait 10 minutes foe someone to appear at the desk and then they had charged me for 2 nights parking when (a) it would have been a very long drive from London (!!!!) and (b) I only stayed for 1 night. No apologies, I had to justify it coming off. Also there is no doorman, which can make finding a cab hard (and opening the doors with lots of luggage).

This hotel adjacent to the Stadiums is also walking distance to Pioneer Square which has wonderful fun shopping - incredible book stores, wonderful toy store, boutiques, antiques, art galleries and fun restaurants, along with a Park in the square that will remind you a bit of Paris. Back to the hotel: Very nice staff and management, very clean. It is not the most expensive so perhaps it can't afford to please me on every need - they had run out of shower caps but on the 3rd day found one for me, all the pillows are foam and too much pillow for me (no down alternatives or even any alternatives - all pillows are the same.) There isn't a breakfast included rate like at the Broadway Silver Cloud, but Jimmy's on 1st is a good restaurant that did pretty well for us- nothing exceptional though, just convenient, and hotel food prices (not a place where locals would eat breakfast - too high). The hotel lobby is nice: fireplace, bright windows and furnishings, flat screen for viewing while waiting for someone... The standard rooms were very nice and great value when ordered from Expedia or hotwire. If you want a little more I recommend the suites over the jacuzzi rooms - The jacuzzi just seemed out of place - planted in a standard room next to the window, as far away from the bathroom as you can get. You really have to step up and over and then get in - all a bit awkward. They do provide you with bath salts and a loofa and bath robes. The suite has the robes too and the corner suites have so much light and plenty of space for a small gathering. We even served soup and salad brought in from a gourmet store - heated up the soup in the microwave- and our family of 6 adults and one infant were all comfortable in the living room - FYI only one of us stayed in the room - the others lived locally or had their own room. Wonderful HDTVs flat screen captivated the men - and had lots of cable sports channels. My brother and his family live in West Seattle - this is the closest nice place to stay when visiting family in West Seattle - no traffic to get on the bridge - I was at his place in 10-15 minutes max. No great views - unless you mean looking through to part of the baseball field - interesting but nothing to write home about...the water view is all about sea transport containers and cranes...and yes, beware of the train sounds. They can be frequent and at all hours - annoying. There are some rooms quieter than others, and this can make a big difference. The train sounds were not as annoying as the road sounds from motorcyclists revving and whipping down the surrounding empty streets late at night - I suspect this is common on Friday nights, as it wasn't a problem every night. So with ear plugs, and your own travel pillow and shower cap you will be able to have a perfect stay. Again the staff are wonderful and so I wouldn't be surprised if and when they read this they do everything they can to amend the shortcomings...sans the local sound effects - it is really outrageous that the builder did not put top grade sound proof windows in. Silver Cloud Inns are really nice - great group, so I feel it is unfortunate that the builder here did not do the right thing - also the jacuzzi room I checked out not only had noise from 1st street, but also the cold air was seeping through the window frame as well. Some 8th floor jacuzzi rooms are below the 9th floor party room - NOISY - avoid at all costs or confirm no party is planned for the ceiling in your 8th floor room. I loved my suites on the 5th and 6th floors - very quiet except for the trains. Some suites have separate shower and bath. My 94 year old grandmother, who needed a handicap room, also enjoyed her stay. She said she enjoyed the trains - \"they didn't bother me, they remind you that you are still alive\". Also some of her costume jewelry couldn't be located, and the staff were so nice, searched the removed linens, and the room meticulously and found them for us. Housekeeping was great- very clean and the beds and sheets are wonderful!", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cOne word - \" Noisy\"\u201d", "Author": "yvan31", "ReviewID": "UR12071159", "Content": "Very nice lobby area and a big plasma tv in the room; room is small but should be ok for a short getaway; the bed is comfortable BUT the noise from the railway just keeps me awake for the WHOLE night!!!!

First time visiting and this hotel made it just the best experience. We loved the room, sooo clean and lovely to sleep in. The tv and movie service just topped off our evenings. The pool/hottub area are just awesome and overlook the pier area and the safeco field. It has a nice restaurant in the hotel as well right across the street. It is a little far to walk some days to the pike market or pioneer square but the shuttle offered could not of been any better. When we called for pickup it seemed like we waited no time at all and the drivers were fantastic with all sorts of suggestions. We used the shuttle extensively and it never let us down. Will definitely be staying here again.
