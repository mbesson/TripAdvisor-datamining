This also applies to the rooms which are narrow and tall, do not expect a lot of extra space. This is common for all such hotels though. I stayed in room 15 which was unfortunately situated directly off the stairwell, and the stairs are very noisy. Also all the noise from the lobby carried up through the thin door, making this more like a hostel experience in that regard. Earplugs were a must. The room was basically clean, but was starting to show its age. Especially the grouting in the shower would need replacing. Like almost all Amsterdam hotels, the Alexander is overpriced and overrated for what it actually offers, and it would not be ranked as a three star establishment for example in the Nordic countries. With these things things in mind, it is still a recommendable hotel thanks to its location, the fair service and the acceptable quality of its rooms. Just make sure you reserve yours high up and away from the stairwell.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel for Amsterdam City Break\u201d", "Author": "lottie007", "ReviewID": "UR125851558", "Content": "A great hotel for a short City Break in Amsterdam.

They recommended a good place to eat dutch dishes in the very nearby Liedseplein area (just 2 to 3 blocks away), called The Pantry.

Three were with a Rick Steves tour and two were solo (paid 95 euro which included breakfast). As I was alone in the room the entire time, I did not mind the small size. I loved it! I was cozy and had everything I needed. My room looked over the garden, had a mini fridge, and a fan up on the wall for cooling purposes and additional white noise. The bathroom was decent size with plenty of room to lay out toiletry items. Our group enjoyed the outside balcony area to gather for drinks before going out to dinner. There is an Albert Heijn grocery store right by tram stop #1 on Overtoom. Also, an organic food store on Overtoom near the hotel that only takes credit cards, no cash. As other reviewers have noted, the hotel is located close to trams 1, 2, and 5, as well as the Leidseplein. I walked to the Rijks and Van Gogh Museums. Here is my special story about the Hotel Alexander...Two young brothers work the front desk and they both were always very courteous and helpful to me. I wanted to attend an outdoor dance performance in Vondel Park and I asked him the location of the theater in the Park. He tried to describe it to me, but the park is very large. I did find the theater and had a wonderful experience. After I returned, I discovered that he had walked the park in hopes that he would see me again to give me more detailed instructions as how to find the theater.
