It's centrally located on Hong Kong Island. If you're coming from the airport, you can get off at Hong Kong station and walk to it in 10-15 minutes, or simply change to Sheung Wan station. As you walk, you'll see that you're close to lots of shopping, luxury and bargain. Although you may have your doubts when you see the surrounding buildings, it's stylish both outside and inside. Your first stop will be the 2nd floor reception, where you are welcomed with a smile. This is a true skyscraper, albeit a narrow one with 24 floors and 3 rooms to a floor. The rooms are small, but they are clean, modern, and stylish - you'll have fun trying out all the lighting configurations. Once in your room, you'll find elegant shower supplies and slippers, plus a 'loot bag' with a few snacks and sweets. The mini-bar is free - although besides water and juice, it's just beer. However, there's a free happy hour from 6-8 pm with wines and other alcohol, and breakfast is free, too. Oh, wifi is free, too. I found breakfast impressive, in that while what was offered was limited, it was well-done and fresh: fruit cups, yogurt and compote, some breads, and ham and cheese. The happy hour snacks were less impressive; for example, the two nights I was there, the cut celery and carrots were not fresh and were turning brown, the cheese was hard, and the crackers all crushed. The wine was superb! The hotel also has a small gym, with 2 treadmills and 1 up-and-down machine (my brain is failing me now; you know what I mean). Noise was not a problem. The only thing keeping me from rating this as 5* is the price. My rate was about \u00a3105 a night. I know that HK hotels are not cheap and this cost is about average, bur for me it's still expensive. So, if you know you're going to pay around this rate, I highly recommend this hotel for its service and freebies.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Hong Kong base\u201d", "Author": "bork3000", "ReviewID": "UR138707458", "Content": "Ovolo is a perfect base to explore Hong Kong.

There's a nice gym and really convenient laundry facilities (detergent provided!) on the 3rd floor. I stayed for HK$1000, an unbelievably low price for a hotel of this caliber in Hong Kong. perhaps because the price is low, most of the guests seemed to be Mainland Chinese, which made me consider some would not be as happy as I was here. The \"Western Chic\" style an largely Western staff do not quite 'jibe' with Chinese preferences. I felt this hotel has a lot in common with \"virgin\" from a branding perspective. downsides\u2014very small. I stayed alone, 2 people in the room might be a bit too tight. even the elevators and entry hallway were very tight to move bags in and out of. While someone helped me up to the second floor on arrival, when leaving I needed to first go to the 2nd floor to check out then squeeze my gear back into the elevator to leave the hotel. There's also not a convenient place for pickup drop off in front of the hotel, because of a railing. but those are small grievances, If they keep the price like this, this is absolutely my new local in Hong Kong.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel (with a few issues)\u201d", "Author": "ATW2012", "ReviewID": "UR137236279", "Content": "We stayed at the Ovolo for five nights.

We did not complain hoping they will clean it the next day... still they did not clean it and the day after it was the same. There was a day where housekeeping did not put any toilet tissue in our toilet. We requested from reception & the next there was tissue alright but the plastic wrapper of the tissues housekeeping left it in our sink... i think they must have forgotten huh ? They don't change the sheets everyday. One time i spilled a bit of drinks on the sheet we requested the sheets to be changed. Guess what when we got back housekeeping just wiped the white sheets with wet towels & probably dried it with a blower and never changed it ... the stains are still visible on the sheets but it was wiped down and to think we requested change of sheets. I also notice Ovolo housekeeping works really slow... by the time go back to your hotel at maybe 3pm or 4pm your room is still not cleaned!! we have to wait downstairs to have our room cleaned and this happened 3 times while staying in ovolo.

I was quite surprised that the hotel provide me a wide range of tea bags and nespresso coffee which commonly seen in the chain hotels' executive lounge. The check-in process took me some time but it was acceptable with the companion of fine tea and brownies. The staff assisted me to the room and she was very helpful and knowledgable. My room is on the high floor with an urban view. The room is tiny but not surprising me because this was the norm in HK.

The bed in the room was so comfortable becuase there were 4 pillows and 2 cushions accompany me.

Amazing Location - The location is topnotch... 5-min cab ride to Airport Express Hong Kong Station, 5-min walk to Sheung Wan MTR Station, 10-min walk to SoHo, and for the pink crowd, 2-min walk to Volume and Zoo. Amazing Design - The hotel is very sleek, chic and modern, with a keen eye for design and details. The rooms are small but definitely not unusual for HK standards. The hotel makes up for it with intelligent space-saving design features i.e. high-ceilings, huge windows, built-in safe and mini bar, pull-down open closet, etc. The bed was extremely comfortable with soft sheets and we always managed to get a good night's rest. The nifty, techie features like AppleTV and electronic curtains also added to the room's wow factor. Amazing Freebies - The hotel throws in some wonderful bonuses... free Wifi that actually works (and is fast!), free breakfast (modest selection but adequate and yummy), free self-laundry, free local calls, free mini bar, free drinks and snacks at the stylish Lo Lounge on the 2nd floor! The folks at Ovolo sure know how to spoil their guests! Amazing Service - What we found most surprising though was the friendliness of the staff. HK generally can be quite a cold place with everything moving in fast forward. Ovolo is an exception. From the moment we stepped in to the moment we checked out, we felt the attentiveness and the warmth of the staff in attending to our needs. And every single bit felt genuine. Like what was mentioned in a previous review, there's a strange sense of calm inside the hotel, a stark contrast from the hustle and bustle outside. We had a quick chat with the manager Eugene during check-in and it seemed apparent that his personable nature trickled down to the rest of the generally young staff. A far cry from the standoffish and almost robotic service you get from more established and definitely pricier hotel chains. Amazing Value - We booked the hotel through a special 3-night Summer Bash Offer and all things considered, we definitely got more bang for our buck.

The rooms are big (I took a 1 Bedroom, apparently all the studios were booked when I asked). The front-desk staff were nice. Don't expect free breakfast because this isn't a hotel, but expect a very clean room each day. This is an important thing after walking around that area! I like that they give a \"welcome tray\", after flying the fruit provided is quite nice. What they need more of is fruit, not chocolate. Jackie (I think that's her name) was quite nice, she had a few hints on where to go around the hotel. The only problem is taxis, they really need something to let taxis know that they are there.
