It was only 5 minutes walk from Clapham South Tube Station. It is also a pleasant walk along from Clapham Common Tube Station too. Our room, number 17, in the newer extension, was modern, clean and comfortable and the staff were polite and friendly. Breakfast wasn't available during our stay, but we took a 10 minute walk down to Wetherspoon's Moon under Water at Balham for breakfast. There are also several cafes there and it has convenient tube and train stations too.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice cheap hotel\u201d", "Author": "Julesnoir", "ReviewID": "UR121863576", "Content": "The hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable but DO NOT BOOK IF YOU ARE DISABLED.

It is close to shops, cafes and restaurants and the underground. Very friendly receptionist and we were allowed to leave luggage in our room though we were very early in arriving. At \u00a380 per night for a twin this was not cheap. This did not include breakfast as they were 'short staffed.' We were asked to pay on arrival as reception was not always staffed: in fact, after check in we saw no staff at all though the room was serviced. We were shown a side door which we were asked to use for entry and exit and just dropped keys in a box on departure. The room was serviceable but the chair was worn, the carpet had a hole in it and the wash basin was cracked. The hotel is close to Balham Hill which is a very busy road so were kept awake by traffic noise, frequwnr sirens and loud voices in the street. On these grounds we would not reuse.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201camanda\u201d", "Author": "Amzz W", "ReviewID": "UR120088278", "Content": "great location stayed here for two nights in October , very freindly near the clapham south underground located near shops, i enjoyed my stay here it was very reasonable especially for London would highly reccomend .

Although some reviews found in the Internet were negative I decided to book this hotel. I enjoyed my stay. All was great. The most important that it was close to the Tube station and the room and bathroom were clean. Good location and value for London. The hotel is 10 min walk from the Tube; Bus Stop is right in front of the hotel. The hotel was very easy to find. The room wasn't huge but served its purpose, and was very clean. The bathroom rather small but clean. Nice area with places to eat and parks; many stores within walking distance.

Things got worse when we got to the room. It was freezing, there was no heating apart from a little portable electric heater, which hadn't been turned on in advance, and had little effect on the room when it did. Added to this was the noise - good double/triple1-glazing might have helped keep the noise from the busy (24hours a day) road and rail line out, but this wasn't there. Neither was any net curtaining, so unless we closed the curtains and pitched the room into gloom we were on display to the world.
