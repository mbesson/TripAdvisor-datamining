We all shared the one room to sleep and had two kids in the sofa bed and the youngest (17 months) in with us.I would stay there again BUT the noise level was really bad from the traffic. I spoke to someone else on the same floor in the elevator and they said their room was quiet. So, if you stay there, just ask for a quiet room off the street. Aside from the noise, it was value for money. We booked through a discount rooms website (cannot remember the name of it now) and the hotel was close to transport so made it easy to get around.The staff were friendly enough but we didn't need to consult with them much as we pretty much had everything planned before we left home.We used the train to get to and from the airport which was ok. Pretty short trip and less hassle with children's car seats.", "Date": "Jun 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR423560656", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ChrisFromOz"}, {"Content": "Great location This is a small hotel in the centre of Sydney. We weren't sure what to expect but were extremely pleased overall. Reasonable price, fantastic location. There were 3 of us, and the unit was split over 2 floors, with 2 bedrooms and bath upstairs and a living area and kitchenette downstairs. Unique. Minimal services within the hotel itself, but lots in the area. Excellent support from the staff. Were there for 5 days and could have easily stayed longer. Only complaint was the charge for internet ($30 for 5 days for wired access to my laptop). Being from North America, I am accustomed to getting this for free, although I can now see from 9 hotels in AU that charging high prices for internet is standard behaviour.

It's a short walk to maze backpackers and all the facilities in that neighborhood (internet, tours, cheap food). You have to walk 10 minutes to get on an underground train, that was the biggest surprise.The service from the 24 hour reception was excellent, the fruit always fresh and the room was big with coffee making facilities.

For first timers in Sydney, this hotel is an option you should concider. Easy access to all key transport; subway, monorail etc. Shopping malls within 1 minutes of walking. Key attractions like Hyde Park, Sydney Tower, the aquarium, and IMAX just 5 minutes away. Brilliant.Secondly, you really get a lot for your money, and the staff are very friendly and helpful.

Around the corner from the QVB, one block from Hyde Park, and just a few blocks walk from Darling Harbour and Chinatown.

You're right in the thick of things at this well-maintained hotel but yet it's quiet and comfortable. No food except a small coffee stop in the lobby but rooms are equipped with small fridge and sink. Modern styling, clean, well-kept. Staff is very helpful - - they know the meaning of service.

The location of the hotel could not have been better. We had requested an early check-in and this was not a problem at all. Our room was on the 5th floor and was very quiet and clean. The beds were very comfortable, and the cooling/heating worked well. The bathroom was spacious. I went down to ask for another pillow and the receptionist quickly got me one. They advertise free fruit at reception. The free fruit consisted of apples only. lol. There were also Minties on offer. A downside was that our windows were painted over, so we couldn't see any view.I would recommend the Central Park for anyone wanting to be in the middle of the action.", "Date": "Nov 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR699422023", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mysslauren"}, {"Content": "Central Park rescued us It's getting a bit tatty round the edges but this hotel was a real lifesaver to us. We were travelling for work and our travel agents had booked us into a vile place in King's Cross. We moved here, and got just what we wanted - good location, nice enough and spacious rooms, relaxed decor plus Internet access. The contrast was immense. It may not be the Four Seasons, but it's cheap, well-located and comfortable. The other hotel cost us the same but there is no comparison. Choose here as long as you realise the rooms may be a bit noisy and it needs a bit of a refurb. It's cheap because it's run on a shoestring.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR524287475", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SweetpeaLeicester_UK"}, {"Content": "So So Hi, Do not take me as fussy client but I have a few points to note. I can not complain about location - its perfect for the price they offer. But It started with order online. I have booked through [----] and booked for 4 people. Please note that when you book it ask you how many people would like to stay. When I clicked 4 - it gave me price for 4 people. When we were departing they said the price is only for 2 people the rest we had to pay extra. So we end up paying almost 300.00 AUD extra. When we walked into the room there was an old dusty couch with stains that 2 people had to spent 4 night on. Furthemore, it was only prepaired for 2 people so that we had to order extra towels, blankets.... 2ndly the windows were that dusty that you would not want to wave your hands around otherwise you would end up with dusty smell and it would all go to the air. They rate themselves as 3.5 star, but when we went to Melbourn and stayed at 4 star 2 bedroom Medison hotel, you would not want to compare how different is it. I would certanly gave 5 star to Medison and 2 star to Central Park Hotel. Please, do not judge this hotel under my review as I went there a year ago I was so happy that I returned again, but unfortunatelly not going to anymore.

I always manage to get a great rate through wotif and have never paid more than $130 per night for their standard room. You can't beat this hotel for location and the service has always been excellent. On two occasions we arrived in Sydney at 6am on the midnight flight from Perth and were allowed early access to our rooms. The rooms are always very neat and tidy too.

This was our first stop on a family round the world trip from the UK, and we wanted something a bit different/special, so we booked two of their loft rooms (high ceilings, big windows, top floor) by phone a month before we set off, and secured the booking with our credit card details. A BIG disappointment then, when we arrived late at night after a 24 hour flight to find they had given the loft rooms to other guests, and only had standard rooms available for us. They are OK, a bit basic, and small window only (no view), but clean and well designed. Location is nice and central, but we could have stayed anywhere if all we wanted was a bed in a standard hotel type room. We'd spent a long time planning our trip to be a bit better than that.
