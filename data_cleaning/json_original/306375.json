The lobby was beautiful, and the staff extra helpful.I found the location ideal because it was within walking distance of 2 subway lines. Also the hotel bus runs every 15 mins to drop you off at either station. In the morning it runs a few special trips to a larger train station, I believe its the JR station, but since I was never up that early and I choose to use the aiport bus to get me back and forth to the airport I didn't go to that station. That station isn't very far either from the hotel so you can always just get a cab to it. There were always lots of cabs around too! The food was alright. I would recommend eating while you are out on the town. There are a lot of wonderful restaurants in Tokyo.The room was awesome! I got to stay on the club level which has been recently renovated. Typical heavenly bed, large flat screen t.v. good working desk, and great bathroom. Everything kept very clean.

As others have pointed out the location is not in the middle of the action or main sight-seeing clusters. That said, the free shuttle to both Meguro and Shinagawa JR train stations is very convenient. There is a subway stop on the Tokyo Metro that is about a 5 minute walk away. We used all three transportation stations and were able to get to all sights with relative ease, so I wouldn't be too worried about the location. In fact, it's nice to return to an area that's NOT crowded and a bit more relaxed.The rooms were what you'd expect for this level of property with clean rooms, firm beds, etc. They also have those fancy Japanese bidet toilets I miss so much now that I'm back home. The staff at this hotel was excellent during my visit. From the time we arrived, during our stay and when we departed, the staff was very attentive to our needs. The one nit is the service in the California Cafe is a bit spotty in a very minor sense where food doesn't come all at once (not that late either).We split our visit to Japan (Tokyo-Kyoto-Tokyo) so we were able to leave one of our bags behind for storage and everything worked out great.I'd stay here again if I return to Tokyo.", "Date": "May 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR710977680", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hhyamamo"}, {"Content": "Loved It!

Style of room is oldish although furniture , carpet, etc. are not tired. But if you like modern design, it's not your place. Bathroom is very very clean, but again old. And a bit sad looking.

OK location This is a nice clean renovated hotel but the location is not walking distance to any of the big sites or areas of Tokyo.

If you dont mind being in a quiet residential area then this hotel is for you. They have a bus to take you to train station or you can walk 5-7 mins to the subway station. At night there are not many options to eat in the area but if you want a good priced well serviced hotel then this place is for you. Keep in mind you need to take the subway or train all the time since Tokyo is so large... but if you stay in Shinjuku, Shibuya or Ginza there is a lot to see in walking distance.

I stayed in this hotel for one week for business.There is a direct bus from Narita for 3000 yen. If you are tired from your trip, it's nice not to have to haul luggage through the train stations (the alternate way to get here). You just walk 20 ft outside and hop on the charter-style bus and in 1.5hrs it pulls up to the door of the hotel. The train is slightly faster but if you don't know what you are doing with respect to the trains you could end up talking longer.There's not much around the hotel, but a free shuttle runs you to a nearby Japan Rail station every 15 minutes, and there are a few nice restaurants around there. The concierge is superb: friendly, helpful, and patient. They have lots of custom printed info for you to help you navigate Tokyo (which can be tricky for new visitors.This hotel is dated. It feels like it's from the 70s. However, it was well built and appointed nicely, so it's not run down by any means. However, the gym is pathetic, so if exercise is important to you, you might be served better elsewhere (or plan on going to a separate gym). I am surprised they advertise having a gym at all... it is basically a couple of treadmill, some barbells, and a couple of dated looking machines. To add insult to injury, they charge you to use it!The staff is wonderful and seem to like their jobs. The bathrooms are well maintained but frankly they could use an overhaul. Linoleum floors are right out of the 70's! Included in your bathroom is a multi-function toilet seat... more an amusement than a necessity for westerners.TV offerings are slim, with only 2 or 3 English stations, but this might be the standard in Japan (not sure).The beds are super comfortable and there are several types of pillows on the bed, so you are sure to find one you like.Laundry service is outrageously priced but as I was on business it's a must. There's no safe in the room., but crime in Japan seems rare.Overall, I would stay here again, but I might be interested in something with a more interesting location.", "Date": "Jan 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR112146617", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ldavisfl"}, {"Content": "Can't Use the Pool We did not like this hotel. It advertises having a pool, one of the few in Tokyo. What they don't say is that you must be at least 13 years old to use it. No children are allowed in the pool, even with parents or guardians. This is not mentioned on the web site and is deceptive advertising. It is a 10 minute walk from the train station. Given that we could not use the pool, it was expensive for the size and quality of the room. We also had trouble with the wireless internet, it was not straight forward.

This was a business trip, so our travel agency booked me this hotel (our office is near here). I've stayed at a few Starwood properties - I'm SPG gold. This was by far the best experience I've had at a Sheraton, and maybe at any hotel.The staff here is simply amazing. Everyone from the bell desk to the concierge is so friendly, it feels as if you're doing them a huge favor by asking something of them - as if all they want most in the world is to help you. Wow. I could get used to this!The included breakfast buffet is western style, but with the addition of dim sum, as it's in the Chinese restaurant. The other restaurant I tried is the Cafe California, a French restaurant with Japanese influence. I had the full 6 course French meal, which was excellent.They have a bus that will run you to and from the JR Yamanote line - aka the Green Line, which runs around the perimeter of 'downtown' Tokyo. If you don't want to deal with the bus or are planning to be out after 10 when the bus stops, ask the concierge for a map of how to walk to the hotel from either of the very close subway stations. This makes the Miyako hotel an excellent base for exploring the city.

There were always people in the big comfortable chairs eating and drinking.The hotel is not in an interesting neighborhood; there are two universities nearby.
