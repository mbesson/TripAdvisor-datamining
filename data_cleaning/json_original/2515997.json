Walked about 4 or 5 blocks to take public buses into the tourist areas. No problem. Room was a little small, but clean and quiet. No problem. Nothing I would not expect in a urban area where space is a premium. Restaurant prices nearby were much more reasonable than the areas we took public transit to. The area around the Travelodge catered more to locals and their tastes and budget over the touristy areas closer to Fisherman's Wharf.

Was lucky enough to get the last free parking spot ( a real benefit considering that downtown hotels wanted upwards of $30-$40/night ). Room was comfortable, with free Wi-Fi. Staff helped us to evaluate how we spent the next day before heading out of the city, and to decide on a walking tour of the excellent Presidio that is just down the street (Lombard Gate). The bathroom has just a shower, and there needed to be some repairs to dings in the bathroom wall, some cleaning up of blackened caulking, etc., but it was certainly good enough for our brief time there. The front desk staff and manager, Bruce, are this property's real assets. Everyone was both friendly, and helpful, and they allowed us to keep our luggage there a few extra hours. We didn't use the room safe, so that charge was removed from the bill, along with the room safe tax. Not sure what the corporate philosophy is as this is the first time in a lodging that there was a surcharge for a room safe. The free continental breakfast was simple fare, but sufficient - cold cereal, instant oatmeal, juices, coffee and muffins. Would certainly stay here again, particularly if visiting the Presidio area.

The continental breakfast was a little disappointing offering only croissants, packaged muffins, cereal, instant oatmeal, tangerines, coffee & tea. Parking is free, but the lot is small. We had difficulty exiting our parking space because management permitted someone to park in an area designated \"No Parking.\" Our single King room was long and narrow. We had plenty of space on each side of the bed, but only about 16 inches between the foot of the bed and a dresser which contained the refrigerator. This meant we could only open the refrigerator door about half way. Our room was generally quiet, but people walking up and down stairs sounded like a herd of elephants. The bathroom fan was incredibly loud. Surely, quieter fans are available. Housekeeping staff was far too efficient. They threw away two unread newspapers we left on the dresser.

It is an historic hotel (has always been a Travelodge since being built in the 1940\u2019s) and its 4 public faces (Taylor, Raymond, Bruce and Nikki) are courteous and welcoming. From the beginning of our communications with them, we were impressed by their readiness to help us in any way a hotel could. The accommodations are humble, clean, of good size (many hotels in SF have very small rooms) and offer what anyone would need to have a good sleep and be ready for a day in town. If you come to SF to look for a luxurious accommodation, look elsewhere and be ready to spend much more. This is intended to show respect to the establishment, as when we travel, we are going to there to experience the culture of the location, not wallow in luxury and spend all of our time in the room. If you are expecting a big breakfast with designer coffee, you\u2019ll need to find a local establishment, several of which are only a few blocks away. We requested a dark room, which translates to a corner room that has no window to the front walkway/balcony. We could have asked for another room- possibly because of a slight feeling of claustrophobia, but we dismissed that almost as quickly as we thought of it. There is a circuit that will trip if you have the bathroom fan, three floor lamps and the television on when using a hairdryer, but we don\u2019t \u201cthrow the baby out with the bathwater\u201d- we mentioned it, they reset the breaker and we worked with it. Then we met Raymond. One would not expect the wealth of information that this Midwest transplant readily and enthusiastically offers. Almost anybody we encountered in SF was engaging, pleasant and ready to offer their TIME (unlike where we are from), but Raymond has this in abundance. As much as the other 3 had the aforementioned SF qualities, Raymond brings the \u201cdesireability\u201d of this location to another level. In his few years living in SF, Raymond has gathered enough knowledge about how to get around town, where to go and what is available to you- according to YOUR desires and to any level of expense. The Travelodge\u2019s location was optimal for accessing transit buses and a major road into SF. For those who want to leave their car at the hotel, Raymond showed us 4 bus routes that can get you to all major locations in the city. Once you get the hang of the buses and know what places to avoid (3 or 4 areas, more so at night), you can really find your traveling groove. Parking at the hotel may get competitive, but they will help you. Depending on your reason for going to SF, we recommend the Travelodge at the Presidio. If you research as much as we did and find something comparable, you are fortunate and even the staff at the Travelodge would be happy for you (!). If you\u2019d rather not do a lot of researching, then decide on this place- you won\u2019t be disappointed.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lawton, OK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "Colin D", "ReviewID": "UR126638375", "Content": "I stayed here for three nights this past week and found myself very satisfied with my visit.

I walked all over the Marina and Presidio without even needing my car. I found the complaints about lack of parking space to be somewhat unfounded. Every night I managed to get a spot, even after returning as late as 11 PM two nights. There's a little bit of neighborhood noise at night from a bar around the corner and a preschool next door means children yelling at 8 in the morning, but those are minor complaints. Also, I found the neighborhood to be exceptionally safe, even late at night. That can always be somewhat of a concern when staying in a city. It's very residential around the hotel. It would have been nice to have a mini-fridge and an iron in the room. Another highlight of the stay was the very helpful and friendly staff. Bruce (I think) checked me in by name and was very welcoming when I arrived. The concierge, Raymond Archer, also was exceptionally knowledgable and helpful every morning.

The general manager, Tyler, was fantastic throughout our stay and made us feel more than welcome, giving us plenty of great advice on eateries, bus routes and places to go, so thank you Tyler!

About 5 mins walk to the bus stop to get the bus into town, which takes about 20 - 25 mins. Ok so you could stay somewhere nearer in town, but it'd be noisy, you'd pay a lot more and probably get less for your money - bus service is perfectly good if you don't have a car, which you don't really need in this city but would be useful if you're short on time. Definitely recommend and can't wait to come back to San Francisco, which is a fantastic city!

Well don't be deceived. We arrived here in the dark and on first look the place looked a bit run down and shabby. The light of day the next day allowed us to see where we were and re-assess our opinion. As others have mentioned here this hotel is situated in a quiet area of San Francisco at the end of Lombard Street. Our cabbie did have a little trouble finding it, but he did not realise that Lombard Street actually goes straight ahead and the road that bears to the right is actually Richardson Street and leads to the Golden Gate Bridge. Once that was sorted out all was OK. The staff were very friendly and helpful on arrival and nothing changed in the 3 nights we stayed. The breakfast is basic, but what is there is very good. Public transport to down town is 5-10 Mins walk away (Bus 30) and less than 5 mins to the bus that will take you to the Golden Gate Bridge Park (Bus 28). The cost of public transport is $2.00 each for 2 Hrs so very cost effective. We went to walk the Golden Gate and were back in time before our tickets ran out so the whole excursion cost $4.00US. Liverpool Lils which is around the corner from the Hotel is a place that once again on first impressions I would not visit. But based on the recommendations from this site we gave it a go. It was fantastic. I have never been asked how I want my hamburger cooked before and it was excellent. My wife had the 1/2 chicken and it was just as good. The parking is free, but limited in space and if there are no spots, you must park in the street. We have been told it is quite safe to do so.

My husband, five year old son and I stayed here at the tail end of a four day car trip. We are relatively familiar with the area and were only planning a single day of sightseeing in SF. We had a car with us. The Travelodge provided the perfect location. After a long day of driving we were able to cross the Golden Gate Bridge and check in shortly after 3 pm without having to slog through rush hour traffic. We appreciated being able to park for free off the road and in sight of our room. We had a room on the third floor with two queen sized beds. With tax, our cost was about ~$150. We felt this to be an extremely good value. The room was small, but clean and well appointed. There was a desk, arm chair, small refrigerator, vanity, and TV all squeezed into the space with our beds. The bathroom counter and cabinets, light fixture, and mirror all appeared to be relatively new. Our refrigerator door was broken and missing the lower rack, but this did not interfere with our use of it. We neglected to report this to the management. The heating/cooling system for the room was oddly complicated for me. I'm sure the front desk would have been happy to help had we requested it. We also didn't contact them about this. Considering we aren't used to sleeping in an urban area, we were amazed at how quiet our room was. We left the bathroom window open and could hear fog horns in the distance, but that was about it. The hotel is immediately across the street from the Presidio which has lovely walking paths. We enjoyed walking to the Exploratorium at the Palace of Fine Arts. We also enjoyed walking to the Wave Organ. George Lucas' studios are also within walking distance, as are many restaurant choices. As mentioned by other reviewers, Raymond was tremendously helpful and friendly. He was able to suggest activities that might interest our five year old and restaurants that were child friendly and not too far away. He obviously loves his job and takes it very seriously to make sure that each guest has the information needed to enjoy their stay to the fullest.

Raymond helped us plan out a route, on the day of the Bay to Breakers race, that would get us to California Academy of Sciences. Nicolette was great at showing us the routes to downtown at rush hour. A bonus is that you can buy transit passes right at the hotel, I believe the only hotel in the city who offers all the transit pass options. We used public transportation for our entire stay and never encountered any problems. Both Nicolette and Raymond were always smiling (as was housekeeping, but unfortunately, I didn't get any names), and they truly wanted to make our stay comfortable and cared about us as guests. The location of the hotel is great. It is in a quiet part of the city, just outside the Presidio. Yet just two blocks down, the city thrives, with so many restaurant options we couldn't count them. The hotel is also close to many public transit stops. We never walked more than 3 blocks to or from any stop. A great bonus of the hotel location is that you can both hear and see the famous wild parrots of Telegraph Hill. The birds seem to like the trees at the Presidio.

I checked out within 5 minutes and spent the night in my Mom's hospital room instead. I have been staying back at the Travelodge ever since. The staff is AMAZING!

His love of San Francisco inspired our own interest in the city; as a result, we actually visited places we had never made time for before. He seems to truly enjoy helping people, whether it is assisting them with the continental breakfast, helping visitors with directions, or simply welcoming them. (I also liked the world map in the breakfast room where people place a pin where they are from.)

We were able to park our car at the hotel and see a lovely section of San Francisco. Raymond told us how much pride he takes in his job, and how he feels at home in San Francisco.

Prior to making the reservation, I spoke with some of the hotel's staff members about the hotel and things to see and do in the immediate area. I wanted to put together a really fun trip, where most everything would be within walking distance, so we wouldn't waste a lot of time driving around in traffic. To that end, the staff, and in particular Raymond Archer, the Front Desk Concierge, was extremely helpful, so much so that he ought to receive a raise--no joke. In most cases, he provided me with first hand knowledge and reviews of Marina specific restaurants, bars, and clubs, including A16, Izzy's Steakhouse, Liverpool Lil's, Mamacita's, and Silver Clouds Restaurant & Karaoke Bar. He even made a point of visiting the Hi-Fi Lounge after work one evening in order to let me know if it was the kind of dance place my girlfriend and I would be interested in going to. Then, he shared a number of websites, including sfstation, sfcityguides, sf.funcheap, and yelp, all of which helped me put together an itinerary around our two-day dance show. In addition, Raymond talked to me about bus routes and tours, including the Presidigo, the Wave Organ (a little known but really cool S.F. landmark near the hotel), architectural walking tours, including Alamo Square, and the Lyon St. Stairs--with some incredible views of the bay. In short, he was very professional and thorough in answering all of my questions and ensured that we had both a great stay at the Travelodge and a really good time in the Marina District.

The room we got was in the back (306) so the noise of Lombard eluded us. Unfortunately, the room was one of the oldest ones. There were some minor annoyances. The room is small, but we could live with that. The bathroom was very much in need of work with the shower door wobbly, but functional. The window in the bathroom (a bonus to us to have fresh air) would not stay open so we propped the ice bucket under it to hold it open. We were there one night so we didn\u2019t report it (we should have) however they sent us a Travelodge survey after our stay and I was honest about the condition of the room. I got a phone call within a day of filling out the survey. I have to admit they seemed genuinely interested in my feedback. We stayed again this past week and the room we got this time was much better. Still same old d\u00e9cor and small, but the bathroom was remodeled with the shower stall new, granite tops and a vanity with some room to store toiletries. We had a problem with noise just as we were turning in for the night and this time we did report it. It ended up being the plumbing in the room above us. They came immediately, but because of the hour they were not able to do anything about the problem. They discounted our room and the toilet upstairs was fixed the next day and we had no more problems. On our third visit we were back in room 306 with the old bathroom. Raymond, the manager, told us that they were in the process of refurbishing all the bathrooms and the next phase will be to replace the furniture. They truly do seem to be upgrading the hotel to higher standards.

The only change to eat or drink something was to put the whole stuff on a tray and took it with you to your room. Our son had a small infection at one eye so we had to go to a doctor.

There were cigarette butts overflowing the containers and stunk to high heaven (right outside our window by the way) and trashcans from the rooms, lying around the outside. They could have done so much better at making the place look at least presentable during the construction phase, but they truly didn't seem to care that smelly trash was everywhere.

We were kept awake half the night by other guests coming and going, slaming doors and yelling all night and by their TV at 4:00am.

If you're frugal and don't mind not having an elevator, a lobby, or fancy furniture I think you'll be very happy with this hotel. The downside: our room could have used better ventilation. There was no way to open the windows and get the air moving without sacrificing our privacy. The bathroom window desperately needed a curtain as it actually faced into the hallway/balcony. Since the bathroom had no fan(!) opening the window was the only way to keep the steam down while showering so I had to hang a t-shirt in front of the window. Kinda silly. The result was that the room was a bit muggy. Also, as I mentioned, there is no elevator in this kind of hotel so don't stay here if you have trouble carrying your luggage up a flight of stairs. This hotel also does not offer much of a view and as you might imagine -- the furniture, carpeting, etc is not exactly brand new. Also also, HBO is supposed to be included but we didn't seem to have it (But, so what? We didn\u2019t go to San Francisco to watch TV.) The upside: the price was shockingly low. This made it possible for me and my co-traveler to spend our money on more important things (like eating out and shopping). I booked the flight and hotel together through Orbitz rather than through the hotel itself so I would recommend doing that to get the best deal.
