We stayed in the main hotel with sea views, after talking to a few people we met out there would reccomend this option as you are near to all the facilities as some of the bungalow rooms can be quite a walk. The beach is just a platform with steps into the sea, but still nice with the All Inclusive bar down there as well, nice and breezy. The snack bar offers a small selection every day but food was very nice. The main restuarant varies each day, but if you do go near closing time some items can run out. They always have the grill with the chef cooking somthing fresh and always plenty to choose from, Salads galore and a diet buffet (which did not look very appetizing and never tried it) But as a whole there was always something to eat. The entertainment is very the same and there is no bar by the theatre. We had a lovely relaxing holiday which is what we wanted and the decor of the hotel was nice and always clean. And the sea views from the hotel room were beautiful. The only downside is there is nothing within walking distance, but as we wanted was to sit in a sunlounger for 2 weeks and relax then this is ideal, as you have facilities on site like 3 pools, a spa daytime and evening entertainment.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "portsmouth", "Title": "\u201ccouldnt ask for any more exactly what u pay for\u201d", "Author": "icemaidenPortsmouth", "ReviewID": "UR36219858", "Content": "read some duff reviews on some hotels in turkey but having read some good ones on this hotel decided to bite the bullet and book definately the best thing we did. the hotel is in some need of refurbishment but on the whole basic but clean, the staff are always pleasant (especially if ur a woman!!) the best thing of all is the food always a worry if ur all inc. the location is good if u want to be near the centre of marmaris or the beach but not in the heart of it because of the noise, the dolmus and taxis's r right outside the hotel costs average 50p to get to the beach. dont always believe the holiday reps bout trips etc round the pool r some guys sellin trips for half the price of thomas cook reps we went on a couple n they were fantastic esp the boat trips thom cook wanted \u00c2\u00a350 per couple pool guy \u00c2\u00a350 for 6 people couldnt fault it at all, if we were to go back to turkey i would stay at this hotel again and again whoever slates it needs to chill out too many people read these reviews and panic bout what to do u cant go wrong with this place i would recommend it to all i speak to, the only thing i could diss about the place was the size of the drinks from the bar small plastic cup size they need to give bigger glasses which would mean less queues at the bar apart from that happy holidays :)", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "shropshire", "Title": "\u201cgood holiday apart from\u201d", "Author": "nyreesen", "ReviewID": "UR20804119", "Content": "We stayed at the Kervansary hotel for ten nights, as it was the first time we had taken our four year old daughter on a plane and a foreign holiday i had concerns so we booked ten nights. The hotel is clean and quite modern lots of glass, very very noisy during heavy rain! Reception staff were efficient and helpful. Bar staff we a bit abrupt but as the holiday went on they warmed. Lets face it standing there for the hours they do for the pay they get wouldn't make me smile too much! Entertainment staff very friendly great with the kids, we took a 4 year old girl a 10 year old boy and a 14 year old boy. They all enjoyed the water slides including myself and my husband who was like a big kid, i apologise to anyone sat by the slides for the tidal waves he sent over them. MC one of the entertainers (cant remember the others names) Made a lot of effort to play games with everyone, i must say some days the music was a bit loud! Last but definately not least....... THE FOOD! We were all inclusive as we thought that would be easier with 3 kids, ice creams and drinks can cost a fortune. We ended up eating out quite alot. There was ice cream and cand floss also toffee apples but they were not included and the price could change at any time! There was early tea for kids at 7pm ( not 6.55pm, 7 on the dot!) it consisted of cold chips and chicken , the chicken on the bone was nice but the cold rubbery nuggets left alot to be desired. The rest of the food available was pretty awful, the staff were rude and unhelpful and watched your every move which was very uncomfortable. If you like your cuppa then this was available breakfast only but coffee all day which was unfair. Take your PG tips! If you have booked to go here take extra money incase you find the food as we did.Go to the Serenity Bar a few 100 metres down the road, staff great food fantastic great with kids.
