How wrong could I be!! The Black Hotel is more than worth its four stars, the staff are friendly and very helpful. They helped us with directions no problem and printed out our vouchers for the vatican Museum, they tried their best to help after Air France failed to deliver our luggage by ringing around for us. Yes the location isn't brilliant but you know what people, check google maps!!! I knew before hand and was prepared however I wouldn't say it was badly located, there is a bus to the metro station it does get busy but the hotel offer a shuttle service, although it says complimentary it was 2 euro, well worth it!!! Straight to the Metro then another 1 euro to anywhere on the A line, or you could spend 4 euro to hop on off the metro, we paid just 1 euro as we chose to walk everywhere. There is a bank up to the hotel, however again I am not the fittest most lithe person but managed the bank without problem. I dispute the walk to catch the bus is long, 10 mins, you're visiting Rome, you're going to walk longer than that to see the sights!!! Breakfast was good, continental but could get scrambled eggs and bacon also, staff were always topping things up and there was plenty to go around, also a long breakfast period, 7.30 until 11am, excellent. On our last night I hurt my foot and could not walk well, the hotel were great, I wasn't hungry but my husband asked if it was possible he could eat in the room, no problem his meal was brought to the room within 20 mins, steak with potatoes cooked to perfection, with bread and dipping oil, also he ordered a fruit salad that came with a sort of creme brulee which was also excellent. The worst part of my honeymoon was Air France taking four days to deliver my luggage, I would without doubt stay here again and have recommended the hotel to my friends. I would suggest if you want a closer location pay the cost and stay in the city do not winge about the location surely the idea is to check before you book!! Don't blame the hotel for this!! I personally preferred the location and yes I did venture out after dark and felt completely safe. I found the hotel to be relaxing, rooms very clean yes you could hear people in other rooms but only because some people were loud no different to other hotels I've stayed in and this includes some ewell known top hotels!!, we had no bother sleeping , excellent facilities, brilliant!!! Can't wait to go back!!!", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Studley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLocation Terrible\u201d", "Author": "Lyn F", "ReviewID": "UR127519059", "Content": "Stayed at the Black Hotel with family for 4 nights in March, paid a very reasonable price with Groupon for the 4 star stay but definately not four star quality.

Hotel itself very clean and modern with comfortable beds and rooms cleaned every day. Very little storage space in the bedrooms, no drawers and only 5 hangers so practically lived out of suitcase during our stay. Lovely bathroom with clean fresh towels although hairdryer was useless so take your own. Staff were unhelpfull and breakfast was the worst I have ever encountered for a hotel let alone a 4 star! Dirty tables, self service buffet if you could call it that! Each morning there were no cups, no hot water, no cold milk, no scrambled egg, no bacon, no crossants and one day they had no butter at all! The bread was so hard it bounced, and when we asked for things to be restocked it took forever, if at all. All in all a waste of time.

It is not 4 star but is fine. Hotel itself is in a pretty basic part of town and is not walkable to anything you would want. From the airport it is about \u20ac35 in a taxi. To get into Rome you need to take the 247 bus to the vatican 20 mins (stay on until last stop doesnt operate on Sunday), or the 246 to metro stop Cornelia then take the subway (30-45mins). Tickets are purchased from the magazine shop between the cafe and the supermarket you cannot buy them on the bus. Standard single fare is \u20ac1 per person. Travelcard for 2-3 days is about \u20ac15. Note they had run out of tickets on sunday at the shop, however no one checks tickets on the bus Bus is on the opposite side of the road to the Panarama supermarket to head into town. Subway tickets are purchased in the subway station (\u20ac1 per person). If you want a decent bed and bathroom and plan to head into Rome in the morning and return in the evening to sleep it is fine, it is however not a resort. Cabs back from rome (wouldnt do bus and subway late and the subway finishes at 9.30pm (we went from the Piazza Nuavo) are about \u20ac15 however can be \u20ac30-35 from the far end of town. We found once in Rome you can walk anywhere and to all the attractions. Next time we would stay in town as it makes it easier to take a nap or relax during the day but overall black hotel was fine.

Clearly not enough staff to cope with breakfast time, food running out constantly, not enough cutlery, plates or even cups at one point. Found it very strange that there was no tourist information available in the hotel - re getting around etc. (our own guides were in our luggage which were stuck at the airport due to baggage handlers strike) and also we were given no info about the hotel itself eg room service, dinner etc when we checked in. It is close to the bus stop which is handy as a taxi cost us anything from \u20ac15 - \u20ac28 to get into the centre of Rome depending on the driver. Re transfers to and from airport - yes they can arrange them for \u20ac55 which we had done - however the driver left (without contacting us)as we were delayed waiting for our luggage.

The journey DOES involve a bus and a metro HOWEVER its extremely cheap for both services and the lady at the reception sorted it all out for us even with her little English. The journey does take approx 45 minutes. however takes a about 1 hour on a Sunday due to waiting for the bus. The supermarket is extremely cheap and great for water at only 30c a bottle.

This hotel should not be a four star hotel for a start - rooms tiny and ours had black mould in although was generally clean. My partner was planning on proposing to me during the trip and had spoke to the hotel beforehand to ask if an upgrade would be possible - they said yes a romantic jacuzzi room was available and we could just pay the 30euro per night extra when we got there. When we arrived at the hotel the gentleman on reception informed us that the upgrade was no longer available and therefore no charge for this would be made. Admittidly we didn't spend a great deal of time in our room as we were there to see the sights of the city and the bus/metro links were convenient for travel although I would not like to travel this way after dark (taxis from the city centre back to the hotel cost around 20euro + dependent upon which part of the city you were in and if the taxi was metered or not). Although slightly disappointed by our room for the cost we tried to enjoy our stay and my boyfriend proposed on our first night (despite lack of upgraded room!). When we came to check out we were advised a charge of 72euro was payable. We knew 12euro of this was for the new travel tax italy has introduced (3euro per person, per night). When asked what the additional 60euro was for we were told it was for the 'romantic room' upgrade. We advised we had been told the romantic room was not available and therefore weren't expecting to pay this. We were then advised that the silk petals they had placed on the end of our bed in the shape of a heart, a rose and a few half used candles (with nothing available to light them with) was classed as a romantic room upgrade and therefore the charge was applicable! I don't think 30euros per night is an acceptable amount to charge for such a simple thing especially when we told we werent receiving this and wouldnt be getting charged! Added the fact that the housekeeper didn't even go into our room on our second day to make the bed and re-assemble the reusable silk petals!!!! We did advise the receptionist what we were told on our arrival but we still had to end up paying!!

We stayed 2 nights. Few things to note before you book: 1. First off, it is way out of the way. 2. The hotel is painted black both inside and out. So it's ridiculously dark. Rooms have white interior walls, but the hallways are dark. It seriously reminded me of being in a club except I wasn't drunk and I always felt like someone was going to jump out and scare me. 3. Everything at this hotel you have to pay for (to watch local tv and internet in your room) 4. The Smart Box didn't work - not their fault, it's Smart Box, but if you happen to get one just make sure they send an email verification to them. Our experience: The 2 taxis we took to get there didn't know where it was. Thank goodness, the second one had a gps. Cost is approximately 15-20 euro or 60 euro if you get trapped like us. In retrospect, we realized you could actually take the metro and bus over there. From the train station, take the metro to Cornelia station, then take the 246 or 247 towards Via Bogliasco. You will get off at the Panorama Supermarket. Walk through the parking lot, up the ramp, then make a hard left at the top of the ramp. Walk 1/4 mile then make a left at the fork. The hotel will be the 2nd driveway on the right. This will save you a lot of $$, but as I said before it's off in the boondocks, so if you get there at night, beware it's dark. Aside from the Panorama Supermarket and a small little tobacco stand that sells pizza, there's nothing to eat around here. So we ate at the hotel restaurant which was decent, nothing to write home about except for their rosemary breadsticks with salt. :) Hotel staff is friendly and nice. Room - they have a towel heater rack which is good if you need to dry clothes. The rack that holds the towel is ridiculously high (seriously around 6 feet off the ground), I know this because I am 4'10\" and could not reach the towels. Sad situation there. Something to note - if you take a shower in the morning, take it early because they run out of hot water. There was a tour group at our hotel and they left early. All of them got warm showers. At night warm water is fine. Room cleanliness - the big thing to note with our room was that there were bed bugs. I've never experienced this before so I was pretty grossed out. I showered in the AM and PM before I went to bed. I was reading and got bit several times while sitting there. My husband also woke up to many bites. These were not mosquito bites either. Rather unpleasant. Few things they could do to make the experience better - 1. Run the shuttle to the metro station more often and both ways. 2. Clean the rooms a bit better 3. Lower the towel rack and make sure things like the trash can are not broken. 4.

The bathroom was clean and had also the atmosphere as the name of the hotel \u201cBlack.\u201d To bad the trash can in the bathroom looked like it was crashed between the door or something, should be replaced in a four star hotel. The air-conditioning did its job and kept the warmth outside. The beds were standard and were ok for two nights. One complains to the bathroom, when we used the shower the bathroom and corridor was flood with water, it almost reached the bed. When we complained to the reception staff, the lady sent a technical man that discovered the kit around the bath was not all right. The lady of the reception said it was no problem for our stay. I had the feeling she said this to more customers as the kit problems were not from one day to another. They really seemed not to be amazed. The restaurant of the Hotel we tried for one evening was good. We ate some fine food although the price was a little bit too high. The two men of the restaurant and the bar were very kind and helpful and although their English was bad they did everything to understand you. This is the opposite to the reception lady. The breakfast was complementary and standard. They offered enough for everybody\u2019s needs and there was also plenty of food available. It was also possible to eat on the terrace. The location of the Hotel is not so good. To get to the center you first have to walk to the bus stop and take the bus to the nearest metro station. The metro brings you further to the city center. Although we didn\u2019t have problems to getting in the center and back to the hotel but it isn\u2019t easy. The shuttle service of the hotel we didn\u2019t use but reading the terms of use it was totally useless in our opinion. The way to the hotel is full of garbage and had an unpleasant smell. Glass could be found everywhere near the road so it seemed not to be a very save neighborhood although we didn\u2019t have problems with that. The Hotel offers also a swimming pool but don\u2019t expect a very large pool, it isn\u2019t. Because of the pool there were also a lot of mosquitoes that did bite you very nasty. My wife had purple spots on her body that were as large as a tennis ball and we were wondering if they weren\u2019t Tiger mosquitos\u2019 as more tripadvisor reviewers had these problems. But this isn\u2019t something the hotel can do about. Over all we can\u2019t recommend this hotel to others.

Overall great hotel just wish it was closer to the centre of Rome.", "Date": "July 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cusefull info for the hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5414677", "Content": "[We have just returned from 2 weeks Italy where we went all over and this was the one hotel we booked. We were really looking forward to this one, the promised luxury on the website seemed to good to be true... and it was. It started with wanting to go for a dip... there is currently only a concrete bassin in the back garden and no decking is present. Looked a lot better on the website...it was an actual pool. Upon talking to the deskstaff they offered us a room in another close by hotel with pool but the extra 40 Euros a night would be at our expense... so we stayed. This hotel is not a mere few minutes away from Vatican city, as advertised; it will take you an hour by public transport and a taxi will cost you about 30 Euros. One way. Pay per view movies are dubbed in Italian and, breakfast never seemed to have any fresh bread. If you go for a polished veneer look and you do not mind being away out of the center it is a good deal at the price we got it,120Euro. You are still staying in Rome. They got the design right of the place but that is unfortunately all. To top it all off; they messed up our bill and charged our credit card, once we left the hotel; with an extra 400 Euros!!!! Our current bill with this place stands at over 700 Euros for a 3 night stay. we now have the pleasure of dealing with the bank to sort this one out!!! All in all, not a very good experience.", "Date": "July 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SCOTLAND", "Title": "\u201cWant a Swim After A Hot Day in the City!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5350985", "Content": "Beware if booking this Hotel in the near future - publishes that it has a swimming pool, one of the reasons we chose this Hotel.

It's set back from the road so traffic noise is not an issue, it's close enough not to be a hassle getting into the town centre (1 hour including the walk to the bus stop, the bus ride, the metro ride and any waiting - a 1 euro ticket each way is all you need), and it's new so everything has that nice feeling that everything new does. The customer service wasn't amazing, but then I believe that to be a fault of Italians themselves, as apposed to the hotel - they were still polite and courteous however so don't let that put you off. A taxi transfer is 55 euros from Ciampino airport, and is one hell of a journey owing to their manic driving style. The minibar was frighteningly expensive (moreso than 5 star hotels I've stayed in in the past), and room service is 5 euros per person on top of the meal price. The food is far better in the town centre anyway, so it's best to eat there. Italy itself is also expensive, you'll need \u00a3100 per day for two people to eat and drink, without eating anywhere fancy or expensive in comparison. Pompeii is well worth the 105 euros per person for the day trip there, so I would whole heartedly recommend it. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone, apart from those with children; however Rome is not suitable in any way for children in my eyes, as walking is definitely a must.", "Date": "April 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cHorrible!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4722910", "Content": "No hot water, pool is green, no laundry service.

Prepare to have a hot room, no matter how many times you tell the staff to turn the AC on. This hotel overall has been the worst one we have stayed in.
