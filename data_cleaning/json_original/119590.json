{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Disappointing, after all these years... I have been staying at the Capri since 2001, when my family moved from SF to the North Bay. It used to be a great deal for us ex-pats and while not a luxury hotel, it was clean and comfortable (plus in a great location).My son and I stayed at the Capri this summer and we were terribly let down. They no longer offer specials and while there is renovation occurring, our room was dingy and the bed very uncomfortable. My 9 year old son said, Mom, let's not stay at the Capri anymore. Sadly, I had to agree.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR827459603", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Betty27Middletown_CA"}, {"Content": "Overpriced, no wifi Paid $99 for a Thursday night King room. Entire property looks worn-out and used. Shower door wouldn't even shut properly, and the 1960's decor (especially in the bathroom) was frightening instead of charming.Their wireless network has an extremely weak signal, which I could not even connect to standing out on the open balcony directly across from their main office (about 20 meters away). They could not fix this issue when I called the main desk. Fail.If you can stay at this place for under $70, then maybe it would be worth your trouble, otherwise, stay away.", "Date": "Apr 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR855399491", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "pontoof"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel and location First to say the hotel has changed management (not ownership) and has had a facelift, rooms have been decorated, new comfortable beds etc and a lot of the old staff are no longer in situ, so although I have stayed many times I was pleased with the changes, what is good about the place is the reasonable rates and the location, 2 blocks from shops, bars and restaurants on Union and 3 blocks from more of the same on Chestnut with buses going anywhere you want in the City from either street, add to that a 20 minute walk to the tourist trap AKA Fishermans Wharf and the area is as clean and safe as anywhere in SF, It all adds up to the ideal location for a reasonably priced base in the area.", "Date": "Dec 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR727039614", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kopite"}, {"Content": "Terrible service ,rude adn unorganized!! My daughter wanted to treat us to a stay in the city to visit her and made the reservation, left her card to charge it to. The next day starting at 11:00 they called our room twice to remind us to check out at 12:00, Then the maid came in with her key at 11:30 even though the do not disturb sign was out. When we checked out they only wanted to charge us, not my daughter as previously arranged. A phone call between them finaly settled it with much trouble. They seem like they are not very together and their atttude is rude. Last time we will stay there.

What noise? I was interested to see the reviewer's comments about the Motel Capri being too noisy. I'd be interested in hearing how he/she found it to be too noisy - was it street noise, noisy neighbours, what? We stayed there for about 10 days in March 03 and didn't find it noisy at all. We found most of the staff pleasant and helpful, although there was one who had a severe attitude problem. From our overall experience, it's very good value for money.

There is also plenty of free parking right on-site.This hotel is right off Union street and within walking distance of the Marina Green. Tons of great restaurants and clubs. One of my favorites is the Brazen Head, which is right across the street. A small English Pub with great food and drinks. It's hard to spot but there's a real small sign out front.
