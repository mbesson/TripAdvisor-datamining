I have spent a week-end there and I have enjoyed the beautiful green park in which the hotel building is, the warm hospitality of the hotel management and the simple comfort of the hotel room and facility. And I could also park my car for free. Highly recommended!", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Centro Pellegrini", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d2321143-Reviews-Centro_Pellegrini-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$112*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Vincenzo Ambrosio</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00136</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2321143", "ImgURL": ""}}
