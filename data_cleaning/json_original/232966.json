{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Beware! Hotel Curtatone is gone except for the name We stayed at the Hotel Curtatone several years ago and it was a lovely experience. It was run but the most elegant staff and was tastefully decorated and impeccably clean. We were there last week and discovered that the Hotel Argentina next door bought the Hotel Curtatone opened a door in the wall and has let it deteriorate to the Argentina's low-level standards.When we got there we were confused because there was a paper arrow taped to the door of the Curtatone pointing to the Argentina entry. The lobby is a miserable hodge podge of furniture with deteriorated finishes. My heart sunk when I saw it. The desk clerk tried to give us rooms on an upper floor of the Argentina although I'd booked the Curtatone. I flatly refused to follow him and made him give us the rooms we had booked.Unfortunately, the Curtatone side of the hotel has not been updated since we were there years ago and the lovely carpets, drapes and furniture are filthy. The walls haven't been painted and the bathrooms could use a good cleaning instead of a damp mopping.The breakfast is just shy of better than starving and it is delivered by the surliest waitress in Florence. She'll give you a coffee grudgingly at least. The room was 80 Euros for a double booked through Venere.If you can find anything closer to the center of town with a good review...book it! We didn't mind the remote location of the Curtatone before because it was such a charming place. We would never stay here again now.I wish I could have discerned this change in recent Tripadvisor posts before I went. I hope I save someone else some disappointment.", "Date": "Nov 10, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR813539552", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not as nice as we expected       Hotel Curtatone", "Date": "Jul 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR591476679", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bagritter"}, {"Content": "Older hotel but pleasant The hotel Curtatone shares its space with another hotel, although we never did figure out which hotel was which. It is an older building, but clean and pleasant. Luckily it was only May and the weather was not too warm, as the air conditioning was very weak. The staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast buffet was fine. It can be walked to from the railway station, although it is a rather long walk. The hotel is only a block away from the River Arno near some fine restaurants. On checking out we were told the credit card machine was not working and we needed to pay in cash! Luckily I could withdraw enough from an ATM machine to cover the cost, but it was close to my limit. Still it is hard not to like everything in Florence, including this hotel.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR188695186", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "wbtraveler"}, {"Content": "Good Value for Florence Just a 5 minute walk from the station, the hotel is part of the Hotel Argentina. Only a block or so from the river, it's an easy walk to the central area. The hotel is not as nice as it's web site and breakfast is a bit skimpy.

Although Florence wasn't the highlight of our trip to Italy (I was amazed by the beauty of southern Italy), I enjoyed the Curtatone far more than other hotels, for the combinaton of the room, service, and location.The room was a good size, clean and tastefully furnished, with a clean, modern bathroom. We had a small balcony overlooking the busy streets. With motorbikes constantly zooming by, of course there was some noise, but that's expected from any urban Italian location. The staff was pleasant and helpful, assisting us with finding a group wine tasting tour in the countryside. The breakfasts were good, with plenty of options. The hotel is very close to the Arno, which is nice for an evening stroll, or to walk along to the Ponte Vecchio. We found Florence to be a good walking city, but we were not there at the height of the summer heat, and never needed to take the bus or a taxi. Overall, the Curtatone provided an excellent, comfortable base from which to explore Florence, and was a good value. I would stay there again.", "Date": "Apr 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR802846598", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "We can't wait to go back someday... My husband and I stayed at Hotel Curtatone for our honeymoon a few years ago and we are still recommending it to friends to this day. It was the cleanest hotel we stayed in all of EU and the staff was SOOO friendly and helpful. The breakfast was simple, yes, but it was still awesome! We're still dreaming about the fantastic rolls and cheese! The rooms were cozy with a gorgeous bathroom (no tubs, but great showers) and a super cute balcony overlooking the below cafe. The hotel is on a noisy-ish streat, but we didn't have any problems with noise inside our room. The whole hotel is decorated very tastefully and everything appeared new. We walked from Curtatone to just about everywhere since it's near the train station and many attractions. Also, it's close to the river so finding our way around was easy.", "Date": "Feb 28, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR588261010", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Wonderful location, friendly staff Hotel Curtatone is a lovely hotel with great location, near the Arno River and a 15-20 minute walk to most sites. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful with directions, restaurant suggestions and help with reservations, etc. The rooms are beautifully decorated with a delicious liqueur and biscotti as a treat. Breakfast was generous and served in a lovely setting, and the sitting area with reading material was a nice bonus. Our rooms had balconies with terrific views and extra soundproofing of the windows. The only problem was the thin walls allowing television and conversation to be readily heard between our room, #7, and room #6. I would stay here again for the location and friendly staff but would ask for a different room that may have less between-room noise.", "Date": "Nov 7, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR477578037", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "PineViewDr"}, {"Content": "Charming small hotel; beware the Vespas nearby We stayed here 3 nights in late 2003 on a first visit to Florence. It's a charming small hotel --you walk up a flight of stairs to reach the entrance. Staff courteous; room and public areas lovely; breakfast all right; location worked ok because we are good walkers and walked to town without difficulty, though it hot weather it's definitely a workout. Internet access in office area was helpful to us. The main problem for us was that directly under our window was a Vespa rental dealer, and the fairly constant whine of shrill Vespas was considerably irritating and disruptive.

We had the corner room, so we had two small balconies from which we could see the street and the river. The room was nice and the biscotti was the best I ever had. We picked the hotel for its easy walk to the train station. As some people indicated, it is a long walk from some of the sites. But we loved the neighborhood, which is not very touristy, and has many small shops of skilled craftsmen and antique dealers. And you cannot go anywhere in Europe and avoid walking - there is no parking anywhere. We would definitely go back.We flew home out of Florence airport. It is so small you walk out to the planes, and each flight has its own ticket agent. Very quick. We managed to get a flight an hour before our scheduled one. However, when we transferred at Rome, we had to retrieve our luggage and go back through security and customs. We almost missed our flight home despite the fact that we grabbed an earlier first flight. So make sure that if you transfer between intra- and inter-Europe flights, you leave at least 2 hours between flights.", "Date": "Dec 20, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR882524674", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Magical Hotel Curtatone We stayed at the Hotel Curtatone as a part of a 20th anniversary tour of Western Europe in the Autumn of 2003. We stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels and resorts and had a lovely time at each. Each time we've been asked which city we would return to, we have said to Florence and the Hotel Curtatone contributed to that wonderful experience. It is a modest place but if you are interested in a charming, magical vacation and not concerned about the size of your bathroom, or whether you have a huge Marriott style breakfast buffet then this is the place for you. It is on the second floor in a charming old building near everything. The elevator is tiny but who cares? Walls aren't very thick - we didn't notice. Owners are wonderful and anticipated our needs before we asked. Simple biscotti and lemon liqueur in your room when you arrive. Lovely tasteful furnishings, high ceilings, operable terrace doors overlooking a cafe. Wonderful restaurant recommendations. Everything was so wonderful that we commuted to Rome rather than depart and extended our stay twice. We have so many wonderful secrets about the city now and hope you are able to share them someday. If you want plush American surroundings try another hotel. if you want to dream about a simple but lovely Florentine vacation, try the hotel Curtatone.", "Date": "Nov 5, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR234729529", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "2 Stars NOT 3.5 If this is in the top 10% of hotels in Florence, then the other 90% must be uninhabitable.

Very clean hotel. Breakfast was only average--your standard European style.We were in room 1. It was a big room and easily accomodated two adults and a child.

Both just around the corner.We are serious city walkers, former New Yorkers, and Europe junkies. I would not say the walk to the Duomo was a leisurely one.
