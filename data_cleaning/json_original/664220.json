The restaurants in easy walking distance were better and cheaper than the ones near the big attractions. (OMG - the food in Rome is amazing!)

We did that one night, it was a good way to start the evening and we got a good dinner recommendation that way. Really enjoyed the neighborhood, Lots of things to do and restaurants and had a nice neighborhood fell. Wifi didn't really work in our room, but was fine in lobby, it was the only place in Italy we stayed in that had free wifi so that was a big plus.

An extra plus was that it was also a nice quiet place, yet well-located within Trastevere. The staff, especially Giovanna and Hussein, were wonderful. They were very helpful and were also very responsive to e-mails we sent before we arrived. Breakfast was ample and delicious. We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it. One thing travelers to Trastevere should look out for is possible trouble at the Trastevere train station. We took the local train from Fiumicino Airport to Trastevere. That worked fine, but we were sprayed with some sort of brown liquid by a couple of guys there who claimed it was bird droppings. We believe they meant to distract us so that they could steal from us -- or something! So look out for that and consider taking a taxi or private car from the airport instead.

There're lots of cafe's and restaurants close by catering to tourists. Room: There're 6 rooms all on the ground floor. There is no direct sunlight into the rooms thus a bit damp and cold. It is clean and neat. Decoration is classical modern with a country flair. Size of the room is not big but comfortable. Our room has a small problem with dripping water of the toilet bowl continuing all night and day. It's wasteful of water and annoying to hear the water dripping noise. Although the room is clean, the extra blanket in the closet is very dirty and dusty. We had to use it anyway because of the cold weather. Breakfast: We're not impressed by the breakfast. The breakfast room is small & cozy situated in the basement with 6 tables, a buffet table and coffee bar. It's a simple buffet with a varieties of dry cakes, 1 kind of bread (very dry), some scramble eggs, 1 kind of cheese, salami and ham, juices are not fresh, yogurt and some fruit. Our cappucino was a bit cold. Internet: Poor WIFI connection in the room. Staff: Friendly and helpful. Comment: We booked online directly from the hotel website. The hotel offered us a discounted room rate on an advance payment and no cancellation. The hotel website stated the payment would be charged within 24 hours of the online booking. When we checked out, the reception asked us to pay cash because they said the hotel didn't charge our credit card. Anyway we let them charge again the same credit card and hope this is not a double payment. We were confused by this. Caution: From Fiumicino airport we encountered many taxi scams.

Had a great stay and all the staff were very pleasant & helpful. This started at reception and included the staff who looked after the morning breakfast and the cleaning staff as well. The room was a good size with a double and single which worked well for us (we travelled with our 4 year old son). Good shower in the bathroom as well as bath, bidet etc. All the rooms are on the ground floor around a nice courtyard with orange trees (oranges not edible sadly!). During the warmer weather, breakfast can be taken in this area which would be very pleasant. The breakfast itself was buffet style with scrambled egg, cheeses, meats, fresh fruit & bread in good supply. An excellent Italian coffee finished it off nicely. The breakfast room itself is quite small but we always found seats. The service ran from 07:30 - 10:30 and was very relaxing. The staff were great - constantly busying themselves and attentive without being obtrusive. One small negative would be that the courtyard style of the hotel does mean that you can be aware of other guests arriving back from their evening out. To be fair, as we had a young child, we were back in our room by 20:30 at the latest - just the time when others would be venturing out. There was no disturbance to our son's sleeping (after hiking him around the Forum, the Vatican, St Peter's etc he had no problem in sleeping!) and after the first night my wife and I hardly noticed either. The surrounding area of Trastevere was all that we had hoped for. Full of local life & interesting with some excellent value restaurants as well as the stunning Basilica di Santa Maria which is well worth a visit along with the better known cultural highlights of Rome. We found it very easy to walk to and from all the major sites and the slightly less frenetic style of Trastevere was very nice to return to after a long day sightseeing.

You can buy a ticket at the closest Kiosk or at the tram's ticket machine (1 Euro, 75 mins.) Don't bother to buy an expensive ticket at the tourist busses. They only stop once in a while and the electronic guide (crappy headset) is always out off sync. Meaning that it tells you to look left, while the site is at the right or you just passed the site.

What a great find. The location is a little hard to find in Trastevere, but the staff and serene rooms more than make up for the inconvenience. We arrived a little before 1 pm and our room was not ready yet. We were tired and hot after wrestling our luggage over cobblestone streets from the bus stop and getting lost. The desk clerk brought us chilled water and settled us in the little sitting area adjacent to the front desk. My husband went to the restroom to freshen up. While he was away, the clerk informed me that the room was ready. She helped me move our bags into the room. The room was basic but large, with a king size bed, TV and full bathroom. It was very quiet. There are only six rooms in this hotel. This is not the place to stay if you are wanting to party in your room. A happy hour reception is served at the sister property, which is a 5 minute walk away. I loved the little orange grove where they have tables set up to enjoy the afternoon. You have to purchase the drinks, but the snacks are free. We sat and enjoyed a glass of wine and some delicious bruschetta and other snacks. The included breakfast buffet was wonderful. They serve it in a little breakfast room that features brick arches, warm lighting, and soft Jazz playing on the stereo. The breakfast offered several meats, breads, cereal, fruits and hard boiled eggs. You could order specialty coffee at no charge. There were a variety of juices offered also. It was easily the best breakfast we had while in Italy. We borrowed the hotel bikes that morning and went for a ride.

We researched Rome hotels for a while, wanting to pick the perfect spot, and definitely made a great decision. The reviews on tripadvisor peaked our interest, and then we found that most other sources (travel books, other online sites, etc.) had similarly great things to say about the hotel, so we went for it. To start, the location can't be beat. It's walkable to pretty much everything, yet away from the craziness of downtown tourist-filled Rome. It's located in Trastevere, an authentic italian neighborhood with great cafes, beautiful streets, etc. I've been to Rome a few times, but this was my first time in Trastevere. I would recommend the area highly, and certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting Rome again. The hotel: it's VERY small. One floor, with no more than 8 to 10 rooms. I prefer that though, rather than being in a huge hotel where you feel like just a number, and just another guest. They knew us by name, were incredibly kind and accommodating, gave great restaurant recommendations, etc. It was very clean, well maintained, and updated. I would agree with a previous reviewers' comment that the photos on-line don't really do the hotel/rooms justice. My one hesitation from reading previous reviews were complaints about the rooms not having enough light/not being airy enough. We stayed in a triple, which had a very small patio and we could open the doors, which was a nice touch and provided plenty of light/air. Maybe we were just lucky -- i didn't get a chance to see what the other rooms were like. The room, like the hotel, was very clean and very well maintained, but it was rather small. Also, I would describe the room as better than basic, but certainly not luxurious. If you are looking for luxury in Rome, you're going to be paying 3 times the cost of this place. Oh yeah, and breakfast was a nice bonus! Coffee bar, pastries, fruit, eggs -- all included. For the location, the accommodations, and the service, this place can't be beat.

Loved the free use of the computer in the lobby, and the more than adequate breakfast each morning. The streets of Trastevere are narrow and cobblestoned, and FULL in the evenings, even in February! We loved exploring, shopping, sampling the baked goods and cappuchino in the many nearby shops and cafes. There are so many GREAT restaurants nearby, it's hard to make a decision! But one of our favorites was Le Mani in Pasta, a 10 minute walk (37 Via dei Genovesi...try the Spaghetti alla Vernaccia, or Tagliolini cacio e pepe...mmmmmmmm). TIP: make a reservation, it's great food at great prices and is maxed out every night! Another 10 minute walk takes you to a taxi stand OR the trolley stop, for a very quick and inexpensive trip across the Tiber to the historic sites of Rome. If you have a lot of time, it's even within walking distance. Ask any taxi to bring you back to the Ponte Garibaldi, and you are a 5 minute walk from the Inn, (although do-able, it is difficult for taxi's to take you to the door step, due to the narrow roads, and we always enjoyed the walk!).

We'd never stayed in Trastevere before although we know Rome quite well. The staff at the SM were absolutely lovely from the first minute we walked into the hotel. They were friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and unfailingly helpful. They recommended places to eat, how to get to sights, organised a taxi back to the airport and generally couldn't do enough to help. The hotel is a lovely building, very well refurbished. Original stone arches and wooden beamed ceilings combine with modern fittings to make it a beautiful and comfortable place to be. It's centrally heated in the winter so was lovely and warm. It also has air conditioning which would be essential in the summer. Our room (number 3) was spotlessly clean, and spacious for Rome, could sleep four and had a gorgeous bathroom with the most amazingly luxurious shower I've ever had - very necessary after a hard day's sightseeing. We even had our own little terrace complete with bistro table and two chairs. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the hotel is very quiet - we slept like logs. The breakfast was again reasonable (although I would like to have been offered more than one cup of coffee) and there's a complimentary lunch at the nearby hotel Santa Maria. The price included internet access (there's a public laptop if you haven't got your own with you) and breakfast and was very good value. The only drawback was it's a but of a walk to the city centre - about twenty minutes - although there's a tram which goes very regularly. Staying in the Trastevere is like staying in a small, friendly Italian village. It's probably not for you if it's your first time in Rome as you'll want to be more central, but if you want a peaceful haven away from Rome's hassle, you won't get better than this. One final word - I was a bit worried about the graffitti I saw in the area when I looked on Google earth street view. Don't be.

The hotel is about 20 minutes walk from the Coliseum and 45 from the Vatican. We walked everywhere.

We stayed at this hotel earlier this month for 4 nights and found it a wonderful property to experience Rome to it's fullest. We arrived early in the morning and were told that our room wouldn't be ready for another hour - we expected to have to wait most of the day. They pointed us in the direction of a nice outdoor cafe and off we went. We had a wonderful room (Room 1) right on the ground floor, and no it was not noisy in the slightest. We had a very large room, especially by European standards with a double bed and bunk beds (tasteful bunk beds not tacky) . The bathroom was very clean and well equipped with the best shower in all of Europe I'm sure. The hotel offered an indoor courtyard which is rather hot and uninviting. An outdoor courtyard would be wonderful. The cavernous breakfast room is very daunting initially but actually quite pleasant once there. The breakfast is quite hearty actually with meats, cheeses, cereals, hardboiled eggs, fresh fruit and of course coffee, tea and cappucinos (which were excellent and served with a pleasant smile) We were recommended a restaurant nearby that was amazing and we ended up eating there 2 nights in a row and would have dined there again if they weren't closed - I believe it was called Il Barbineri but please check with the hotel as it is right around the corner from them. The Trastevere area is wonderful and you really feel like you are in a medieval Italian village. We mixed with the locals and of course fellow tourist in the wonderful outdoor cafes and the hotel is only about a block from Santa Maria Trastevere Church which is lovely and the plaza in the evening is really quite an event. We were able to walk everywhere and if we were too tired we simply caught the tram or bus to wherever we needed to go, ie.. Vatican or even the Colisseum although we walked one way to both of these and it only took about 1/2 an hour. The heat is what kills you. I was a travel agent for many, many years and don't often feel overly confident giving a recommendation for a hotel unless I had a really good experience and I can honestly say that I can recommend this hotel to anyone without any qualms. One last little issue, we were told prior to arrival that the hotel had WIFI and access to a computer. We did not get either of these options. One front desk manager said that the computer was stolen , another said that it was unhooked and another didn't know where the computer was. Regarding the WIFI hookup nobody really knew why we were unable to access WIFI. So, if you are thinking of using their computer for emails home don't count on it.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mobile, AL", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay in Trastevere\u201d", "Author": "NYCgirl926", "ReviewID": "UR35004975", "Content": "We had a great stay in charming Trastevere at this lovely hotel!

The air conditioner worked great... I honestly cannot think of a negative thing to say about the Residenza, or about Trastevere in general, which is a great little neighborhood.

On departure, we cabbed it to the Roma Trastevere train station and caught that train back to the airport.

To the traveler's advantage, one finds little or no crowds at popular spots, more relaxed atmosphere in restaurants, and lower hotel rates. That being said, Rome has wonderful boutique hotels in neighborhoods with charm, comfort and location. The Residenza Santa Maria is an outstanding example of such a place. Located in the historic Trastevere (\"across the Tiber\"), it's one street away from the Santa Maria church, one of Rome's oldest churches and within a great restaurant district. If you want to eat real Italian food like a real Roman, the Trastevere is the place. All the major sites are within 10 to 30 minutes away by foot. Since the Tiber has many bridges, three of them are within 10 minutes or less from the Residenza. The Residenza is the newer little sister of the lovely Hotel Santa Maria, (located a few blocks away, a street behind the other side of the Piazza Santa Maria). The Residenza has 6 very comfortable rooms with TV, phones and personal safe. All rooms are sizeable doubles, have comfortable beds, some with enough room for an additional bed if needed, large built-in closets and full bathrooms. The lobby has a 24-hour free and open laptop for internet and email. Included in the room rate is a breakfast with a full variety of croissants, sweet rolls, fruit crostini and fresh bread, fruits, cheeese, meats, yogurt, cereals, juice, milk, and hard boiled eggs. It is frankly hearty. The coffee is anyway you prefer. The bread is about the best you'll find. Fresh every morning, crunchy crust, fragrent chewy interior. I'd say downright memorable. With just 6 rooms the staff can lavish as much or as little attention on one as one wishes. Any of the typical tourist inquiries are answered with knowledge and experience. They seem to know something about every restaurant in the Trastevere (and probably the rest of Rome). The Residenza is staffed 24 hours daily, and can assist the tourist with car or taxi hire for sight seeing or to get to and from the airport or train station, know guides with or without transportation, help with ticket reservations, sightseeing suggestions, maps, etc. We were delighted to have found the Residenza and would both recommend and stay there again.

I noticed a lot of people boarding the bus that did not swipe their pass, which I guess means they received a free ride (it appears to be an honor system). In the four nights we stayed we only took the bus twice, depending on our destination we would usually walk or take a taxi. We only had few minor complaints. We did not notice any English speaking TV channels (unlike another hotel we stayed at previously) so it was hard staying in touch with the world, we did not use the TV at all as a result. We booked a room that accommodates two adults and two teenagers, but the problem was that the bathroom was very small, making it very challenging for four people to share the room.

Next time if I stay again I would rather book two smaller rooms. The other minor complaint was that the small refrigerator was not always stocked, but all his is very minor.

The room was quiet and comfortable. Hard to believe we were in noisy Rome. It was an oasis of peace and quite. The neighborhood is great like has been said by everyone else. We felt safe and secure walking the streets of this lovely neighborhood. Of course it was a quiet time of year. The weather was cold which meant none of the outdoor cafes were busy - so most nights the streets were virtually empty. The breakfast was always good - we had fresh fruit every morning. One day they even served us strawberries and this was the end of November. The only complaint and it isn't the fault of the hotel was tha the driver we hired from the airport could not find the narrow little street where the hotel was located. It wasn't even on his GPS system. We literally drove around in circles for over 30 minutes trying to find the right one way streets so that he could deliver us to the door of the hotel. He wouldn't just drop us off in the the Plazza Santa Maria. Turns out the hotel was only a block from the plazza. But he was determined to get us there himself. The best part about this hotel is the staff. Chiara at the front desk went above and beyond the call of duty for me and I will always be in her debt. I left my eyeglasses in a taxi on our second to last day in Rome. Not only did she track down the cab driver who had picked us up from the hotel but the next day she arranged to have the cab driver meet us at the Borghese Gallery to give me my glasses. I call that service. I didn't think I would like Rome but Romans like Chiara proved to me that the Romans are much nicer and friendlier than the Italians we met in other Northern Italian cities like Florence and Venice.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC/Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cJewel in the Trastevere\u201d", "Author": "xiximullane", "ReviewID": "UR23210350", "Content": "I cannot say enough about how great this hotel was.

We also liked the location for walkability to central sites and for access to public transportation. The hotel is very cute and the service was great!

You are researching the internet for a hotel in Rome that has a great location, with rooms that are clean and functional. I'll make it easy for you, Residenza Santa Maria will exceed your expectations. Our accommodation requirements were for a family of four on a short mid-term break to Rome. I was familiar with Trastevere as a location and we booked directly with the hotel on that basis and the simple theory that a \"Good web site equals a good product\". Both proved correct. The hotel itself only has 6 rooms, and the problem with that is? The rooms are an effective size, very clean, and practically equipped for the tourist market. Don't expect to find conference rooms and gymnasiums, it's not a business hotel. The hotel is however, the epitome of a boutique hotel with high attention to detail in the design and upkeep of the interior. Friendly staff that are very relaxed and willing to help and a convenient continental breakfast with healthy and unhealthy options, accompanied by some great coffee. Trastevere is teeming with restaurants, bars, gelateria and just a great place to stroll in the evening. All major tourist attractions are within 2 km and the hotel staff will happily provide guidance for transport options but Rome is a walking city so where ever you are staying a good pair of shoes is a must. The advantage of Residenza Santa Maria is that when your walking is done for the day, everything you need in the evening is literally on you doorstep. In my opinion, Trastevere is the place to dine in Rome. It's much more affordable than across the river, a quaint atmosphere and very much the experience that most of us seek. As for cost, I look at it like this. Why spend a lot of money going to Rome and then try to save a few euros on accommodation in some noisy flea pit with indifferent staff and drunks on the street outside. Chances are you will need two rooms for a family of four in that sort of accommodation. However, the Residenza's accommodation options of suites/triples/quads will probably mean that most families have the option of one room instead of two thereby negating the additional cost of quality. If you're not still not sure about hotel options after this review, you probably never will be because this hotel really is as good as it gets. Good luck with your hunt but remember that rooms at the Residenza may already be booked anyway.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cResidenza Santa Maria is Home Away from Home\u201d", "Author": "mliccar", "ReviewID": "UR19443577", "Content": "We loved the Residenzia Santa Maria.

The hotel is located on a side street which is very quiet and peaceful even though it is very close to the bustle of the Trastevere night life. At night, the Trastevere area truly comes alive. In addition to many restaurants, bars, cafes and shops, there are various street performers and a great place to people watch. The Residenzia Santa Maria is very cozy and home-like. It is small and quaint. No formal hotel feeling here. One feels very safe and at home. The staff is excellent and hospitable. They are very professional, friendly and helpful. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and the air conditioning worked very well (something we found to be somewhat rare in Italy) for which we were especially thankful having stayed in Rome during August.

Our entourage of 6 included 4 younger adults (ages 16-20) who felt safe and comfortable at the hotel.

I stayed here with my girlfriend for 3 nights and could not have been happier with the stay. Upon arrival, I realized that I had actually never actually confirmed my booking (my own fault) with the hotel. The front desk was very helpful in determining the cause of the problem and was fortunately able to arrange us accomodation in the hotel for the first night. Because the hotel was scheduled to be full for the remaining nights, the front desk called several other hotels to arrange us another place to stay for the rest of our nights in Rome. Fortunately, there was a cancellation later that day and we were able to stay in the Residenza for the remainder of our trip. Thus, I only bring up the point to emphasize the overall helpful nature of the staff. The rooms are very nicely equipped with comfortable beds and large bathrooms. Some people have issues with the small showers etc. in European hotels... not a problem here. Trastevere is the only neighborhood where I would choose to stay in Rome. The closest US equivalent I can think of would be the W. Village in NYC with a bit more of an E. Village attitude. It's perfectly convenient to the major sites (you can walk to about anywhere in Rome in 30-45 mins at most) and it is IDEALLY situated for great, fun trattorias and restaurants.
