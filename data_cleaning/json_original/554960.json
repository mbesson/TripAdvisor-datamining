Our refrigerator was missing all its racks but a quick call to Clarion was all that we had to do to get that resolved. We found that if we called Clarion to resolve any issue, they were quick to respond. My one complaint is that the balcony does not have a screen door. Due to this, you cannot enjoy the sounds of the ocean while avoiding bugs. We did not opt for the $30/day linen service but we had ample towels to last us during the stay. We had one minor inconvenience - there was a leak from one of our bathrooms to the bathroom on the 3rd floor.

You have the privacy of a condo but get to use the amenites at the Clarion Resort Fontainebleau Hotel right next door. The staff was extremely nice and helpful when we checked in which was two hours prior to check in time. We rented two 2 bedroom units for the eight of us. Three adults and 5 of our kids (15-21 years old). The units were extremely clean and very spacious. NO BED BUGS! I do not understand why people are complaining about the cooking items in the kitchen. We had everything we needed. If you didn't have enough of something all you had to do was call and ask for them. Of course the items are not William-Sonoma pots and pans but what do you expect. It is a rental unit and often items are taken by guest so it would be ridiculous to expect high end cooking items. I knew I was going to be making pancakes so I brought my favorite skillet with me. I really could have left it home. It was great having the washer and dryer in the unit. Bring your own detergent. Our laundry room had a broom but the other did not. No big deal. I really didn't expect one to be there. The tv in the main room was new. We brought dvds with us and watched them. There was dishwasher detergent for the dishwasher. Bring your own dish washing liquid because that is not supplied. Bring your own shampoo and conditioner because there is only a hotel size of it there which is more than I expected. This is a condo unit and not a hotel unit without maids daily. You have to treat it as a vacation rental. There are two parking spots alloted to each unit. Upon check in go to the Clarion not the Marigot. You really do get the best of both worlds. Privacy of your own condo but service from the Clarion if you want it. Our rooms were 804 and 811. 804 was directly opposite of the elevator and I have no complaints there. We did not hear a thing. You do not hear slamming doors all day and night as you would in a hotel. I would recommend that you book directly through the Marigot and not a privately owned unit. I only have good things to say about staying there. I booked a great deal directly through an internet special on their website months prior to staying. We are from Long Island and it was a great trip. I packed a bunch of food items with us expecting everything to be over priced at the local grocery store. There is one across the street that is very reasonable and easy to walk to. Bring your own cereal. Way to expensive there! Roses is also across the street and is a very good place to buy beach toys and inexpensive beach gear and postcards. I am very happy to give this review and believe me.....we are picky!

As it was St. Patrick's Day weekend and there was a convention in town, things in Ocean City were a little booked. We chose the Marigot Beach Suites operated by Clarion for our weekend getaway because quite honestly the pickings were slim. When you arrive, you have to check in at the Clarion, and then drive over to the Marigot next door. We did not arrive until 10:00 after shopping and having dinner, and even though we requested a room on a higher floor or at the very least away from the elevators and called back to confirm it, it was not honored. (We were, in fact, placed right next to the elevator on the 2nd floor.) We were so tired we didn't care and just headed to our room. There were about five or six very inebriated people yelling off the balcony of the Clarion right by the lobby area, whistling at my daughters and unnerving them a bit. We trudged back to the car, got our bags, and headed up to room 204. We have learned from our travel experiences that they very first thing we do is check the room for bed bugs. Bed bugs are NASTY and not something you want to bring back into your home. The girls started to check their room: lifting up the bedspreads to see if there was white powder on the floor near the corners (there was none), blood stains on the sheets, or any bugs. My youngest daughter found a bug right away. After observing it and being a little nervous about it begin a bed bug, we touched it to see if it was dirt or if it would move, and it fell down to the mattress below and disappeared. Thinking perhaps it was just a piece of dirt, we kept looking--and found another one on the other side of the bed, by the headboard. This time, I watched as my daughter put her finger near the bug and it crawled away. We knew for sure at that point that they were both bugs and it was not our imagination. We called down the desk where they told us they would move us right away. So, we had to take all of our things back to the car (in the rain), go back to the lobby where we were again treated to the obscenities of the drunk people, and get a new room. This time we were placed in apparently the only room they had left on the 10th floor. They gave free drink cards to us (this was very helpful for my 15 and 17 year old) and told us that they would definitely notify the manager on the morning shift so that we could possibly receive a discount on our stay or a future stay. They also commented that because a competition with a certain sporting group had been in town, it was very possible the room could have bed bugs because they tend to spread with teenagers who move from location to location to location visiting friends. We went to again to settle in. A thorough check yielded no bed bug sightings, but now my youngest daughter (who found the original bed bugs) was freaking out and nervous. While this room was nicer, we could not enjoy it because it was nearly 11:00 at night and we were all utterly exhausted. By the way: if you do not know this, always keep your suitcases and things OFF the floor unless the floor is tile. We had everything on chairs and counter tops. And, thoroughly wash any clothes you wore as soon as you get home, not letting them touch anything else, just incase there were bed bugs in the bed. The entire checking in, going back, getting a new room, and going to the new room process took about 45 minutes. The next morning, upon checking out back at the Clarion, I asked the desk if the manager had reviewed our experience. She went to get the manager (a tall, thin man with glasses) and he came out and told me that Phyllis the house keeper found nothing in the room, they met their obligation when they moved us, and there was absolutely nothing he could do for us because they couldn't find any bed bugs. He said everyone knows about bed bugs and actually told me because it's in the news I could be making it up. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT??? I was mortified. Here he is, a manager of a nationally known hotel chain, and he is telling me that he doesn't believe me because they didn't find anything? I am not sure how many bedbugs were in that bed before they changed the sheets, but I figure for the two we saw, there were probably a few more. He wanted me to physically walk back to the room where the bed bugs were located and show his housekeeper where we found them--even though because they didn't find any, he wasn't going to do a darn thing in terms of discounting the room or offering any incentive for a future stay with the Clarion/Mairgot resort. And, I had already told three people very specifically where they were and even offered to draw a map of the bed and show them where they were located. But no--this manager wanted me to go back to the room even though it wasn't going to change his mind about whether or not he was going to discount my stay for the inconvenience. Irregardless, I STILL walked back to the room to show Phyllis where the bugs were, because I knew I was not making it up. What bothers me is because he didn't believe me, he very well might rent out room 204 to someone in the near future--and I did not want someone to get infected because of his arrogance. The room would have to remain vacant for at least two weeks for the bed bugs to not be a problem for future residents. The first thing I noticed was that the bed was already made, meaning that sometime between last night when we had found them and that morning when we checked out, someone had probably already changed the sheets. But, we of course showed Phyllis where they were anyway. No bed bugs were found, but upon moving the mattress, popsicle sticks, trash, and old food was discovered behind the bed next to the wall (it was disgusting.) Phyllis said they'd bring a bed-bug sniffing dog in the room-but I don't know how many bugs need to be present for the dogs to pick them up? We left with a promise to you, the reviewers, to beware. And perhaps if you find bedbugs at your Clarion resort, you better video tape the evidence or else you will be told they don't believe you. Pros to this stay: the location is nice, the ocean views are nice, recent renovations have been done to the Marigot. Free (I think)? wi-fi in the Marigot. Cons: the treatment by the manager (I felt like he was accusing me of making the entire thing up), the security's lack of taking care of the drunk people who were catcalling and whistling at passersby made it seem \"cheap\" to me. The shades were broke in both rooms. PS--If I had to prove the bedbugs to them, why didn't they come look at them that night before we moved?? Why did they wait until AFTER they changed the sheets and made up the room? I would NOT stay at the Clarion or the Marigot. Find another similarly priced hotel to spend your money. Would you want to stay at a resort where no one who works there listens to you? (No request for room location met, from quiet area to away from elevators; free drink cards great but not for teenagers; manager who tells you unless they find the evidence they don't believe you.)", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cFall Getaway\u201d", "Author": "Linda28970", "ReviewID": "UR119775620", "Content": "We enjoyed the serenity of the beach and all the amenities of the Clarion (sauna, jacquzzi, steam room, etc. Apartments were quite spacious.

There are a couple of things, however, that we were disappointed about: -One of the showers did not have a curtain when we arrived. We did request one and had it within 20 minutes. -After about 5 minutes in a shower, the water turned cold. -We called down to ask for a proper corkscrew, because the one in our room did not have the handles and would not open our bottle, and we were told that we would have to walk over to the Clarion with the bottle, and someone would open it for us...That's not customer service. -The check-in area at the Clarion is in an odd place. Rather than in a parking tunnel, why isn't it at the main entrance, where that conference center is? It's confusing. Every single guest I saw coming for the first time walked up to the conference center and became confused about why the door would not open. Of course, there are signs, but only if you're on that side of the building already. -Parking is pretty difficult...When we arrived, we had to put our cars in the Clarion parking lot to check in because our room wasn't ready--or we'd be towed from the Marigot lot (understandable). The problem is, however, that when you go to move your car from the Clarion to the Marigot, you have to get back out on Ocean City Blvd and make 2 U-turns to get there! That's a lot of effort just for your guests to be able to check-in and move in to the room. Additionally, our room comes with 2 parking spaces: one conveniently close to the building and one VERY far away in that lot. Regardless of how many cars a group has, they ALL contain luggage that we have to haul. This became an issue when unloading and reloading. I was fussed at for having my car in a spot other than my assigned--for about FIVE minutes--but where else can I put my car to load it, when all the loading zones are full already!? I understand that the spots are assigned for a reason, but do you really have to put them so far away and then fuss at guests about moving them closer for their convenience? The woman was borderline rude and not understanding about our loading situation. -I expected a pamphlet or at least a piece of paper saying \"Welcome to Merigot, we appreciate your business. Here are some things you should know...\" There wasn't anything like that. -Overall, I just didn't feel very welcome or like our business was appreciated, and we spent over $1100 for 2 days... -Almost every single lady at the front desk in the Clarion seemed annoyed at the guests, and I barely got even a smile. Only when we left did I hear a \"have a nice day!\" -The ice maker in our freezer did not produce ice... -We had to walk over to the Clarion for ice, where they gave us a tiny little baggy to fill up. We had to go to 3, 5, & 7 to get an ice machine that worked in combination with a drink machine that worked. That's just ridiculous...And the stairwell in that building is gross. You might consider cleaning it up... -You may consider painting the outside of the buildings too. It can't compare to the surrounding hotels, and I would rather try to get a room in a nicer looking place next time. So, overall, we were disappointed. The room itself seemed to serve our purposes well, after we had the ice and the shower curtain--and other than taking cold showers. There were 8 of us, so it was nice to have the space.

We had a problem with the lock on our door and shortly after I reported it, the entire lock was replaced. We felt like the other guests were a lot noisier this year.

We stayed 8/16-19 in a 2 bedroom 2 bath unit. The appliances were nice, washer and dryer nice, had all the cooking utensils I needed. Even the bed was comfortable.

The beach steps away, Lenny's featured the outside band, On the Edge that week and they were awesome, The group Arizona had the club inside in the evenings. We did not have far to go for a great time. I rely a lot on research and the reviews before I book.. In this case, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, it seemed to be 50/50. However, I lucked out and we had a condo o the 11th floor. The view was spectacular. They even managed to bring us up 2 more chairs, so we could all sit on the balcony. The furnishings were older, but, decent, my unit was clean, If unsure, I always carry my handy disinfectant. We were not ready to leave when our time was up. I did hear some complaints, while there. If the Clarion looks into those complaints and continues to update and repair the units when brought to their attention, they will be a sure winner. We had everthing we needed..room, privacy, great view, entertainment, convenient to grocery stores, etc. We were quite happy in the condo.. Would I try my luck again?, most definitely.

The coffee maker was on its last legs, the stove did not heat evenly and the air conditioner filter has clearly not been changed in a long time and the extra loud unit constantly ran as it struggled to cool the air.

We had to drive around for fifteen minutes literally looking at each and every number in each parking space! Please also note that these rooms have no daily maid service. You can call the front desk and they will deliver toilet paper, tissue...etc. We go to the room and do our little \"inspection\". As soon as we walked in, we saw the closet to the right had a broken door and only one side was able to be closed (it was double sliding doors). The bathroom to the left had a broken doorknob that was hanging on by a screw. It did work and lock, just had to be careful we didn't pull too hard. There was also a persistent drip coming from the bath faucet that we could not stop. The kitchen was good with marbletop counters and plenty of space. There were a lot of utensils and dinnerware, make sure to wash them as they all were dirty. The little kitchenette table had all dirty chairs. We could see spills and dirt all over them. The main living room was good sized and had a pull out sofa and two side chairs. The screen sliding door to the balcony fell off when we opened it. When you slide it just do it slowly. The balcony had a great view. There was no table just two cheap plastic chairs. There was some type of industrial carpet on the balcony that was \"pieced\" together and patched. There were ants as well under the carpet. The whole condo had central a/c that worked great, problem is....the main unit is in the master bedroom closet!!! The door had a big screen opening in it for the air intake as well. It sounded like an airplane was in the closet. It woke us up every time it turned on and off. This is a totally unacceptable placement for it. When we opened the door, we saw a sign about not blocking the air intake on the door. Looks like others before tried to block it to help with the sound, haha!! The main bedroom bathroom did not have a shower just a sink and toilet, not a shower like the front desk booking said. The lock was funny and you had to pull the door really hard to close it. The amenites are average at best.

The place wa very empty with only like two other families there. All the foods in the buffet were dry. It literally seemed the food was out since 5:00. Very dry food and very high prices. We now understood why no one goes there. The service from our waitress was average. The pools between the two hotels were good. One was heated and inside. We had hopes in thinking that spending more money for a \"better than average\" place would guarantee us a good room, but this place was bad. I would not recommend this place to anyone or ever go back. Don't be fooled by the high prices, and the internet pictures. The pictures are of the \"top of the line\" corner three bedroom unit.

The condos are a better price for a larger party with the benefit of full access to the Fountainbleu restaurants and bars. The beach is really quite nice and easy to access. The balcony allowed for relaxing and watching the sunsets. Washer and dryer in the condo kept the sandy clothes to a minimum. Was able to drive to the boardwalk and there were plenty of handicapped parking spaces for my dad as long as you get up there early. There are two indoor pools available which keeps the kids happy if you hit inclement weather. The new outdoor heated pool at Fountainbleu was excellent. Gift shop in the Fountainbleu had pretty reasonable prices vs the boardwalk i.e. sunblock was two dollars cheaper, etc. but its hours were rather sporadic. Do the breakfast buffet at least once at the Fountainbleu, excellent. There's an indoor mini-golf around 76th street that was a lot of fun too. The fitness center offered two areas which were well suited to our needs with some excellent treadmills and a weight room. The two 12 year olds simply wanted to see the rooms and there was one rather surly female staff member who kept remarking and reminding us that \"no one under 16 can use the center\". Lighten up lady! Overall, it was such a relaxing vacation, you really didn't have to worry much about safety and felt okay letting the kids explore the resort. There was security and lots of staff who do a really nice job.

The resort was truly a resort with restaurants, a private beach and other amenities. We encountered very expensive and low quality food, with poor service at the rest of the restaurants. Ocean City definitely seemed like it was for drinkers more than families. We enjoy our cocktails, but there were visibly drunk people on the streets at all hours.

In the kitchen, there was no frying pan at all. This is the second year in a row that this had happened. My husband and I did not do any cooking and so i did not call to ask for one. But how do you offer a fully stocked kitchen and no frying pan? One of the things I look forward to is dining on the porch. There was no large table on the porch when we arrived and I had to call housekeeping and ask that one be delivered. There were just too many things that were not in the unit which should have been.
