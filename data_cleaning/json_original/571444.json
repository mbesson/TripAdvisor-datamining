Everything you would want. Not inexpensive, but then nothing is, in Venice. We splurged on a junior suite over looking the canal. Everything red and gold and dreamy. The included breakfast includes coffee and fruit and croissants and eggs and much more. Everything you need to get you to the Guggenheim. The service is first rate.

The rooms are large and comfortable with old fashioned decor. The service and housekeeping are excellent and the breakfast sets you up for the day. Views from the bar are extraordinary. Getting home is no problem on any water taxi number 1, every ten minutes. Our preference would be for a quiet room on the back or side as the canals can get noisy in the early AM.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay\u201d", "Author": "bayberry39", "ReviewID": "UR116590743", "Content": "What a great Hotel!

What a great find. It was ideally located near the San Marco Plaza. The rooms were basic but spacious enough. They had televisions (no clocks) and nice bathrooms. We had air conditioning. The breakfast buffet was very satisfying. The staff was pleasant. The hotel was very clean. We had two rooms and were traveling with two teenagers so the reasonable price and the breakfast buffet came in very handy.

The best thing about this hotel ,outside of its charm and hospitality is its location. Literally 150 ft off the Valporetta #1 Sant Angelo stop!!. Its water front entrance is 1 of a kind and has an ideal location for all of Venice. The staff was extremly courteous and the rooms very clean and well appointed with fabric wallpaper not seen in 4 star hotels. It is listed in the SBH (Small Boutique Hotels guide) as one of the top picks in Italy. The breakfest buffett was equally as charming with a friendly atmosphere and plenty to choose from. The hotel arranged a tour to Murano at one of thier suggested factories. There are many confusing issues over the hotels and thier affiliations to the Murano factories, in our case we were very pleased with the selection and had a great expierence provided you know what you want and what you are willing to pay. As a high end hotel we were treated to a high end factory. I have traveled all over the world and I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sant' Angelo", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d571444-Reviews-Sant_Angelo-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "571444", "ImgURL": ""}}
