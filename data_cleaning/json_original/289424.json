It was very pleasant and the staff were helpful. It is located about a 10 minute drive out of the cbd so be prepared for that, however if you have a car this is no problem and we were advised there was a bus at the front door running regularly to take you to the city if need be. Free parking was included, and we didn't opt to have breakfast included so can't comment, but the restaurant looked very nice and was catering for a wedding one of the evenings we stayed (including loud noise from the music!) so it is likely quite a nice restaurant. I was surprised there wasn't a fitness centre on site or nearby, as it is a four star rated hotel and we were also disappointed the swimming pool wasn't open despite consistent 30 degree plus weather daily for weeks now and it was one of the reasons we booked here in the first place. Upon check in we were advised the pool wasn't opening for another 2-3 weeks. The room was very clean, the bed extremely comfortable. Noise was fine (apart from the wedding night!) and all very private and secluded despite being a large hotel. The staff were very friendly, including helping us to make a reverse charges call overseas which was lovely. Very helpful in giving directions and a map etc. Internet connection was free in the rooms, and the wifi access had great reception unlike some of our other stays.

I got the to the hotel after a fairly long flight, and even longer taxi drive (it's almost 30 mins drive from the main Madrid airport by highway). When I reached the hotel I was told that my room wasn't reasdy yet (it was somewhere around 13.00h), but after 30-45 mins I finally got the chance to get to my room. I specifically asked the lobby to get me a room where the internet connection would work thru cable, not WiFi - even called in advance the hotel to make sure they can offer this service (internet is free of charge). 1st thing I do in the room, check the net connection, and not to my surprise it wasn't working, which led me to calling the reception. After explaining that I know how to connect to the internet, they informed that the technical guy would check the issues only after lunch somewhere after 16.00. Indeed the guy tried his best to fix it in the roo m (while I was downstairs for a late lunch and specifically asked the reception to call me when he gets to my room). whatever the case, the connection wasn't working and so I had to take my computer and find a room where it would work. Not very nice to move all your stuff from one room to the other, but efforts must be done to work late in the evening ;-). All in all, room was clean (and cleaned daily) & spacious; stuff in the bathroom always refreshed; furniture in good condition; english speacking channels on tv avaialble; breakfast same thing each morning but plenty of choices no worries (even good coffee :)) and service is nice. Not a wide choice for late lunch, but you can do wiht a good cesar's salade. they also have a pool if you happen to drop by during summer. The hotel actually has 3 buildings, and in the main one you have the restaurant and reception (esspecially if you are sleepy in the morning and outside is pretty cold); it's located in a quite location, outside the city but not far from it. Good to know: there is a bus stop just in front of the hotel and it will take you 20 mins to get to one of the subway station (almost 30mins to get to the city centre). there are some shops not far from the hotel (not sure where cause I saw them from the bus) and some restaurants.

I think the hotel is nice, but I think it would have been even better in summer, as the swimming pool is outdoors and can not be used in November. With a recent promotion, the price was quite attractive (if pre-paid) and then it became a much more attractive proposal compared to another large chain hotel within the same neighbourhood. However, the hotel had far too many noisy guests who did not mind screaming in the corridors and outside (by the porch, which is right in front of some rooms) after midnight.Since the hotel has two separate buildings, the receptionists did not have any idea that all this noise was going on in the hotel. If you go here for business, and you are used to other business hotels in Spain providing some amenities such as a toothbrush, toothpaste and shaving razor, you may be surprised not to find them in your room at Eurostars Zarzuela. However, the receptionist can give them to you upon request. The in-room TVs are located at an inconvenient angle if you watch them from the bed. The remote control key you need to press to start watching TV is the \"program up\" or \"down\" key, not the usual \"stand-by\" key or the channel numbers. If you get here by taxi, be sure to have a map to indicate the hotel's location. If the taxi does not have a GPS, it can be hard to find a taxi driver who knows its location. I spent 20 minutes in a taxi looking for it after midnight when coming from the city center. I found that the gates of the hotel had been closed by then. Upon ringing the bell at the pedestrian entry point I did not get an answer from reception, and had to walk in through the car gates after ringing that one's bell, which the receptionist was able to hear.

It is located in an affluent, quite residential neighborhood about 15 minutes north of the center, with easy access to the freeway.

The hotel is located on a low hill, offering nice views of the city while enjoying the well groomed lawns around the refreshing, good size pool.

This, however, is offset by the fact that parking at the hotel is free \u2013 unlike parking at the city center hotel which is outrageously expensive (if it is offered in the first place).

But it seemed quite busy in the evenings. The hotel is in a residential neighbourhood, but whilst you are there, you would never know. The grounds are small but pretty, and the area is very quiet and peaceful. There is a bus stop outside the hotel, but we had a hire car. You can park for free around the Moncloa Metro station during the week, and around the Teleferico at the weekend. It is only a few stops into Madrid from there. Although we decided not to take the car into the city, our general experiences with Spanish car parks were very favourable.

The hotel is situated in a residential area with no facilities nearby. As for the accomodation, the rooms are lovely, modern, clean and comfortable. The breakfast is excellent. The dinner was good if a little expensive. One bugbear was that we came back early from Madrid on a saturday evening to eat, and found that the restaurant was closed. With no restaurants or bars nearby we had to go without any food or head back into Madrid. As the taxi we'd got earlier in the day had got 7 euros already on the clock before we even got in it, we decided to call it a night and just go to bed.

The Hotel as the other reviews have said is nice and clean but consider the hotel has only been open for 1 year so it should be. We arrived late September 05 in Madrid to a nice 29 degrees Celsius and could not wait to take a swim in the Hotels advertised swimming pool. We asked if we could have the key to the pool only to be told that it was closed as we had arrived \"out of season\". They informed us that the pool closes mid September. I was very annoyed by this as neither lastminute or the hotels website (eurostarshotels) said anything about the pool closing. We picked this hotel as we wanted to relax by the pool in the very hot weather that Madrid has this time of the year. The hotel has a very nice garden and outdoor area around the pool which would have been nice to use but the Hotel has no furniture to sit on at all so you have to sit on a wall which becomes very uncomfortable after a few minutes. They have I think 4 tables with 4 chairs for each table outside the cafe/bar area which after about midday is in the shade. The bar was advertised in the Hotel Guide in room as being open on Saturday from 2pm until midnight. I fancied a beer as I was on holiday so waited from midday until 2pm for the bar to open. This never happened so I found a member of staff and asked him if I could buy a beer from the bar as it was supposed to be opening at 2pm. The answer I got was \"not today\" I queried the hotel guide with him and he looked at me and said \"not today, we will open at 8pm and shut at 11:30pm. This is not good enough when the hotel advertises differently in it's guide. The hotel is in the middle of a residential area so the nearest place to buy anything at all is Moncloa whish is 10 minutes bus ride away. Also as the other reviews have said, Taxi's do not know where it is and if they do they don't always want to take you. The bus (161) runs from Moncloa to right outside the hotel but stops running at 11:30pm. Madrid only starts to get busy at night around 11pm so the bus finishes a bit early. My girlfriend and I stood on the side of the road in Moncloa hailing taxis for each of the 3 nights we where there and each time at least 4 taxis refused to take us before one did and we even made sure we had a detailed map of how to get to the hotel by car from Moncloa. Junction 9 off the A6. Some taxis just said no, some said not out of the city. The Hotel has 2 tennis courts which are nice but they are undersized. There is also absolutely nothing to do for children whatsoever. This didn't affect me but just something to note The Hotel is clean and quiet but if you want to go for a break in Madrid and to see the capital then I would advise staying in the centre. If you want to relax at the hotel it is very quiet so you could do this but bring your own chair. By the way breakfast there is a buffet style breakfast and costs 10 Euros. Get a better breakfast and cheaper in Madrid.
