The rooms are small, but great for 1 person. The hotel is old, but all the hotels in the area are old, that's what makes SF, SF! The best was comfy, free wi-fi, nice little resto int he lobby for breakfast, starbucks across the street. My room was not facing the street, but I'm glad it wasn't. I know the cable cars can be loud, and if I opened my window I could hear them slightly. Everyone at the hotel was super friendly. Good to know, there is no AC. I was there first week of March and it was little warm during the day (I'm Canadian, anything about freezing is warm) so I had the window open during the day and up until I went to sleep. There is a celling fan and the front desk told me they had a cooling far for the room if I wanted it.

Now, the rooms are small, but i knew that already from other reviews on Tripadvisor. The decor is just lovely, bright modern colours and modern furniture mixed with the old style of the building. We were on the 9th floor, and had a room that overlooked a roof of another building. This wasn't a problem however, as it made the room quiet, even at night with both the windows open we still couldn't hear any street noise. I found the beds to be a little uncomfortable, a bit to firm for my liking, plus i am used to sleeping in a King bed, this was a queen.There is a large flat screen television in the room. No coffee machine or bar fridge. However, in the lobby there is free help your self coffee and cookies, plus chilled water. It wasn't particularly warm when we visited, but i noted that in terms of cooling they only have a ceiling fan and the windows which open. It wasnt an issue for us though during our stay. The concierge was fantastic, outlining everything on our map that we should see and how to get there. We bought a three day muni pass for $21 which gets you access on all the cable car and other buses that run. San Francisco is a fairly easy city to navigate, the public transport is pretty good. There is a bit of wait for the cable cars however, and sometimes they get so full they just go straight past. The location is great, right in the action.

It all got better from there, the Bell Hop was extremely pleasant, soothing and not even a little bit put out that we had a fair bit of luggage. Check in was very efficient even though we had problems with our credit card, the nice lady was patient and eventually we got it all sorted and we got into our room on the 13th floor. These rooms are small. Thankfully there is quite a roomy closet which managed to hold a ski bag, two suit cases and some other small bags - quite the Tardis. Even with this the room still felt confined, but we weren't there to lie about in our room all day! We had no noise issues. An in-room coffee maker would have been a good thing, coffee/tea is available in the lobby but I couldn't 'aquire' the taste for American drip coffee (anywhere). But I'll forgive them that because the cookies were always very yummy. The handy free ice machine was well apreciated by me. Great restaurants were in abundance around the hotel corner. There is a Walgreen's seemingly everywhere which was handy and I thought had the best souvenirs. Shopping - well that's legendary as is the cable car that stopped right out the lobby door but be prepared to wait or find an alternative, they were always full. We bought a muni passport from the hotel kiosk which was very efficient and cheaper. There's even a very good doctor the hotel can recommend. The bathroom was built on a postage stamp - we are tall people and it was a bit of comedy sketch at times. The bathroom as with the rest of the room, was always scrupulously clean and the toiletries are lovely. Thanks to the complimentary umbrella in the closet our tour of Alcatraz was not a total wash out. Very good thinking! On the whole, the hotel was very pleasant. If we stayed in SF again, we would probably stay somewhere else, not because of the hotel but away from touristy Union Square - it was always so busy and us country folks just didn't cope well.

In fact, the reviews were so good we canceled our booking at another, nearby hotel and switched over to the Chancellor. I am glad we did. Every guest experience at the Chancellor seems calculated to be out-of-the-ordinary in terms of customer service, thoughtfulness, and ambiance. The details are legion, from the extremely helpful front-desk staff to the entertaining Irish bartender to the umbrella in the cupboard and the exhaustive list of available pillow options. Everything conspires to say, this is NOT an ordinary hotel, this is a place that receives you and turns you into a customer advocate. Dang, these people could and should write a book to re-teach the mega-chains (talkin'-a' you, Mr. Marriott) how to run a hotel. Internets are free. The breakfast has healthy options available that are not over-salted and are, in fact, delicious. The bar has a happy hour from 17h00 to 19h30 and provides an entertaining option for meeting fellow-guests and hangers-on. Nothing is perfect, of course. The hotel would do well to pay a bit more attention to its infrastructure, such as, Do the bathroom doors close and stay closed when closed (hint: In our case, no). Barring a major breakthrough in physics, the rooms cannot increase in size, but it would be nice if that could be arranged. But of course such things are more likely in Los Angeles than San Francisco (Go, Caltech! :) And, though tram bells are charming, if they get on your nerves you will want to request a room on a higher floor. But the Chancellor appears to be very receptive to such requests. Though no coffee is available in the room, free coffee is available in the lobby. One important hint: When you book your room, pay a few dollars extra for the meal credit. $10 extra per day buys you $25 credit at the Chancellor's restaurant and bar - more than enough to cover a good breakfast, or some wine in the evening; whatever floats your boat.

Given that the hotel is old and close to Union Square, I wasn't sure what to expect. Some of the hotels in that area are not very nice. .. Just saying. At any rate, I'd made reservations stating that our flight arrived SFO at 9:30 am. They said they would do what they could to make sure the room was ready. It wasn't ready when we arrived at 10:30, but that was fine since we knew we were arriving before official check-in. They stored our bags, told us to check back in 2 hours, and off we went. Three hours later, the room was still not ready. They checked in several other people who came in while we were sitting there waiting for the room to be ready. . . Not happy about that at all. We waited almost another hour before they gave us our keys. At least the small lobby was comfortable. We got to the room to find had provided a bottle of champagne and box of chocolates as a birthday present. That soothed my consternation over the delay in getting the room keys. The room, while small, was larger than some we've stayed in in SF, and it was clean. We had a corner room, and the closet was huge. That said, there was not a lot of room to hang things up as it was long but not too wide. Still, it was good to put suitcases in there and out of the way in the room. The tiny bathroom, while dated, reminded me of European bathrooms. There was a tub with shower, and stepping over the edge wasn't fun. The towels were as old as the hotel, I think. I did, however, like the soaps, shampoos and cute yellow duck. Three things I appreciated (other than the birthday gifts): hot coffee, cold water and cookies in the lobby all day long. What I would change: Update the bathrooms and the towels. While we didn't partake, they did offer an extensive choice of pillows different from the ones in the room.

All I can say is WOW! I was sent to San Francisco for training. I am not a traveler. I rarely leave home without my husband. SO it was quite a surprise to me when my Boss said I would be going away (by myself) for two weeks, possibly 16 weeks I know nothing about big City living and I was scared. I went to The Chancellor's website to see what was available. There was a link to contact the manager so I did. I mentioned that I would be in the City alone and that I was afraid. When I checked in I got a big surprise as I was upgraded to a SUITE on the 15th floor! The Room was beautifully charming. It is not a brand new hotel but a cozy and historic building from around 1914. The bed was comfortable. The pillows were wonderful. They even have a pillow menu where you can order up what ever type of pillow you are used to sleeping with!! Rooms are very clean and updated with new and trendy furniture. The bathroom has a very deep bath tub which was perfect for taking hot baths after a long days work. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, cotton balls and even Q-tips are provided. For my second week at the hotel (I went home on the weekend) I did not have the SUITE.. However, I was given a room on the 15th floor that was equally as cozy and comfortable. Since I was staying for 5 days and wanted to have cold waters, I called down to the front desk and asked if they had a refrigerator that they could bring to me. They brought it up right away! Both rooms that I stayed in had a beautiful view of Union Square. I felt safe to walk around this area. This Hotel is in the Heart of things. You can easily catch a taxi or any other public transportation by just stepping outside of the building. The Staff was extremely friendly. The facility was very clean. The elevators were fast. The bar is small but I had a great time talking to other hotel guests and the Awesome Bartender named Alicia. She made me feel comfortable and even gave recommendations on things to do in San Fran as well as places to eat if I had craving for certain foods. They even have a plug underneath the bar to plug in your phone :) I thought that was cool!! Oh, there was a walk-in closet in both of my rooms. In the closet there was a safe where I kept personal items. Lastly I want to say that this hotel is VERY AFFORDABLE! I will be returning to San Francisco and when I do...

Their eggs Benedict was supposed to be the house special, but because I'm a vegetarian the waiter offered to make it Florentine and very tasty it was! The bar also has a decent happy hour. The only drawback was our room didn't have a very good view -- maybe a room higher up (we were on the 6th floor) and/or maybe facing Union Square (but then you might have more noise). And it didn't have a fridge. The location is superlative, half a block from Union Sq., the Powell/Hyde cable car goes right past, and a lot of great restaurants and watering holes are within walking distance. One day we walked all the way to Pier One of the Embarcadero and then along the waterfront up to the Powell/Hyde cablecar for the ride back. A long walk but lots of fun. It was very brisk weather while we were there so we appreciated being able to duck out of the hotel and to have a choice of places to go within a three-block radius. While you're there check out the little concierge/gift stand in the lobby.

I narrowed the choices down to a few hotels I hadn\u2019t heard of before, and checked the reviews on this site. The deciding factor was based on the fact that the manager, Wes Tyler, took the time to respond to the comments (both positive and negative) and also gave his direct contact info. & suggested getting in touch w/him if guests had any issues or concerns. I thought that was pretty outstanding & decided to test it out. Emailed him, let him know I was booking some Exec\u2019s there for the first time and asked him if he could please help to make their stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible. He responded quickly and assured me he would make every effort to do so. And he did just that! They all came back and said their stay was great, absoultely no complaints, location was perfect, staff was gracious and the hotel was very charming. Thank you to Wes and the entire staff at the Chancellor Hotel!", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cRemarkable in every way\u201d", "Author": "Guy_North_Of_Hope", "ReviewID": "UR123212094", "Content": "Our three night stay was perfect.

The windows were open, and the smell wasn't too bad; my husband didn't even notice. If it had bothered me I would have asked for another room. Open windows were a plus since we don't like it too warm at night. Loved the green accent wall, the rubber ducky in the bathroom and very nice shampoo/conditioner/lotion (organic no less). Loved the bar and bartender Rory, where we took advantage of a two-for-one coupon and happy hour to have a relaxing drink - Rory was very friendly. Hotel is 1/2 block from Union Square, which was alive with people, ice skaters, music, performers, a giant Christmas tree and the lighting of the first Chanukah candle on a giant menorah. The shops were decorated, Macy's had a wreath in every window. We walked all over. In the morning, Sears Fine Food is just up the block, a famous breakfast somehow I've never sampled.

The rooms are clean, the staff is really polite, in general a good experience. The hotel doesnt have a parking, so you have to first park in front unload your luggage and leave it with the bell boy at reception or bring it already to your room and then go and park the car. The garage is a public one that also serves the hotel, and is like a block away, so this might be a problem for some people, for us it was ok. The rooms are tiny, really little, and as we had lots of luggage, that wasnt optimal, but we managed. The hotel is not new, but well kept and clean. The hotel also doesnt have a restaurant, there is a restaurant there but doesnt belong to the hotel, so if you want, you can have breakfast there and they even will charge it to the room, but is a separate business. I will not recommend it though, because we had breakfast there twice and you have to wait FOREVER to get your food. So if you are staying here, I would recomend you to go the Cafe du Paris that is very close (great breakfast) or next door, there is a great place, a little expensive, but with a wide range of options, very nice food and efficient service.

Others have commented about the lack of air conditioning, San Fran was unseasonally warm in the days we were there, but we slept with the windows open & were surprised how quiet the city was! Also walked down to Fishermans Wharf from here - never felt unsafe at night! Being across the road from saks was handy as could drop our purchases back before heading to other stores.

The lobby is cozy, with delicious cookies and coffee available throughout the day. We had breakfast at Luques twice, and it was very good. Our waiter Mao used to live in my hometown - small, small world. We had an especially good time with him. This location is absolutely excellent. Cable car a few steps from the front door. Great shopping in Union Square a few steps. 24 hour Walgreen's a few steps. Chinatown just 3 or 4 blocks. At the tour counter in the lobby, be sure to get your Muni pass for unlimited rides on the city's great transportation system including cable cars, buses, and streetcars. Great bus routes and the F-line streetcar are quite convenient to the hotel. An e-mail to the wonderful Mr. Wes Tyler prior to my birthday visit last week resulted in an unexpected upgrade to a 2-room suite on the top floor, with a view of Union Square, as well as welcoming gifts in the room - a birthday card, a picture frame, champagne and flutes. So thoughtful. So gracious. Wow and double wow. San Francisco is wonderful, and I look forward to many more visits. I use the word great many times in this review. This hotel, the city and its people deserve all the \"greats\" I give to them. And I'm so grateful to tripadvisor and fellow travelers for helping me to find this gem of a hotel.

It's also nice to be able to hit Happy Hour at your own hotel before heading to a show. While it's not a large hotel, it gives you more of that feeling of going back to your own apartment at the end of the day than that sterile feeling you sometimes get from a larger property. It's not unusual for me to get tired of a hotel after a few days, but that did not happen at the Chancellor. It's in a perfect location when you are using public transportation to get around. Same as last time, all the employees I came in contact with were friendly and helpful. I asked for a refrigerator this time and it was very handy to have.

This hotel has class and has been very well maintained. Our bed linens were clean and new and there were a variety of pillows to choose from including buckwheat! It was our honeymoon and the hotel staff placed 2 souvenier champagne flutes along with a bottle of pink champagne in our room before our arrival. Very nice touch. The cleanliness of the room was wonderful. We slept with the window open each and every night. The city is noisy but you can request a room up high and you can avoid the street car/city noise.

Needed a quick lunch, had to choose between Scala\u2019s Bistro across the street or Sears next door(look another for review). Back to the hotel to checked in \u2013 got high floor, room-facing Powell St.(requested in advance thru email which was responded promptly). Found a bottle of wine and small box of chocolate on the cocktail table \u2013 nice touch, thanks! Room has 32\u201d flat tv on top of dresser with a marble? top. Next to it is a table/chair with lamp (with a/c outlets) and telephone. Chairs are on each side of the cocktail table by the window. There are end tables with lamps on each side of the queen bed-one with a clock radio. Pillows and bed were very nice and comfortable. Ceiling fan produced enough circulation \u2013 vibration/noise is noticeable at top speed but that\u2019s not the preferred setting anyway. Noise from cable cars, construction (Stockton & Post) and everything else going on (Powell/Union Square/HVAC of the building across the street) is on a medium high level with the window in full open position. I could not close it fully as the room gets too hot for our taste. Although, I think the noise level will be much better when the road constructions are over. Bathroom size is fine, the only really complaint is how close the potty is to the door. Wi-Fi signal was very good and VPN connection worked properly \u2013 for free! Closet has iron/board and a safe big enough to fit a 15.6 laptop with plenty of clothes hangers and an umbrella too (came in handy for a few rainy days/nights). The Icebox is nicely hidden inside a closet by the elevator. The elevators are quick and seem to handle the traffic very well. Hotel is central to all public transit \u2013 cable car at Powell, buses at Post, Sutter or Stockton. I believe BART is a short walk as well. Muni passport can be bought at the tour desk. Hotel is practically next door to major shops \u2013 Saks, NM, Macy\u2019s, Bulgari/Tiffany, Uggs and more. Ditto for different restaurants/bars. Only used the hotel restaurant for breakfast (3x) \u2013 food was very good with great service \u2013 with 20% off for conference attendees. There is a small bar by the lobby where the free coffee is (didn\u2019t particularly liked the flat taste/flavor), but has very good selection of tea bags. On several occasions, the thermos for coffee or hot water ran dry, although they were replenished quickly. There were also free cookies and fruits available for guests. All the staff seems genuinely friendly, from the front desk, bellhop, tour desk, restaurant wait/help, maintenance & maids. Normally, there will be staff(s) that are indifferent but not at this hotel, at least not the ones we encountered in our 6 nights stay. The hotel is a very good (4.5) 3 star property. If/when I\u2019m in the city/Union Square, I will definitely consider staying at Chancellor again.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evesham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location but some glitches\u201d", "Author": "bizzylizzy158", "ReviewID": "UR119288631", "Content": "Like many other people who have stayed at the Chancellor we booked on the strength of Trip Advisor ratings. I'm sorry to say I have to disagree with those people who have given the hotel four and five stars. The desk staff were efficient and pleasant, other staff we came across were also courteous and polite. The room was very small, but we did expect this as we'd read the info on the hotel before booking. The room itself was clean and the bed linens were of good quality. The bath was pretty parlous, with pieces missing from the enamel. Luckily neither my husband nor I actually wanted to use it as a bath, preferring to shower. So we were able to put a mat over the top of the damaged area. But the hotel should really fix these kinds of basic faults. Our booking had been in place for several months prior to our arrival, so we were hoping for a half decent room, and not one of those rooms you take because there's nothing else available and you're desperate. But this room overlooked some kind of rumbling, thrumming plant - air conditioning I think. The noise was unacceptably loud, it also meant we had to keep the window closed at night. Bad enough in reasonably clement weather, but if you'd been in the room during a heat wave you would have had to choose between a baking hot room or being kept awake by the roar of the plant. Regarding the free coffee and cookies. The cookies did seem to hang around under a plastic dome for some time, they appeared not be home baked (although I apologise if I'm wrong). We came across the coffee and hot water dispensers (for tea) in several hotels on our trip. People from the UK may not be familiar with them. They're rather like very large vacuum flasks - you push the top to dispense a measure of coffee or hot water to make tea. A good idea of course, and it was nice to have a coffee first thing in the morning before we set off. But we did notice that the water didn't seem to be replaced on a regular basis and was occasionally tepid. The bar in the hotel seemed rather dark and dismal - not at all welcoming. Very few people seemed to use it as far as we could see. That also applies to the restaurant. A few tips for you all. Eating around Union Square is not cheap, if you're on a budget I would suggest booking a hotel offering breakfast as part of the package. This could easily be the fault of our travel agent, but we were not offered this option for the Chancellor at the time of booking and I don't know if breakfast is offered as part of a room package. The cable car turntable is at the other end of Union Square, just a short walk down the road. There always seemed to be long queues there - this means that the cable cars are very often full by the time they get to the Chancellor stop. So take the 'it's easy to hop onto a Cable car outside the Chancellor' advice with a pinch of salt. It isn't. My final piece of advice which doesn't actually relate to the hotel, but is worth knowing. If you want a quick snack, some chocolate, postcards to send home, or maybe some sandwiches to take out with you for the day, go to Walgreens. What a great shop. You'll find branches all over the place. The one we used was a few yards up the road from the Chancellor. Go out of the door and turn left. We bought delicious pots of melon, sandwiches and boxed salads for just a few dollars. To sum up. The Chancellor is a good average hotel in an excellent location. It was our first visit to the city, so, to be fair, we have no other hotels with which to make a comparison. I'm not entirely sure that the characterful hotel descriptions are appropriate. Sadly it seemed a little lacking in character as far as we were concerned. Also, many hotels offer fridges in the rooms these days. Although ice was easily available, a fridge would have been very useful to keep our bottled water and snacks in as the room was pretty warm. I expect a rebuttal from the hotel manager regarding our opinion of the Hotel's shortcomings as he seems very pro-active on the Trip Advisor site. You can't fault him for that. But perhaps rather than going on the defence he might care to look accept this review as constructive criticism. We have stayed in far, far worse places than the Chancellor, but if we are lucky enough to visit San Francisco again, I suspect we'll look for another hotel.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Fabulous Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jeffh383", "ReviewID": "UR119282672", "Content": "Just wanted to say a big thank you to Wes the manager for having such a wonderful hotel.

I didn\u2019t like how the toilet paper was right against the wall on top of you. You have to actually twist your back around to get it. They should have placed it on the wall in front of you (near the towels) instead of on top of you. That was a disadvantage for me. We had stayed in a remodeled room but my bathtub didn\u2019t look like it was remodeled at all. The paint had peeled off and you will see paint holes in your tub. LOCATION: You will find lots of shopping places and restaurants right outside of Chancellor. Chancellor is near a lot of the popular attractions like: fisherman wharf, Chinatown, Lombard St, etc. The cable cars are right in front of the hotel so it\u2019s very convenient to go to these places. You can buy the Muni pass right there at the tour desk to try it out. Some of the farther places like the Golden Gate Park, GG Bridge, and Palace of Fine Arts were better off if you take your own car. The cable cars don\u2019t go to these places. Waiting for the Muni buses will waste a lot of time and they are always full. We drove instead of taking the buses and were glad we did. HOUSEKEEPING: Everyday cleaning lady always cleaned our room. She gave us extra soap and towels, which was nice of her. NOTE: There will be plenty of homeless people everywhere you go including right outside of Chancellor Hotel. But don\u2019t worry because Chancellor is located where there are lots of people around you so you won\u2019t be alone, kind of like being in New York. We even came prepared with pepper spray just in case, but never even use them. At night this place is pretty quiet, you could barely hear your neighbors or the street noise so I thought that was good about the quietness. Overall, a 4 rating was right for the Chancellor Hotel.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paradise, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, reasonably priced for SF\u201d", "Author": "MovieGuyParadise_CA", "ReviewID": "UR118548036", "Content": "A colleague and I stayed at the Chancellor on business recently, rooms are clean and comfortable.

Although, I did not hear noise from the neighboring rooms, the noise from outside the hotel was unbelievable. I checked the windows twice to make sure they were closed. It sounded like the street was running right through the room. The windows are not double paned and they are useless in blocking out noise. I felt like I should tip the street musicians on Union Square since it sounded like they were playing in my room. Powell Street is very busy and the noise did not diminish all night. There is no air conditioning and the evening was quite warm. I thought I would be saved by the ceiling fan. In theory, this would provide some cooling air and some white noise. However the fan was so poorly mounted to the ceiling, that even at the lowest speed it shook so badly I was certain it would fall out at any moment. Further it had a noisy and irregular rattle that added to the general cacophony. I would suggest that future guests insist on a room away from the street and check out the ceiling fan before settling in. Other than the noise, which as you can gather, was a big problem, I liked other aspects of the hotel.

We stayed there 3 nights and walked down to Powell and Market St. to catch the bus towards Embarcadero/Ferry Building. (We came back on BART to test the subway. TIP: cheaper to pay Bart $1.75 than the $2 bus fare.) We also got on the 38 bus that rides out west on Geary Ave. The central location also puts you in the heart of shopping action, many stores within a 3 block radius. We wanted to try Sears restaurant next door for breakfast but the line was too long, so we took out from Starbucks at the corner of Powell and Sutter. At the opposite corner, there is a drugstore to pick up beverages, snacks and other conveniences. Our two best meals were at Slanted Door (Ferry Building) and Empero Taste on 42nd St. near the Golden Gate Park. We tried Fino Ristorante in Andrews Hotel on Post Street \u2026 but it turned out not so fino. Back to the Chancellor Hotel. Overall, we were satisfied with the room for the price we paid. We had two twin beds in a very small room that also included a desk and chair, flatscreen tv on a bureau of drawers, and two more chairs around a small \u201ccoffee\u201d table. I was put off by the poor lighting in the bedroom; you have to turn on all the lights to see properly. Fortunately, with all lights on, it was adequate. I laughed at another reader\u2019s comment that the closet was larger than the bathroom. True! Actually, we had to keep closet closed at all times (losing the use of the full-length mirror on the door) because of the horrible odour. It smelled like 1864 in there. The bathroom could use some design tricks \u2013 one skimpy towel bar to carry six towels (2 sets of towels) was not wide enough to hang used towels\u2026 Why not install a pivoting towel bar on the wall? Only one short hook on the back of the door\u2026 Why not install a double hook? Hardly any counter space, certainly not for two people. The best thing in the room was the bed linen \u2013 pillows and duvet. Sadly, the same could not be said of the bed mattresses, which sagged in the middle. There is no a/c in the small room, so fortunately, we didn\u2019t need it. If you go in months hotter than Sept, you may want to find another hotel. Such a small room without a/c can be claustrophobic. In the hotel lobby, you can do web check-in for your flight boarding pass. Very handy. While not the best hotel experience, other hotels were charging $20-40 more per night for about the same quality.

I did quite a bit of research before deciding on The Chancellor. For the price it was perfect. There are lots of high end hotels around it, but for comfort and value this can't be beat. The hotel: very clean public areas, very friendly staff. My room was still being cleaned when I arrived so went and grabbed a bite and came back. Very friendly bellman retrieved my stored luggage and escorted me up to my room. NOTE: I was impressed with the elevators. There were only two and I was staying on the 13th floor, and they always arrived promptly and moved quickly. The rooms are small but comfortable and nicely appointed. I was traveling alone so the smallness didn't bother me as much as if I had had my wife along. The closet was HUGE. Lots of hanging space with safe, ironing board, umbrella and portable heater all inside with still lots of room for my luggage to sit on the luggage rack. I agree with several reviewers that you should request a high floor. It can get noisy, especially the cable car bell that dings constantly. And there is no A/C, but the open window and ceiling fan keep the room cool (and I was there during a SF \"heat wave\": 80 degrees! Location is fantastic. 1/2 block to Union Square with shopping and dining galore. I walked the neighborhood and found tons of restaurants, both chains and independent. Scala's is right across the street who's chefs were both on Top Chef. I just ordered a takeaway margarita pizza and it was delish. Transportation is easy to secure. The SF MUNI system is very efficient. While there is a cable car stop right out the hotel door, by the time it gets there from it's origin at the base of Powell street, it was always full. I did catch it early one morning around 8:30 and it wasn't bad. Walk about 2 blocks and you can catch a trolley car to Fisherman's Wharf. The trolley cars are old restored trolley cars from various cities. The city name is printed on the side. I rode one that was from Milan, Italy and still had signs in Italian. They literally are \"museums on wheels.\" And BART line is right there as well, which you can take to and from the airport. I also rode it into Oakland to go to a Rangers/A's game and it was great.

The hotel itself is right on Union Square so is good if you are wanting to get onto transport or tour buses. There are trams right out front and the tour buses all line up outside Macy's across the road. The hotel itself was nice - while we were there they were re-painting the lobby. The hotel style is sort of like the old victorian style buildings so don't expect modern or sleek at this hotel (not in a bad way). The roooms were tiny - probably the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in but I hear this is normal for San Francisco, especially if you're on a budget. The rooms were clean and tidy, the bed comfy and they had a pillow menu which we didn't use but I thought was a great idea. The bathroom was even smaller and the thing I found funny was that the closet was almost bigger than the bathroom. I would prefer a larger bathroom than some closet space as I just leave my stuff in my suitcase when I'm at hotels, but that's just my opinion. We only went to the bar for an hour or so one night and it's really small so it's not really designed for if you're looking for a night out. There was a market a couple of blocks away from the hotel where we were able to buy beer, toiletries and general stuff. We asked the concierge where we could eat - we aren't foodies so we generally look for averaged priced restaurants, nothing fancy. We were advised that there was a pizza place a few blocks away that was good. As we had spent the whole day travelling to San Fran we weren't looking forward to the hike up the hills to find this place and as we stood outside we noticed right next door a place called Sears Fine Food. After looking at the menu this is exactly the place we were looking for. Reasonably priced food - steaks, pasta, that kind of stuff. The food was great we ate here for dinner twice and breakfast twice. I have no idea why the concierge didn't tell us there was a restaurant right next door. We also used the concierge to book a hop on hop off tour and a city. We are usually the kind who likes to explore on our own but as we only had two days here we wanted to get the most out of the two days. The hop on hop off wasn't worth it. They were meant to loop around ever 15-30mins and we got off to look at the crookedest street and we waited over and hour for them to come back, in the end we rang the tour company to find out if they were going to come back for us! They did come but it was annoying because it took precious time from our schedule. In saying all this, this was nothing to do with the hotel itself. All in all a nice hotel and one of the cheaper around San Francisco.

Coming from NYC I am super paranoid about bedbugs and a lot of hotels in SF have bedbug reports, so the Chancellor gave me piece of mind in that regard. And the hotel itself was fine, but nothing too fancy. I also appreciated the fact they let me check in early (around 11 am), even though I hadn't requested early check in. But I must say I was NOT a fan of Union Sq this time around. Maybe it has gotten worse since my last trip, or maybe it was super crowded because it was a holiday weekend, but it was absolutely mobbed with tourists, to the point where it was difficult to walk on Powell St from the BART to the hotel.

The Chancellor fully discloses these limitations so it's not their fault when people don't read and get these amenities. The Chancellor does NOT have the following: (a) large rooms (thus no double double bed rooms for example), (b) large modern lobby, elevators or hallways, (c) air conditioning, (d) on-site gym or (e) pool. Air conditioning is virtually unnecessary in San Francisco and even during 90 degree plus days (and we once stayed during such a summer \"heat wave\"), the hotel was very comfortably cool. If that isn't sufficient, each room does have ceiling fans.

I had emailed the hotel and requested a room on a higher floor on the backside as some reviews said it could be very noisy. We had room 1505 and I had no problems with noise. There aren't rooms on either side so we didn't hear anyone else at any time. The only noise we heard was from the ice machine which was on the other side of the shower.

Our waiter was hilarious and the food was really good, and a little cheaper than other restaurants in the same area. For the price the hotel was perfect, the hotel was awesome the staff was great, not single complaints here! It was really nice to have the pillow menu, they have... 8, 10? on the menu that you can chose from, that was a really nice added touch. A few recommendations... The hotel is walking distance to the Wharf, Ferry Terminal and all the touristy spots. It took maybe.. 30? 45? minutes to walk to the Wharf, but is a beautiful walk. You can walk through China Town to avoid the hills if that's easier for you. When you arrive you get a package, there's a $5 off coupon for Bike and Roll bike rentals. We rented our bikes from there for $27, other places were a bit more expensive ( up to $35 at some places) I would definately recommend biking from the Wharf over the Golden Gate Bridge and into Sausilito (sp?) The ride isn't to bad ( a few hills ) and beautiful views of the bridge along the way. Riding over the bridge is just something you need to do, it's a great fun experience and a beautiful ride ( my bf even proposed while we were stopped on the bridge :) ) I would also recommend walking to the Ferry Terminal and buying fresh bread and cheese and having a picnic where you can find a spot. The ferry Terminal has awesome shops and restaurants that you shouldn't miss. All in all, San Francisco is a wonderful city and the Chancellor Hotel is the perfect place to spend your vacation.

The staff was always friendly and extraordinarily helpful (particularly the bellman!), and yes the cookies were in the lobby and they were warm. No, there is no air conditioning, but a nice ceiling fan made up for that along with windows that open wide to the street below, plus August is usually cool with foggy days and evening. While I enjoyed the sounds of the city late into the evening, my husband was frustrated with the noise and had trouble sleeping. I've read that a request for a high floor on the back of the hotel may eliminate this problem. The room was appealing with a comfortable bed, and the candy dish made the kids smile. The hotel is lined with old fashioned fire escapes and I was heard to quickly proclaim \"NO!\" as my 12 year old daughter asked \"Is that our balcony and can I go out there??\" Luques was marginal... pricey for Dennys-like fare, I would not return. My recommendation is to try Honey Honey Crepery just down the street and around the corner. Charming hotel at a wonderful price in a very desirable location. My hotel of choice for trips to SF!

Check in went pretty smooth, but I must say we got lucky I believe because I was able to get a parking spot pretty quick for the unloading of our bags, this could be a issue for sure if you had to circle block. I drove to the parking garage myself easy just around corner and from there its a valet service so if you have a valet key, bring it.

Check out was easy but again I recommend a early start on the day if driving as traffic heading out of town is minimal, and be warned depending on what time you drive into S.F. it can be very busy at tool booth, so plan accordingly.

The thin walls weren't a problem, either. I'm very irritated by noise coming from other rooms, and though now and then at The Chancellor I could hear a snippet of conversation from the neighbors, it wasn't enough to bug me.

Allysia and Rorie made fabulous cocktails and were always a joy to converse with during televised sports events. Mao and Yesmie were terrific hosts in the restaurant and helped us get each day off to a great start. Our accomodations were immaculate, a testimonial to the great housekeeping staff of the Chancellor. They always went over and beyond expectations to make sure we never lacked for anything.

Make sure you go to Chinatown while you are there. And, of course, don't forget Alcatraz. We had breakfast one morning at Luques, and it was great.

Or is it on Powell Street? Well we'll forgive them that as it is within spitting distance of the square, which is viewable from some rooms on the square side. We pulled up outside and was immediately set upon by the Concierge who informed us that the SFPD do not take kindly to cars parking against the flow of traffic, so keep this in mind if you have bags to drop off. We still unloaded and I disappeared to Hertz to drop the car off. We were booked in to the 17th floor on the side facing parallel to Union Square but a the next street over, if that makes sense? So we could see Union Square, but only by standing at at angle at the window. The window is fixed to only open a maximum of 6 or so inches, which is clearly a safety and security precaution as there was a metal fire escape directly outside. The fire escape did block our view somewhat, but then do you want to get out if the worst should happen? On Union Square there is a trumpet player who starts up around 6pm and plays till 11.30pm'ish, if he isn't your thing you may find yourself having to shut the window and the room can get a little stuffy as there's no air conditioning. The traffic noise can be loud, but that is to be expected. The rooms are small, at least ours was. They are very tastefully decorated, with classy furniture adorning almost every bit of free space, this did make the already small room feel very cramped. The bathroom was also very small with the toilet being immediately to the side of the door so you had to edge round it to get the sink and the bath, which housed the shower. Once you were in the standing space in front of the sink, there was no room for anyone else in the bathroom. The shower was good, but the head was loose, so the shower made a strange whining noise occasionally, though no great cause for concern. The saving grace for the room was the fact that there was a separate closet space, so we could stick out cases and hang our clothes out of the way. There was no fridge in the room, which was a bit of a disappointed. There were ice machines on every floor opposite the elevators, accompanying the smallest ice bucket I've seen! We used the plastic bin in the room and filled it with ice to chill the wine! The hotel uses the Lodgenet system for it's TV and film entertainment. This comes with 20 or so TV channels and other pay services like internet, films and premium TV. Be wary of the films, they are expensive and are automatically billed to your room, it is fairly obvious whereabouts the billing comes in, but if you click fast you may skip it. The films are $17 + tax, personally I would go to the cinema, but if you fancy a lazy night it's good to know they are there. With regards to the billing, we noticed that the Chancellor had put an authorization on our credit card, initially for $72 (odd amount) and then subsequent amounts of $50 and $32. Much of this was refunded, but just to make you aware of it. I think American hotels do this to covers incidentals, but they do not inform you they are going to do it, so do not be surprised if you see it on your online credit card statement. The location of the Chancellor can only be beaten by the much more expensive hotels situated directly on Union Square. It is ideal for San Fransisco's main shopping area and restaurants. The cable car turnaround is only 3 blocks at the end of Powell and runs all the way to Fishermans Wharf (Powell to Mason?). The one problem you may have with the cable car is the fact that it is such a tourist attraction. Getting onto a car at the stops adjacent to the hotel can be difficult as the cars are generally full from the turnaround. Sometimes it can be better to walk a few blocks to the nearest popular stop at the top of the hill where some people will get off, or be willing to wait at the turnaround, which can be extremely busy. Another option for getting around is the open top buses which make Union Square one of their stops. For $26 (I think - sorry can't remember exactly!) per person you can get a 2 day pass which allows you to get on and off at various stops around the city and they run very regularly (every 30 mins or so). Using this you can hop on the bus then get off near to a cable car stop where it will be less busy. We didn't use the facilities of the Chancellor much due to the amount of diners, bars and shops nearby. On the days that we were tired we ordered pizza from Uncle Vitos (2 blocks up from the hotel, but they will deliver) and got snacks from the ABC stores which is on the end of the same block. There is coffee every morning in the lobby next to the small bar and there are internet PC's next to the reception desk. Outside the hotel it is a very safe area, with many concierge staff lining the streets from other hotels and often there is an armed security guard outside the Bank of America branch, which is just a few doors up, so we never have any problems near to the hotel. A few blocks of walking brings you into contact the San Francisco's many homeless and you either need to steel yourself and avoid eye contact or drop a dollar or so and walk on. Some will politely thank you, others clearly have problems and are a little concern. A recommendation for breakfasts and lunch is Loris diner which is 1 block away going up hill. Very nice. All in all a nice hotel and highly recommended.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Killeen, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay at union square.\u201d", "Author": "Jerald475", "ReviewID": "UR114580508", "Content": "Our stay here has been great.

My 80 year old father joined us for the last night. Everything about it was good, from the check in to the rooms and most definitely the location. In fact we raved about it to fellow passangers on the cruise. We decided to stay the one night back in San Francisco after the cruise before flying out to Honolulu and booked it through the hotel. However...................... we arrived at 9.30 am to a very surly welcome by the two gentlemen on reception. I won't mention their names but I am sure if the management is remotely interested they can check on 14th June. The rooms were not ready which is absolutaly fine as we did not expect them to be. We left our luggage in storage. We returned at 11am as we were to meet some old friends there. My father asked if there was any indication of when rooms would be ready and was told again, \"check in is at 3pm\" and that maybe, maybe by 2pm. We returned at 2pm as Dad was flagging. He was given his room but in a rude and unhelpful manner. We asked for our bags as there was nobody to get them despite the two gents and no other customers just 1 meter from luggage room. Eventually I asked them to call the porter who came. We helped Dad up to his room and returned to the lobby. Now this is not a large area. We sat directly opposite the front desk on one of the two sofas, used the computer behind the desk and waited, and waited. These two gents knew we we were waiting to check in. People came and went, a lot of laughter and chitchat went on. Eventually the shift changed. They avoided any eye contact. There was no hand over, it seemed, to oncoming shift. Eventually at 1545 I approached one of the the new team and she seemed surprised and said the room had been ready for sometime and was an upgrade to a suite. I was very annoyed as I got the distinct impression that this was done on purpose. We were tired and fed up and I do realise that the rooms have to be cleaned ect but it was like checking into two different hotels on each visit.

We had booked several tours before we went but we feel that if we go again we could quite happiily rely on the Tour desk to arrange everything for us. The location of the hotel was excellent. Right on Union Square and within easy reach of cable cars, MUNI buses and the subway. There are a number of restaurants and fast food places in the immediate vicinity depending on what takes your fancy. Shopping is great with Macy's, Levi's, Apple and the Westfield Centre (Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, etc) all within a short walking distance. The free tea/coffee/apples &cookies available in the lobby was great and real plus over other hotels that make you rely on over priced room service. We ate at Lucques restaurant on the ground floor a few times during our stay and were very pleased with the service and the quality of food. Our server Mao was extremely amusing and welcoming and we felt totally relaxed and ready for the day ahead. The rooms whilst small by American standards aren't as bad as some reviewers have claimed, maybe they have a larger bone structure! We've stayed at a number of hotels over the years both in the UK and abroad and have had rooms of equal size to the Chancellor and in fact some smaller. For us the hotel room is a base of operations, some where to lay our weary heads at the end of a days exploration and the Chancellor easily met these requirements. The Hotel has a new app which was useful for checking in earlier as well as finding out about offers and menus for the restaurant. There was also some useful tourist advice that was provided and I'm sure this will be built upon in the future. One thing I would suggest is a facility to contact the Tour desk prior to arrival as this would have been very useful for us, it would also have saved us some money on airport shuttles as the price we were quoted by the tour desk was about $20 cheaper than what we paid online despite using the company (Lorries) recommended by the Hotel in an email. Without doubt we were very pleased with the Chancellor and it went along way toward making our holiday truly memorable. We will recommend this hotel to all friends and family who consider a holiday to San Francisco and will definitely stay there when we return. Finally, the wifi facilities offered were great and allowed me to upload my photo albums each night as well as check my emails etc. There is a secure key provided in your room and I felt safe connecting to this network especially when I was also able to pick up other nearby hotel networks that seemed to offer no protection.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cSan Francisco Gem\u201d", "Author": "HollywoodUk", "ReviewID": "UR114007922", "Content": "This hotel was not particularly imposing on arrival, but the staff were fantastic.

A special thank you to the Wes Taylor, GM, who took the time to personally answer my questions, and made a special holiday even more memorable. Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Taylor. There is absolutely nothing that needs improved upon from my our experience. The service is fantastic, the food tasty, the rooms clean and comfortable, and last, but not least, location, location, location!

So I did, easily, on-line. In the meantime, a relative who visited SF 30 years ago had great memories of a hotel and went to check out which it was. You guessed it - this one. I'm sure a lot has changed since. Including the rubber duckie, which now carries an I-pad and cell phone. But a lot hasn't changed - it's clean, friendly, efficient and well-run. Our preferences for a quiet room were fulfilled perfectly - top floor, in the back. No view but good protection from street noise. Not perfect, but you'll never get country quiet in the middle of a city. Actually, we could hear the clang of the cable car over the general (low-level) noise. This was cool - a frequent reminder of the great city we were in. Yes, the room was small, especially the bathroom. However it somehow didn't feel that small. My wife loved the mirrors all over the bathroom (including a magnifying one) that made it feel bigger, but also was great for checking out her hair from all angles. And the room itself seemed to be set up quite efficiently. Maybe the high ceilings also give a sense of more space. Didn't hear any noise from other rooms or the hallway. But then, things were built a lot more solidly a century ago. One neat thing you should take advantage of: they have a big selection of specialty pillows you can try out for free. A big surprise was the restaurant. We had an excellent breakfast there a couple of times. This is a city of good food, albeit a bit pricey. The hotel restaurant gave quick service with quality food at prices below the other nearby places. We stayed seven nights, giving us time to check out the ins and outs of SF, not just the major tourist trophies. In that time, we could not think of a single complaint in the Chancellor.

My luggage didn't make our connecting flight, but when we returned to the hotel that evening, my suitcase had been delivered and hotel staff put it in our room -- it was waiting for me there instead of downstairs at the front desk. Front desk was professional, helpful and competent. Soda, water and snacks were available for a reasonable price, and there were ice machines on every floor. The hotel feels classy and refined, with lots of brass and glass. Classic and tastefully understated decor. I rearranged the chairs in the room to give us a little more space -- but everyone says the rooms in SF are always tiny. Our room was small but not tiny. The bed was very comfortable. I didn't realize that they didn't have king beds, but the queen room we had (for a very reasonable price) was more than adequate. Great mattress and pillows. We didn't feel cramped. We are average sized people. If you are larger, you could request room with two twin beds and possibly put them together for a king? The bathroom was small, but very nice, and had a HUGE tub (no jets). They provided bath salts and I took advantage of a nice hot bath after we returned from walking all over SF for most of the day. No A/C, but we didn't need it. You can request a high or low floor, and you can request a \"quiet\" room. We were on the 10th floor on the back. It was perfect. We had a great view and no noise from the busy street on the front. This hotel is on the cable car line which runs up and down Powell Street. Very convenient. Just walk outside and there is a cable car stop -- you're on your way. The breakfast offered in this hotel was outstanding. Lots of great choices. I had New Orleans Eggs Benedict -- fantastic and fresh! Good coffee and service. Affordable and reasonable. Next door to Sears Inn, which has great swedish pancakes. Easy to get a cab to and from this hotel -- cabbies knew where our hotel was just by providing the name. I can't think of anything negative about this hotel. A great place to stay: great room, happy environment, very convenient location, safe area, close to great restaurants, stores and nightlife. All at a very reasonable price.

She also helped us source some wines they sell from a local off licence, even calling ahead to ensure they had them in stock. She was fantastic!! So much so that on our last night we enjoyed her company so much we did not even make it to dinner!! Bell Boys also great, giving us more advice and help. Rooms were great, ample room for us, but I know that in the US you probably may think them a little small, bathrooms a little tired but quite possibly the best shower I have ever had. Little touches in the hotel, make this stick out....umbrella in room, sweets in room, pillow menu and the tea and coffee was great to get you going in the morning. Be sure to pick up all the local maps, they have great discount vouchers on the back, including the one behind the bell boys desk has a 2 for 1 wine tasting voucher at the wine collective at Fishermans wharf.

Book first, and ask questions later (seriously). Just to clarify, I got this room for a fantastic rate ($75 on Expedia.ca), so my review is coming from the perspective of someone who paid a very decent price for this hotel. PROS: +Awesome location: Everyone mentions this in their review, but I'd just like to reiterate what an amazing location the Chancellor is located in. Close to EVERYTHING, including Union Square, cable cars, food, shopping etc. You seriously can't do any better than this when it comes to staying in SF (Fisherman's Wharf is only about 10-15 mins away on the cable car) +Very, very clean: The housekeeping staff does a great job cleaning your room, and overall the room was very well maintained. (although the bathroom could use a slight refresh; no biggie though) The housekeeping/maintenance staff are also EXCEPTIONALLY nice. Can't say enough good things about them. Very polite, asked me how my day was etc., and were SUPER fast when I had a few things that I needed (phone wasn't working, requested a fridge and white noise machine) +The Pillow Menu: The Chancellor offers a \"pillow menu\" which has at least 8-10 different pillow types you can request - including pillows I had never even seen or heard of before. Definitely worth trying out if you're staying for a few days or longer +Not noisy (really!): A few reviews mentioned that the rooms tended to get a bit noisy at night time with all the traffic and all that. I slept with the windows open, and my room was facing Powell Street - and I slept like a baby (although maybe my 18+ hour sightseeing days kind of exhausted me as well!). A little tip: the hotel has some white noise machines which really help, so don't hesitate to request one of those. +Other pluses: A few things which I found useful: 1) There isn't really a gym in the hotel, but they do have an agreement of some sort with a full-sized gym (\"Club One Health Club\" if you want to Google it). It's literally a 5 minute walk away from the hotel (Mason & Sutter), and it has everything you'd need. I think it's a great idea, since most hotel \"gyms\" usually consist of 2 treadmills and a few free weights. This gym was great, and the staff there is nice too (tip: take your hotel card & one piece of ID with you...lockers w/ locks are provided) 2) Safe is included, as well a heater (not really sure when you'd need that in San Fran!) Oh, and including an umbrella in the closet was also a nice touch. 3) Mini-fridges aren't really included in the room, but you can request one without any problem 4) Great channel selection on TV: Didn't watch much of it, but they had all the useful channels (at least to me), including CNBC, CNN, ESPN and all the other good stuff. 5) Tour desk is staffed with a great lady (sorry, forgot her name!), but you can book everything through her (or at least get some info) - and muni passes are available from her (DEFINITELY get the muni pass if you're staying for longer than a day or two) 6) Can't forget the almost-famous rubber ducky in the bathroom ;) DEBATABLE: +/- Room temp: I went during January, and the weather was picture perfect (22-24 degrees Celsius, sunny all day). However, I DID notice the room was slightly warm during the afternoons when I came back to change clothes or something. There is a ceiling fan which helps, and you can open the window all the way. But honestly, I don't know how bearable the room would be in the heat of the summer. The hotel DOES NOT have A/C. Not really a big deal, but if you're going in the summer and absolutely NEED the A/C, then you may need to think twice. CONS: -Wi-fi Internet: Wasn't AWFUL, but it wasn't very speedy during many times. For some odd reason, the best wi-fi reception I got was in the bathroom (don't ask me how I know this :P) -Front desk staff: The staff is \"pleasant\", but honestly I did not find them particularly engaging. There was one particular woman at the front desk in the afternoon who was pretty stiff. I asked her how to get to the gym, and she rolled her eyes at me like I was bothering her or something. And when I got to the gym, the guy at the front desk said that guests need to bring a piece of ID with them - something the lady at the front desk didn't mention (luckily the staff at the gym are very nice, so I was able to slip through). Another gentleman at the desk, who I think is the supervisor/manager (young-ish looking guy) also didn't really seem to go out of his way to engage with people at the front desk. Not really a big deal, but kind of blemished the otherwise great hotel OVERALL: The hotel definitely made my stay in San Fran (which is an awesome city, btw) a bit more memorable and tension-free overall. Apart from the few slightly negative \"cons\", I wouldn't ever hesitate to give this hotel a second chance or to recommend it to someone else. I just hope the front desk staff can be a bit more consistent in their customer service so they don't tarnish the reputation of this otherwise amazing hotel.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat value hotel in excellent location\u201d", "Author": "dopeschool", "ReviewID": "UR96194969", "Content": "We just stayed at the Chancellor Hotel for three days while on business in San Francisco and could not have been more pleased with our stay.

Attractions.........Alcatraz Island tour is a must at $ 28 pp.pls book in advance depending on the time of the year.We booked a day before and was available because we were out of season. Golden Gate Bridge is also worth a visit.One can use travel pass to reach the Golden Gate by bus or Cable car and then walk on the bridge.Lovely view of SF city. and Alcatraz island.

Any time you leave home, you\u2019re bound to run into some hassles, but the Chancellor does an excellent job of minimizing those hassles to the point of invisibility. I don\u2019t really trust any of the negative reviews I\u2019ve read; I think these people had a bad day or just have an axe to grind. I corresponded a little with Wes Tyler, the Chancellor\u2019s manager, after we made our reservation. He was extremely pleasant and, when we arrived, our room was exactly as we requested. We had a room on the front of the 13th floor; we didn\u2019t realize until the 3rd day that the window was slightly open, but we had no trouble with noise before that and no trouble with temperature after closing it. The ceiling fan was more than sufficient for cooling (and I\u2019m extremely sensitive to heat when sleeping). One caveat: because of the size of the bathroom and the placement of the toilet, larger persons might have difficulty getting comfortable on it. I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d, 275 lbs, and I felt a little like a bear on a tricycle. It\u2019s not a complaint, really; more just something to be aware of. In addition, since this is in the news quite a bit at the moment, I am happy to report that there are NO BEDBUGS! A sign in the room asks that tips for the housekeeping staff not be left in the rooms; however, tips are welcome (and deserved), but the front desk will provide an envelope for your tip at checkout if you ask for it. We didn\u2019t try the hotel restaurant, but we had three good meals at Sears\u2019 Fine Food, next door, and one at Lori\u2019s Diner, half a block up Powell. The cookies always available in the lobby are excellent, especially the oatmeal-cranberry cookies. The Tour Desk in the lobby sells Muni passes and can arrange rental cars and transport to and from the airport.

Great hotel and staff, we were so very pleased. First, the location is perfect---perfect for transportation, shopping, dining and within walking distance to Chinatown. The hotel is located on Union Square on Powell St.. where the cable cars run directly in front of the hotel. You can't beat the location as all the high end stores are within a short walking distance of the lobby. Sak's Fifth Ave. is directly across the street, Border's Books next door, Sear's Famous Restaurant is located next door as well, Walgreens at the corner, Lorie's Dinner. Around Union Square are Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Levi, Prada, Tiffany, Coach and many more high end and casual stores. Restaurants both casual and upscale are within a very short walk. Secondly, transportation is very good. You can purchase a Muni pass at the tour desk in the lobby and catch the cable car at Union Square, or walk a couple of blocks to catch the BART, etc. and other public transportation options. You can take the cable car directly to Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf & to Lombard St. Lastly, the hotel is very charming, very clean, well kept, and has nice furnishings. The rooms and baths are small, but understand that this is part of the charm of a San Fran turn-of-the-century hotel. The rooms have all that you need, desk, chair, two sitting chairs with table, silver service and glasses, flat screen TV, dresser and nice comfortable beds with good bedding. There is a pillow menu. The bath is small but it has tub, shower and nice items such as bubble bath, cotton balls, Q-tips, shampoo & soaps. The shower has soft water. No AC, but not needed with ceiling fan and windows which allowed fresh air---it was fine, not a concern. A nice sized walk-in closet, dressing room with full size mirror, safe, extra pillows and blankets. The closet was perfect for setting up luggage and kept the room mess free. Located in the lobby, the Tour Desk is very helpful, managed by a lady named Susie who is knowledgable and helpful. Also, the hotel restaurant was very good, as we ate breakast and one lunch there. Food was good and wait staff was polite and friendly. We ate lunch on our last day, extremely tasty and good quality, waiter name was Mao and the service was excellent---to match the food. The receptionl staff was friendly as well. There is a business center/computer in the lobby. We were very pleased with the hotel and the service.

As we were flying domestically (and we're from the UK) the Hotel also stored our main luggage for us so we could pack carry on bags for the internal flights (Thus saving us around $120 we would have paid by checking luggage into the hold). We asked for the quieter rooms at the back and we were given these on all 4 occasions. There is very little difference between the rooms. The rooms are a good size and include a desk and chair and also 2 other chairs and a table so not as small as you would imagine reading some other reviews! The bathroom is small but is actually bigger than our one at home so no complaints there! The bathrooms were clean and practical with hot and cold running water and a powerfull flushing toilet. The shower is over the bath and is perfectly functional and does what it should do!! We arrived on a Thursday when it was a hot day (25C - double it and add 30 for F !!) and found the room overnight to not be unbearably hot with the windows open and the ceiling fan on we had a good nights sleep! Jetlag was our biggest problem sleeping - but can't blame the hotel for that can I? We had breakfast quite a few times in the hotel and weren't disappointed. We also had \"Bar\" food in the evenings during happy hour and again the food was very good! All in all we thoroughly recommend this hotel, I was going to mark it down 1 star as I wanted to see Wes the General manager (Love his replies to other reviews) but luckily saw him walk past me in the lobby on our last day - he didn't notice me but great to put a face to the comments!! This hotel is bordering on a 4 star, in fact I would give it 3.75 rating if there was such a thing, if you are looking for a high standard, clean, execellent location and value for money hotel then this is the place for you, and its a breath of fresh air from the sterile chain hotels.

She was so helpful, and gave us great advice on what to see & what not to see. The bar is small but fun, we met some other travellers there and had great fun. The main enterance is not great, could do with a re-furb but the room was so cosy clean and very well decorated. There was complementary coffee/tea and cake in the afternoon. The breakfast was excellent but at an additional charge, but seeing that we paid \u20ac35 per person per night in a city center location we were not complaining. There was a Irish guy at Reception who was really friendly, Rory is his name. Great help. Overall, for comfort, location and price this hotel is a must to stay in San Fransisco. You only sleep there and the beds if we could would have taken them with us... they were so cosy. Many thanks to all the staff there for making our stay so memorable.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a city break - super comfy room - great location\u201d", "Author": "LondonTravellerVW", "ReviewID": "UR82191233", "Content": "This hotel is perfect for a city break when you want a little more comfort and luxury during your stay. Our room was spacious with a separate closet where we could store all our luggage.

Also close to lots of restaurants. The bathroom is pretty basic (not as nice as the room itself) but it has everything you need and was very clean. The brief interactions we did have with staff were a little odd but they didn't disturb us and when we requested the pillows for example, they delivered them quickly. The only aspect of the room I didn't like was the proximity to the air conditioning/ kitchen unit down below. Our room was on the back so we didn't get any street noise but the humming from the machines did initially disappoint me - I was looking forward to a returning to a peaceful room after a day out in SFS. I have to admit after the first day, I didn't notice the sound any more and I am sensitive to noise. They also supplied us with a white noise machine. This made lovely rain sounds which meant I could fall asleep without any worries. I do think they should include a breakfast in the price but for convenience sake, there is a paid restaurant downstairs in the hotel lobby. I wouldn't recommend this unless you just want a quick refuel. It's a depressing place to start your day. For a tasty breakfast you can head just next door to Sear's fine foods which has a great atmosphere and much much yummier food.

We only got it out twice during our 5 night stay. Location-simply cannot be beat. Right in Union Square, across the street from a small park, and the major shopping venues like Macy's.

Our room: we were on the 15th floor, which I had requested. It was very quiet, we NEVER heard anyone in the hotel close a door, walk by our room, nothing. The rooms are small. But the huge walk in closet more than makes up for it. We had a queen bed, which was comfortable. The linens are very decent. We asked for and got our extra pillows. They have a menu of like 15 different kinds of pillows. 2 nightstands, each with its own lamp. Alarm clock/radio. One drawer in each nightstand, as well as an open area under. Ceiling fan. Two chairs, and though they are OK, not the kind you are going to stretch out in and be comfortable for any length of time. A table between them with a silver tray with a dish of candy (peppermints, etc.), an ice bucket. Very nice desk with chair. A couple drawers in desk. 3 drawer dresser with TV on top. The closet: LOL. Loved it. Safe and iron/board in here. 2 luggage racks. Plenty of hangars, ask for more if needed. Extra blanket and pillow on top shelf, which extends length of closet. More than enough room to hang all your clothes (bring some of your plastic hangars from home), stash your several pieces of luggage, dirty clothes bag and still move around. I stashed all my shoes on the top of the safe, they were out of the way and off the floor. Umbrella provided. Full length mirror, I think.....! Bathroom: Deep, old cast iron soaking tub with your very own yellow rubber ducky. You can take this home, they want you too. :) Good water pressure, several different types of flow. One sink, large mirror, small shelf. Toilet. Wastpaper basket. Very nice towels. Nice bath products. Hairdryer. Everything worked well-lights, plugs, TV, remote, hairdryer, safe, alarm, locks, water pressure, iron. Like many if not most hotels in SF, this one does not have A/C. It was warm in our room most of the time, though we had the ceiling fan going all the time. We opened the window, which opens a whole 3 inches or so. Now I do not know if you are suppose to, but guessing not, we got the bolt out and were able to open the window all the way. We felt much better with the air blowing in. We also bought a small fan at Walgreen's, though I sleep with a fan on, and it was originally meant for that purpose, but had it going all the time, also. Though we heard all the city noises with the open window, we didn't mind. We closed it when we went to sleep and when we were gone, of course. You can still hear sirens, loud yelling from the street, whistles, and maybe the Cable Car clanging, but it never bothered us and I am a very light sleeper. We loved our view of Macy's and the park. Checkout was just as quick and friendly. The concierge is nice and helpful, though we got some short answers from her. We chose a different tour company than she suggested and she didn't say one word about them. I was left stammering some sentence, I felt like I had to appease her. But I just thanked her and walked away. We took one taxi, and they had it arrive in 5 minutes. We never used the evening bar area. We did get coffee though, and it was OK. They also had hot chocolate if I remember correctly and it was very good. Very happy with our stay, and with the price paid.

They have no a/c, which is standard in this part of the country, so you sleep with the windows open. It was perfectly comfortable (we didn't see the FIRST insect, it was cool and breezy)...but it was noisy, because we had a room fronting Powell Street, directly off of Union Square. If you stay here, and you certainly should, just ask for a room on the back side of the building, away from the street. Aside from that, our only complaint was the size of the rooms - since its just two of us, and didn't spend a lot of time in the room, it was just fine. The bathrooms are VERY small though - the kind where you almost have to stand in the shower to shut the door, because the toilet is in the way. Again - just fine for us. And we're average sized people. But they're definitely smaller than average (its a historic property). Room was terribly comfortable though - and their pillow menu was really cool. We sampled two, and I may even buy myself a buckwheat pillow now. I slept like a baby. Very comfortable bed as well (including the standard pillows). They had lovely relaxing bath salts along with the standard shampoos, etc. SPECIAL TOUCHES: The front desk staff routinely gave us easy bus directions and great maps to help us out. We also arrived on our anniversary, and the hotel left a bottle of sparkling wine (Napa) and some truffles in our room. The cable cars stop DIRECTLY in front of the hotel, and the F-Tram line is a few blocks down the street. We used the city bus system mostly, and several lines stop within a block or two. Its location on Union Square makes it an easy crossroads for transportation and shopping is great. Several restaurants in the area as well. We didn't eat the hotel restaurant though, so can't include that in the review. Hint - there's a Borders a few doors down, and they have hot breakfast sandwiches and lovely pastries with their Seattle's Best coffee, for much less money than the local restaurants. In sum - ask for a room away from the street (and a high floor perhaps), and if you don't mind a smaller room, this makes a GREAT home base for exploring San Francisco.

Always nice to get off to a good start. CHECK IN - smooth and efficient and we were allocated a room on a high floor as requested. Reception staff were very helpful and very happy to offer directions when asked. The only irritation was with the tour booth lady who jumped on us before we could get to the lift and thrust leaflets in my hand trying to sell tours/bus passes etc. I told her we'd take a look, but had already booked a couple of tours online to which she made a face and promptly grabbed them back. Quite amusing really, but it did put us off approaching her again for a couple of days, although I must add that when we did she very efficiently arranged our transfer back to the airport. ROOM - our room was very well furnished, spotlessly clean the whole visit and the jar of sweets was a nice touch. As mentioned in many previous reviews they're not huge, but considering the extremely reasonable cost not really a problem. We were only staying for 4 nights so didn't want to fully unpack and therefore found it quite difficult to fit both cases in, but again a minor problem which we managed to get round. The bathroom was very small and did feel a bit cramped, but again spotlessly clean and for a short stay quite adequate. FOOD - we only ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast on our third day as we were usually out early for tours. The food was very well cooked and reasonably priced, but the waiter although very efficient wasn't particular friendly - just going through the motions would be the best description. LOCATION - very central with easy access to the cable cars. Particularly good if you like to shop - not really our thing so no reflection on the hotel, but we would probably opt to stay on the Embarcadero if we visit again.

The location is excellent - cable car exactly opposite the hotel, and not only that but you are about 30 seconds away from union square so if you are a tourist you can easily catch any of the hop on hop off bus tours, which for anyone staying in the city for a week or more may find it useful to know that for about 40 dollars you can go uptown or to fisher mans wharf over and over again. The main benefit of this is that you won't need to waste money on taxis. The tour guide gave us a whole week of travel and we literally covered the city centre,north beach, china town, fishermans wharf, golden gate bridge, sausilito, golden gate park and more for two people. Basic advice? Ask for a bargain and you will get one. Hotel room was excellent. Emailed manager to ask for room high up and it was provided. Don't know why some reviews say the room was so small. Our room had a queen size bed, large tv, walk in wardrobe, drawers, two chairs and a table, as well as a full en suite bathroom. We got all of that at a bargain rate of just over 110 dollars plus tax per night. I don't know anywhere you can get that much for so little. Hotel is so clean. Annie and Maria cleaned our room to a very high standard and the entire hotel is immaculate so it gets a ten out of ten for that. Breakfast was fairly good with excellent service every day and again all food served quickly and everything was very, very clean. Susan on the tour desk / gift shop was very helpful and efficient and the front desk staff were good too. Free coffee and cookies as well as newspapers available in lobby every day, Susan always willing to assist with everything and this is a hotel I would most definitely be staying in again. Susan arranged bike tours as well as airport transfers for us so again worth her weight in gold. Bad points - nothing for the price. Not one bad remark I can say about this great little hotel to be honest. Suggestions - might be nice if coffee was available in the room - that's the only suggestion but it's not the end of the world as it is provided, but it's the only thing I felt would be a convenience. Other than that? This is a brilliant hotel and yes it's not the ritz but if you want clean, stylish with good service, a central location and something above and beyond a soul less travel lodge this is the best hotel of it's kind in San Francisco.

My husband is very tall but was still comfortable in the small room. Our closet was big enough to hold both of our duffle bags leaving the room free for us to walk around the bed.

If you like to run laps around your room, this is not the hotel for you. The building itself is old. The elevators are old and slow, but the Chancellor provides the sort of mix of modernity and timeless elegance that really appeals to me. The furniture in our room was new and modern, but maintained the aesthetic of a European boutique hotel. The mattress and linens were top-of-the-line. I always travel with my own pillow, but the pillows were so nice that I was tempted to sneak one of them into my pillowcase, on the way out. There was even a request sheet for specialty pillows (i.e. a body pillow or between-the-knees pillow). We didn't need any, but I wish we had tried them anyway. The bathroom was tiny and a bit older looking, but very clean and functional. Only one person will fit in there at a time and there isn't a huge counter to pile your toiletries on. Again, if you and your companion need a lot of space, or you're not fond of pedestal sinks, look elsewhere. High-end toiletries are provided and the rubber duck was a thoughtful touch. The location is very central. I would NOT recommend driving around San Francisco, but you can travel just about anywhere from Union Square, by Muni. We picked up a 3-day pass for $20 and it took us everywhere we needed to go. The Caltrain station to San Jose (where we went for a hockey game) was a 10-minute ride away. On a nice day, you can walk to a number of spots, if you're willing to dedicate a few hours to meandering around. One thing of note about Union Square is that it is in the downtown core. There were homeless people roaming around the neighborhood and one perched directly outside the hotel door, on one occasion, but I did not feel unsafe at any time. No in-room coffeemakers were provided, but complimentary self-serve coffee and tea were available in the lobby. Valet parking is offered by a third-party company, for a reasonable fee (given the location). If you need your car for any reason, you must provide 20-30 minutes advance notice so the hotel can contact the valet company. Keep this in mind, if you're on a tight schedule when checking out, or if you're the sort of person who accidentally leaves things in your car, like we did. Two things prevented my stay at the Chancellor from being 100% perfect. Firstly, the Wifi was terrible. We planned on going online to look up addresses and transit schedules, but it was often too slow to be functional. On the bright side, it was complimentary, so at least we weren't paying extra to be frustrated. We were also on the very top floor. Depending on the location of the hub, I wouldn't be surprised if the connection would have been better elsewhere in the hotel. There also wasn't a fridge in the room. Fortunately, we were traveling with a cooler and there was an ice machine nearby. If you enjoy having snacks in your room, this is something to note. All in all, I thought the value was fabulous, for the area and the quality of the accommodations.

Rooms were very clean, cosy and the staff was great. There is a concierge service in the lobby run by a lady that was very helpful, even got us a limo to the airport for the price of a town car.

You are also within easy walking distance for great shopping (which may or may not be a good thing). The hotel was clean, the staff were helpful, unnecessary but nice touches in the room (such as the rubber duckie, jar of lollies and biscuits) and the room size was more than adequate for two of us particularly when we were only sleeping there. Speaking of sleep - the Chancellor has the most comfortable bed and pillows. We got an amazing rate on line which included parking at a parking station just around the corner. The price could not be beat. It also included free wifi in the room. Would definately stay here again when we go back to San Francisco. If you are going to be travelling on many and varied modes of public transport throughout your stay, get a MUNI pass.

Location wise, the Chancellor was absolutely fantastic. Just minutes away from the main shopping area and with the cable car stop right outside, we were able to get to most of the must-see destinations and do our shopping easily. Even when we needed to take the buses, it was very convenient as the bus stops were within walking distance (five minutes on average). However, do note that as the hotel has rather thin walls so you might occasionally be awakened at night if other guests return late at night and make lots of chatter in the common corridor way. We were aware of the thin walls from previous reviews so we were prepared for it. There were a few nights when other guests came in late at night and we were woken up by the chatter. There were previous reviews about the room being small but it was good enough for us. The closet room was big enough for 2 our big suitcases. There was a safe deposit box in the closet room as well. Hot coffee, teas and cookies available 24 hours at the lobby. The tea selection is quite good. For those who want to explore the city and beyond, you definitely have to speak to Susan from the Tour Desk. Susan is a GEM! She is a friendly lady who always smiles and greeted us everytime we passed by her when we headed out. She is very knowledgeable on the tours and will help you to book tours to Monterey Bay, Yosemite, Napa Valley and many others. We signed up for almost all the tours available and had a fantastic time. The customer service at Chancellor Hotel before we arrived were splendid. My gf keyed in the wrong expiry date for our credit card during reservation and Mike McConnell (reservations agent) helped to rectify it very quickly. As we were staying for more than 10 days, we requested for a high floor room with a view of Union Square. Mr. Kevin Vossen (reservations manager) was superb in answering all our enquiries via email before our arrival and did helped to arrange a high-floor room with excellent view of Union Square for us! Unfortunately, our final day stay was marred somewhat by some hiccups. We were woken up at 7:30am twice by phone calls from the front desk who mistook us as the ones who had an airport pickup at that time. We checked with the front desk after we woke up and found it strange as the guest who arranged for the pickup had a totally different surnname from ours. We were quite disappointed as the staff didn't make any apologies for their mistake. This is strange as they are in the service industry. A second hiccup followed later in the afternoon. We had earlier twice informed and confirmed with the front desk during arrival and also the day before our check-out that we will be extending our check-out time to 4pm and were well aware that we will be paying extra for the late checkout. While we were catching on our sleep (having been woken by the front desk in morning at 7:30am), we were woken up again at 2pm by the front desk telling us it's time to check out. These are just minor issues but it's good to note as guests will still review the hotel based on overall experience.

After scoping over all the trip advisor reviews on San Fran hotels it became apparent that Chancellor was the ONLY choice :) What attracted me also was the fact that if there were any negative parts of a review - management would come on trip advisor and try and explain the \"WHY\" - it shows they have a lot of self respect for their customer service.

But I was happy that is arrived so quickly after we arrived (unlike other establishments with poor service). Let me begin with the room - in a country where it's all about BIG - these rooms were tiny - but in saying that, that is what you should expect from a boutique hotel. The beds were single beds - quite small and soft. There's a bay window that looked out onto the street below where we watched a busker outside our hotel getting rowdier and rowdier as the day went on - this is not a hotel you want to be in if you want to keep the windows open lol - unless u like noise. With the windows closed I didnt find it at all too noisy. The bathroom perhaps needs a face lift (as the new feature wall and bed linen in the main room has given it a great look) but for all intent purposes was fine. Free wireless internet was fabulous and fast. Apart from being small - the rooms were clean and comfortable. Biggest flaw with the rooms - The extremely THIN walls.... in the middle of the night we were awoken (and kept awake!) by noises that well, were a tad \"R\" rated - with a 5am wake up call the next day we were a bit tired the following day. Location Location! Union Square is right there - shopping district surrounds you and the cable cars \"ding ding\" at your front door step.

Initially I booked for $149 a night on the hotel website, but a couple of months out I found a better rate ($89 a night plus taxes) on Expedia, so I took that rate with a smile. I arrived at 2pm but my room was not available until 3pm, no problem - they took my bags and I went for a walk. They gave me a room on the 12th floor in the corner looking out over Union Square. It's a small room but it has a walk in closet, and its very well furbished. The bed was a little hard the first night (I have a princess and the pea back) but the next day they put a egg-crate foam topper on the bed and that made it incredibly comfy. There is the full complement of toiletries - shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soaps, plus cotton buds and tips, shower cap - and your own take-home rubber duckie. Mine came with a mobile phone and filofax! There is no mini bar but when I realised this, I asked if it was possible to have a bar fridge brought up and it was delivered within the hour. There is a Walgreens on the corner to buy milk etc - I prefer to have cereal in my PJs - can't handle company before breakfast! The room has a desk, chest of drawers with a big flat screen tv, table and chairs, and lots of lamps. Nice heavy curtains keep out the neon lights from the Square. I only realised it on day 3 but my window was open about an inch which was why it was so noisy - when pulling the curtains on the morning of day 3 I noticed curtain billowing outside and followed it back to the source; once I closed the window it was really quiet and peaceful! Nice carpet, nice soft towels and flannels etc. There is a pillow menu with 12 different types of pillows but I just stuck to the down pillows. The location could not be better; a 5 minute walk down Powell takes you to Market St, and the cable car stops just outside the hotel so you can shoot up to the tourist sites without having to queue down on Market. Get a Muni Pass if you are visiting - 3 days for $18 compared to $5 per trip on the cable car; I estimate I would have 'spent' $15 a day on local transport without the pass. Tea and coffee are available all day in the foyer, along with REALLY yummy cookies and fresh apples. There is a tour desk down there too - the woman behind the counter has a lot of zeal! They can book you on the airport shuttle for $14. The front desk staff are incredibly helpful and friendly - even with my extra demands (fridge, bed) they didn't blink - and they lent me packing tape and scissors when I decided to see how much stuff I could pack into one of those flat-rate boxes the USPS the sells ($56 to Australia, up to 20lbs - I managed to get 17.5 pounds in there!). The rooms and the foyer are all wireless - and its pretty high-speed for wireless too. Plenty of power points throughout the room and the bathroom - and the light switches are night lights which is cool because the bathroom is a step-up and the light always reminded me. There is a restaurant downstairs for breakfast and lunch, and room service is available until 9pm. I had breakfast there on my last day, using the discount voucher they provided on check in and it was absolutely fine. I would definitely stay here again - it was really good value.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, CA", "Title": "\u201cClassy Staff, Great Location.\u201d", "Author": "vjmelzer", "ReviewID": "UR53241683", "Content": "Had a short but sweet stay here and everything went smoothly.

The hotel is in the heart of Union square - a busy shopping district in the centre of town. The area is also very pretty at night (around the holidays there's a massive Christmas tree lighting up the square). - Price. I booked the room for $100 per night - very low for a decent hotel in San Francisco, so excellent value for money. - Comfortable rooms. Great beds, free wi-fi in the rooms. Lovely (walk-in) closet. - Friendly and welcoming staff. Cons: - Room size: the rooms are comfortable, but small. - Slow (free) wifi. Good for surfing the web, but too slow to stream video. Tips & tricks: - Guests have complimentary access to a great health club just around the corner. Or you can just get a room on the top floor and walk up the 15 floors of stairs instead of taking a lift. :) - Delicious coffee, tea (and biscuits in the morning) are available in the lobby around the clock and free of charge. - Because of the lack of AC, the bathroom window needs to be opened regularly to avoid getting mold spots on the mirror and walls. - Room doors have standard locks, but no door chains - a first among dozens of hotels I have stayed in and should be trivial to resolve.

The hotel itself: It is a boutique hotel, which is of course a difference from a large chain such as Marriott or Hyatt, but the experience was great. The hotel staff were polite and helpful but not intrusive. A few notes about the building: it is older; less space in the staircases/elevators; no A/C in the rooms (ceiling fan present) but SF doesn't get that hot/cold during most months. Rooms are cozy, but furnishings were functional and in good condition. Inside the room: flat-screen TV, free wi-fi in the rooms and in the lobby, no coffee maker (but you can place a request), free coffee and cookies in the lobby, free access to the Club One gym a block away (no fitness center inside the hotel), well organized walk-in closet, comfortable and clean bedding, all light fixtures were in order.

Another HINT: there is an Irish type pub a block down the hill and to the right...cannot remember the name, but they have a piano and it is a great sing along bar.

Like so many others that have stayed at this hotel, I was very impressed. The hotel is right on Union Square and, whilst you might expect it to be noisy, we found it surprisingly quiet. It is an older-style hotel, but tastefully decorated, clean and comfortable. We found the rooms more than adequate for ten nights and the bed really comfortable - in fact, I haven't slept so well in ages. We ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast every day and, again, thought it was excellent value; we also liked the cozy bar, which was great for a drink before going out for dinner in the evening. What really sets this hotel apart is the quality of the customer service; all our requests were dealt with efficiently and quickly and everyone - from reception staff to cleaning staff - was so helpful throughout our stay, and seemed determined to make sure that we were enjoying our visit.

I usually prefer business hotels and tried to find another place until the last minute. However, this hotel seemed to offer best value for money and we decided to stay there. This was a good decision. Having read all the great reviews about the service in the hotel I was disappointed at first. I felt that we needed to make the initiative to get the service, i.e. ask about everything as nothing was explained in the beginning (coffee, breakfast, bar, fridge in the room..). However, as soon as we did this, it was apparent that the reviews we correct. We got very good and personal service. Everyone working at the hotel was very polite and easy to approach. The tourdesk downstairs is the best. You can book tickets, buy Muni Passes and get all tourist information you need. We stayed in the hotel on two different occasions during our visit to SF. Both times the rooms were clean and nice with good pillows, flat screen TVs, good sized closets and best of all free internet. Rooms don\u2019t have air conditioning, but this didn\u2019t bother us at all. Open window and a ceiling fan did the job. Bathrooms were a bit on the old side, but perfectly usable (and clean). As said earlier, this is not a standard business hotel, but a hotel with character. One negative aspect was the noise from a room next door on our second stay. Our first room was very quiet but in the second one we could hear our neighbors talk and at night, snore. It felt as we were in the same room. The noise coming from the street didn\u2019t bother us at all \u2013 it was nice hearing the streetcars pass by and ring their bells. We had breakfast on four of the six mornings we stayed downstairs in the Luques Restaurant. It cost abt 35 USD (tip and tax included) for 2 and was definitely worth it. We didn\u2019t see the point in going to the restaurant next door as they pretty much had the same menu and prices. Service at the Luques was very good and friendly. Location of the hotel is perfect, right next to Union Square. In addition to the shopping and restaurants, it is an excellent place for public transportation. You can hop on the cable car to get to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf or walk down two blocks to Market Street and hop on a tram/bus to get to Ferry Building (or if you go the other way - to Castro District).

After driving across the country from Chicago and staying in various different hotels along the way, the Chancellor Hotel felt like an old-school Hollywood hotel of which we got a great rate on. Everything was so authentic and unique throughout the entire hotel from the lobby with extremely personable staff to the room which was cute and well furnished. It looked and felt like one of the older buildings in San Francisco which added a very nice feel to the experience of our trip. However, they are very well kept with modern features like a flat screen TV in the room, high speed wireless internet and the options to choose a dozen different types of pillows! The best part of the hotel was the location. You're in the heart of San Francisco and the trolley really does stop right at the Chancellor's doorstep. Everyone was very helpful in helping out the \"out of towners\" get around and navigate the public transit system (which was fairly simple if you're familiar with riding buses and trains in a major city). Overall, I would definitely stay at the Chancellor again. We even spoke to a gentleman in the elevator who said that he's stayed across the street at a different hotel for 20 years and decided (opting for a better rate) to stay at the Chancellor this particular weekend. He said that he was happier with this stay than in the 20 years he's traveled to San Francisco. Only drawback was parking, we got a deal where our parking at the Valet Garage around the corner was included with our room rate. It's downtown San Francisco so there's not much room to park anyway.

No matter how hot or cold it was outside the hot, the room was felt hotter. - The pillows on the bed were not comfortable. They were always clean and pleasantly arranged, but didn't work for me - too many and too soft. - Lastly the bathroom. It is very hard to have a wet shave without making a watery mess.

I had it changed but the potatoes (terrible they were\u2026) had gone cold and the bacon too. The next day the special was steak\u2026come on! You can\u2019t have steak in the morning! I asked for pastry but they had none even if on the menu\u2026..so the set was yogurt (in a bowl\u2026.) juice and white toast\u2026all for $7.50 which I find expensive\u2026.I also ordered fruit aside as it was not included in the set\u2026 Let\u2019s say, don\u2019t bother eating breakfast at Luke\u2019s and go somewhere else!", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sherwood Park Alberta", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "cdnwatchguy", "ReviewID": "UR39915705", "Content": "We stayed at the Chancellor for a week in August.

I think most people consider this room to be small ONLY because it has 1 bed, and not 2 beds. I guess its kind of small, but certainly not uncomfortable. I take cruise vacations all the time (2 or 3 times per year) and this hotel room is HUGE compared to a cruise cabin! ha ha I have plenty of room here to get around, there's even a nice desk where I work at my laptop (I also LOVE that there's free WiFi here - which is one of the reasons why I selected this hotel to begin with) and a lovely sitting area with 2 chairs & a small table. I haven't heard any strange noises, am not kept up at night and I wouldn't even know that there were other people on my floor unless I saw them on the elevator. I got great service at the front desk. I think the breakfast food in the Lougues restaurant is great, although the first day I ate there the service was VERY SLOW but that's only because it was busy. The lobby lounge is only open 5pm to 930pm, which isn't very long opening hours, but I managed to find a nice lounge close by to enjoy after dinner drinks with friends. I definitely recommend this hotel. Great value, fantastic location, very clean and comfortable. I have recommended this hotel to a group of approx 40 friends coming here for a reunion in September and I would recommend it to anyone else.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cWonderfull!!\u201d", "Author": "Silke_1", "ReviewID": "UR34098956", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel in the beginning of May.

I booked it because they included parking in a package (which is worth $30+ per day in S.F.) and I thought that the room rate was fair even without the extra perks.

Disadvantages The main problem for my husband and I was the noise. Directly outside of our window (3rd floor) was an air-conditioning/water unit for an adjacent building. I have attached a photo. The noise was really loud. My husband and I have backpacked around the world and both of us can sleep anywhere - but we really struggled to get any sleep at the Chancellor. No-one should have to put up with this kind of noise in a hotel. Obviously in a city you expect street noise - but not industrial noise non-stop almost 24hrs a day. No air conditioning. In San Francisco this should not be a problem. The weather was COLD when we were there - but the room was HOT HOT HOT. And we couldn't open the window as this made the noise from the industrial unit even worse. No fridge in room. I asked when I checked in if it was possible to have a fridge in my room. I was told it was possible for a fridge to be moved- but no fridge arrived. I did not ask for a fridge again as once we arrived at our room it was so small we could not see where the fridge could possibly fit - together with our bags. However it would have been good service to get an explanation as to why we did not get the fridge we had asked for. Bathroom. The bathrooms are TINY- very little room for washbags. Also the state of the tiles in our bathroom was terrible. I have added a couple of photos. The bathroom in our room was certainly in need of freshening up. Food. We only had 1 meal at the hotel - we had breakfast from room service but this was enough to put us off. I had homemade granola and rye bread toast and both were disgusting. First of all the granola contained loads of pine nuts. Now I love pine nuts - but in savoury dishes - it is just wrong eating them for breakfast. Also the rye bread was unlike any rye bread I have ever seen or tasted. It was basically white bread with a very strongly tasted herb. I think this may have been cumin - it was certainly not rye - and again it was totally unsuitable for breakfast. Advantages Great location Main bedroom was clean Comfortable bed Fantastic Italian restuarant across the road Handy for the tram Parking I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to sleep (due to the noise).

My wife and mother-in-law tagged along to do some sightseeing. Being from rural Pennsylvania, we weren't quite sure what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised by every aspect of this hotel. Rooms: The rooms are tastefully decorated and cozy. The bathrooms weren't as small as I expected. The flat screen TV was very nice and there was a small desk for me to set up my laptop. Our room was very clean. It was also very quiet considering that the hotel is in the heart of the city, the cable car runs right in front of the building and we had our windows open the whole stay. When we checked in, I asked for a quiet room and the staff delivered. Our room was on the 15th floor and at the back of the building. I do have to remind readers that this hotel doesn't have AC. We didn't need it since the high temperatures each day never got past the low 70s. However, if you're one of those people that has to have AC, this isn't the hotel for you. Service: Everyone was very friendly and helpful, from the bell staff to the cleaning service. We arrived in the city early and our room wasn't ready, so we left our luggage with the bellman. Once our room was available, the person at the front desk said that they would bring our luggage up. I figured we would see it in about a half an hour, but to my surprise the luggage was brought up about two minutes after we stepped into our room. The cleaning person on our floor was also very friendly. We opted not to have our room cleaned every day, but whenever she saw us, she asked if we needed any additional towels or toiletries. Finally, I'd like to mention Susan at the Tourist Desk. She's one of the hotel's stars as far as we're concerned. She booked tours for us, gave directions, helped us with transportation and was just a wonderful, friendly person who always said hello when we walked past and asked us how our day was going. She helped make our trip enjoyable, since part of the fun of travelling is meeting new people. Value: Considering the location, the room rates were quite reasonable.

The entire place is non smoking, which is a plus for us, the room was very nicely decorated, clean, had nice touches like the flat screen TV and the little jar of candies that awaited us when we got there. The beds were comfortable and everything was just perfect. The only thing I would mention that maybe some people should consider is that rooms that face Powell st. might be a little noisy due to the cable car passing by, and also, don't expect a huge room, the rooms are cozy. But again - we loved the room so non of the above applied to us. Other great things besides the room - complimentary coffee, cookies and newspapers in the lobby made our day each day, and since we travelled sans laptop - the free internet in the lobby worked well for us. Can't write a review without mentioning the great location - lots of good restaurants around, shops, attractions, easy access by public transportation to all parts of the city nearby. The hotel staff are so helpful, useful, smiling people we just enjoyed approaching whenever we needed something. I'm sorry I don't remember the name of the specific receptionist who assisted us, but they were all equally nice. After 6 days in the hotel, we loved it so much that before we continued our trip throughout California, we knew we would be back in San Francisco the last weekend before we go back home, we decided to book the same hotel again for 2 nights. Since we knew we were coming back there we asked the front desk if we could leave some luggage there, and they happily agreed, which definitely gave the place even more credit points on our part (Thanks for helping us not pay the excess baggage on the plane guys! :)...

Similar hotels (or, perhaps better according to the rating guides) were available for similar prices, not including parking, which is usually another $20-50.

Susan, who works in the gift shop/tourist information was fantastic giving us advice on how to make the most of our short stay in SF. She pre-booked Alcatraz for us and the City Tour. Using her advice we purchased a MUNI pass (three day pass for $18) giving unlimited transport on the trams, street cars and buses. Their transport system is brilliant. We made great use of these passes. One day we used the passes to cross the city to the Pacific for a paddle, then back to the Golden Gate Bridge. We walked across the bridge and down the hill into Sausalito, had a lovely afternoon and got the ferry back to Pier 1! We were also up and down Powell Street to Fishermans Wharf on the cable cars all the time, great fun - even for a pair of 50+ year olds! Taxis from the airport appear to be quite expensive so we used the BART (rail system) to get from the aiport to Market Street/Powell Street (cost about $5.35 each one way). Very easy to use. Get off at Powell and walk about six blocks up Powell Street to the Chancellor. Returning to the aiport we used the shuttle service recommended by Susan for $14 each. Well worth it - knowing we had a full day travelling home ahead of us. There are a few homeless people around Union Square, apparently they filter in from the Tenderloin area (about 4 blocks behind this hotel) but we didn't have any problems with them at all.

We went north to the Muir Woods, absolutely beutiful, highly recomended. And also traveled south to pebble beach for a round of golf. Bathroom amneties were nice, and we stole the rubber ducky from our room for a little souvenier. The only reason Im giving it four stars was because of the service our last day before leaving for the airport. Our car was brought to the front.. but the bell boy who had been very helpful when we arrived just watched as I dragged all our luggage (inluding a large golf bag carrier) to the rental car.

I had researched extensively on trip advisor and chose this hotel based on the reviews plus the hotel's own website. Our TA booked it for us, at a cheaper rate than we could, so that was a positive to begin with. On our last trip to San Francisco we had stayed at Fisherman's Wharf, but wanted to stay at Union Square this time. We were extremely pleased with everything about The Chancellor. The room size was fine, especially after having spent some time in Europe, where rooms can be very small. The bathroom may have been small, but had the requisite bath (and a nice deep one), shower over it, washbasin, toilet and a shelf for toiletries, so what more do you need? Not to mention the rubber ducky and the toiletries. I enquired whether the ducky was complimentary - not only was it, but I was given another (better) one as well. The body lotion is lovely, and there was also shampoo, bath salts, shower cap, cotton balls and cotton buds. The bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were fine. We did not avail ourselves of the pillow menu, but there was enough there for the fussiest of sleepers. While we were there, the TVs were being changed for flatscreens. We had plenty of space in the wardrobe to hang things. We left one suitcase in it on a stand, and had the other one in the room. There was also an in room safe, which we used, an iron and ironing board, which we didn't use and an umbrella which, thankfully, we didn't need. We availed ourselves of the tea and coffee (and the occasional cookie) in the foyer, but do prefer to be able to make our own in the room. However, again it was better than the hotels where we stayed in Europe, none of which had any free tea or coffee, in the room or elsewhere. We ate breakfast in the hotel twice, and found it to be tasty and filling, and cheaper than other places. It was actually the only time on our holiday where breakfast was not provided, so found this additional meal to be an expense we'd rather not have (the Australian dollar had dropped dramatically in value while we were away, so everything became much more expensive than we'd anticipated). Our room was on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel, so was noisy with the windows open. However, when we wanted to sleep, we just closed the windows and used the ceiling fan for cooling. And I did enjoy hearing the city noises, anyway, and at least we had a good view. The staff were always friendly and helpful, although I never did see Wes, the manager. I had enjoyed reading his trip advisor posts, both in the review section and on the San Francisco forum. We were able to leave our bags at the hotel on our departure day, which was helpful, as we had a 10.30 pm flight (all 14 and a half hous of it) home that night. A 12 noon checkout was also good - it gave me time to pack and rearrange our luggage that morning. For the price we paid and for the location I highly recommend this hotel.

He reserved a room for us on the 10th floor over looking Union Square. We were looking forward to a 'stress free girl's week' in San Francisco, and weren\u2019t disappointed. When we checked into our room we found a bottle of wine and two gifts compliments of the Chancellor Hotel, with a nice card from Wes wishing us a fun 'stress free' week! As for the room, we had a two twin room and it was plenty big. We had a walk in closet (which helped store our luggage out of site), and the tub was nice and deep for soaking after a long day. We loved the pillow menu, and took advantage of it. The hotel was full of charm and very clean. I was a little nervous on the 10th floor with the elevators. In New York & Chicago, it's seems to take forever to get an elevator going down that's not already full of people. At the Chancellor, we always got an elevator in a timely manner and surprisingly, it was usually empty. There was always something complimentary to drink (coffee or tea) in the lobby area, and during the day there are cookies and in the evenings we found popcorn to munch on. The lady at the travel info desk in the lobby was very helpful. If it wasn't for her, we would have missed one of our tours! She explained the Muni pass to us and we got the 7 day one. It was perfect. We could ride the cable cars, and the Muni buses anytime, anywhere. We didn't hesitate to go across town to see something, or even just to eat. The cable cars run right in front of the hotel, and you can board at each intersection. It runs all the way down to Fisherman's Wharf. Plus, the cable car engineers are full of character. Watch out for the ones that like to sneak up on you and try to scare you while you are enjoying the sites :) If only everyone made work fun like that! The Chancellor is with in walking distance of some of the best shopping I've found to this day! There are lots of restaurants in the area as well. Many coffee houses...we loved the Sugar Cafe (not only for their coffee, but their omelets and potatoes were yummy as well!). The other place for breakfast (if you don't mind waiting in line for 10-15 minutes) is right outside the Chancellor...Sears. They have the best breakfast around...we tried their Swedish Pancakes and had to go back the next day to try their omelets...it all looked so good!

Check in : Easy and a friendly. We had requested a refrigerator in the room (based on one of the TA reviews\u2026 it really was very useful) Room: Really comfortable for two people. The walk-in closet really expanded the space so that you could store your suitcases and not bump into anything. We had asked for the topmost floor overlooking the Union square, based on TA reviews and were glad for the choice. We weren't bothered by traffic or noise, and in fact found the music filtering in every evening from the Union square really charming. The sound of the cable cars and fire engines wasn't bad enough to disturb our sleep. Bathroom: Slightly on the smaller size, but big enough when we used it one at a time. Wished we had used the comfortable bath-tub (and the rubber duck). Lobby : The hotel lobby is intimate and cosy enough that you welcome coming back after a cool and tiring day. The freshly baked cookies with different types baked everyday (chocolate chip, raisin etc), coffee and apples were appreciated. Infact after the first day, when we had Starbucks, we didn't really feel the need to have any coffee elsewhere. ( I usually obsess over my coffee, and I really liked it). Location: (I hate saying \"location, location, location, location) Great. Just right next to Union square, a hop across to cafes, diners, small bistros, delis, a cable car stop right across, and very convenient for our conference also- just a block across. Staff: Rory, Steve, and the other guys at the reception- very helpful. Any question we had, use of the business center to print our boarding cards, picking up a Fedex for us and calling us up when it came- very helpful. Luques Filling breakfast with cheerful staff (especially Nancy). We had breakfast a day before the conference and it was really good. Bacon usually is too salty to eat, but even an occasional non-vegetarian like me enjoyed it. My wife had the veggie menu and felt her breakfast was ok. Smell: I know somebody had mentioned some smell in the lobby. I didn't really notice any smell except the nice smell of popcorn. There was however some funny smell in the passage outside our room. Just a minor point, and not really a big issue, as the room was comfortable, (non smelly) and the location cant be beaten. Would we come back here- Yes! in a heartbeat..

Things did not start well. Arriving in San Francisco at 5pm is not a good idea, especially for someone unfamiliar with the area. Having done several tours of the block trying to find somewhere to park and unload, eventually one of our party went into the hotel for \u2018guidance\u2019 as our tour of the blocks continued. Should have done that sooner! The Bell Captain came out and sorted us out, showing us where we could park and unload and helping us to unload. Check-in was efficient, if somewhat \u2018sterile\u2019 and a smile or two would not have gone amiss, perhaps it had been a long day, especially as the hotel seemed very busy with the Oracle conference being in town. They explained the options for car parking as, like most city hotels, they have no attached car park. We chose the $22/day self parking option, which was a multi-storey a couple of blocks away, we just drove there and the attendants did the rest. As it turned out, this was a good option as \u2018public\u2019 car parking was more expensive and this allows as many in and outs as you like, although the public transport is so good and cheap, we just left the car in the \u2018lot\u2019 during our stay. The hotel itself is a (relatively) old building, built in the early 1900s so is classed as \u2018historical\u2019 and the decoration and style reflect this. Our room was on the 9th floor, not much of a view but then we don\u2019t expect that in any city hotel. By US standards the room was small, but very clean and tidy and well decorated. We were a bit concerned about there being no air conditioning as it was a warm day and opening the window allowed in all the San Francisco noise \u2013 however it turned out to be part of the charm listening to the \u2018ting ting\u2019 of the street cars, the general hub hub of city life and of course the wailing sirens of police cars in the distance ! There was a ceiling fan which we couldn\u2019t get to work \u2013 at the end of the day this was down to \u2018user error\u2019 by me. You are even offered a \u2018pillow menu\u2019 here to choose from a range of pillow types but the ones supplied as \u2018standard\u2019 were more than adequate to complement the large, comfortable bed. Despite the local noise (with the window being open) we had no problem sleeping and it was lovely to wake up to the sound of the street cars going by. Although no coffee/tea making facilities were in the room, coffee was available in the lobby and again it would seem that most city hotels do not provide these room facilities. The strong point of this hotel is its location. Plenty of shops, diners and restaurants in the immediate locality and a two minute walk to the cable car stop \u2013 which you just have to do ! We chose to eat out and had breakfast at Lori\u2019s Diner a couple of blocks away \u2013 highly recommended, we even had the two \u2018cops\u2019 on the next table enjoying their pancakes \u2013 just like TV! We had an evening meal at a nearby baseball themed \u2018carvery\u2019 which was excellent value for money. As we already had a trip to Alcatraz booked (a not to be missed trip!) and with only one full day available, we tried to cram as much in as possible so we spoke to Susan the hotel concierge who was very helpful. She sorted us out with day passes for the public transport and booked us a three hour bus sightseeing trip of the city. We chose to use the streetcar down to Pier 39 area and benefited from a commentary by the very friendly \u2018brakeman\u2019 at the back of the car, pointing out local sites and interests. Both the Alcatraz and bus trip were very good, certainly whetting the appetite for a return visit and a longer stay at the Chancellor. So all in all, a very pleasant stay at the Chancellor and we would have no hesitation in staying there again. As a footnote, I left my glasses in the hotel room, only realising later as we were on our way to Yosemite.

EVERYTHING about our stay at the Chancellor more than met our expectations. We had booked shuttle service from the airport with Lorrie's, which I found on the hotel's website and which I'm sure saved us considerable time as we were unfamiliar with getting around San Francisco.

Waiting for us was a bottle of sparkling wine, two Chancellor wine glasses, gift-wrapped photo frame, and nice note from the hotel staff congratulating us on our recent marriage. What a way to welcome your guests! The room was painted in lovely shades of green and taupe, with nice prints on the walls. The bed had a soft white comforter and many pillows. Television, armchairs, dressers, lamps, etc. were more than adequate. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept like babies for the four nights we were there. The bathroom was plenty big for the both of us, and well-appointed with soap, shampoo, lotion, tissues, cotton balls and Q-Tips, hair dryer, and makeup mirror (plus the rubber ducky was a cute touch!). The ceiling fan and open windows provided more than enough ventilation. The large closet was much appreciated, as was the iron, ironing board, and in-room safe. The room was very quiet at all times, and street noise was not bothersome. All of the staff that we encountered were efficient, friendly, and helpful--particularly Steve (helped us with restaurant reservations), Susie (answered transportation questions and arranged shuttle service back to SFO), and Matt (brought our bags to the room). Everyone that we saw truly seemed to enjoy working at the hotel. We visited both the bar and restaurant and had pleasant experiences along with moderately priced, tasty meals/drinks. As many reviewers have previously noted, the location of the Chancellor can't be beat for just about anything a tourist would want to do in San Francisco, particularly shopping and dining.

We were trying to keep meal costs down but enjoyed two good quality meals just around the corner on Mason Street at Lori's Diner, a 50's themed diner and at Cafe Mason...the later had an excellent Loin of pork, with vegetables and rice for about eight pounds. Beers seem to be around 2.50 for a bottle, whatever your tipple. If you have the time...get across to Tiburon on the other side of the bay...$18 round trip...it's a peaceful haven with super views back to SF and the ferry goes right past Alcatraz to boot.

However, I would now have to issue a couple of caveats to that recommendation, and that the hotel is just beginning to look a little bit tired...for example, when we went into our room, the first sight of the bathroom was not pleasant, with a bath-tub that had definitely seen better days to the extent that we decided to have showers during our stay.

This hotel is beyond words. To our surprise at check-in, we had been upgraded to a suite on the top (15th) floor of the hotel, overlooking Powell Street and Union Square. What a terrific view and location. We thoroughly enjoyed the expansive two room suite, complete with two televisions, two full baths, a large walk-in closet and personal safe. (Thanks Wes for the upgrade and special recognition of our celebrations.) We ate breakfast each morning in Luques Restaurant, attached to the hotel. This was not only convenient, but also provided us with a great start to each day with a fantastic assortment of delicious food. From Brioche French Toast to Praline Pancakes to out-of-this-world omelets, our breakfasts were delightful and very filling. On several occasions, we had the opportunity to imbibe at Luques Bar. Their Mud Slide Martinis and White Russians were fantastic! As many previous reviewers have indicated, the location of The Chancellor can't be beat. We were able to use public transporation to get anywhere and everywhere we wanted to go. The close proximity of the cable cars and Muni rail system really made getting around San Francisco quite easy. While there, being big baseball fans, my wife and I were able to attend two SF Giants games, taking advantage of the Chancellor Hotel SF Giants baseball package promotion. The field level seats provided by the hotel were fantastic.

We availed of the summer special offer, which meant we paid $145 per night with $25 per day food and beverage credit. We were checked in by Rory (a fellow Irish man!) he was, as were all the staff in The Chancellor, friendly and professional. After checking me in, he rushed outside to help my husband get out of a tight parking space and direct him to the car rental drop off. The lobby of the Chancellor is very attractive, there is a small bar area and there is complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits all day which was a nice touch. We were very pleased with our room, some reviews here mention how small the rooms are, we certainly didn\u2019t feel that the room was small, it was more than adequate for the two of us. The room was very attractively decorated with rich green walls, muted brown furniture and bright white soft furnishings. Everything looked very new and spotlessly clean. The bed was lovely, very comfortable, with a pillow menu if the pillow you had wasn\u2019t to your liking! There was plenty of storage in the room with a large chest of drawers, table with small drawer, two bedside tables with drawers and best of all, a walk in closet area so you could stow your luggage away out of sight. We had requested a refrigerator for my husband\u2019s medication and that was waiting in the room when we arrived. The bathroom was fine, maybe not as nicely decorated as the room, but clean and well presented all the same. There was never any shortage of towels or cosmetics. Included in the room were a safe, iron and ironing board, hair dryer and radio alarm clock. Our room faced on to Union Square, we tended to sleep with the window open, so it did get a little noisy. This did not bother us as we are both heavy sleepers, but if you are easily disturbed by noise, maybe do request a room to the rear of the hotel. We used our food and beverage credit to eat breakfast in Luques restaurant in the hotel it really was delicious. We tried several things on the menu over the 4 days and everything was large, well presented and delicious. The wait staff in the restaurant was excellent also. Although be warned, this is not a place to grab a quick bite, it is more to be enjoyed for a leisurely breakfast. It also opens for lunch, but we did not try that. The location of the hotel really cannot be beaten. When you step outside, you are right on Union Square, with all the shopping and restaurants that that entails. The Cable Cars also stop right outside the door and they whisk you down to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in about ten minutes. Or if you are feeling energetic, you can walk there in about 15 mins (beware of the SF hills though!). We returned our rental car as soon as we arrived in San Francisco and I would recommend that others do the same. Parking in the hotel is $30 per night (and that is one of the cheapest places around \u2013 most hotels charge upwards of $40). We also noticed that parking garages around the city were very expensive. San Fran is so easy to walk around and I would also recommend a MUNI card, which allows you free transport on the buses, cable cars and Metro. We paid $18 each for a 3 day pass, when you consider that the cable cars alone cost $5 per trip, this works out very good value. Overall, I couldn\u2019t fault The Chancellor Hotel in any way, we felt it offered excellent value for money and also some nice little extra\u2019s such as a free jar of candy in the room, free tea, coffee and biscuits in the lobby, lovely cosmetics including bath salts, a pillow menu and a rubber duckie in the bathroom! It should be noted however that The Chancellor is only a 3 star hotel, an excellent 3 star, but a 3 star none the less. Reading through the reviews on Trip Advisor, it seems some guests expect 5 star luxury due to this hotels high ranking. The Chancellor doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything other than a lovely boutique 3 star in an excellent location that offers superb value for money. Don\u2019t go expecting any more than this and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Please note also that this hotel does not have air conditioning in the rooms, we knew this before we arrived and were duly prepared. It was hot when we were there, but we just left the window open and were quite happy. It\u2019s irritating when people leave reviews complaining about lack of air conditioning when that fact is already mentioned in practically every review! If you feel like air con is essential, you might be better booking a different hotel. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, this intimate hotel made such a refreshing change from the behemoth we stayed in Vegas! It was nice to be greeted by all the staff you met throughout the hotel.

Although I had told them in advance we would be arriving in the evening, about 9pm, I was still a little worried that they might have forgotten and given our room away; this ended up being totally unfounded, as the reservations and front desk staff were very efficient and had everything noted down perfectly. They had even noted it was our honeymoon, and congratulated us when we checked in, and we had a lovely little gift waiting for us in our room from them, which was wonderful. The hotel is very swish, with a pleasant lobby and bar area with marble floors. Our room was great, spotlessly clean, with a lovely comfortable bed. The cleaning staff were great, as we'd sometimes only go out for a couple of hours late morning, and by the time we came back the room had always been made up. The staff on the front desk were really helpful, warm and knowledgeable about the local area. The hotel's location is also really good, as you are very close to all the shops of Union Square, and you can easily get to buses and the metro for travel around the city. Union Square is very touristy, so we were pleased to get away to some of the other parts when we weren't shopping. There was no air conditioning in the room, but with the ceiling fan we had no problems with temperature at all - although it was quite foggy while we were there, so was never that hot outside. We also had no problems with noise in the room; you were too high to be disturbed by any street noise, and you could only hear people outside your room as much as you would in any hotel. I really liked my stay here, and was very very pleased that I chose the Chancellor. I wasn't sure if you were meant to take the cute rubber ducky home with you from the bathroom, but I did, and he is now a nice reminder of our lovely stay there in my bathroom at home. I would definitely recommend this hotel, and it would be my first choice for any future trip to San Francisco. It is well deserving of its rank on here, and is also a lot cheaper than many of the hotels with similar ratings.

The lobby was spacious and comfortable, and there was always fresh fruit, coffee and cookies. This was such a wecome sight when coming in from a long walk up and down the hills of SF! The bar in the lobby was wecolming as well, with 2 flat screen TVs that usually had a ball game or some other sporting event on. The people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. There was a menu in the room offering many different types of pillows, should you require something softer, more supportive, or hypoallergenic. There was also a list of spa equipment to add to the bath tub should you feel like a foot or bubble massage after a long day of walking. The tub was very deep and long, and a bath after a long day in SF was just what the doctor ordered! The location is great, as everyone else mentioned, right outside is a cable car stop (good to ride on at least once for the novelty) and shopping in the area is abundant, with Macys, Saks, Neimans, all across the street.

The bathroom is also tiny, but well decorated in small tiles and a deep soaking tub. The place overall was extremely clean, and so relaxing and charming (it is a very old/historic hotel). It was so fun to roll out of bed and be in the middle of it all, and the staff was accomodating and very friendly. The cleaning crew cleaned in the afternoon unless you put a sign up requesting early cleaning, which was very nice. Although the place was wonderful overall, it was slightly noisy since you are right in Union Square, and during our stay there was some construction right across the street. We were never bothered by the noise, though, unless the windows were open. The walls are slightly thin, and although not generally a problem because it attracts a pretty quiet clientele, we did have to ask the person on his cell phone next to us to keep it down at 4 a.m. The bathroom is not well-ventilated, so they ask that you keep the window open while you shower, which is slightly awkward to get to and has no curtain. The window is small, however, and tucked back over the toilet. There is also no heat in the hotel, so you must use a stand alone radiator, which works okay, but not great. This was only a problem a couple nights since we had unusually cold weather. The lobby also smells slightly moldy, which several people noted during our stay.

After reading all the good reviews on Tripadvisor we decided to try the Chancellor and we now have found our home away from home in SF. My wife and I booked a 4 night stay from the hotel website. They had a special for stays of 3 nights or more which made it a real bargain. We flew into SFO and took a cab to the hotel. As soon as our cab pulled up in front of the hotel we were greeted warmly by Martin, the hotel bellman, who took care of our bags. We got to the hotel before check-in time and were prepared to have to wait, however, the room was ready and check-in was a breeze. When we made the reservation we had requested a quiet, mid floor, room and that's what we got. We went up to the room on the 7th floor and a couple of minutes later Martin showed up at our door with our luggage. Martin not only brought our suitcase into the room but he set them up on the luggage stands and showed us where everything was. Martin was so genuinely warm and welcoming that we knew we had made the right choice by staying at the chancellor. The room was wonderful, with a queen bed, two armchairs and a coffee table. It had a large walking closet so overall I would not describe it as small. The room was tastefully decorated and very comfortable. Once thing that impressed me was that although the hotel is right on Powell Street, one of the major arteries of downtown SF, and a stone's throw away from busy Union Square, our room was indeed quiet and we slept like babies at night, despite leaving the window open. The room had wireless internet which worked flawlessly and we even had a pillow menu which allows you to order various types of pillows. The bathroom was very nice with one annoying little thing. The toilet is smaller than usual. What's odd is that there is actually plenty of room for a bigger one. Since the rooms have recently been renovated I was wondering if the toilet is a remnant of an old bathroom layout where the door clearance required such a small design. It would be nice if the toilets were replaced. This being said, it's manageable even for a 6'5\" bloke like me. There's a restaurant (Luques) on the ground floor of the hotel. We had breakfast there one morning and the food was very good. Very conveniently, the hotel lobby has a booth were you can get information on tours, book tickets for various attractions, buy stamps, etc... We bought our Muni passes there. The passes allow you to use the buses, metro and the famous Cable Cars for 3 or 7 days. Note that there is a Cable car stop right in front of the hotel. In fact, if you do not mind standing up in the Cable car you are probably better off catching a ride in front of the hotel rather than queuing for ages at the bottom of Powell street. This is actually a general tip. Cable cars are never filled up to their max capacity at the first stop of the lines. I guess that's to allow other people to hop in along the way. Therefore, if you are traveling from Powell St or Fisherman's Wharf which seem to always be crowded, just walk to the next Cable car stop and you should be able to hop in on the next car. Both metro and Bart are a short walk away from the hotel. On our last day we rented a car and that evening we decided to use the valet parking service. We parked the car in front of the hotel (there isn't much room to park on Powell St so if you can't find a spot just drive around the block until there's an opening), left the keys with reception and they took care of everything. We paid around 30 dollars which compared to what some of the other hotels around charge for parking is a rather good price. There is also the option of parking the car yourself for a smaller cost. We checked out the next morning. We had arranged with the front desk to have our car delivered at the time of our check-out. The valet brought the car over but there were not free spots on Powell (you cannot double park because of the Cable cars) so he had to circle the block a couple of times. A couple of hotel staff even went out on the street and started regulating the traffic in front of the hotel so that our car could be parked. This is an ideal hotel for a romantic getaway or a business trip to SF. If you are traveling with small children, however, you might want to look for another location because, as the hotel website states, it is not recommended to have more than 2 people per room. Incidentally, the hotel website is very well designed and you can download a very complete list of room features and hotel amenities that should help you in deciding if this hotel is for you. Also, don't forget to check out the specials on the website for some very good deals. We really had a fabulous stay at the Chancellor. While we were there my wife and I really felt at home and not in some hotel room. In an age where customer service is often little less than a afterthought, the Chancellor shines by the genuine warmth and professionalism of its staff. From the bellman and the front desk, to the chambermaid and the maintenance people, everyone we met at the hotel was great. This is probably the real secret to the Chancellor, its people. You really get a sense of a team working together to please the guests. We love SF but we loved it even more with the Chancellor. There's only one problem with this hotel.

I ended up choosing the Monaco, which I subsequently regretted. Last week, I was finally able to correct my mistake and enjoyed the most wonderful stay at the Chancellor. I cannot fault this hotel - everything from start to finish was perfection. All the hotel employees were courteous and efficient; the food at the hotel restaurant, Luques, was delicious (open for breakfast. lunch and dinner - we just had the breakfast), and the service prompt and friendly; the room was spacious and beautifully appointed; the hotel had wonderful maps and anything else you needed for your stay in SF. Full disclosure: Like the previous reviewer, I was also upgraded to the top floor, which I'm sure had larger rooms. This hotel has everything - even the option to borrow a noise machine if you need one (I never travel without mine, and did use it in SF, as I am a light sleeper). The bed was amazingly comfortable - and you can request different pillows if you wish (we did not need to do this, though - ours were perfect!). The bath products were wonderful and smelled great and the linens were unbelievably soft. The location is unbeatable - you are steps from the cable cars and the Market Street lines, which can take you right to Fisherman's Wharf or the Ferry Building, respectively, and other places as well. Not to mention there is a world of amazing shopping at your feet when you step out the door! Any questions we had were answered courteously and promptly, and the valet process was great. If you have any questions at all, do not hesitate to ask any of the staff - I was in a state of disbelief with regard to how consistently friendly, cheerful, and helpful every single member of the staff was. That alone makes this hotel a standout, but it is an exceptional hotel for so many other reasons as well! If you have forgotten anything or need anything, there is a Walgreens nearby. I went into the Borders next door to the hotel to pick up a local magazine. Cabs were plentiful and easily found just outside the hotel at any time of day or night. The Chancellor is officially the only place I will stay in SF, and I will recommend the hotel to anyone and everyone without hesitation. It is truly a gem of a hotel in the heart of SF.

I had read the reviews and chose the Chancellor because of location primarily. We were checking in after three nights in the Bellagio in Las Vegas so I wasn't sure about how the kids would react after all of the flash and grandiosity of the previous hotel but they loved the Chancellor as did I for several reasons. First, of course location, location, location. So close to great eats (Sears was awesome for dinner and breakfast), great shopping, parking (reasonable), drug stores, transportation whether you want a quick ride to the Wharf on the F line or a thrilling ride on the cable car. It was warm in SF when we were there but we opened the windows and everything was fine with very little noise. Because the hotel is small and we saw the same employees (who would quickly recognize us) over and over again, the children were able to be a little more autonomous than usual so they were allowed to go downstairs alone to get the complimentary popcorn, apples, and cookies. My son used the ethernet connections in the lounge with me in the evenings and everyone was so friendly to him. My debit card was lost at one point and I called the front desk to ask about the location of a Wachovia bank in SF. They called around and found one that was open that day, a Saturday, called the bank to confirm the hours, mapquested the directions, highlighted the route and sent me on my happy way. I think that the age and size of the hotel give it a unique and friendly feeling that really makes you feel a part of SF. My 10 year old daughter took the yellow duck she was given at the Chancellor into every hotel pool we visited on our way home. I watched as it floated around as she was playing and on several occasions adults picked it up and read the inscription on it and asked my daughter about it and that began a lengthy and colorful conversation about her \"awesome\" trip to SF and her stay at the Chancellor.

First, as a family of four, we knew we are not the ideal customer for the Chancellor, which only has small queen or twin/twin combination rooms. But the location, service, parking option, and price were right so we went for it. The central location just off Union Square and on the cable car line is perfect. Our visit didn't get off on the great start because a really expensive two-bottle pack of wine (from our Sonoma Valley winery visit) was inadvertently left on the sidewalk outside. Matt apparently got everything except for the wine and we didn't notice until we were in the room. It was just as much our fault for not making sure we had everything before we headed up. Well, by the time we realized the wine was missing, somebody was probably already enjoying some great wine! With all that said, Matt was friendly, helpful and informative (and later apologetic about the wine). Check-in was very smooth. The hotel uses a parking garage a block over and, with the in-out privileges, it was very convenient whenever we needed to drive somewhere. Another nice thing is that the Chancellor lets you leave your car in front of the hotel while you check-in and get your stuff upstairs. As other reviewers have already pointed out (and we well knew), the rooms are on the small side and don't have AC. However, the high ceilings make the room \"feel\" bigger and the ceiling fan helps cool the room even though we were in SF during an unusually warm week. Despite the tight space, we packed our family of four in and still managed just fine. One unique thing about the Chancellor's rooms are that they each have a small walk-in closet. My 7 year old son liked sleeping on the closet floor so we all had enough room to sleep and get around! The beds were comfortable and we all slept well. The room had nice little touches like free candies, wi-fi access and an in-room safe. And unlike the vast majority of hotels who can't be bothered with it, they recycle! Also, we liked the fact that they only launder and replace towels that you place on the floor, and not all towels each day. On the downside, there was a step up into the bathroom that could pose a tripping hazard, the toilets are very loud (loud enough to be heard in adjacent rooms at night) and there was no refrigerator. Also, our third-floor room only had a view of the back of an adjacent building 10 feet away. We forgot to ask for a view. Oh well.... What separates this hotel from the average is the exceptional staff and thoughtful touches around the hotel. Everyone we encountered was very helpful and friendly. Cookies, fresh fruit, coffee, iced tea and ice water were plentiful in the lobby/bar area. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Luques, several mornings, and we enjoyed the pancakes, waffles and french toast!

The location was great, right beside Union square and near all the shops. Ton's of restaurants in the area within walking distance, sushi, pizza, chinese, all american, whatever you are in the mood for. It was easy to get to, we took the BART from the airport, took about 25minutes to get to our stop, just followed the directions, cost was $5.35each one way, walk to the hotel from the BART stop was slightly up hill along Powell, Cable car line, approx 4 blocks or so, took us maybe 10mins. Lovely reception area, check-in could not have been quicker, staff at front desk were very friendly and welcoming. They gave us a package at check-in giving us a discount for the dining area as well as 2 for 1 drinks at the hotel bar. We also received a coupon for the 11% discount at Macy's given to foreign passport holders. Now to the room. I had done my homework and was expecting a smaller size room based on everything I'd read and yes the room is smaller than some, however it is not the smallest room I've ever stayed in and I have travelled a LOT. The room was efficiently layed out, with nothing in the way of the other and SPOTLESSLY clean. I loved the rubber duck in the bathroom and the bath salts that soothed my aching blistered feet. There was more than enough room for two girls who planned on shopping and bringing takeout back to the room. The closet was huge, walkin with a safe in the back, iron, ironing board and an umbrella, just in case, I love it! There was a jar of candy on one of the tables, mint, butterscotch, cinnamon, Jolly rancher, nice touch, we had several. Room service was available, not particularily expensive, however we did not order anything becase coffee was always available and freshly baked cookies as well as apples. We would grab a coffee and cookie in the morning as well as a complimentary newspaper . As mentioned in previous reviews, there is no air conditioning, but the windows in the bathroom and the room open, allowing for air to circulate and there is a fan overhead if you need it, but I don't think you will, average temp during summer is in the mid 70's and it cools down at night. We did not use the fan. We had two single beds and covering up with the lightweight duvet was more than enough to keep us warm or cool at the same time. The bed was extremly comfortable. There is a tour desk in the lobby. They will make arrangements for any tour you like, pick up from the front lobby. We took a day tour of the city, highly recommend it, it took us to all the spots you must see, first time in SFO. If you don't want to book a tour, from this location you are within blocks of China town, taking you maybe 10-15mins to get there. We walked from the Wharf back to the hotel, took us 45 minutes, most of it uphill. No problem. Now to the part that made the biggest impression on us, the hotel staff. It wasn't just the staff at the front desk that were friendly but everyone that worked there said hello to us and smiled. Once we were getting into an elevator and the bellman who was already in the elevator got out to allow us to use the elevator first. He insisted, even though we told him we'd wait. The employee's all seemed happy to be there and ready to work, no private converstaions going on that you fear interrupting or conversations that continue while you wait for someone to notice you are waiting to ask a question and that means a lot to me.

He gave us helpful information on the area. We had a wonderful breakfast one morning- beautifully presented, and served by two lovely Asian staff. The room was cozy and spotless. We had asked for a room high up and quiet and our request was honoured. We thought the complimentary coffee in the lobby was a lovely touch. The location couldnt have been better - we were able to either take buses, trolley or walk to Fishermans Wharf. We thought the value was excellent for a stay in a major city in a downtown hotel.

After studying the different Union Square hotels, we emailed the most promising, requesting a special extended stay quote, and then wrote the Chancellor, asking could they improve on the best offer received, which they did. We were able to stay for 9 nights for less than $1,500. They even had a card & anniversary gift for us. My son and daughter in law also reserved for a shorter stay. They were also delighted & kept saying what a charming hotel (how did you ever find such a gem?). All in all, it was better than we had anticipated. Kudos to the fine staff, who responded promptly & courteously, even providing a small fridge on request. Susan, who effortlessly handles gift shop and concierge duties, arranged for terrific sightseeing trips: wine country, the redwood forest, Monterey and Carmel, Yosemite Natl Park, city sightseeing.

The roof fan did help to cool it slightly as it was too noisy outside to leave the window open. The view of Union Sq was good from our room.

The staff were all very helpful regarding tips for eating out etc. The position of the hotel was very handy to the shopping and eating out etc but we were very disconcerted with the vagrants that hung around the hotel and Union Square at night begging etc. I reckon San Fran needs some zero tolerance like NY did a few years back.

As for the room, it was very small and while updated in its decor- it was old. The bathroom was also very small (the door barely clears the toilet) with no frills.

The location is perfect - a few of blocks from the cable-car turnaround, across the street from Union Square, within walking distance of excellent restaurants and bars... I could go on, but suffice it to say that for travellers and tourists, I strongly recommend it. (A quick hint: if you're looking for great breakfasts, go a few blocks south to Cafe Bellini, pick up a sandwich or danish, and enjoy some outdoor dining on the steps in Union Square.) Although our interaction with hotel staff was relatively limited, I must give special mentiont to Rory, who greeted us on arrival late Friday night: in the midst of a very trying set of circumstances (he was alone at the front desk, confronting an ever-increasing line of people waiting to be checked in, a pair of guests whose door-keys refused to work, and someone who kept calling on the phone to ask for driving directions), he maintained his composure and was polite and helpful throughout. As many good things as I have to say about the hotel, it isn't for everyone. I greatly enjoyed the jar of complimentary candy in our room and the free popcorn in the lobby, but some people might see these as gilding the lily. Although I've seen the term \"boutique\" applied to the Chancellor, I don't think that's entirely accurate - to me, the term implies a hotel which has been recently renovated to offer the latest in design elements and luxury amenities. That's not the Chancellor. You won't be finding a sleek bar in the lobby, or flat-screen TVs in your room - what you're getting is an older building that could use some renovating, but which with apparent attention and effort has been well-maintained and is certainly punching above its weight. As an example, the beds are very comfortable, but the lobby is dated (if still quite nice). It's an excellent value, it's a great location, I would strongly recommend it - but if you're looking for a cookie-cutter chain environment, or more emphasis on fancy bottles of shampoo and pricey designer bottled water, this isn't for you.

We had requested a room on a high floor with a nice view if possible our suite didn\u2019t have a view so perhaps they we unable to give us a normal room with a view so they bumped us up to the suite?

We had a 5 day stay at the Chancellor Hotel in March 2008 - 3 days before we left for Las Vegas/Grand Canyon and 2 days on our return. The location and the service were first class -- we had front rooms on both occasions and it was just magic to be able to hear the SF cable cars as they passed within a few feet on the hotel - there is a stop in both directions just steps from the door - making it easy to get to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf etc. The rooms might be on the smallish side \u2013 but we did not intend to stay in the rooms for long and we knew this beforehand from previous reviews. Some nice toiletries in the bathrom saved us buying when we got there, although there was a Wallgreens just 2 minutes away which stocked anything a visitor could need, We had great views of Union Square - with Macy's and the Levis Store about 4 minutes away. Down on Market (10 minutes walk downhill or 4 mins. on the cable car) was a huge Mall with all the usual US stores -- a great place to exercise your credit card! The staff were unbelievable -- because we were on a 5-hour city tour when we needed to check in on-line for our SWA flight to LV - Shamina on the front desk did all this work for us and our boarding passes were at the desk when we returned that evening and she also checked our final flight time home with the airport a few days later, and changed the time of a Lorries Shuttle pick-up for us. Thank you Shamina. We were able to leave a bag in the hotel while we flew east and picked it up on our return -- very handy as it saved us carrying too much weight on the internal flight. Also as it was my birthday when there -Wes Tyler had arranged for a bottle of champagne and a gift in the room - thank you Wes! The convenience of having the restaurant on the ground floor for a large US breakfast and the bar in the evening for aperitifs was great. The bar closes early but we were able to stop on walk home from dinner for our nightcaps! Muni passes can be bought from Suzie in the lobby and there is an ATM machine in the lobby too. We bought our last two Lorries Shuttle vouchers from Suzie too.

We booked 7 hotel rooms in total. On arrival we checked in and the girls on reception were really helpful, however only 2 of the 7 rooms were ready for us. We were disappointed as it was after 2pm so we did expect the rooms to be ready, so we ended up dumping all the baggage in the 2 rooms so we could go out. All the rooms were really small and as 2 of the rooms had babies in them and therefore needed cribs (which resembled something out of a orphanage but were clean and comfortable) there wasn't much room at all. Although reception were pleasant and helpful they did not really allocate the rooms acording to who was staying in them, as the largest room was given to one of our group who was staying on his own rather than being given to the family who has a baby. So we swapped rooms between ourselves. We stayed in room 906 whcih was clean and tidy and had a bowl of sweets, which was a nice touch. However the bathroom was old and tatty and in need of some renovation, also I was convinced I could smell vomit in the room. The location of the hotel is very close to Union Square which is excellent for shops. Howvever there seems to be a lot of homeless people hanging around this area, (much more than when I visited San Fran a few years ago) this was very intimidating at night, so next time I would be tempted to stay near the Wharf rather than Union Square. The hotel lobby has free tea and coffee and cookies (which were lovely) and there was a residents bar which did great cocktails - however this closed really early (around 9.30pm) which was a bit disapointing.

After reviewing hotel choices we chose the Chancellor Hotel. In planning the stay they were reasonable on the rates. In arriving at the property they followed through from start to finish. Having visited many properties I think they are too modest to call themselves a \"3 star hotel in a 5 star neighborhood\" I think they are a solid 3 1/2! We are a family of four. We took two adjoining rooms which I recommend for a family group. This is not the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton. If you are looking for a pool and a spacious modern room then you should look elsewhere. If your tastes are more modest the courteous staff from the attentive front desk to the chamber maids makes this hotel a good choice. The hotel was built in 1914 and sits right on one of the main cable car lines adjacent to Union Square. It's a great location if you are looking to travel around and see the sites in the City. The only downside to the location is if you are a light sleeper this is near SF's theatre district. When the bars close at 2am you can hear folks milling around at street level. We were told that the hotel had completed a renovation in the last year where the guest rooms were upgraded. The beds were comfortable and the furniture in our room was new, one comment here is larger TVs in the guest rooms would be a plus. When on vacation with the family we are not looking to lounge in our hotel room during the day. We were in town to visit family and travel around the area. When you left in the morning or returned in the evening you could take a apple and a cookie from a display in the lobby. At the end of the day during happy hour there often was a popcorn wagon set up near the bar which the kids (and adults) enjoyed. We had breakfast at Luques (the hotel's restaurant) one morning and were treated well.

The Chancellor also has a tour desk with a knowlegable staffer to help you with directions, reservations etc. As has also been mentioned by many others, The Chancellor provides complimentary cookies (penut butter, oat meal etc.) coffee and tea in the lobby for use by its guests 24 hours a day. My wife and I often took advantage of these amenities after a long day of exploring San Francisco. Our room was on the 14th floor and had a nice view of Union Square and the Sir Francis Drake Hotel across the street. We could also view a small portion of San Francisco Bay, which was an added bonus. The rooms were very clean and well decorated. Our queen sized bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. We also enjoyed the large walk in closet so that we could hang up our clothes and store our luggage. In the closet was an extra blanket, ironing board & iron and a heater, if needed. The TV worked well and had many cable channels. Next to each bed was a night stand with a lamp and one of the night stands had a nice clock/radio. The ceiling fan in our room was also a nice touch, as it really moves the air in the room, as the hotel does not have air conditioning. The windows can also be opened too, which we did when we were gone from the room for the day. The bathroom was very cute, functional and more than adequate for our needs as we were well aware that the hotel was built in 1914. Some people have said that the rooms are small and I tend to disagree, as the rooms, while not spacious, are more than adequate for 2 persons especially if you consider the large walk in closets. I would not recommend that more than 2 people stay in a room, as it could get a little cramped for space, but the hotel makes that point perfectly clear on its website. We really loved our stay at the Chancellor Hotel and would highly recommend it for any couple wanting a very nice, clean, affordable hotel with a friendly and knowledgable staff in arguably the best location in San Francisco. For us, the Chancellor Hotel was a grand slam and everything we hoped it would be.", "Date": "February 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cH I G H L Y Recommended\u201d", "Author": "lawnboy246", "ReviewID": "UR13629148", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at the The Chancellor Hotel on Union Square from 6/30/07 to 7/4/07.

Wow. The Chancellor made me realize my expectations were pretty low! I was extremely impressed with this place. The hotel is beautiful- although it's old, it has been fully refurbished and is absolutely pristine. The guest rooms and the lobby are filled with character. The rooms are beautifully furnished and they are absolutely spotless. I'm a slob and the maid removed all evidence the mess I created every single day. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the free in-room WiFi was icing on the cake. I was most deeply impressed by the staff of the hotel. I didn't catch names, but every person who helped me was oustanding. I was amazed when my breakfast was brought up to my room and the person who delivered it started asking me how I like the room and then explained how it had been completely redone. This was a great indication of the pride this person felt in the Chancellor- if you're going to engage me in a chat about how the room was redone while you deliver my breakfast, you're obviously pretty proud to be working there. That sums up my experience with the Chancellor- everyone seemed to be proud to be there and the ruboff of that pride was excellent service all around. It was so great to get to experience a city like San Francisco while staying in a hotel like The Chancellor. I am now looking to return to San Francisco with my wife and family for leisure.

We had a midweek matinee and a good parking deal at the Chancellor, so we decided to go back, which I had hoped to do anyway because of all of the wonderful recent reviews and I wanted to see the room refurbishing. We decided to make it a two night stay. There are two main things which impressed me, especially as compared to the myriad hotels in San Francisco that we have visited over the years. The first is the staff. I swear that the general manager, WesTyler, must have trained this staff in customer relations. Or else they are just genuinely great people...they don't ACT trained, it seems genuine. The front desk clerks are smart, efficient, friendly, and alert. The bellboys keep track of when your room is ready if you arrive early and efficiently keep track of various people's luggage. both checking in and checking out. The woman at the Tour Desk (which we did not use) is available for questions and help...she is probably the equivalent of a 'concierge' in a larger hotel. (She will also laugh with you when you come in from the rain soaking wet.) The staff in the restaurant is not only efficient and attentive, but cheery and fun. They really seem to enjoy what they are doing and always wish you a good day when you leave. If you run into a member of the housekeeping staff in the hallway as you are entering or leaving your room, you can always count on a greeting with a smile, ...\"good morning\"...for example. The refurbished rooms are delightful, with a classy decor, beds and linens and comforters you wish you could take home with you. SO....this is an older hotel, brought up to boutique/charming style. Don't expect 300 square foot rooms, air conditioning, huge modern bathrooms. You may find a welcome walk-in closet. You will not have air-conditioning, but you will have a window which opens and a ceiling fan to circulate the air. Actually, you will need not to worry about A/C at all in SF. You will need to worry about heat, if you are in your room during the day on cold days. The hotel has an efficient way of turning on the heat at about 5 o'clock in the evening and turning it off later in the morning, but if you are in your room during the day and get cold, look in your walk-in closet you will find a modern electric 120 v \"radiator\" which you can trot out to warm your toes. It is not really a problem, just a caution for extra cold days if you plan to \"stay in\". OKAY, Wes.....your turn. But please share what I said about your staff with them.

The front desk and concierge staff were friendly and gave excellent directions to all the places we wanted to go. The coffee and cookies in the lobby were a homey touch, and the coffee was so good I never felt the need to go in search of Peet's! We used the pillow menu (the memory foam pillows are amazing), and we asked the first day for a refrigerator, which was delivered and cold by the time we returned from lunch in Chinatown. We had drinks in the bar each night that we were there, and found Alicia to be a funny and informative barkeep. Housekeeping did a wonderful job of keeping our room clean and comfortable. The location of the hotel is terrific. It was easy to get anywhere we wanted to go, and right on the cablecar line. We were just a couple of blocks from the bus line, Chinatown, the world's largest Macy's, and a mall housing some really wonderful restaurants. We especially enjoyed our meal at Out and About, a Vietnamese restaurant. My husband and I run a 32 room inn with a full service restaurant in the Berkshires of Massachusetts, and came home with lots of ideas to improve our own guests' experience.

You also have to initial about 6 different clauses when you check in, whereas with most hotels a signature and a credit card suffices.

The renovation meant the room had a modern lick of paint and new modern bedroom furniture...the green was a good choice. I slept well in the bed and could have chosen from a list of 10-12 special pillows to order to my room. There was a large walk-in wardrobe/closet which made up for the size of the room, a little on the small size, and an in-room safe, which was appreciated.

It was very busy so instead of waiting 30-40min we took a seat at the bar and had dinner there. The bartenders were nice and the food was good but nothing to write home (or TripAdvisor) about. The hotel is right on the street car line which is awesome! You can make it to most of the major tourist spots on this system. Also, the hotel is a few blocks away from the Powell street BART station which is great if you are flying in and not planning to rent a car.

The cookies and coffee available in reception were brilliant as this is all we needed for breakfast on the run so we could cram as much into our stay as possible.

I bought tickets for two Giant's games and wanted to find the perfect little hotel for us to stay in. Location: I've been to San Fran many times before, and I love Union Square... so, this hotel couldn't be more perfectly located. Right on Union Square with a Cable Car stop right out the front door, with very easy access to public transportation (we bought a 3 day muni pass for $18 dollars, a great deal because PT in this city is very convenient), and LOADS of shopping nearby. Cost: I wanted to go on the cheaper side for hotel cost, since I had just spent a bunch on baseball tickets, so you really cant beat the price at the Chancellor. I did a ton of research on TripAdvisor and other hotel websites, and I knew that this was the place to stay. I got a great rate of around $100 per night, and I had origianlly only booked one night at first. After arriving at the hotel we realized that we had found a true gem and we immediately called the front desk to see if they could accomodate us for another night. The front desk was more than helpful in extending our stay and also made sure we wouldn't have to move our stuff into another room the next day. Simply flawless and friendly service. Room: I requested a room that was on a higher floor, newly renovated and facing union square. When we checked in we got a corner room on the ninth floor overlooking union square. Perfect. Bed was very comfortable, bathroom was small but very functional. This is an older building so it has it's quirks and imperfections, but that all adds to the charm... so just keep that in mind. From reading past reviews, it seems that they are very good at accomodating every guest's requests... but I'm sure that there will be times when people's requests can't be met, but thats just how it goes. This hotel really goes out of its way to make their guests happy, so no one should let a little thing like tat ruin their stay. Service: Again, the service here is fantastic. The woman at the front desk was so nice and helpful, and make checking in a total breeze (we even arrived several hours before normal \"check in\" time, but this didn't seem to be a problem in our case). The bartender was also quite friendly and mixed some good drinks. Overall, you get great value for the money you pay. In a city like SF you can expect to pay tons of money at any hotel, so paying the rate you pay at the Chancellor, its almost like robbery! Simply cannot say enough good things about his hotel.

We had a friendly welcome upon check-in by Steve, the guy who dealt with us and the process was quick and very efficient. He also gave us a map and told us to come to reception with any queries. I had made a request to Kevin Vossen prior to travel for one of their reburbished rooms on a high floor with a good view of Union Square and they were able to fulfil this request so thanks very much Kevin!! Brilliant view of Union Square day and night and the windows did a great job of blocking the noise out. The room was nicely decorated and clean. It was more than big enough for our needs and the bed was very comfy! Bathroom was clean and maybe a little small for some but we were happy with it. Having complimentary coffee and tea available (along with the cookies) is a really great idea and gives the guests so much freedom and free use of their computer for internet access is an added bonus. One of the best things about the hotel must be it's location to Union Square, the San Francisco centre and everything else. It's fantastic!

We were originally going to stay on Fisherman's Wharf but upon visiting it are very glad that we didn't. Too touristy for our liking and a bit further out.

Or about the bowl of hard candy, the welcome bottle of local wine, or the rubber ducky in the bath. These touches require a certain obsession with being the best hotel possible, within the limits of the hotels architecture and age. This commitment to excellence, perhaps commonplace when the Chancellor was built, has become a rarity in our time. The hotel is old but is by no means rundown. The paint our room was fresh and the carpet was new. Furniture has been updated. But it is not the Marriott or Ritz Carlton. As Wes frequently writes...do not stay here if you are looking for a luxury hotel. Rooms here are adequately sized but not spacious. Our room featured a queen bed, writing desk, small end table flank. The walk-in closet was huge. Since we were able to place all of our bags in the closet, we had more useable space in the room itself. Bathrooms are charming but not very large. There is no air conditioning. Do stay here if you are looking for lots of value for not much money...an immaculate room....and welcoming staff....and lots of little touches..... The Chancellor is rated by TA readers as one of the best value hotels around. Given the prices for other hotels in the heart of SF, we wholeheartedly agree. We spent more for dinner for two than for our room!

This hotel should be 4 or 5 stars for the service and the quality of the room, and proves how flawed the whole star system can be as I have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels which have been much worse than this one. Firstly the location is second to none. You are staying right on union square in prime central location. You are staying right next to all the most expensive hotels, and the most expensive shops and restaurants. To get there from the airport I would advise taking one of the shuttle buses which will cost only $14 plus tip, much cheaper than a taxi. The service throughout the hotel was excellent. The room was a good size, and it was located in a quiet area as I requested, although I thought the whole hotel was quiet. The hotel has wi-fi throughout, and if you do not have a computer you can check your emails on the computer in the lobby for free! The room had a nice size bathroom, which a good shower/bath. There is a fan in the room, which I preferred compared to the air-conditioning systems found in most hotels which always give me a sore throat. There is also a television and a clock which can play your mp3 player through its speakers. As for San Francisco it is very nice. Would definitely advise booking Alcatraz as soon as you get there as it is always booked up during peak season for at least a day, so if you are only staying a couple of days book it before you go there, and if you are staying a week or so, then do it as soon as you get there. The tour bus, located in Fishman's Wharf is a good way of seeing the city (and is close to the place for buying Alcatraz tickets) so I would advise seeing Fisherman's Wharf, buying your Alcatraz tickets and doing some of the tours on the first day so that you have a good orientation on the city.

I booked the trip as a surprise 40th birthday present for him but we decided to travel in September to coincide with our wedding anniversary. Like many other people I had emailed Wes in advance and he pre-allocated us a \"nice room\" (room 1003). It was a corner room with a side view of Powell/Union Square and we couldn't fault it. The decor was lovely, the bed was nice and comfortable, the bath amazing and the power shower was an added bonus. Unlike some people we didn't find the room small - it had a Queen bed, dressing table, coffee table, two chairs and two bedside tables. The closet is massive & you can easily store your suitcases out of the way. The bath is also huge and you can actually fit two people into the bathroom fairly comfortably. In addition to our great room we also received a load of gifts from the hotel in recognition of both my husband's birthday and our anniversary - whilst we really, really appreciated this it is not the free stuff that sets the hotel apart from others, but the attitude of the staff and the absolute attention to detail. Everyone we encountered was professional, helpful, happy and keen to help. The free cookies and coffee are welcome (and delicious) but the hotel breakfast in Luques is also really good. Portions are huge, service is great, there is a wide range of choice with daily specials and the prices are reasonable - we dined there several time and it was always great. In addition to Luques we also found two really nice restaurants - Scalas, directly across the street (beautiful Italian food & great service) and Colibris on Geary Street - if you do go there the guacomole is a must. It is made fresh in front of you and is delicious - and the creme brulee is even better. The things we enjoyed most in SF are as follows: A trip to Muir Woods and Sonoma Wine Country. We booked with Extranomical (as recommended by Wes) and it was a fantastic experience. This company showed us 3 different wineries and also lots of the sights & history of SF; A trip to Alcatraz - we took the evening tour, which is really atmospheric but you must book in advance if you want to go; A bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito & then the ferry back. Sausalito is well worth a trip but note some bike companies will only hire if you have photo ID - Blazing Saddles does not ask for photo ID; The Musee Mecanique at Fishermans Wharf is a \"museum\" dedicated to old arcade games & attractions. Everything works and only costs 25 cents to play - it's a great laugh. Our Top Tips - If you plan on riding the cable cars, buy a MUNI pass. You can get 1, 3 or 7 day passes for various sums. A one-way cable car ride costs $5 but you can use your pass on the cable car, MUNI & buses; All ATM's charge $2 or $3 per transaction. If you use the one in the hotel lobby it charges $2 but you can redeem your receipt for a $2 discount at Luques; Macys offers tourists 11% reduction on purchases - just take your passport when you're shopping.

This was our second visit, and part of an anniversary trip, so I contacted Wes the manager before we travelled and he helped me to arrange a special treat for our arrival. Not only did we find a bottle of wine and a special gift for our anniversary, but some beers and nuts for my husband (he is a simple pleasures kind of guy!) The hotel room (1103) was great - we had a corner view of Union Square, and although we could hear the cable cars quite clearly, they just added to the experience of San Francisco. We purchased a pair of MUNI passes from the tour desk and made full use of them during our stay. We travelled regularly on the cable cars (which were quite busy, but another part of the San Fran experience). We also walked down to Market Street and caught the F Line historic trams, which go all the way along the Embarcadero to Fisherman's wharf. Top tip - take the $20 trip across the Golden Gate Bridge - it only takes 1 and a half hours, but you get to stop off at the Palace of Fine Arts and take pictures of the city from the other side of the bridge. We also took a $10 sunset cruise under the bridge, which was well worth the money, if a little chilly!! Anyway, back to the hotel - I didn't get the chance to meet Wes in person to thank him for his help in making our stay special, but I didn't really have the need to speak to any of the staff apart from at check-in, as we had no problems the entire duration of our stay. That said, whenever we made our way through the entrance foyer, we were always hailed with a greeting by whoever was on the check-in desk. Little things like that, along with the jars of sweets and rubber ducky, made our second stay at the Chancellor just as good, if not better, than our first.

The people at the reception were very friendly but still professional, and helpful. Though, please note that the Chancellor is not a 5 star hotel - my review is based on the fact that for what we paid for the room (some 130 USD per night) the hotel was more than fulfilling my expectations. This hotel was the best value for money that we got during our whole month long stay in the US, and I highly recommend this hotel to others too. The only negative I have is that we took the valet parking which was rather expensive, and when we got the car back it was covered with seagull [--]! Not nice.

This was our first trip to San Francisco and I don't think it will be the last - for all subsequent stays we will choose the Chancellor. Location: You couldn't be better placed to explore the city. The hotel is right in the middle of Union Square, giving you easy access to great restaurants, shops and bars. We found it very easy to walk to all the key areas including Chinatown, Nob Hill, Fisherman's Wharf and the financial district and if we didn't feel like walking, then the cable car and cabs stopped just outside. Room: Was exactly what I expected. Bearing in mind the price, you aren't going to get 5* luxury but I am exceedingly fussy when it comes to hotels and it ticked pretty much every box for me. The room was adequately spacious with nice furniture. The bed was very comfortable and they offer every type of pillow you could possible imagine. The bathroom was fine too with a great shower and free toiletries. The room was cleaned daily. It could get a little warm from time to time, but I found I was cold a lot outside so it was a relief! A tip though, I would request a room away from Powell Street as it could get noisy with the cable car right outside. We were relieved to have a room at the back! Food: We ate at Sears for 3 mornings running which I can highly recommend. However, we ended up using the hotel restaurant for the last 2 mornings and I have to say that I wished we had gone there every day instead! The food was very good quality, a great selection (from unhealthy to healthy), reasonably priced and the staff were very helpful. Staff: The reception and restaurant staff were exemplary, particularly Rory who was very helpful with directions, change and advice for exploring the city. The tour desk lady was also good, although a little abrupt at times. We found ourselves using the reception staff more as they always had a smile. The bar is serviced by their 'employee of the year' who was good but didn't seem to favour the tourists so much, more the regulars! If you want really friendly service I would go elsewhere. All in all, this should be your No.1 choice for a hotel whilst staying in San Francisco! A couple of other tips for the city in general: - Book a night tour to Alcatraz - easily the spookiest way to explore the former prison and escape a majority of the crowds - A wine tour to Napa is well worth it - we used San Francisco Shuttle Tours and it was a brilliant day out with a very helpful tour guide ([--]) -The bay does get cold so bring warm clothes and sensible shoes for all those hills - If you get time, hire bikes from Blazing Saddles and head over the GG bridge to Sausalito which is a beautiful little riverside town - very picturesque. - SF doesn't seem to have a late night life - we headed out for a drink at 10pm on a Friday night and everywhere was shut!", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canton, MI", "Title": "\u201cI have recommended The Chancellor to friends\u201d", "Author": "MIRay", "ReviewID": "UR8655198", "Content": "We found the Chancellor Hotel on Trip Advisor - and were very happy we did.

The staff was very helpful ( printing out directions for us) There is a Computer in the lobby for use at no charge. I had found the Chancellor on Trip Advisor and booked two rooms for my Father -in Law and my husband and I . We had been in monterey for a family wedding and this was our last night before flying home. The rooms are very small but it reminded me of European hotels but this one is much nicer than what I stayed at in Paris. The rooms were newley refirbished and very very clean and fresh. Very tastefuly decorated and we loved the curtians that keep out the early morning light. The hotel offers several types of pillows you can chose from if you do not like the ones in your room and its Free !!. Think of Down, hypoallergic, scented and many more. The beds have tailored bedding with down comforters. The room has no A/C but a celing fan and the windows opened up to let in lot's of air. You do need to close them at night as the city is loud, unless you like that. Yet, when they are closed you don't hear a thing. Impressive windows. The room has a safe, iron & board, soaps, shampoos etc and the signature yellow rubber duck for the bath. We were well taken care of and I would highly recomend the Chancelor... as long as you don't need a large room and like spotless and cozy comfort.. We did. They may have larger rooms I didn't ask but I am sure the excellent staff at the chancelor Hotel would be happy to help. They also offer portable spas for your in room bath. They charge a small fee but I am sure after a busy day in the city a little in-room pampering at such a reasonable fee is worth it. On another note, the Cable Cars pass by the hotel and you can purchase a day pass for $11.00 vs. $5.00 per ride. The hotel offers valet parking and they had our car back to us very quickly in the morning.. Thanks.

By the positive interaction I had had with Wes Tyler, who is the hotel's general manager, and his staff prior to our vacation, I was already certain we were going to have a wonderful stay at the hotel. We rode BART from SFO to the Powell St. station. We had a bit of an uphill walk on very crowded sidewalks to get to the hotel but it wasn\u2019t too bad. Upon check in we were delighted to hear that we had been upgraded to a Romance Suite. This was a wonderful start to an amazing vacation. The lobby of the Chancellor is very lovely. Be sure to check out the elaborate crown moldings. The girl at check in was very welcoming and told us our room would be ready shortly. The delicious cookies I had read about were awaiting us in the lobby so I used our extra time to try one out-Yummy! We also bought our muni passes right there in the lobby. Soon our room was ready and we rode up the elevator to room 1502. I want to add here that contrary to some of the posts I had read, although our room was on the 15th floor ,we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for an elevator. We were pleasantly surprised again by the Chancellor with a wonderful collection of gifts including a lovely wooden picture frame, chocolates, champagne, glasses and a thoughtful card congratulating us on our 20th anniversary (Thanks Wes!). We were so touched. The suite was two adjoining rooms that seemed to have been two identical regular rooms at some point. One had a sofa bed, two chairs, a desk, TV, and a full bath. The other had a queen size bed, armoire, a 2nd TV, side tables and ANOTHER full bath! Upon entering the room with the bed, we felt as if we had tiptoed into the twilight zone. It was so bizarre; the bed had our same Croscill bedding that we have at home! What are the chances? Besides this, the print behind the bed is the exact one that I have in my living room here at home. The armoire was also strikingly similar to ours. I guess Wes and staff really wanted to make us feel at home but I must say it was a little freaky! It is an old hotel with lots of character. I loved the enormous arched windows in both rooms as well as the crown moldings and walk in closet. There were also hard candies and magazines provided in the room which was a nice touch. Both bathrooms had a slight step up to them as well as VERY deep bathtubs. Although the tubs had handrails, I could see where the bathrooms could be very difficult for anyone with mobility impairments. The bathroom amenities included swabs, cotton balls, soaps, shampoo/conditioner (bring your own if like me, you don\u2019t like the mix), lotion, bath salts and an adorable rubber ducky (the ducky can go home with you, I asked!). The hotel also offered free wireless service in the room which my husband was very happy about. There was also free internet use in the lobby. In addition to the cookies, there were apples, coffee and fresh hot popcorn provided each day. There was also an extensive pillow menu that you could choose from with magnetic, snore stopping, bath and a variety of other pillows. We found the ones on the bed so comfortable that we didn't feel a need to try any others. The bed was also quite comfortable. Between the armoire, nightstand tables and the deep closet, we had more than enough room to store our belongings. There was also a safe in the room and a radio with an MP3 hook up. In the bathroom, there was a spa item menu that you could rent items from. Everything had to be returned by 12:00 the next day. There was a foot massager, bubble pad, a whirlpool machine and a variety of other items. I rented the whirlpool machine for my aching legs but it didn't seem to work very well, maybe because the tub is so deep. I let the girt at the desk know this and although I didn't ask for it to be done, I noticed I wasn't charged for it when I checked out. As we entered through the door of our room after exploring the city the first day, there was a strange intermittent blinking red light greeting us. Could it be that we had truly entered the Twilight Zone? As it turns out, there is a very large blinking neon sign for Harry Denton\u2019s Starlight Room at the Sir Francis Drake right outside our room! We pulled the curtains shut which obliterated all but a slight twinkling rosy glow and fell asleep to the ding of the cable cars and the music of the night. We didn't find the light or the outside noise bothersome. We did have the window closed every night but the ceiling fan provided sufficient cooling. In case you don't already know, there is no air conditioning in the hotel! The trolley does stop right outside the hotel, but during our summer stay it was very busy unless it was early in the morning. There are many bus stops nearby and Chinatown, Nob Hill and North Beach are an easy (although sometimes hilly) walk. There are also lots and lots and lots of stores withing walking distance. We had a view of many of these as well as the square from our window. We did have the pleasure of meeting the celebrated Wes Tyler during our stay. He was as nice in person as he seems to be in his responses in the TripAdvisor forum. There was a fire drill planned at the hotel later in the day and although he seemed busy, he still took the time to meet with us. We thanked him for our spacious room and the thoughtful gifts that were left for us. All of the staff at the hotel were very friendly and personable throughout our stay. Check out was very simply and quick too. If you are expecting a luxurious, modern, state of the art hotel you will probably be quite disappointed here. If you are expecting abundant smiles and pleasant service, thoughtful (and quacking) amenities, wonderful architectural details in a historic building, and a fantastic location, your expectations will be exceeded!", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bayside, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay - Very Professiol and Helpful Staff\u201d", "Author": "mikejayphoto", "ReviewID": "UR8349470", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 2 days in early August.

We ate at the restaurant next door which sometimes had long queues (forgotten the name) but it was very disappointing (dull American fixed menu - sorry) and service was poor - 10 minute wait at the bar for a table but no bar service and no wine list offered at the table. There was one but it took so long to get it the food was delivered! The Italian restaurant opposite the hotel was the fantastic - we didn't book a table (advised) but as we were early (6pm) and agreed to eat within the hour we got a table. Really great food served by friendly staff and the same price as the other restaurant. Wish I hadn't been with children as it had a very buzzy cocktail bar section and it looked fun.

This year, we stayed six nights at the Chancellor Hotel after reading many excellent reviews of the property on TripAdvisor. The hotel far exceeded our expectations. We stayed in Room 1000, requesting this particular room after reading reviews indicating how nice a room it was. The hotel graciously granted our room request. The room overlooked Powell Street, and on a clear day, we could see the Ferry Building Clock Tower. The ceiling fan combined with an open window provided more than adequate air circulation. The sounds of cable cars and street traffic were all part of the SF experience and were welcomed by my wife and me. Many people have noted the excellent location of the Chancellor with respect to shopping, tourist attractions, restaurants, etc... All of this is very true. We used mass transit (cable cars, streetcars, Muni trains and buses) to go wherever we wished to go. This was very economical (7 Day Muni Passport) and convenient. We took advantage of the Giants baseball package on two of the days of our visit. This not only allowed us to have terrific field level seating for the baseball games, but also provided us with food/beverage credits in the hotel restaurant and bar. We ate breakfast in Luques Restaurant (within the hotel) on three different mornings. The food was excellent (especially the French Toast) and the restaurant staff very pleasant. In fact, the entire hotel staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and \"at home.\" Our room was more than adequate in size for two adults. The safe within the room was a very nice feature as was the extra large closet, and the housekeeping service was excellent. The hotel staff was gracious enough to store our luggage during the day we checked out until late afternoon since our flight home was a late night flight.

We stayed here mid June 2007 & can only say that it lived up to our expectations.

The room was clean & comfortable & the choice of pillow menus' is a nice touch! The bed was comfy, we slept well (with the occasional noise of the San Francisco Fire department rushing through town - but Wes can't control that) and the welcoming gift to mark our Silver Wedding was a lovely touch. As Wes says - the rooms aren't huge with acres of free space, but they do the job & are clean and comfortable. We made full use of the free coffee in the reception area, and took advantage of the free internet access at reception - just ask. Staff were helpful, friendly & courteous with any questions about getting around town.

We nearly starved in the morning by their non-existent breakfast, cookies and coffee only! To top it all off, we were harassed by a vagrant outside the hotel! OK, none of that is true. Did I trick you Wes? I read every single review before visiting this hotel and researched the hotel's web site and others. I got exactly what I expected and we had a great time. I am always hot, but there really is no need for a/c in SF. We actually closed the window at night because it was a little chilly. I can't see a need for anymore than 2 elevators? We never had to wait more than a minute or two for it to come. The rooms were a bit small compared to other hotels I've stayed, but we spend only sleeping time in the room. Even if we spent more time in the room, I don't believe I would have a problem with the size. Yes, when the window is open, it is very noisy outside, but I enjoyed it. I live in a quiet suburb and it was exciting having the business of the city right outside. When I did want it quiet, we closed the window and hardly heard a thing, we were on the 6th floor not the 15th. I'm not sure what people are talking about paper thin walls. Our walls in room 600 were solid masonry. Maybe we didn't have any neighbors during our stay, but I couldn't imagine it being noisy still. The hotel never advertised any breakfast of any kind, so this was not a shock. But the cookies were delicious and we had one everyday, I'm not a coffee drinker, so that didn't bother me. Sears Fine Food next door has a great breakfast. And yes, there are homeless people and street entertainers on the streets of San Francisco that will ask for money, but I don't know if there are any hotels in SF that can say this won't be the case.

It is a nicely sized room for a boutique hotel of its vintage and quite honestly still comparable to many rooms that are much much newer. Bless you all that read and post on this site but I think too many of you, especially those of us here on the West Coast have been spoiled by the luxury SUITES in Las Vegas and compare those to regular hotels. Remember, those are suites and they're primary goal is to get you into their hotel so that you gamble and leave all your money behind. That's not so with this hotel. I found the staff to be extraordinary, they never tried to upsell me anything, whether it be tours, upgrade rooms or even their room service or restaurant. In fact I asked several of the staff for advice on numerous things and they always suggested what would be the easiest and cheapest way of doing things. I found that very refreshing. They spoke to me as a friend and not some pre-rehearsed routine like so many of the big hotels do. They weren't trying to take my money, they were trying to help me enjoy my whole San Francisco experience. I'm not sure what General Manager Wes Tyler puts in their water, but whatever it is...it works. They entire staff has bought into it and the funny thing about it is, I think he's told them to just be themselves and not worry about impressing the guests...BUT I AM IMPRESSED.

I chose the hotel as it was recommended by Trailfinders who said their guests loved it, and despite extensive research on the net and Tripadvisor I could not see another hotel I would prefer. We arrived at the hotel at 1.30 am after a nightmare 24 hour, 3 flight due to plane delays, journey from the UK (7 hours late). After taking a minibus from the airport we checked in and were warmly welcomed, no queue due to lateness of the hour. I had emailed the manager in advance and he had allocated us a high floor (14th) room with a view of Union Square as requested. A bottle of wine on ice and a lovely giftwrapped photograph frame were waiting for us due to this being our honeymoon. I must be in the minority as I did not think our standard room was small at all, average and above average compared to many UK hotel rooms (it was half as big again as the room we spent our wedding night in, in Scotland, although I appreciate many US hotels have larger rooms) and, given the massive walk-in cupboard with two luggage holders for storing our suitcases and hand luggage, I found the room spacious and not cramped at all. Nice sized bathroom with toiletries and bath salts as well as the renowned rubber duck! I also chose from the pillow menu the next day. I knew there was no air conditioning as it is listed against all the information you read about this hotel, e.g brochures, Tripadvisor, net info and hotel website so It's really not a surprise. We found the ceiling fan to be sufficent in October. We never had to wait long for a lift/elevator and I never noticed any \"shabbiness\" in the bedroom or public areas which other guests have remarked upon (and our visit was some time ago before renovations). Maybe I am lax in choosing not to inspect every surface and drapery looking for minor flaws but I was on holiday and it all seemed ok to me. The location is spot on, right next to Union Square and 2 cable car routes. It's not far to walk to get onto the various bus routes either, Susan at the Tour Desk told us the buses we needed to get to Golden Gate Park for example. She also booked our return transport to the airport. We received two complimentary $5 cable car postcard passes on check in, but as we purchased the excellent value $18 3 day muni passes, we kept these as souvenirs. I loved riding the cable cars for fun as well as for getting places. We found the people very friendly and the city very cosmopolitan, I was surprised how much at home I felt. Had a lovely boat trip on the Bay under the Golden Gate Bridge and a separate ferry trip to Alcatraz which is unmissable - make sure you get the audioguide tour. An ex-inmate Darwin Coon was signing copies of his book on the day we visited Alcatraz and answering questions - an unexpected bonus. The hotel does a nice breakfast and we used our 10% discount coupon given at check in for this. We also had to visit Sears Fine Foods next door given the high recommendations it receives but I found little difference between the two. We also had a good value breakfast at Lefty O'Doul's two blocks away and enjoyed visiting this bar at night too. Met some very interesting people! Alicia at the bar at the Chancellor was attentive and my husband had a few drinks here through our visit whilst waiting for me to get ready oh and to watch the sports on TV. Various complimentary foodstuffs and tea/coffee are available in the lobby although we never took advantage of these due to eating so well. Location wise we much preferred the city centre location as compared to Fisherman's Wharf (an easy cable car ride away), plus you can walk lots of places, Chinatown is not far, and we used the buses, cable cars and streetcars to go further afield. I had added San Francisco to our trip after deciding against Hawaii and it went from being our third choice city to first place. I definitely left my heart in San Francisco and can't wait to go back.

I chose the Chancellor because of location, price, and most importantly, the rave reviews on Trip Advisor. Not only was I not disappointed, I was totally blown away by the high level of service I received from the entire staff. This was my first time traveling a long distance alone with my 15-year-old daughter (we're from the east coast), and I was pretty anxious about the trip. My daughter has type 1 diabetes and is insulin-dependent. She is also a typical teenager. Having read about the small rooms, I was somewhat concerned that we would drive each other crazy. I requested a quiet room on an upper floor and a refrigerator for my daughter's insulin. We were given a corner room on the 14th floor at the back of the hotel. I found the room size to be perfectly fine. It was very clean, bright, and not crowded at all. As others have mentioned, the closet is very large. We had room for all of our stuff, and knowing how changeable the SF weather can be, we brought enough clothes for a month-long stay! The room was extremely quiet with the windows closed. However, our location was perfect for leaving them open and enjoying the sounds of the city without being overwhelmed by the noise. I can't speak about thin walls because the room beside us was empty during our entire five-night stay. The central location is excellent. We went all over the city and only used public transportation (get a Muni pass!) and foot power. Exploring SF this way really enhanced our experience. I cannot speak highly enough about the staff. One incident will stand out for me forever. The refrigerator in our room froze several cartridges of two types of insulin, and they could no longer be used. My health insurance company refused to allow me to use a co-pay when replacing the insulin. The total out-of-pocket cost was over $350! I was very shaken and upset. When I spoke to hotel staff, they immediately offered to buy the insulin for me. A member of the desk staff, Mike, walked with me to Walgreens, waited with me while the prescriptions were filled, and paid the pharmacy for the insulin. While we waited, he was very kind and reassuring. He told me over and over that I should not worry about anything and should just enjoy my trip. I am a single mom on a very tight budget. This meant the world to me. I will never forget that kindness. I get teary-eyed just thinking about it. Wes has stated over and over on Trip Advisor that if you need something, just ask. My experience is proof that he means what he says. I wish I could give the Chancellor more than five stars because they earned it. Wes, I know you read all of the reviews here.

A few tips for SF travellers in the Union Square area - the service at Lori's Diner a short distance away was terrible, avoid it if you can. Also, although Union Square itself is nice, if you walk too far in the wrong direction you can find yourself in a pretty shady area. Of course this is no reflection on the hotel, which is in a nice area. Chinatown is the perfect place to find tourist souvenirs for family and friends. You won't find better prices anywhere else, and Chinatown is five minutes away from the Chancellor. Once again, stay at the Chancellor.

I did not have any trouble with the walls being too thin. The beds were very comfortable and the large bathtub was great. I did not eat in the hotel restaurant but did enjoy the cookies and coffee in the lobby. Everytime I had a question about the city I found the front desk to be very courteous and helpful. I had a wonderful time in SF and if I go there again, I will stay at the Chancellor without a doubt.", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cEnjoying the Chancellor as I write this\u201d", "Author": "Cruisedave", "ReviewID": "UR7479797", "Content": "I am staying at the hotel right now and I must say everything is right on as far as the reviews.

We were wrong. We were surprised and delighted by the Chancellor Hotel. We live in Mexico now, where we own a hotel ourselves. When we knew we were going back to San Francisco to visit family and friends of course we turned to tripadvisor, where we saw that the Chancellor had been named a Travelers Choice Best Bargain (like our own hotel!), so we booked it sight unseen. It was absolutely perfect. The location is great. Right in the heart of downtown San Francisco on Union Square, it is walking distance to plenty of fine shopping and restaurants. The Powell St. cable car line goes right by the front door of the hotel and will take you over to the Wharf area in a few minutes. Or, make the walk to either North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf or Chinatown--all are an invigorating walk and part of the fun of being in San Francisco. Our room overlooked the street with a view of Union Square. At night we would open the window and listen to a street musician\u2019s saxophone echoing through the Square accompanied by the occasional clang of cable car bells. The faint sounds of Disney music coming from the Disney store a couple of doors away also made us smile during the day. The slogan on the Chancellor\u2019s comment card is \u201cA three diamond hotel in a five star location.\u201d Perfect description! San Francisco, as can sometimes happen, was in fine form the week we were there. As if to beckon us back home, it was absolutely seductive with sunny but breezy days and crisp nights. The comfort of the Chancellor really added to that experience. It made us very homesick for our City by the Bay! The Chancellor was built in 1914 and is a San Francisco classic. Rooms are small but very clean and comfortable with 40s/50\u2019s style furniture. Bathrooms are also small but modern. Each room we stayed in had a huge walk in closet, so despite the fact that the room was rather small, our luggage and clothing were completely out of the way in the large closet. There are great little touches like hair dryers, umbrellas (it is SF after all!), bath salts and powders, free dependable wireless internet and a pillow menu from which you can select from several types of pillows. When we checked in, we were even given a discount card for shopping at Macy\u2019s, which was a nice treat, since we had planned to do some shopping while in the States. In the lobby you will find free cookies, apples and coffee 24 hours a day. We only had the cookies once a day. Really. :) Even parking, which is always a headache in San Francisco, was made easy by the Chancellor. We had a rental car, and parking was a breeze at the garage just around the corner. Our room rate included the cost of parking there. We could have paid a few dollars extra for valet parking, but being from the City, driving and parking there is second nature to us, so we just parked & picked up our car ourselves. We stayed several days at the Chancellor and then left to visit family in Sacramento. When we returned to the hotel two days later we were treated like old friends and even given gift cards good at Luque\u2019s, the hotel\u2019s restaurant, enabling us to eat breakfast or lunch each day for the rest of our stay. As they said at the front desk, \u201cWe like to take care of our return guests.\u201d (We did have breakfast at Luque\u2019s one morning, and it was great. Even better than the one we had at the legendary Sears Fine Foods just next door.) On our last night we were up late packing, as we had to leave at a ridiculously early hour for the airport. As we were trying to guess if we were within the 50 pound limit for each of our bags, on a lark, we called the front desk to ask if they had a scale. They did!! They think of everything at the Chancellor. The staff was wonderful. From Kevin in reservations, to the front desk receptionists, to the people who brought pillows to the room on request, everyone was friendly and helpful. And the price was excellent. This hotel is truly a \u201cBest Bargain.\u201d You can probably find similar prices in modern box-like structures on the edges of the City. However, the Chancellor is a true San Francisco experience that allows you to be central to and part of one of the world\u2019s greatest cities for a reasonable price.

It is charming with an intimate feeling, small enough to feel at home but right in the heart of The City, accessible to everything. The staff was friendly and welcoming, informative and efficient. There are so many touches that make the hotel special. First, and foremost, it is clean and well cared for with much attention to detail. Ammenities such as comfortable beds, a pillow menu,ceiling fans, a walk in-closet with with a safe, a portable heater, iron and ironing board and an umbrella, plus ample room for hanging clothes as well as storing luggage . The bathroom had a soaking tub complete with bath salts and fine toiletries(as well a a rubber ducky!).There were sweets and coffee in the room as well as delicious Italian Roast coffee,cookies and apples in the lobby, along with free newspapers and WIFI computer access.

A few months back, I started making plans to attend MacWorld San Francisco, which takes place every January. My wife and I had a baby girl last March, and she was 10 months old in January, making it OK for us to take our first \"baby-free\" vacation. :) After ensuring that my in-laws would be able to keep her for a few days, we started making plans. MacWorld started on Monday, January 8th, so we made arrangements to fly out there the Friday before (the 5th). My wife would stay through the morning of the 9th and fly home, after which I'd move to the official MacWorld hotel (the Marriott on 4th Street) for the remainder of my stay. But for our time in SF together, we wanted a smaller hotel, a more romantic hotel than the gigantic Marriott. We started looking on TripAdvisor, epinions, and some other places, and found that the Chancellor Hotel got consistently good reviews, and was less expensive than many places in the Union Square area. The one liability of the Chancellor seemed to be that some rooms were noisy, particularly rooms that had a connecting door to the room next door. However, people raved about the staff, particularly Wes Tyler, the general manager, who has a very noticeable presence on TA, responding to people's comments, compliments, and complaints. So, I sent Wes an email, explaining the situation. I told him that this would be our first vacation since the baby was born, and that it was my wife's first trip to San Francisco in nearly 20 years. He responded quickly with an amazing offer -- if I'd book directly with the Chancellor, he'd upgrade us to a top floor suite for the price of a regular room ($125/night). Of course, we took that deal!!! So for two months, we waited for our SF vacation, and January finally came!!! After a moderately-tearful departure from our little girl, we boarded our Southwest flight in Birmingham, changed planes in Las Vegas, and arrived at Oakland International in the late afternoon. After a harrowing shuttle trip (I will never use SuperShuttle again!) we arrived at the Chancellor around dinnertime. The front desk clerk was efficient and polite, and got us checked it quickly. The lobby was understated, clean and pretty. A few comfy chairs in the front near the windows, with the bar and lounge at the back of the lobby, next to to the elevators. We boarded the elevators and headed up to the 14th floor to see our room. It was, in a word, gorgeous!!! What they've done for these top floor suites (I believe there are 4 total) is to combine two regular rooms into a suite. So we entered into a living room, with a couch, a comfortable chair, coffee table, small dining table, and TV. There was also a coffee maker and refrigerator. Through the connecting doorway was the bedroom, with a gorgeous four-poster bed, an armoire hiding another TV, and two chairs. There was also a gift package for us, consisting of a bottle of champagne, two Chancellor champagne flutes, and a boxed wooden picture frame with the Chancellor's name on it. Lovely. The view from the room was very nice, overlooking Union Square from above. In the day time, you could also get a glimpse of San Francisco Bay between the skyscrapers. Each half of the suite had its own bathroom, with a large bathtub and Chancellor-labelled rubber ducks. We took one home for our daughter, of course!!! That first night, the temperature had dropped substantially, and the Chancellor's heating system wasn't quite making it toasty on the top floor. A quick call down to the front desk resulted in a small space heater being delivered to our room. (On subsequent nights, the temperature in the room was just fine.) The location of the Chancellor is as perfect as it could be. Right on Powell Street, a half-block from Union Square, directly on the cable car lines. An easy walk to Chinatown, which is what we did for dinner the first night. Also an easy walk to Market Street, and the connections to the BART and SF Muni transit systems. On our last day at the Chancellor, we checked our bags with the bell desk after checking out of the room. My wife did some Union Square shopping while I headed over to MacWorld to check in, and to the Marriott to claim my room there. After an afternoon visit to the Anchor Brewing Company for their tour (highly recommended, if only for the SIX glasses of free beer!) we caught a cab back to the Chancellor to pick up our bags. The staff was again very helpful and assisted us loading our HEAVY bags into the cab. All in all, highly recommended. The Chancellor is a beautiful, charming hotel in the perfect San Francisco location.

We will be back.", "Date": "January 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upland, California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nomossgrows", "ReviewID": "UR6589928", "Content": "I had the pleasue of staying at the Chancellor Hotel for 2 days during the Macworld Conference this year. It was my first time to stay here, but certainly not the last. I booked a quiet room on a higher floor, and they delivered. I didn't come to San Francisco for a view -- I came to see the city up front and personal, so having a big, fancy room with a city view was not important to me. I found the room (906) clean, well-stocked and comfortable. The walk-in closet with safe worked perfectly to secure my belongings while at the conference. An extra blanket and pillows were available in the closet, and many other choices of pillows and spa items are available from the front desk just for the asking. The front desk personnel were very accomodating, allowing my brother and I to print out our boarding passes from the provided computer and free internet service. Coffee, tea and free cookies were also available at the desk -- no need for a coffee maker in the room. The charm of this hotel is unbeatable.

Got a package deal through Expedia and saved about the cost of one night's stay. The GM seemed quite responsive to questions and requests, so I thought I would drop him an email and find out for myself. I received a prompt response and got exactly what i requested (high floor room with a bit of a view, and breakfast recommendations). So many people have already said great things about this hotel, so I'll probably repeat a few here. This is what stood out for the hotel in my mind -- some stuff might seem minor to most, but it's little things we sometimes take for granted: -- Polite, attentive staff: Everyone always said 'hello'. -- Elevators: My wife doesn't like elevators that feel cramped and old. These ones got my wife's approval. And not only that, they were fast, and there were two. -- TV: Reception was perfect, and included HBO. The last two hotels we stayed at had issues, and it's always nice to watch a little television after a long day on your feet. -- Free coffee in the lobby: not only free, but always hot! I've stayed at hotels that offer free coffee, but don't keep it very warm after hours. -- Free newspaper: always a nice touch. -- Location: Maybe the most ideal location in Union Square if you really want to be picky: For example -- 12 minutes by foot to Moscone, 15 minutes by foot to House of Nanking in Chinatown, and neither involve a big uphill walk! If anyone is interested, our room (1403) was relatively quiet (the only thing you ever heard was the fire truck or police sirens), very spacious (for a boutique hotel), and had an OK view of the Square. What has been a bit of a tradition with my reviews is some tips that I could share that may help some fellow travellers: - Lori's Diner: Nothing special, but the food is priced well, especially since their website has a 20% off coupon. Google it and print a few for your trip. - Sushi joint: my favorite is Sanraku on Sutter. Sit at the bar, chat with the chefs, and watch'em work! - Chinese food: House of Nanking on Kearny. They rush the patrons a bit, but so what? The food is great and two people can leave with full tummies for $20. - Pub crawls: Thirsty Bear and 21st Ammendment are quite good. Try the watermelon wheat beer at the '21A'. The 21A is a bit of a walk from Union Square, but it is doable. Google for them both to check out the menus and exact locations. - Out-of-town excursions: If you are an Apple-fan, head south to Cupertino to see the Apple Campus. If not, head south to Palo Alto and have lunch at Stanford University. Free shuttle around the campus. We ate at Ciao! in the Terman Engineering Complex. Good food for a great price.

The few requests we had of the front desk were all dealt with professionally and promptly. Basically, we couldn't fault the place and now the best part...it's location. You are right on union square near all the shops, the cable car station (which takes you straight to fisherman's wharf), chinatown, bars and nightlife, and also the BART station which we took across to Oakland for the Raiders game. I have stayed in Fisherman's wharf and you somehow feel safer on union square as well as having more to do and see within walking distance of your hotel.

From the moment of our arrival the staff made us feel welcome. I'd e-mailed Wes Tyler the week before to ask for a room with a view and also mentioned it was our honeymoon. The room we were given on the 13th floor had a great view over Union Square and we were also provided with complimentary champagne and a Chancellor Hotel photo frame which was a nice touch. As other reviews have stated, the rooms are fairly small, however I've never understood why anybody needs a huge hotel room. I go on holiday to see places not stay in my room! The room was cleaned meticulously every day and had all the facilities we needed. The location of the hotel could not be better - accessibility to all the attractions is great due to the cable car stopping right outside the door and all the other MUNI links being accessible from the bottom of Powell Street. My only advice is that if you need a taxi I wouldn't ask the bell boy to hail you one. When we asked him, he told us that we basically had no chance at that time of day because all the taxi's coming down the street would go straight to the hotel opposite (where the bell boy had a whistle to flag down cabs). He did try though. Eventually he advised us to stand in line at one of the larger hotels a couple of blocks down the street as we'd be more likely to get a result. This should not be taken as a criticism in any way as I'm sure the larger hotel was much more expensive than the Chancellor and was able to employ someone to spend all day hailing cabs!! When I'm next in San Francisco I'll definitely stay at the Chancellor again. Why do I say that this hotel offers 5 star service?

The reason I am not giving the hotel and GM Wes Tyler the fith star is quite simple. At the time of our stay, a very rude and patronizing person was given a job behind the information desk. Not only did she give us a hard time when booking for things such as a boat ride to Alcatraz (-On a Saturday? Nothing available, next time think in advance- she replied walking away from us towards the main door with her hands at her back) but to our every request/concern she seemed annoyed!. In additon, she offerred to post our 6 postcards for us for which we gave her $10 (she said each stamp would cost $1). Postcards were never received by anyone. And it was dissaponting.

However, I was disappointed since most of your reviewers like this hotel a lot. I have to say in fairness that the main problem we experienced may have been peculiar to the room we had. I was very tired when we arrived and the first night I slept until 5 am when I was awakened by an irritating hummng noise but I didn't worry too much since it went away at about 6 am. However, the next night I was awakened in the early hours by the same noise and we got little sleep for the rest of the night. I tried unplugging various things but to no effect and I eventually decided that the noise was coming from an electrical device outside the room and located behind the bed. Again it went away at 6 am. I would have asked for a room change but we were leaving that morning. At departure I mentioned our bad experience to the staff and they said they would certainly have given us a room change, but I am sure they were aware of the problem with that room. As for the rest of the hotel I can say that it was satisfactory: our room wasn't particularly small, and the decor was OK except for the carpet which had seen better days and which had some strange white marks on it as though someone had tried to clean it with bleach. There were no coffee making facilities in the room but coffee was freely available in the lobby. The location of the hotel was wonderful. My only other gripe is that about a month before our stay I tried to book a room online using the hotel website but I was told that there were none available but because of the reviews the hotel receives on Tripadvisor I persisted and I obtained a room through an agent but this may have increased the cost - the Chancellor was the most expensive hotel on my recent visit to California.

We just got back from out trip and spent 3 nights at the Chancellor 9-14-06 to 9-17-06. Everyone on the list was right that Union Square is the best area to be in. We visited Fishermans Wharf but way way too crowded. This was our first trip to San Francisco and we are so happy that we went with the Chancellor. All the reviews were wonderful and Wes Tyler is the best General Manager I have ever worked with. Unfortunately we did not get to meet Wes in person though I feel like I know him already from this list. He is always so helpful and never pushes the Chacellor. If someone seems to want something different he will recommend other places. That impressed me. When we first pulled up to the Chancellor I thought this area is really old I hope I didn't make a mistake. Even though it is very old, it is so unique and does not look old inside or smell old like some places do. It is very clean, very elegant but in its own way. The rooms are smaller but not that small. We had a bed (which I slept great in which is unusual for me - the buckwheat pillow I picked from the menu helped!! I'm buying a couple for home). We had the usual dresser, desk, tv, side tables, 2 chairs and a table by the window. We also were able to put 2 of those fold up suitcase holders in 2 corners of the room for our suitcase. So to be able to do that it can't be that small. He put a couple nice extra's in there for us plus their usual amenities, jar full of hard candy, umbrella (thankfully we did not need it), iron, ironing board, safe, qtips, cotton balls, shampoo, lotion, bath salts, and shower cap. Also a pillow menu and menu with massagers too if you want to use for a small fee. The bathtub is unreal. You can be on one end and try your hardest and you cannot touch the other end. It is that long. And deep.....I was trying to fill it up but after half hour finally gave up and took my bath,,,,,I think in a half hour I did not even get it half full. Yep that is how deep it is. We asked for a back room so it would be quiet. Well it was not totally quiet but that was a good thing. We went to sleep with the faint sound of a jazz horn playing. HOW COOL IS THAT?? I wish I were bak there now....it seems so long ago, not just a week. My big worry was air conditioning...I am an air conditioning addict and was so afraid it would get hot and stuffy. Was I surprised. Its nice to have the window open and small breeze, no bugs or anything to worry about there. But at night it actually got so cold we had to close the window and turn the paddle fan off. Believe me I was most surprised by that. Though the streets and muni system did confuse us a bit, I do think that the Chancellor is a good central location. We could walk 2 blocks over and 2 blocks up to Chinatown,,,that was fun. Everyone working at the Chancellor is extra nice . You can tell it iis not just a job but that they really take pride in working there and its as if they are welcoming you into their home. I will always highly recommend the Chancellor to anyone going to San Francisco. I'll put a trip report on the San Francisco Forum within a week or so. Oh how can I forget the most important!

I booked with the Chancellor primarily because of the reviews on Trip Advisor, and I wasn't disappointed. This is a great hotel. I requested a room with lots of light and a view if possible, and I received it. The staff was incredibly helpful and the food (I only had breakfast) in the restaurant was very good. As for the room (I was in 1003), it was on the small side. For one person it was quite comfortable but probably not what you are looking for if you want a romantic getaway. I loved the bathroom with the huge soaking tub and the window that looked out onto the fire escape. There was wonderful natural light in the bathroom which is something you won't find at other hotels. I could picture Sam Spade crawling out the bathroom window and escaping down the fire escape when the person he was investigating arrived back at his room. There was a big window in the room which i always left open a bit. You could definitely hear the street noise, but I got used to it quickly and it created a feeling that i was really in the city. The flashing pink sign from the starlight dance hall across the street softly flashed through the window at night. Someone might find that irritating, but I found it charming and it didn't interfere with my sleep. The free wireless worked perfectly for me. The bed was very comfortable. The closet was spacious, but the drawers on the chest under the TV did stick , and I figured out I couldn't close them all the way. The staff were all sweet, solicitous, and polite. I was only there for a few days but they recognized me and treated me with familiarity. The lady selling the tours I would call the \"Tour Nazi.\" She's very intimidating, but I think she is an independent contractor with the hotel. HOWEVER, the assistance she did give me was right on target and just what I needed. Just be prepared for her firm, no-nonsense manner. Unfortunately, I had to cut my stay short in San Francisco and at the hotel. I had to check out earlier than planned. I gave the front desk the appropriate notice, and they didn't blink an eye about it or give me any grief. I could go on and on about the hotel. I would definitely stay there again. However, just because there are well-deserved high reviews of this place, don't expect a luxury hotel.

They gave us a bonus breakfast card for the value of $42 ( although its not a huge amount for 2 people for 3 days, still they didn'thave to give it to us) and they left a bottle of champayne in our room as i'd written during the booking that we were a honeymoon couple. The hotel is in good condition. Guests can have free coffee, biscuits, newspaper, fruit and internet access in reception area. The cable car runs right outside the front door too.

I do not feel like to write a huge review here as the many great posts are largely accurate: - The location is brilliant \u2013 I don\u2019t think that you are likely to find a better location anywhere in the whole of San Francisco. Shops, bars and restaurants are all on the doorstep, and Sears Fine Foods is next door. This is a perfect place for breakfast or brunch. - The price is very competitive. - Free tea and coffee is a bonus although once I had to wait for fifteen minutes when the bellboy went and restocked all three flasks. Cookies are very tasty. This service may only be available because there are no facilities in the rooms. - The free Internet is great and the two times I used it I didn\u2019t have to queue. Note there is only one PC for guests to use. - The reception staff were friendly and helpful. However, there are a few things that all potential guests should be aware of: - The bedrooms are described as \u2018European\u2019 and \u2018boutique\u2019. This is just flowery language for \u2018small\u2019, \u2018poorly laid out\u2019 and \u2018in need of modernising\u2019. - On a number of occasions we waited for quite some time for the lift only to find to full to capacity. We then just used the stairs and still had time to pour ourselves a coffee before the lift finally made it to the lobby! - Our room was not spotlessly clean as so many guests state. In fact, it was not clean at all. The skirting boards were filthy, as was the whole content of the walk-in wardrobe. My photo shows just how dusty the tissue holder in the bathroom was. It must have taken months of not being cleaned to get into this state. I\u2019m writing this fully aware that Wes will write a \u2018management response\u2019 saying that had I made him aware of dirt and grime problem during my stay it would have been sorted out, but room cleanliness is vastly different from reporting a faulty lock or broken light bulb. After weighing up the pros and cons, I\u2019m really not sure whether I would choose to stay here again or not. I hope that everyone finds this to be a fair and reasonable review.

When you read it and the postive trip advisor reviews you know what you will get. You will stay in a \"real hotel\" that has not been modernised by the big chains. You will know this hotel represents excellent value for money hotel and you will know it has small bedrooms and bathrooms. You will know the staff will be polite and friendly and the hotel will be nice and clean. You will know there is no A/C and you know that if something does go wrong the staff will help you sort it out. Finally you will know you are in an old building in the heart of an historical city . So that's exactly what you should expect and that's what we got! We stayed for four nights in July and booked a suite and a twin room for the children. The rooms were small but had everyhting we needed including a huge wardrobe so we could get the suitcases out of the way. The bathrooms were a little dated BUT they were immaculately clean, an adequate size and had an excellent shower. There were nice touches in the rooms - A jar of sweets (candies), the little yellow duck in the bathroom and the bottle of wine. A CD player in the rooms was a bonus as was the wire to connect ourt MP3 player to it. The pillow menu is a great idea. Things like this make you realise that you are staying in a hotel where the managers really care about the comfort of their guests. We enjoyed the coffee and cookies in the lobby, we appreciated the help offered when we asked questions. We liked being in the centre of town. We took good advice from the gift shop and bought a pass for all the public transport which was great value for money. Yes we did hear the noises of the city but how much better is that than being in the sterile envoironment of a triple glazed air conditioned room? We travelled the ocean to experience all the SFO has to offer and that includes her sounds. I am fortuntate that I stay in many quality hotels.

European is a good word for it, but the spacing is just right for two people and the beds were comfy. (I've lived in Europe for a few years so I can say that).

Foleys (Irish Pub) on O'Farrell only a few blocks from the hotel. We also got a 3 day Muni pass for $18.00 for the Trolleys and public transportation. This was great because we would hop on and hop off all day as we saw all the sights. At the Chancellor you can pick up the Trolley just a few doors away.

We stayed 2 nights (May 11- May 13) before flying back to boring England (nobody ever left their heart there). There was a mix-up involving our pick-up from the Cruise Terminal which was quickly resolved. A compensatory bottle of wine was waiting for us in our room. We thought this was rather generous - unneccessary but very kind all the same. The breakfast component of the bread and breakfast package (and I don't believe this was made clear on the website) was worth $14 (as is now clearly stated on the Summer Value Package). This, in contrast, we thought was rather cheap as $7 per person wouldn't buy much at all (three quarters of a blueberry omelette, I think). After a quick chat with the front desk, this was upgraded to $28 which is sufficient for two people to indulge in one of their four (very tasty) breakfast packages (e.g. juice, tea/coffee, toast, vegetable omelette) valued at $12-13 approx. So my only suggestion to the management is to do likewise - change your current and future packages from a $14 per room restaurant allowance to (a more realistic) $28.

While we enjoyed our visit and thought that the Chancellor was certainly a value, there are a couple things I would warn fellow travellers about: If you are a light sleeper, request a room that isn't adjoining with another one (doesn't have a door in between). We had a couple with a very small child next door to us, and we could hear every noise that the baby made, including when it started shrieking at 3 in the morning. I realize that it is an old building and so might have thin walls, but the noise was unbearable. We called down the desk to see if we could switch rooms, but were told that since it was past 10 o'clock there was no way we could switch because there were no other rooms made up. This seemed unnecessary -- why wouldn't you have rooms made up in case guests need to switch or a guest wanted to check-in late at night? And how were we supposed to know that it would be too loud to sleep until we had actually tried to go to bed? They also claimed to have white noise machines available, but one was lent out and the other was broken. We did end up switching rooms after a night of bad sleep, but the whole thing was a hassle and extremely frustrating. The second room was much much quieter (no adjoining room). The rooms were decently sized, bigger than what I expected after reading reviews. The pillows that came with the room were horrible, but that was remedied by calling down to the front desk and ordering off of the pillow menu. All in all, it seemed like the hotel could have spent more effort on getting the little things right in the first place and less on \"luxury\" add-ons that just seemed out of place (the pillow menu, or the \"spa\" menu in the bathroom). Also be warned that the location of the hotel is right on Union Square, and while that might be great for those who are visiting the city for the first time, I wouldn't stay in that exact area again. Everything around the hotel is extremely touristy, which makes it hard to do things like grabbing breakfast or drinks quickly and cheaply. It's a good place from which to see the city for the first time, but the whole cable car/giant chain stores/lots of homeless people/bad food thing gets old pretty quickly.

I have to say that I researched various places quite carefully prior to booking at the Chancellor (actually I spent about two hours looking at various places, with a wide range in price). What tipped the balance in favour of the Chancellor is that the general manager has taken the time to actually respond to comments on this web site: I felt that the service and general level of attention would be better than elsewhere, given that he is obviously concerned about how his hotel is perceived.

After discovering tripadvisor we chose the Chancellor Hotel and couldn't be happier that we did. It is right in the heart of everything... shopping, cable cars, near Chinatown, the financial district, the Ferry building and a short ride to Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Sq. There are great restaurants within walking distance (Millenium - vegetarian; Mela - Indian;) which the front desk staff recommended. Prior to our visit, I e-mailed the hotel and asked for a room with a 'view' since my bf was celebrating his birthday and we wanted a nice view of the city). Upon check-in, Mr. Tyler, the hotel mgr. had a bottle of sparkling wine waiting for us in our room. What a great touch! You rarely find such courteous and thoughtful people these days. It's the small things people take note of and this hotel does these quite well: the pillow choice, the complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby, cookies and apples for snacks with the coffee and tea. You just don't find these types of amenities anywhere anymore. Not once did we run into any hotel staff (even those cleaning rooms on the floors) that they didn't greet us with a warm friendly hello. The rooms are pretty much as described by others on here and on the hotel website. This is an older hotel but very well maintained and probably the BEST value for the location. We typically don't spend a lot of time IN a hotel room when we travel... it's a place to sleep and rest before heading back out to see the sights. Cleanliness is what we value most and this is the one thing that we found the Chancellor to do VERY well. We didn't notice that the rooms or the bathrooms were all that small. There is a BIG closet and a safe in each room. We do quite a bit of travelling and this room (for an older \"boutique\" hotel) is quite nice... and an AWESOME value for the location. We had the valet parking package which is a good value. It takes about 20 minutes to retrieve your car, so calling down to the front desk in advance is recommended. The only thing I would say that needs updating is the bedspreads -- as they are quite worn and outdated. However, we will be back for another trip and WILL stay a the Chancellor again. It is rare to find hotel that seems to do the little things to make your visit enjoyable AND memorable. As far as other recommendations -- buy your tickets in advance for Alcatraz. We didn't and they were sold out... next time! beachblanketbabylon.com is a riot. If you haven't seen it -- go! A day trip North or South is well worth it. Our trip to Sausalito was very nice. Be sure to stop at the last exit heading south on 101 before the bridge for some awesome views and pics of the Golden Gate Bridge...drive all the way up to the top of the mountain and climb up to Hawk's Hill. Simply stunning scenery. Walking around the Castro district was a lot of fun and there were plenty of nice bars and restaurants. We would highly recommend Thai Express... great food and value.

This hotel is not fancy, but it has everything you need and should save you money if you get an on-line deal like I did. I stayed for four nights at $125/night, and that came with a gift card worth $28 for the restaurant. I also got a 20%-off coupon for the restaurant for when my gift card ran out. The lobby is attractive (contrary to what one reviewer thought), with oversized, comfortable couches for seating (Anyway, just look at the hotel's photos, that's how it looks.) The restaurant is very nice, and the food is very good. I did not have lunch there, but the breakfast was great -- much more variety and better food than I expected. My room was number 604, and it looked a lot like the one pictured in the other traveler's candid photos. The walls were off-white, and there were two pictures that were attractive. The window treatments were lovely. The paint was clean and fresh-looking everywhere. There was a huge, walk-in closet with plenty of wooden hangers and two large, metal luggage racks. The closet would probably help to make up for the smallness of the room for a couple staying for an extended period. As a single traveler staying for a few days, I did not find the room to be especially small. Shampoo, conditioner, kleenex, bath salts, shower cap, soap, and hair dryer (and appropriate outlets) were supplied. The soaps were nice -- glycerine for hands and face, and a thick round cake for the bath -- the same as in fancier hotels. New soap was delivered when I didn't even need it. The towels were bright white, and the bath towels were thick. The bathroom was immaculate, and everything worked really well. There was a swing-arm, magnifying mirror, and the bathroom could be lighted by an overhead, incandescent fixture, or a fluorescent one over the large mirror. One feature I really appreciated was the massaging shower head. The bathtub was very deep, and the guest was offered various spa ammenities at additional cost. The closet door featured a full-length mirror. There was free wireless everywhere, and free internet in the lobby (It was pretty popular.) There was an iron and ironing board, a free in-room safe, and an umbrella for use during my stay. Several different complimentary newspapers were available in the lobby, as were coffee, cookies, and apples. The heat in my room worked very well. The large window could be opened, and there was a ceiling fan over the bed. My room had a noise (like a din) coming from outside, but it did not disturb my sleep. My room was not on the street side. The carpeting was nice. My bed felt comfortable to me. Room service was available, but I did not use it. The room type that I had really does not make a great first impression, but I think it could easily have been made more appealing -- different bedspread and fabric on the chairs perhaps. I notice the suites have light fabrics on the beds and chairs, and this looks prettier. (A room decorated like the one I stayed in is pictured on the website, though, so there should be no reason for complaints.) I was not crazy about the dark wood on doors and elevators -- that may have contributed to the few negative reviews about appearance -- but perhaps that is part of the historic ambiance. There was no mini-bar, but there are Walgreens everywhere, and the one closest to the hotel is open 24 hours if snacks and drinks are needed -- and, of course, that is usually preferable to paying exhorbitant prices for such things in a hotel room. The reviewer who thought you could get a better room for the price was wrong. The location cannot be beat, and the ammenities are truly fine. I was staying with colleagues for a conference, and I boasted of many perqs that their much more expensive rooms did not offer. The TV was certainly large enough, and the reception was perfect. I had little need for the staff, but when the public-access printer had no toner and I wanted to print out my boarding pass, one clerk was most helpful in a joint quest for a solution (I should have asked his name, actually.)

I found all the staff to be very friendly and knowledgeable, a real non-chain appeal permeated throughout our stay. The bar in the lobby was very layed back and friendly with a good selection of Californian wine and plenty of beers and spirits, free nuts and pretzels on request along with a couple of plasma TV's showing the latest news and sports. The bar area was being renovated whilst we checked out (mid Nov 2005). The Chancellors location cannot be faulted for visitors wanting to stay in the heart of San Francisco within 5 mins of all the main shops and cable car stop. There's a choice of at least 3 restaurants within 30 seconds walk of the front door, handy when you've had a tiring jet-lagged day sightseeing. Taxi fare to and from SFO international was about $40 including the tip. As for visitor tips - there's one I would definately recommend. Buy a MUNI Passport ticket to cover your stay. If you're in town for 5 days buy a 7 day ticket, believe me you'll save money!! Example: 2 people making 2 return trips on a cable car in one day would cost $40 ($5 each single trip); buy a 1 day MUNI Passport for $11 each and that covers your trips plus you can use it on buses and the tramcar along Market St. Wish I got one on our 1st day !! This would only apply to overseas visitors but one thing that we thought was a bit annoying upon check out was that our credit card was already charged before we had agreed the bill. This meant that a refund of a service back to our card was made in US dollars which the card company make a charge for to convert back to your currency, so if they inadvertantly charge for something you didnt use or buy then you are out of pocket anyway.

We live about an hour away and came into town for a party in the city and didn't want to drive home. Here are my general thoughts - both good and bad. The Good 1. Kudos to management for coming here and reading and responding to the comments on this site. I think that says a lot for the management and, regardless of what else I say here, they are to be commended. 2. The Chancellor is in a great location in San Francisco and is a good value for the money. The bed was comfortable and the room, while somewhat small, was clean and fine for our purposes. 3. The staff was very friendly and professional. The Bad 1. There is nothing management can do about this, but be advised that the bathrooms are really small. They have a deep tub, which *is* a nice touch, but there is really only room for one person in the bathroom at a time. The pictures posted on this site are accurate. 2. In the case of the rooms facing Union Square, the lack of air conditioning was a real issue for us. Granted this is San Francisco, and it rarely gets ridiculously hot, but here is the dillemna: We were on the 13th floor facing the street. More quiet than the lower floors I would imagine, but there is still plenty of street noise. So you can keep the window closed, but then the room gets really, really stuffy and the ceiling fan just doesn't do enough to rectify that problem. You COULD open the window, but it is on the fire escape so there is a potential stranger access / safety issue that is not unreasonable in a major city. There *is* a little bolt to hold it closed, but it is not big enough to allow any real air in the room. EVEN if you did either the full open window or the small latched opening, it would be useless as you would have to open up the blinds to let the air in...and there is a huge Harry Denton's Starlight Lounge neon sign directly opposite the higher floors and flashing outside all night long. So you have to choose between stuffiness (which is made worse by the smallness of the room/shower and the warmth of that filling up the room) and the neon light flashing in your room all night long. My wife and I both woke up due to the warm stuffiness in the room several times throughout the night. There it is...warts and all. I think that the Chancellor is a good value hotel in a great location with a good staff and responsive management and would recommend it with the caveats listed above.

My requests for a quiet room, facing the back, high-up, with no connecting doors were met (the only noise we had was a loud radio or TV one evening, but it stopped before we went to bed). The view at the back of the hotel was still quite striking, especially at night. Hotel itself has some character, with a beautiful art-deco type mirror behind the bar. Lifts were effective; we did use the stairs a few times, but 15 floors is along way! The room was quite big enough and (like Wes, the manager, whose responses on Tripadvisor are highly entertaining) I found it no problem using the toilet ! No A/C needed - ceiling fan was only needed a couple of times, and we left our windows open during the day.

The staff were excellent: check-in took about 30 seconds; bags were taken up to our room immediately; the housekeeping staff were friendly and always said hello (in Vegas, they avoided any eye contact, and one rarely saw them); when we needed a light bulb replacing and I wanted a special pillow, the staff responded immediately; all the staff smiled & made us welcome; the lady at the tour desk may have never actually smiled, but she was polite & helpful; the restaurant staff were efficient most of the time (though on 2 mornings they were slow and forgot part of our order), so we ate breakfast at the hotel 6 out of the 7 mornings. The food was good, and the free coffee (including de-caff.) & cookies much appreciated.

A year ago, I visited with some friends from out of the country and we thought the Chancellor was a great hotel, but the beds were too hard for our comfort. San Francisco is a tough city to find quality hotels for a reasonable price, so after pouring through hundreds of reviews for the competition and being disappointed with what I found, I came back to Tripadvisor and checked out many reviews here for the Chancellor. I noticed that the hotel manager, Wes, responded to many of these reviews and even said not to hesitate contacting him if there was any problem, so I did! Wes immediately emailed me back that the hotel can fit any of the beds with a soft \"cell-foam\" covering that would make them more comfortable and went out of his way to make sure that I was happy with everything. I would have to say that the Chancellor is truly outstanding because the people there make the difference. From the efficient and friendly check-in, helpful tourist advice, restaurant recommendations (such as the fantastic Inidan restaurant \"Mela,\" only blocks away from the hotel), the staff made me feel very welcome during my stay. On top of this, there was a complimentary selection of coffee, tea, cookies and apples in the lobby along with plenty of newspapers to read! The room was immaculate, nicely decorated and they even offered a selection of something like 8 different types of pillows at no extra charge. I would just caution anyone staying in adjoining rooms (two rooms that are joined by double doors), to know your neighbors. One of my friends was supposed to be staying in the adjoining room to mine for 4 nights, but he cancelled 2 nights due to other committments and I could hear conversation, coughs and sneezes from the other room at times that I normally wouldn't have been awake! The adjoining rooms would probably be great for families with kids, but if you want a really quiet room, I would recommend asking for one that is by itself. Overall, the value, quality, location and service just can't be beat. I would stay at the Chancellor again in a heartbeat! I have stayed at several SF hotels in the same price range where the staff seemed to consider their guests annoyances, the heat didn't work and nobody could fix it, the furnishings were badly worn, etc. I'm confident that the Chancellor will meet expectations of a quality hotel at a reasonable price, and that if it doesn't, management will do most anything in its power to make things right!", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, New South Wales", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "Aussie_Mik", "ReviewID": "UR3993068", "Content": "The Chancellor Hotel offers a wonderful location for an excellent price.

Like New York, where I am from, it is a city that is meant to be walked (the hills are not that bad). There is also so much to do and see. If you are a tourist stay away from Fisherman's Warf, it is so stale. The only locals there are the people who work there. It's a tourist trap and it is very sad to see in a city that has so much to offer. EXPLORE. Anyways, my stay at the Chancellor Hotel was really great. It was clean, quite affordable (especially in 2003), and conveniently located for a first time visitor. I was on a bit of a budget so was unable to rent a car but did not need one. I relied on public transportation and also explored alot of the city by foot. The public transportation is great during the day and evening, but late at night it seems to stop. I remember one night after going to a club waiting for one of the electric trolleys on Market Street. I waited....and waited, someone else showed up who was also waiting. I thought that this seemed promising as I found it unlikely that he would also be a tourist so the trolley should be here soon. Time continued to pass and I decided to ask him how frequent the trains run late at night, it turned out that he too was from New York (our public transportation runs 24/7 so we were both accustomed to this). Soon a car pulled up and one of the passengers asked what we were doing, they gave us the impression that the trolley was not coming and since I had not seen any taxis and my fellow New Yorker was going in the same direction I asked if we could have a ride. They let us and I was brought back to the Chancellor. Back to the Chancellor, I stayed there about a week and a half and did not spend much time in the hotel aside from the first day when I had a bit of jet lag. My only complaint would be that the linens and towels seemed a bit worn, not dirty, but worn. The room seemed large to me, but I live in New York where apartments are small and I was staying by myself. The furnishings and decor are nothing out of the ordinary and very modest. It looked like a hotel. The staff was friendly and seemed aproachable if you had questions. Again, the Location could not be better for a first time visitor. I would definitely recommend it to a friend so I suggest that you consider staying here. Also, if you are looking for some inexpensive, interesting entertainment when visiting, head to the Audium. It is located not far away from the Chancellor. A friend had told me about it and said that I had to go. She was right! It is run by this older couple and was started in maybe the 60's or 70's. It is basically an electronic musical performance. The listening room has speakers embeded in the ceiling and floor so the sound envelops you. It is basically old-fashioned surround sound and is really alot of fun. Visit ---- for more information.

We were there from late Wednesday night until Sunday afternoon and we saw a lot of San Francisco thanks to the planning help. They helped us to arrange a bus tour of the city (picked us up at the door) and a bus tour of wine country. Both were reasonable and well worth the money. They also helped us figure out the public transportation and then we were really free to explore the city. We were in a great location - very close to many attractions and restaurants. We had drinks at the bar a couple of times. The bar is VERY small but friendly and actually surprisingly lively on the weekend nights. We had breakfast in the restaurant (good) but didn't eat meals there. (WAY too many great restaurants in the city to eat at a hotel!)

We would definitely recommend the Chancellor to anyone on a budget; it offered every thing it promised.

Maybe because there was big closet for your luggage and clothes. I read from other reviews that tho bathroom would be cold, but I didn't realise that it would be freezing! It was really cold in there and we had to keep the floor covered with towels that we could stand in there. There is no heating in the bathroom at all. I wrote to the hotel beforehand and asked for a view to Unions Square and also a room from upper floors. We got what we asked for. Our room was in the 12th floor and we had the view we asked for. I also asked beforehand if I could book a car through the hotel or if they had any special deals with any car rental companies, but the answer was simply no. So I booked a car from AVIS, but I was quite suprised when I arrived to the hotel and found a big sign on the concierges desk which said \"Dollar car available here\"... Otherwise the service at the desk was fine. We even got a late checking out when we asked for that. The room was kept clean all the time. Well, as clean as one can keep that kind of mattress. The maid also kept our candy cup filled all the time. Only problem with a service was in the restaurant. One mornig we decided to try hotel's breakfast, but didn't do it again. We were in a bit of a hurry to catch a bus and asked the waiter to hurry up. He said no problem. There was only three more couples having breakfast (and two waiters) so it wasn't too much to asked for. We got our breakfast (beside the toasts) and I immediately asked the waiter to bring the check when he could. After 10 minutes we hadn't got our toasts yet (and hadn't got the waiter) and one supervisor (I think) walked by and I asked her for the toasts and she replied that the waiters were only trainees, so it could take a while. So, she did absolutely nothing about that. After 15-20 minutes we had finished our brakfast besides those toasts and finally got our waiter, but no toasts and no check. He didn't apologise when I mentioned about the missing toasts and asked again for the check. He only left for them. Soon we got toast and the check, but we didn't have time to eat the bread anymore. As for the brakfast itself, don't bother. For that price you don't have to chew those reheated bacons, but you can go and que to the next door at Sears Fine Food and you'll get a fabulous breakfast! It's really worth to wait 10 minutes in a que. Or maybe you can go to Lorrie's next block, which is good too. Because so many have told all the good sides of this hotel I'm not going to repeat them.

It's CHEAP, but you wouldn't think so with the service they provide! The location is out of this world...right on Union Square, on Powell Street (so you can easily get a cable car to Fishermans Wharf) and within walking distance (15-20 mins max) of places like the Moscone Convention Center south of Market. The room was perfectly sized for me - I can't understand why people were saying it was too small, but maybe it would be a stretch with 2 people staying, I don't know. Nice touches included the jar of sweets and the rubber duck - a coffee machine would have been great, if only to wake me up in the morning (as the bed was too comfortable!), but that's only a minor issue as there was coffee available in the reception area. It was also really quiet - despite being in a busy area, I never really had a problem sleeping, and it was certainly in a safe location. Thanks also go to the lady on the Tour Desk, who I probably annoyed too much with my requests for bus tours, sweets, drinks, transfers to the airport etc...but she carried out these requests with no fuss at all. Problems? Nothing major, and certainly nothing to reduce the review by 5 stars to 4. I think most have commented on the fact only one lift works - although on the 11th floor, I never found this a problem at all (no more than 5 minutes waiting), and while I was there, it was clear that everything was being done to accomodate this (e.g. notifying residents), so I can't really call this a problem. However, I did once try to walk to the 11th floor (of 14, I think) and, even as a fit(ish) 20-something, I was really tired by the time I got to the top! Also, room service in the evening was only provided Wed - Sat: I would have liked this to have been provided on other nights, as (travelling alone) I found it really awkward walking into restaurants and asking for a \"table for one\"...however, there were PLENTY of local restaurants only steps away from the hotel, so I guess it's a business decision - I normally ate my food at the bar, and it didn't appear that the service was over-subscribed, so I guess most people would prefer to eat out at a local restaurant instead. Finally, I wouldn't really book here if you're a smoker (the hotel is completely non-smoking), or if you're looking for a party atmosphere (e.g. a stag night/bachelor party) - go to a cookie-cutter hotel for that!

It wasn't, BUT, this is where this hotel's sincere hospitality we've all been reading about started. The young girl at the desk was very apologetic to us about the room not being available, but she actually called Housekeeping to see when it would be ready. They gave her an approximate time for our exact room and she offered to hold our luggage. She recommended a couple of things to do in and around Union Square to pass the time and should check back later, all this time calling me by my last name. Within 2 hours, we came back (still waaay before the 3 o'clock hour) and happily said our room was ready. It's a great way to start a vacation. No complaints whatsoever with the room. 14th floor, overlooking Union Square. Elevator wait, no problem. No air conditioner, no problem. Not the right pillow we wanted, no problem. Great towels, great closet, the ceiling fan a great touch. The window fully opened letting us take the views and the sounds all in. We took advantage of the free cookies, coffee, apples, and candy (in the room). We befriended the lady behind the Tour Desk. I think her name was Susan. Despite what was previously said about her in a another post, she was genuinely friendly.

Good, fast, a little on the high $ide, but nonetheless worth it. The location of this hotel, as said before, is unbeatable.

My wife and I stayed at The Chancellor for two nights on our way to our annual trip to Lake Tahoe. Check-In: We arrived at the hotel an hour or so before check-in time and were informed that our room was ready (yes!). We were shown to our room and what is waiting for us after our long journey from Florida? A very NICE bottle of champagne on ice. We felt like king & queen, what a great touch. I don't think they do this for everybody, but I'm not sure. I had had some previous correspondence with the GM about his comments on this board and his superior commitement to his hotel by e-mail. The Room: We requested a room facing Union Square and located on a high floor. Guess what - we were on the 14th floor and faced Union Square. We travel a lot and I have NEVER stayed in a room more clean, EVER. This includes The Ritz and a couple other 5 star hotels. The rooms are plenty big for two people. There was a small desk with chair, a queen sized bed, 2 cocktail chairs with table, a dresser, and 2 nightstands (i think). A large walk-in closet was great for holding luggage (we had a ton), clothes, and shoes. The bathroom was normal sized with a tub/shower, a sink, and a toilet (obviously). The bathroom had obviously been remodeled quite a few times over a 100 year period but maybe could use a little touch up. It was sparkeling and spotless, but the tile and floors could be replaced or touched up. This is my only mildly negative comment. Personal Touches: This is where this hotel really shines. We have never seen anything like it! -Fluffy, oversized, monogrammed towles and washclothes were heaven. -Rubber ducky in the bath was great. -High quality coffee in the lobby 24/7 - free! -Cookies and fruit in the lobby 24/7 - free! -Mixed hard candy jar in every room - free! -Pillow menu to die for. (they even have a pillow with music/speakers in it) -White noise and sound machines available upon request. -Foot massagers & bubble bath machines available for small fee. -Umbrealla located in every room (chances are you'll need it at some point) -Room safe with your personal access code. -Harry & David chocolate on our pillows on Valentine's Day. -Cieling fans in every room. I know there are more but I can't remember tham all. Needless to say, we were thrilled with all the above. Location: Can't be beat! Walk about 10 steps and you're at a Cablecar stop on Powell Street (Chinatown, Fisherman's .Wharf, etc...) You can walk to Chinatown (it's a small hike). All the shopping around Union Square. Buy your MUNI pass about a half block away. Many great bars and restaurants within walking distance. What more can I say. Staff: Absolutely great!! We NEVER walked through the lobby without somebody asking us \"Can we do anything to make your stay better?\" or \"How is your stay at The Chancellor so far?\" or \"Do you need any tour information?\" - You get the point. Everybody was extremely friendly and helpful. Smiles all the way around at check-in and check-out. You can tell it's a great big family atmosphere. I agree with the above review regarding the bartender, but would never let one employee blemish the entire staff. Misc.: -Elevators were being upgraded and it was really no big deal. We were on the 14th floor and only had to wait about 4-5 minutes a couple times. We justed talked to others waiting and learned some things we didn't know about the area. -We never ate int the restaurant but it looked nice. We did have a great meal at Sears next door one night. -We loved that the entire property was no smoking!! I think that about covers it but I'm probably forgetting some things. Hope this helps future visitors to San Francisco! Please stay at The Chancellor!! I would be happy to answer anybody's questions. I check this board frequently.

All I can say about those rare \"unhappy\" traveller reviews is that they must only like cookie cutter chain hotel rooms! The Chancellor is a piece of Europe in the heart of San Francisco. Clean, outstanding location, wonderful staff, ambience, and affordable! We brought another couple from Florida as a surprise for his birthday. Unknown to me, the staff put a chilled bottle of very good private-label wine in their room with a congratulatory card. A really CLASS touch! They have traveled extensively and were very happy with the Chancellor. Everything about this hotel is good old fashioned guest service -- thick, monogrammed towels, genuinely helpful and friendly staff, jar of candy in the room, fresh apples and cookies in the lobby, rubber \"duckies\" in the bathroom for your bath(!), and even an umbrella in the closet should the weather require! The rooms are on the small side, but that is typical of a hotel built 100 years ago (pay attention here all you people who want 1000 sq. ft. rooms!!!). Nonetheless, it was very adequate for two people and CLEAN. The elevator service was slow because they are renovating, and 1 of 2 were offline. But we still never had to wait more than 4 or 5 minutes. I have waited that long in big hotels with whole banks of elevators. It is well worth paying a few dollars extra for the valet parking! I think the only thing that did not impress me was the bartender on duty that night in the lobby bar. He was very lethargic and lacked the enthusiastic personality the rest of the staff exhibits. Maybe he was having a bad night. If not, they need to replace him or give him some Dale Carnegie lessons! If you are a light sleeper you'll want a higher level room -- lots of city noises including the cable cars. And don't forget to review their \"menu\" of pillow options!

Its best feature: no locked-out hotel workers striking in front of it to harass you and other guests! (I sympathize with the workers, but they sure made SF look bad.) You cannot beat this hotel for location and price, given the rates of other Union Square lodging choices. It really is right on the street car line and is within walking distance of China Town, MoMA, etc. I don't know that I would stay at The Chancellor in the summer (no a/c and we never could figure out how to open the windows so it may be impossible), but for autumnal afternoon temperatures in the 60's and evening lows in the 50's, it was just fine. Ventilation in the bathroom was poor, but given the hotel's age, I was not surprised. It was clean and tidy, even if the room was small; there was enough space for us and our luggage. My only real complaint is that it would be nice to have some color in the room - we had whitewash everywhere with the furniture & carpet providing the only relief (I don't count the 2 tiny prints on the wall, nor do I count the wallpaper border in the bath). Our view over Powell Street was fine. The staff was nice, although the Asian woman at the information desk in the lobby was probably the least enthusiastic person I have ever met in my life. Someone wake this lady up! Thanks to the reviewer who recommended Sears Fine Food in a review on this site - we ate breakfast there and it is GREAT.

Another good breakfast place is Lory's Diner; there are, like, 5 locations within 3 blocks of The Chancellor.

We were within walking distance to some world class shopping and plenty of restaurants in all categories. We purchased a 3 day Muni pass ($15), which I highly recommend, and we were able to take advantage of San Francisco's incredible public transportation system including the cable cars. We took advantage of the pillow menu and each ordered specialty pillows. There is no air conditioning here so I wouldn't want to stay in the hot weather, but the ceiling fan was fine in November.

I now feel that I need to give back to this forum. First let's get past the cons of this hotel. If you are looking for very large room with extremely nice decor, you are not going to find it here. If you need to sleep in a room that is 100% quiet without any street noise, you are not going to find it here. If you are used to staying at a 5-star, this is NOT the place for you! My wife and I just returned from a five night/six day trip to San Francisco (part vacation and part work ... for me at least!). We arrived early Tuesday morning (11/02/2004) and took the BART to Market/Powell station. Cost is only $4.95 per person. This is cheap in comparison to a shuttle for $12.50 or a taxi for approximately $40 plus tip. The trip was about 30-45 minutes long. Upon exiting the station, we needed to walk 4 blocks up a slight hill to get to the hotel. We arrived at approximately 9:00AM and proceeded to check in. We were told that the specific room that we had requested (queen with a view of Union Square) was not available yet, but we were offered the option of getting a room that was available immediately. Now tell me, when was the last time you arrived at a hotel that early and was offered an immediate check in? We decline and stored out luggage and proceeded to sightsee. The location of the Hotel is on Powell between Post and Sutter. The cable car stop is located right outside the hotel, with the start point at Market and Powell. The cable car is fun to ride but access to different parts of SF are limited. Also, at $3 per person, the Muni system at $1.25 with at least a 90-minute transfer is really the way to travel around the city. Unless you are used to the stress of driving in a very congested city, don't even think about using a car around town (more about this later). Several Muni bus stops are located not more than 2 blocks from the hotel. After doing some sightseeing, we checked into our room at about 2:00pm. I must say, that ALL the employees of the hotel were extremely nice and friendly and willing to answer any questions and help in most any way. We should know, because we were constantly asking about transportation, eating and questions in general. We wound up in a corner room (1003), located around the corner from the elevators and the ice machine at the far end of the hall. On one side there was another room (we did not hear anything next door for the entire time we were there) and opposite was the emergency exit to the fire escape. We overlooked Powell and were able to see Union Square from our window. The first thing that my wife and I did was race to the bathroom to see if we had a rubber duckie waiting for us and sure enough, there it was! The bathroom was on the small side, with the toilet such that opening and closing the door while seated would be difficult. The tub, however, was a large and deep cast iron one. Since neither my wife nor myself planned on spending any significant time in this room, we were able to easily overlook any shortcomings. The room itself was much larger than I had imagined based upon the reviews that I had read. I was expecting a room slightly larger than a cabin on a cruise ship! We had a queen bed, a desk and chair and a table at the window with 2 additional chairs. Yes, it is true that there isn't any air conditioning (just a ceiling fan), but at this time of year, none was needed. And yes, the carpet was a bit warn, but it was clean and I didn't plan on doing anything other than walk on it. We did happen to get a glimpse of another room, and it did appear to be somewhat smaller than ours. I guess the corner room might offer a little more space. Although there was only a 3-draw dresser to store clothes, the closet in the room was a walk in! Plenty of room to hang stuff and store unneeded luggage. Also, it contained extra pillows, blankets and an umbrella, not to mention a digital security safe. The Pillow Menu is for real! My wife and I tried a number of different pillows during our stay. Our favorite was the \u201cBetween the Knees\u201d pillow. We also asked for and received a noise machine. We kept our window all the time. We were able to hear noise from the street, but mostly during the day and somewhat at night (cable car, occasional car horn, and crowds). I guess it was heightened by the fact that many hotel workers were on strike and you could somewhat hear their chants. Bottom line, though, was that I was so exhausted by the time we came back to the room, that we both slept like rocks (the beds are comfortable and very, very clean). I actually booked my hotel stay on Travelocity. The daily rates provided by Travelocity were better than those that I received directly from the hotel ($99 TWTh, $125 F, $145 Sat). Travelocity even gave me a FREE night ($89 TWTh, Free Fri, $125 Sat). My 5-night stay was approximately $455 with taxes and fees. The hotel also has either on-sight valet or off-sight self-parking for an additional fee (I think for an additional daily fee of $30 and $20, respectively). You can come and go as often as you like. Travelocity, however, offered the on-sight valet parking for only an additional $18 per night. This beats the average going rate of $25, and that usually does not allow unlimited in and out). The hotel\u2019s apple bowl is always full and on occasion even cookies are available at no charge. The apples were a great snack to hold us over until our meals. We did not try either room service or the hotel restaurant. The following is additional information for those that are interested. We rented a car for one day to travel outside the city. We went to Monterey and visited the aquarium (awesome!) and we took the 17-Mile drive in Carmel (wonderful views). The car rental place is located 3 blocks from the hotel (220 O\u2019Farrell). There was Alamo, National and Budget. I reserved using Orbitz (where I usually find the best rates) and got a Saturday daily rate of $30 (the weekday rates ranged between $26 and $28) for a compact. At the rental place, they offered us a convertible (Sebring) for an additional $10. It was just what we needed for a sunny drive. The drive was about 120 miles and took 2 hours. Since the rental place was closed by the time we returned Saturday night, we needed to park the car until the morning. The parking lot on the corner where we rented from charged only $12.50 for the late night special (in by 7:30PM out by 9:30AM). Very cheap! As I said before, I would not use a car to get around in the city. Our stress level went from zero to 10 when we returned on Saturday night. Driving in an unfamiliar city at night is hard, to say the least. Then you have to deal with the wacky street directions, which do not permit left-hand turns across traffic on many streets. When we were only about 5 blocks from the parking lot, it took us literally 45 minutes to get there, making a lot of right hand turns! China Town is located a few short blocks away. And above that is Little Italy. We had the best rotisserie chicken and pasta at Gira Polli, located at Union and Stockton. Not only was the food good and reasonably priced, but the staff was friendly and the owner Noreen spent almost 30 minutes talking with us after we had paid our bill! Also at that location, on Stockton, you will find a great Italian bakery (??) and an extremely good gelato place (Sue\u2019s Fruits?). There is also a magnificent church to visit diagonally across the street. For pizza, try Golden Boy. Pretty good (compared to NYC)! Since we live in a land locked state, it is always a treat for us to get fresh fish. Personally, my wife and I no longer go out to eat fish where we live. For the same amount of money, we splurge and get our seafood from Whole Foods (where we know that it has not been previously frozen) and cook it at home. Same amount of money spent, but it all went into the price of the fish! We ate sushi at a nearby restaurant (2 blocks from the hotel) on the corner of Sutter and Mason. Sushi is at it\u2019s best when it is made with fresh fish! Now, for the most part, Fisherman\u2019s Warf is a tourist trap. We did, however, go with some locals to Scoma\u2019s, which is rated as one of the best seafood restaurants in SF. Plan on spending about $50 per person, but well worth every cent! You haven\u2019t been to SF unless you have had Dim Sum! Probably the best Dim Sum restaurant is Yang Sing (2 locations). Plan on approximately $20-$25 per person, again, worth every cent for the food and experience! We also ate at a great french resturant called Le Centrale, located just opposite the gates to China town. Finally, the museums --- Most are free the first Tuesday or Wednesday of the month. Some others are free one day a week. The Legion of Honor (near the Presidio) is a great museum for those that are into paintings and sculpture. They have a very large collection of Renaissance artists and one of the largest collections of Rodan sculptures. The Exporatorium located between Golden Gate Park and the Presidio is an excellent hands on museum. My wife and I had a blast there! While in the area, there is really great Teih and Vietnamese food (real hole in the wall authentic!). We also went to Alcatraz. I wasn\u2019t sure if this was going to be cheesy, but it turned out to be a very informative trip. The National Park Service runs it. We spent about 3 hours (including the ferry). Cost is $16 per person (including ferry and audio). Unfortunately we did not have nearly enough time to see many of the other museums that SF has to offer. Our only bad experience was at the very end of our trip. We took a taxi to the airport (SFO). The fare should have been between $36 and $40. Our driver told us that 101 was backed up with an estimated time of 1-1/2 hours. He took us around the horn (I-280) for an ultimate fare of $52. I do not really think that highway 101 had any traffic early Sunday afternoon.

I used trip advisor as a guide in picking out a hotel, still I was not sure I made the right decision... Once I got to Chancellor I knew immediately that I made a great decision. First the location is unbelievable, in the heart of Union Square where the best shopping is with the fanciest stores anyone can imagine, close to the best public transportation in the US. I am from Chicago and I thought we have good public transportation but that was until I got to SF and I used MUNI absolutely everywhere from one end of the town to the other, great connection with minimum wait, get MUNI pass it's also good for the cable car which happen to have a stop right in front of the hotel. Chancellor Hotel... friendly staff with a great sense of humor, rarely found anywhere else. To check in took exactly 2 minutes, I guess they also know what they are doing...:) Elevators, every entry that mentioned the elevators were saying they are slow, let me tell you the elevators are fine, true it's not like the Devil's drop at Great America but they work just fine, and you know what if you think these are slow evators than go to Europe and I would love to hear one's opinion than. Europe's elevator have the speed of a snail race, that is if the elevator works at all. The rooms... When I opened the door I expected to enter this room a bit bigger than a closet, considering everyone mentioned how small the rooms are, Well... the rooms are perfect, actally I was a little surprised to see that was not small at all. From the room we had a great view of the union square. The beds were so comfortable and sooooooo clean. I am a very picky person who ALWAYS checks every layer of the bed sheets making sure it's clean and no surprises. I was surprised but this time it was because beds were so white, crisp, clean NO funny smell... Bathroom, again very, very clean, very well stocked, even Q-tips, and yes the ruber ducky was there waiting for us, nice touch. In the lobby, 24 hours hot coffe, tea, fresh homemade cookies, yummmm and fresh apples... Great way to start your day with. Overall I have to say I was very satisfyied with my stay at the Chancellor. Next time in San Francisco, I can guarantee I will be checking in at the Chancellor.

Hallways are narrow and twist and turn. The elevator is small, older and a bit slow for a traveling type 'A' like me, but hey, use the steps to go down. With that said, this hotel is as clean and quiet if not cleaner and a more quiet hotel than that of the larger more expensive hotel chains found elsewhere.

Can walk around as its a safe area - a few beggars perhaps, but this is a large American city not unlike any other large American city in that regard. Easy acess to cable cars, taxis and BART - no need for a car while in the City. Fun tip : Rent the \"Blazing Saddle\" bikes and ride across the GG Bridge. Yolanda the desk person ( who assisted with our extra nights stay ) and Matt the Bellman ( who secured me an extra rubber duck) were names I recall for service. I can't recall anyone else at any other hotel I've stayed at over the past year. Can you? It's that kind of place.", "Date": "June 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redding, Ca", "Title": "\u201cThe Chancellor: I only wish I could have stayed longer!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2220023", "Content": "I stayed at the Chancellor after reveiwing tons of hotels on this site. I was not disappointed. I did book directly through the hotels website though, and would recommend that as the price was better than any other site. I paid 89 for my night, 101 after the taxes. That was an excellent deal for the place as my 13th floor room overlooked Union Square. Some other reviewers complained about noise, but the only problem I had was when my neighbors had their television up a little loud. With the window closed, I couldn't even really hear the street noise. I am a great lover of SF, so the cable car bell was actually charming to me. I found the decor to be tasteful. They avoided that crappy fake border/stencil stuff that many other hotels try to pass off as decorating. The room was impeccably clean, with opening windows, a ceiling fan which cut any warmth and black out curtains that made the room almost pitch black in the middle of the day if one so desired. There was also a deep tub that I took full advantage of. Others have complained about the size of the room, but for one or two people, it was quite comfortable. Besides, you're in the city, why stay in the room if you don't have to!? The hotel staff was excellent and friendly. I was able to check in a full 2 hours early after a quick email to the hotel site. The service, even just on their website, was prompt and courteous. They held my luggage after checkout because I had a couple of hours to kill before leaving. There are a bounty of shops, restaurants and entertainment within easy walking distance and the public transportation is almost ridiculously easy to use. If you need a refrigerator in your room, request it ahead of time because mine didn't come with one. That is really my only complaint. I just wish I could have stayed longer. I loved the Chancellor and would recommend it to anyone.

Another tip, yes, there is a trolley stop in front of the hotel. The problem with the Trolleys is that they are usually full. Don't waste too much time waiting on them, start walking and you can jump one if it happens to have space. (we were there on a holiday weekend though).
