I stayed in The Takanawa Hotel for 2 nights and it was fabulous. It was in an excellent location, a short (slightly uphill) walk from Shinagawa station. Shinagawa station is easily accessed by the airport by the Narita express, other parts of Japan by the Shinkansen (bullet train) and other train lines that will take you to other hot spots in Tokyo. The room was a lot bigger than I expected! Loads of room and storage space. Some lovely extras were included like slippers, yukata (Japanese dressing gown), toothbrushes (and mini toothpaste), razors, and anything that you could possibly need. The hotel staff were attentive, helpful and spoke very good English.There is a few restaurants near the hotel - Outback steakhouse, being one which is very nice food! Also there is a shopping centre nearby with some restaurants. (Takanawa East and Takanawa West). There is an italian restaurant in the hotel, which we did not try. Also we didn't have breakfast included in our stay, so I can't comment on it! To find the hotel, go out the Takanawa exit., cross over the main road, you will see the shopping centre Takanawa West in front of you. You will see a left turn as soon as you cross over, walk up that and you will see the Shinagawa Prince Hotel, keep walking and you will pass Outback. When you come to a set of traffic lights the hotel is straight of front of you at the intersection - you have to take a left but you will see it in front of you! Overall my stay in Takanawa was very satisfying and I would stay there again and recommend it highly to anyone.", "Date": "May 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR552995561", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "PrincessFi"}, {"Content": "\u9479\ue218\u4e9c\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4ef9\u9287\u693c\u4ee7\u9287\u5c78\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(21684938, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR508687902", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "\u9288\u5098\u5031\u701b?> \u9288\u5098\u5031\u701b?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u5d83\u510d\u9289\u5822\u6335\u6fa7\u51a6\u4f05\u93c8\u20ac\u93ae?#x201d;   showReview(20628968, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR186272448", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TKBO08"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d310305-r14362578-Takanawa_Tobu_Hotel-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "310305", "Price": "$283"}}
