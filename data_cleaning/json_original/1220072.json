Upon arrival at 4pm I was told they had no knowledge of my booking. I presented them with the confirmation document I recieved and was told I must contact the travel agent and ask them to send confirmation to the hotel. In the mean time I was told I could check in as normal. I thought this strange since I had the document but duly emailed the agent (based in Europe). The following morning I went out for breakfast and when I returned to the hotel I found my room key wouldnt work. I went to reception to be told that I had been locked out of the room as I had failed to contact the travel agent and that the hotel had contacted them and hadnt got the booking confirmation either. I demanded to speak to a manager and informed him that at no time was I told I would be locked out of my room, that not even 24hours had passed since I checked-in, and given an 8 hour time difference with Europe it was likely the office was closed when I emailed. After spending almost an hour on the phone to the agent, I was told they had recieved no communication with the hotel and that the confirmation I had should have been sufficient but they would contact the hotel directly to confirm this. I found the entire thing to be extremely upsetting to be locked out of my room. The staff including the manager were rude and unhelpful and I would never stay here again.

The best thing about this hotel is the staff (Christopher, especially) and the location. The negatives include the need for renovation, the construction noise around the hotel, and no continental breakfast. Parking was an issue for us as well because our Kia Sedona wouldn't fit under the low clearance of the parking garage without first removing the roof rack. For those with large vehicles, parking outside of the secured garage is possible, but not recommended due to the high risk of vehicle theft/entry in the area. The parking in underground garages at this hotel is tight! Leave your full sized vehicles at home. Parking cost us $16/day. The lobby of this hotel is very nice, if modest. We did not try the restaurant or bar there. The hallways and rooms are dated though and need renovation. There is major building construction going on to the front and rear of the hotel but it did not bother us. The room had a nice flat-screen television with a clear HD picture. The hotel does have WiFi, but we could not get connectivity due to a weak signal (We stayed in room 402 which was at the extreme end of the hotel, so rooms closer to the middle might have better luck). I wish I'd realized that there was no continental breakfast offered... just a single serving coffee pack in the room. I've come to expect that continental breakfast is pretty standard in Choice hotels and did not read the hotel description very carefully on this. You can buy breakfast in the hotel restaurant or there are many nice and unique restaurants in easy walking distance. It was loud outside on the weekends and I was awakened by revelers in the streets late at night (that's Vancouver though). Location is the best part about this hotel. It's an easy walk to the Aquabus to Granville Island and every other place (Gastown, Chinatown, Stanley Park, etc) is within walking distance too. I recommend walking up to Davie Street, turning left and finding one of the many restaurants there. The hotel is pet friendly (for a fee) and there are many dog parks in the area. Overall, it's an OK place to stay. If they'd renovate the rooms and add a free breakfast, I'd certainly come back again.

The hotel was fine. It would benefit from an update of the rooms. Our dining table was wobbly and furniture and decor were not terrible, but a bit tired. The elevator was a challenge. The doors would close as soon as everyone unloaded but before anyone else could get on and then would leave - pushing the up button again did not reopen the doors. And there are not enough elevators for the number of guests, so it actually can be a pretty lengthy wait to get up and down if you cannot use stairs. We had a stroller so had to depend on the elevators. The location was a bit removed from most of what you would want to see in Vancouver.

There were two guys behind the front desk when I got there and no one was in front of me. One guy was on the phone (it did not appear to be a work-related call based on his body language) and the other was on the computer. Neither of them bothered to look up to acknowledge me while I stood there waiting to be assisted. Not a great first impression from the front desk clerks. Once I got help, the check-in process was fine. We got a room on the 4th floor behind the Quality Inn sign. The view was great from that side of the building, but as another reviewer mentioned the lights from the sign were very bright from inside the room at night. It was distracting but not a big deal since there were blackout shades available. Sadly, I found a tiny bug in my bed on the first night and the air conditioning didn't work. We dealt with it because it was not worth our effort to switch rooms at that point. The next morning we told the front desk (different clerk this time) and she gave us a new room on the 5th floor right next to the ice machine which was MUCH better as it seemed to be newer & nicer than the first room. I actually enjoyed having the ice machine directly outside of our room. It was convenient and any noise from the ice machine was not noticable. Switching rooms, however, was a bit of a pain point because only one elevator was working and it was jam packed. People were trying to start their day so we had to wait for several trips just to go up one level. Folks who were trying to go down to the lobby actually rode UP the elevator with us just so they could make it down. Housekeeping was also sharing this one small elevator with the rest of us, linen bin and all. It was a bit of a cluster. Lastly, the underground, secured parking was very limited. Both nights we parked there it was completely full. I got the last parking space the first night because I have a small car and could fit in the spot. Two other cars were out of luck and had to ask the front desk where else they could park. There were no spots open downstairs on the second night. The front desk advised us to park in their open lot right outside which was convenient. I got the LAST space in that lot.... As another reviewer mentioned, they gave us a sign to put on our dashboard indicating we removed all valuables so that thieves would be deterred from breaking in. That was a little unsettling, but I was glad/thankful the hotel made us aware that we needed to take extra precaution when leaving our cars parked overnight in the open lot. Here are the things I was happy about: Great proximity to Granville Island Public Market (just walk a few blocks and take the ferry for a small fee to get to/from the Public Market) and Granville Entertainment District Beautiful, welcoming lobby area Nice water-pressure and temperature in the shower Free wi-fi", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "Travelinggirl1968", "ReviewID": "UR117243383", "Content": "My 11 year old daughter and I stayed here for two nights.

The Quality Inn at False Creek certainly rounded off our holiday nicely. After checking in and dropping off our hire car near Canada Place (20-25mins walk), we settled in to our rooms. The rooms are a decent size and had a king size bed in the middle which provided me with the most comfortable sleep from our entire trip. The bathroom was slightly claustrophobic and the small hallway from front door to the main living around was tight to manoeuvre our large suitcases. Apart from that our room and the rest of the hotel was very clean. I liked the exposed brickwork and our maid did a great job at keeping everything clean and tidy during our stay. The ice machines are in the middle of the hallway on floors 3 & 5. The machines are very loud and the rooms aren't well sound proofed. We had room 601 which was next to a fire exit facing the back of the hotel (views of hotel car park and what looked like a collection of council flats) but it was quiet, apart from other people slamming their doors in the morning. Our parents had room 619 which was bigger than our room and faced the front of the hotel & the motorway. Unfortunately they were kept awake by a barking dog on one night as the dog owners did not return until late. They were then woken up very early one morning by a neighbouring room's husband banging on the bathroom door trying to hurry his wife out for half an hour. Our experience with WiFi was good. Signal was strong and we had no problems in checking emails and going online to check out tourist attractions & restaurants nearby. I used the swimming pool which I found to be adequate. Request pool towels from front desk. The pool is slightly heated, clean and is fairly small, just long enough for short laps. I didn't have a chance to use the complimentary Steve Nash Fitness Centre about 2mins walk from the hotel though, but it looked good with fitness classes and ladies only area. There are a huge number of restaurants, bars and cafes nearby. Tim Hortons coffee shop is right next to the Steve Nash Fitness Centre, Nando's & Subway are also 2/3mins walk away. However Davie Street is where the action is, it starts from Burrard Street junction about 5 mins walk from the hotel! It's supposedly the gay street with rainbow flags on the lampposts, but we found it swamped by families at dinner time. The Quality Inn has a 25% discount at a Greek Tavern called Characters on Davie Street, so we gave that a try one day. Glad we went, the delicious portions were generous and the owners friendly & informative. We shopped till we nearly dropped on our last day (Robson Str & Pacific Mall) and I dropped into a massage place on the way back, on Burrard & Davie 2mins walk from hotel. Best $42 I spent in Vancouver! It was relaxing and set me up for our flights home. There is also another massage place which I didn't try called Mango Bay Spa on Howe Str 1 min from hotel. These aren't high end Aveda type spas, so don't expect 5*. We were able to walk to all of downtown (Yaletown, West End, Coal Harbour, Gas Town, Chinatown & Granville Island) within 30mins stroll from the hotel. We walked over the bridge to Granville Island and returned via the Aquabus ($3.25 one way, $5.50 return) which stopped 2 blocks from the hotel. We used the dedicated phone line to book our airport transfer using Black Top Cabs. Our driver turned out to be a reckless driver (near collision with city bus as he was punching in number into his cell phone) and demanded over $12 more than meter price at airport. So use MacLure's or other cab companies instead! To sum up, the hotel is solid Quality Inn standard with genuinely helpful staff. Any questions or issues were dealt with immediately.

But when I planned the trip, all upper-class hotels were completely booked somehow, so I decided to look for a budget hotel room. I thought I did my homework properly by researching various hotels on this web site. The rating of this hotel was quite high and feedback was generally favorable, so I decided to reserve this hotel. However, I found it one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed. I know I'm a bit spoiled by number of luxurious hotels I stayed in the past, but this is my honest feedback. <Pros> - The room was relatively clean. - The bed was comfortable. - The shower poured out plenty of hot water, which was relieving after a long day. <Cons> - Extremely noisy. - Email correspondence was awfully sloppy. - No welcome atmosphere or smiling on the face of front desk clerks. - Low security. - No in-room fridge. - No in-room safe. <<Sloppy Email Correspondences>> After making a reservation via local travel agency, I inquired the hotel if they can provide me with a room with an in-room fridge. I didn't get a reply for a week. So I sent another inquiry via their online contact form. This time I got a short reply, saying \"the rooms with fridge are scarce so you need to book it asap\". So I sent a reply right away to request the room. But I didn't receive a confirmation or whatsoever. At this point, I gave up communicating with the hotel online. <<No Smile>> When I arrived Vancouver and checked in to the hotel, I felt no sense of welcome atmosphere from the front desk clerk. No smiling, bar none. But I didn't care as long as he did his job of checking me in. One glitch was that the room booked for me was the one without a fridge, as suspected. I asked the clerk for changing the room to the one with a fridge, but he said that only suite rooms have fridges. So, the clerk and the reservation staff told me different stories, but I didn't argue anymore because I was exhausted after a long flight. <<Dated Facility>> The facility was generally quite dated. If you've ever stayed at one of dated Aston condos in Waikiki, this hotel is dated just like them. This won't be a big deal considering the price range of this hotel. And the room I stayed was relatively clean and the bed was comfortable. <<Extreme Noise>> The room I stayed was on the second floor, right in front of the staircase with heavy firedoor, and storeroom for cleaning staff. Because it was second floor, most guests were going in and out through the staircase. Each time they opened the firedoor, the door automatically closed with explosive noise \"BANG!\". While staying in the room, I was harassed by that loud noise every so often, making it impossible to relax. In addition, during daytime the cleaning staff was opening and closing the storeroom's door all the time, making the noise even worse. Meanwhile, because the room was facing to one of arterial streets in downtown Vancouver, there was considerable traffic noise for 24 hours. I was lucky enough to bring a pair of ear plugs. Otherwise I could never sleep well. Because of this noisiness, I became hesitant about staying in the room. So I tried to cruise around the town as long as possible even after finishing my business appointments. <<Security>> There's no in-room safe. And anyone can enter into the guest room floors bypassing the front desk, by going through the parking lot door and the staircase (all unlocked). So your room door is the only security between your valuables and people on the street. <<Wireless Internet>> Regarding the complimentary services, the hotel provides free wireless internet access. However, the connection speed is very slow, so I recommend you to prepare an alternative method of internet connection, if it's vital for your trip. I measured the connection speed via several web sites and the average was around 370kbps. Meanwhile, my Novatel MiFi 3352 scored around 3,700kbps in the same room. <<Bottomline>> All in all I had poor experience staying at this hotel. I will not stay here again. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone I know.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "Title": "\u201cI wouldn't recommend it for a business trip.

They are all friendly and helpful: from the front desk, restaurant staff, housekeeping, IT to management they could not have been more wonderful. They have free wi-fi (but see my comments below) They are more reasonable than most of the decent/name hotels in this city. They have a complementary breakfast, not just continental but a full meal, at a table, with a wonderful wait staff. Eggs, choice of meats, potatoes, fruit, toast, juice.. and a full carafe of coffee on each table! There are stores, restaurants, buses and Davie St/West End (with many eclectic shops and restaurants) about 2-4 blocks away. And the (on - off) tour buses stop right in front of the hotel. CONS: The wi-fi is free, but it is frustratingly slow. I wasted many hours trying to access websites and emails. Eventually, their IT people (yes, also part of great customer service) gave me a Ethernet bridge and it was manageable, but still slow. The room itself was acceptable. I was supposed to get a king suite with a kitchenette, but when I got there they only had one with just a micro/fridge available. They did, however, take some money off my nightly fee (again, good customer service). The suite was a good size, with a bedroom and sitting room, both with TVs. They were clean and very comfortable. The king bed was too firm for me, but that's a personal preference. The bathroom was very disappointing. It was tiny, cramped and looked like it was added on as an after thought... the door from the bedroom into the bathroom couldn't even open all the way.

At check-in the desk clerk, Chris, was rude and embarrassed me in front of a group of people (there was a long line and check in was slow.) After he handed me the key to my room, I asked about breakfast and he informed me my room did not include breakfast. I explained that I had booked the \"Stay and Eat\" package and he informed me I did not. Then he said my room was only $89 a night and that if I wanted breakfast I could pay an additional $20 for it. I told him that I wasn't paying extra for something that was included in my package. Suffice to say, it was not the best start to my vacation. Chris told me if I could show him my reservation confirmation and PROVE TO HIM that I actually did book the package he'd give it to me...he even offered to allow me to use the business center FREE so I could get this information to him. After dropping off our bags I returned to get the key to the business center, but Chris was still busy checking in people (who looked at me like I was some sort of moron trying to get free stuff.) I asked a young woman behind the front desk if she could provide me with the key to the business center and explained that I needed to prove that I had booked the \"Eat & Sleep\" package. The young woman told me that they've had quite a few issues with the new reservation system and said that she didn't think it would be necessary for me to look up the reservation. She went to Chris and told him that she was just going to give me the breakfast coupons. He seemed quite annoyed with her, but didn't argue - which was good because at this point I was ready to check out and find a hotel where they wanted my business. The hotel accommodations are decent. The value fair. However, next time I go to Vancouver, this hotel will be off the list of options. It's kind of sad for me as I've stayed at this hotel probably more than ten times in the past and it had always been great. Must be new management or something. Chris was well dressed, but I sure hope he's not a manager - his people skills are horrific. I wonder if he's the person the other reviewers commented on.

The staff is friendly and helpful, and it is a nice and central location at the edge of Downtown Vancouver. However, the rooms facing Howe street gets quite a lot of traffic noise. ---- My first impression was it was very impersonal, as it tends to be in a chain hotel of this size. However, as soon as I got to the room the impression was; What a comfortable room! The room was absolutely spotlessly clean and very comfortable, with a nice comfortable armchair to cuddle up in, and a comfortable bed. As well as the armchair there is the standard hotel little writing table and chair. Plenty of huge drawers and a closet to put your clothes and stuff in. Nicely decorated, probably very recently, in some kind of modernized mexican colour scheme, with rich brownish colours. The decorator has somehow managed to do this without making the room look drab or dark. The bathroom was not quite as newly redecorated, but was spotlessly clean. Not very big, but adequate. --- The hotel is just beside the Howe street ramp to the Granville street bridge, meaning the rooms at the front of the hotel do get quite a lot of traffic noise. And the view is not exactly beautiful, but interesting. ---- OK, so one or two of the buildings immediately around the hotel are not exactly brand new and well kept, but the area seems quite nice and most of the surrounding buildings are quite new residential buildings. If you walk a few blocks down the street in front of the hotel, you are down by False creek, in a nice residential area with a very nice walk along the water, with boats, the tiny ferries across False creek, a view of Granville Island, some green patches and residential buildings, and lots of people taking their evening stroll. A few minutes along this walk and there is a beach continuing all the way to Stanley park. A few blocks walk the other way is Downtown. -- I found the front desk staff to be very friendly and helpful. The restaurant is friendly and serves good breakfast, many different options.

We loved Vancouver and will definately return.", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Quality Hotel - Inn at False Creek", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g154943-d1220072-Reviews-Quality_Hotel_Inn_at_False_Creek-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html", "Price": "$102 - $227*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1335 Howe Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Vancouver</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">British Columbia</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">V6Z 1R7</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1220072", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/92/91/9291fd6f1c9f3a451025dd567ad011435large.jpg"}}
