My experience has been pretty consistent. I like hotels in historic and older settings and this is a recently renovated structure, which is a plus. The lobby is large and opulent. The rooms, too, were well-appointed and had a \"luxury feel\", including LCD tv's, wide molding, granite countertops etc. The sheets on the bed were of a high thread count and very soft. The staff was friendly and attentive. So why not excellent? Well, a couple of things. First, although I paid close to $300 a night after some sort of preferred rate, I still had to pay $15 for wi-fi. Really? I'd pick an internet connection over a TV or many other things in the hotel. It sure as heck doesn't cost them anything close to $15 for a night. If you are a Marriott platinum or some other high level \"elite\", the internet doesn't cost extra, but I travel all over and, frankly, while it is generally very good, Marriott isn't always the best alternative so I don't have the high elite levels needed for \"free\" internet access. Second, I thought the prices in the restaurant and the lobby were rather high. The prices for wine by the glass were more than I would pay for an entire bottle at home. They are certainly entitled to a fair profit, and I support their right to one, but $18 a glass for wine that would cost $12 a bottle retail is going a bit too far. Having said that, I had a chocolate martini at lounge bar, an occasional indulgence for me, that was very good (it was $18.50 with tax and tip). In short, they have a beautiful and thoughtfully restored building and an excellent and responsive staff. I was annoyed, however, by the nickel and dime-ing on things like excess charges for internet access and beverages in the lobby. If you are already Marriott elite of a sufficient level, the internet won't be a problem, but you would likely be staying here anyway. If not, however, I would look at the entire package to determine whether the hotel is worth it.

However, once I stepped in the door I realized I made the right decision. First of all, the staff are impressive. Everyone from the valet, doorman, front desk and concierge went out of their way to welcome us (and continued to make us feel welcome throughout our stay). Genesis Rodriguez at the front desk was awesome. The concierge also was amazing (sorry, but I didn't get his name). The hotel is only about 1 year old, it was a former bank converted to a hotel. The architects and designers paid close attention to every detail, in the common areas and guest rooms. I upgraded to Luxury Suite, and as you can see from my attached pictures it was top of the line. I would easily stay here again on my next trip to Chicago. I didn't even mind the location. It was only a quick 5 minute, $5 cab ride to the Magnificant Mile and Navy Pier. I'm sure the this hotel caters to business travelers Sunday-Thursday, so it's a quiet on the weekends and you're more likely to score a great rate.

I had a double expresso which was ok but it was'nt hot enough for me at $2.00 a shot. It was Lilly expresso straight from Italy so I don't know what the problem was. The service was excellent, as was everyone we delt with at this hotel. There was security there at the hotel but very discreet. One thing I noticed is that Saturday night was party night at the hotel and even though we were on the eighth floor and facing the inside court yard, we could still hear the thumping of the music from the party that night. Also, the sound proofing between rooms was excellent... I could'nt hear a peep between rooms. However, I could hear every conversation in the hallway right outside my room door. I heard every person coming back that night and what they were saying. They may have been a little loud but I thought this lack of soundproofing on the room door was odd. I have stayed at the Pennsiular and Trump in Chicago and the JW is as clean as both. But their locations are much better and are overall (duh!) a upgrade above this hotel.

Closet space is more than adequate for 2 people for a longer stay. The bar downstairs has a great drink selection and a very warm welcoming atmosphere with pleasant and very professional bartenders. The staff knows a lot about Chicago and will answer your questions about where to go/what to do even if you know quite a bit yourself. This hotel has a very sophisticated yet warm and home like atmosphere. Please understand, it is not the absolute biggest or best of what Chicago has to offer, but it is very unique in it's own way and very welcoming. It is located in one of Chicago's most historic and oldest buildings to provide that old world city charm. It is the type of hotel that you want to come back to time and time again and call it home away from home. The room service menu is very extensive (dinner and lunch) are very reasonably priced for a hotel of this type. Due to the location of this hotel, please do not expect a great view, just an OK view. It is located in a historic building that over the years became surrounded by other taller ones. If you want a street view, you will have no problems getting it you reserve your room by phone in advance. Just like ALL the other hotels in this class, breakfast is not included in the price but again, it will be delivered to your room and the prices a very reasonable for a hotel of this level. The hotel is very close to your major conveniences: Walgreens, Starbucks, Cafe's, Restaurants and etc. Some reviews complain that is it not close enough to the 'shopping central' on Michigan Avenue and etc. It is really not fair to judge this way and most people who stay at this hotel do not have shopping as their #1 priority for the day. Please check the map before you book. This is foremost a sophisticated professional/business/luxury hotel and it is for that purpose in an ideal location...the center of the financial district. If you want a 5 minute walk to the Water Tower and Michigan Avenue shopping there is a regular Marriott on Mich. Av. for about $100 less. However, this JW is not that far of a walk to Michigan Avenue shopping if you are a fairly fit and not lazy :-) If anything, a maximum 5 minute cab ride to Water Tower. Not so negatives but just pointers for future guests and management.

I got there and they began with a welcome, used my last name immediately. I had an issue with the internet and they not only spent 10 minutes with the service people but comped the internet for 2 days. The food is great on the floor as is the view. The rooms on the top floor are roomy and spacious. The furniture is a great mix of modern and traditional and it works. The bed is fantastic after such a miserable one in Lincolnshire it was just a delight. The location is perfect for the museums or bus to Miracle Mile. It is 2 blocks from the northern train line and 2 blocks to the O'Hare train both much better ideas than a car or taxi. The concierge was perfect in making a dinner reservation, how to get to the Museum of Tech and Science and the fact there was a special night at the Planetarium and walking directions there. I travel 120-150,000 miles a year. Good hotels with great service are few and far between. This one is excellent. The reason it does not get 5 stars is it is important that you know the Executive floor closes at 11Am on Friday and does not open till Sunday Evening. This is just a bad idea in that the floor was full all weekend and the ability to just relax with a muffin or a snack and some tea is worth it and closing it on the weekend is sort of down scale for such a nice hotel.

The rooms are absolutely fantastic as was the Staff running the Hotel and the Banquet Staff in their Grand Ballroom. Very clean and well laid out rooms. We also attended a Wedding Reception in their Grand Ballroom and the Banquet Food, (which can often be considered ordinary at some facilities), was excellent. The service staff was buzzing around the room with patience and speed. Of course some of the guests, (that often got in their way), not once did I see a frown or agitation of any kind. The guests were having a wonderful time yet the plates, dishes and glasses kept coming and going without interuption. The Banquet Manager orchestrated the dinner perfectly in my opinion. The only negatives with this Hotel was the arrival and how absolutely busy West Adams street was. This is a narrow city street with another Hotel directly across the street and with Guests arriving at the same time to both Hotels, some traffic control would be welcomed to those first time visitors. We also had breakfast at the Florentine. Again the service and the food was excellent. It is not an inexpensive stay but in my opinion travelers often get less than we pay for.

It is a beautful new hotel ( it was formally a bank in the financial district ) with an exceptional staff who bent over backwards to make sure we were well taken care of. The room was very comfortable, nicely decorated and clean. I am a bit of a bathroom snob. If I don't like the bathroom, I am not going to like the hotel. Well...that was not going to happen here, it was awesome. There was a huge shower, separate extra deep soaking tub, generous marble sink with a make-up area and a TV in the mirror. There were many little extra's in the room that made us feel really pampered. We loved it! The biggest surprised had to be Sunday morning. Figuring it would take the typical 45 minutes to a hour for room service we placed our order. We were told it would take 30 minutes...great! 10 minutes later there is a knock at the door from a very cheerful staff member with our breakfast! Not only was it super quick, it was hot and very good. It was a bit pricey but room service at any good hotel in Chicago is. In short it was a great stay.

I checked in for 3 nights. I thought I had reserved a room with a king bed, but apparently the bed size was just a request and not guaranteed. I was given a room with two full size (not queen) beds. I complained and was offered a king bed in a room on 5th floor overlooking the atrium. The front desk staff did disclose to me that the window was opaque, so there is no view, but I still agreed to take the room given that I really wanted more than a full-sized bed. After 3 days with no view at all to outside, I decided I should have taken the room with the small beds and a real window. The hotel did give me a free internet/entertainment package given they could not meet my room request, but that didn't do much for me because I am here on business with little free time to watch movies and an expense account to cover internet access. The bathroom is spacious with high end finishes. They could have used more square footage for the room and less for the bathroom. The finish on the desk was chipped off, making it look shabby relative to the rest of the room. One light fixture was mounted too close to the wall to allow the light shade to fit properly, and the seams on all the lamp shades were turned out. An admittedly minor detail. Exercise room itself, located in the basement , was nothing special, but the equipmenjt was plenitful and as high end as you'd find at any health club. I didn't use the restaurants. As you would expect, room service is very expensive (e.g., $19 burger + tax and delivery). Staff seemed pretty accomodating.

In fact, we found the location ideal for shopping on State street (where Filene's basement, TJ Maxx, Nordstroms clearance -off the rack, and other general stores were located. We also liked that we were only a short walk away from Grant Park/Chicago Art Institute. We walked home from the Field Museum/Shedd Aquarium which was about 15 minutes or so. We also walked a few times to the Magnificent Mile shopping area and this was also no problem. We are city people so the walking did not bother us at all. But, you can take a cab and it will cost only a few dollars to get to the Water Tower area. (home of American Girl and other great shops) The Federal Reserve is just around the corner from the hotel on LaSalle and it has an interesting little museum which is free. The Willis (Sears) Tower is only about two blocks away. We took the Chicago double decker buses and stop 10 is right across the street from the Willis Tower. You can hop on and hop off the bus all around the major attractions of the City. We extended our pass for three days and took the other tours as well. The North Tour will take you to the zoo, botanical gardens and home of the cubs. (all worth seeing) We paid 87 for two adults and one child. (they let our youngest go on for free due to her age) If you have not gone to Chicago, take the tour, it is worth the information you will receive about the city and it serves as a great way to get around. Since the hotel is not on the main strip, you do have to walk a bit to find area restaurants, but there is Giordano pizza which is only about two blocks away and their pizza was recommended and enjoyed by us. We also had sandwiches for lunch at Hannah Bretzel which were amazing. (organic, tree hugger type restaurant with \"uber\" sandwiches and high prices. But they did have gluten free bread so I am bias) Right outside the hotel was a deli like restaurant called the potbelly pig which also made delicious sandwiches which our kids enjoyed. Also the Corner Cafe made great brunch/lunch food. Chicago is kind of a bread loving city. We had room service and the food was delicious. The banana cheesecake was very yummy. At night, the hotel is in the quieter area since it is the financial core, but it was safe to walk around. The W is located across the street from the JW. The Cons: Valet was 52 a day which is expensive and the internet is not free. But, with that said, the positives outweigh the negatives. If you stay here, you will not be disappointed with the hotel itself. If you are only interested in shopping prada, gucci etc, then I would suggest you stay at a hotel near the Water Tower area. This was a great hotel and we will return, in large part because of the friendliness of the staff and cleanliness of the hotel.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cbig room, great fitness center\u201d", "Author": "nycnd", "ReviewID": "UR117471206", "Content": "Bathroom in my room was as big as any Ritz I've stayed in with deep soaking tub and large glass shower.

My colleague upgraded to a suite, and I tell you, that's where the rubber meets the road. The bathroom was as big as the bedroom, and it had a big Wow factor. There was a freestanding tub clad in marble mosaic tile, big marble shower, and a toilet in it's own room. The vanities were separate, so no leaning over your spouse to reach the toothpaste. But the big WOW factor was the mirrors. They were both large, with the lighting seamlessly integrated into the mirror in a clean band of white light. The best part - when you turn on the tv, the picture appears in the mirror facing the tub. Way cool. I liked the fact that the hotel is next to an L stop, since I was way over the taxi cab drivers who floor it between stoplights for their own entertainment.

Many of the things you select are internet based. They have on-demand in addition to pay-per-view which is a nice touch that I've not seen at other properties (Marriott or otherwise). Valet is not cheap (you are in Chicago) but car was available quickly as needed. Lobby bar is a bit impersonal, but drinks were good. Unsure what the smell is, but smells like perfume. A little strong, maybe, but oddly felt more like a Vegas hotel lobby. Felt special the entire time I was there. Staff went out of their way at every turn to ensure we were taken care of w/o being over the top. We are typical Renaissance hotel people when we are in Chicago - we avoid the Michigan Ave properties as they are much more crammed and value is lower. The location is a bit farther from Michigan, but we didn't have a problem getting around when we needed to. I wouldn't consider it a factor when I choose to stay here again - and I will. With the Reniassance, Blackstone and JW, Chicago has several great properties to choose from now.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "pa", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a health inspector\u201d", "Author": "conjuror88", "ReviewID": "UR107438291", "Content": "JW Marriot Chicago is a beautifully appointed hotel , sliding doors open to the wrong side ?

Bathrooms are nice, with the mirror bordered by florescent lights, great , white lights and the counter has dotted led lights which is great at nighttime. Toilet was not cleaned properly since there was some fecal residue on the sides, called the front desk. Next day we were missing some toiletries and towels, hair clump on the shower -front desk again, The cleaning time is not consistent since when I came back after lunch the room was not yet done. When calling for anything it takes a while for them to pick up like 5-7 rings. I have stayed at the Marriot before for medical and business conventions, but this hotel is sub par in terms of room cleanliness. DId not try the restaurant Florentine since it was empty we walked to Magnificent mile. In terms of location, it is a poor one especially if you have limited time after all the meetings and CME's.

(for example, i ordered a cheeseburger one night with a salad. The burger was dry and overcooked too welldone, the fries came cold, the salad was missing things on it that the menu said it had, and they were just too generous to send a single small bottle of catchup instead of a couple. Very basic, no table cloth and a lack of presentation) The rooms were very nicely decorated, but the standard room i had was small. Bathroom was clean and with good amenities. Spacious bathroom. The pool is still not ready, it has been about a year I think. Fitness center was impressively large. Overall i would probably stay here again as it is a nice hotel in good location.

Most days, they do not even clean the room until 6pm. Even when they do... the end up missing to refill all the bathroom amenities and one day, did not even refill the coffee / sugar / plastic coffee cups. Next day (after complaining to front desk) they end up piling on all the coffee & milk, but forgotten the cups and water. Even on a \"good\" day... they still forgot to the bathroom floor towels.

Union Station is only a couple of blocks away, which is great walking to/from the hotel. The JW Marriott just opened last year, and it is magnificent. The lobby is warm, clean, and very inviting. The bar has an excellent choice of beers, and for whatever reason the deserts were outstanding (you normally don't think of eating deserts while drinking at a bar, unless you are my wife). The service in the bar was extremely attentive (and all the cocktail waitresses were very attractive - don't worry - my wife said all the guys working at the bar were also attractive). The room was very modern and comfortable; including the bed. The bathrooms was very spacious and bright; our bathroom had a separate toilet room, a soaker tub, AND a walk-in shower. And last, but not least, the room service was fast and immaculate. The attention to detail was just incredible. It literally felt like they had three employees for every guest in the hotel. This was the best part of the JW Marriott - the employees being ready to assist. We felt like we were at a five-star hotel off the Champs-\u00c3\u2030lys\u00c3\u00a9es in Paris. You know how in the movies they show all the hotel employees running up to help a guest struggling with their three carts of luggage? That's what it felt like.

The bathroom was very nice, with a glass shower and oversized soaking tub. We ate in the restaurant for breakfast, and found the service to be okay. There were far too many staff members for the number of diners, and their \"overpresence\" was a bit annoying at times (not so much intrusive, but just too many staff members walking around the dining area constantly). They were friendly, however, and the food was excellent. We also ate dinner in the restaurant, and found the service much more complimentary to the atmosphere of the restaurant. The food at dinner was superb! The location of the hotel, while not in the middle of all the Chicago action, was convenient. The orange line train stop is only a block away, which makes getting to the hotel from Midway a breeze, and the bustling shopping of State Street is within walking distance. I find it enormously ironic that two of the reviews for this hotel are dated before the hotel opened.

The parking cost at this hotel was also very high, which is why we didn't bring a car. Overall, this hotel was very nice, and I would recommend it without hesitation.
