I admit that I was very worried about coming to the France Hotel which was already booked by a friend, as the majority of the reviews were terrible. However, I was pleasantly suprised when we arrived. The staff during the day are kind and approachable, and very willing to help with anything you may need, (We'd forgotten an iron and travel plugs, both of which they offered, as well as directions and advise on where to eat). The location of the hotel is perfect as it is within walking distance from everywhere. It is a five minute walk from the train station, all pubs and restaurants, as well as having near by shops. We got our breakfast in the pub next door which was average but included with the room so we couldn't complain! It's about 10 minutes away from the RLD, so far away enough to avoid it but close enough if you want to go and see it. Your also on a canal so whilst our room didnt have a great view, I'm sure some rooms do. The staff at night (one man inparticular) is extremley bad mannered and rude, however a complaint will be made directly to the hotel, and I would not let this influence us returning. It was a great, CLEAN (this was something i was espiecally worried about), low budget and central hotel, and I would recommend it to anyone going to Amsterdam. I travelled with my boyfriend and three other friends, and we were all happy enough with the hotel. We had a late flight home and the staff kindly held on to our bags as we walked around Amsterdam and went for a meal.

After about 20 minutes of walking around the RLD and walking into other hotels asking for directions, finally found this POS hotel, nestled away on a canal (it had NO road access) and right next to a gay bar (not that there's anything wrong with that, but the bar was ALWAYS full and VERY loud). Now, I've traveled a lot and I know what to expect in Europe when it comes to customer service. I respect, appreciate and understand it. I know I'm not going to get the same service I get in Australia, and that's fair enough. But when we finally got to the hotel and walked through the front door, only for the guy outside having a cigarette to say, \"Let me finish my cigarette\", I knew we were in for a rough 6 nights at the hotel. We checked it and made our way to our room. I've stayed in some dirty hostels before, but all were manageable considering the price. This hotel, considering the price and three-star rating, was TERRIBLE. Firstly, there was spit on the walls outside our room. Not just small blobs of spit, but actual green chunks of snot. There was no window in our room, or any sense of ventilation. The shower was FILTHY and the toilet was DISGUSTING! It actually still had someone's left-over lunch float around in it. As for the third bed, we had to roll it out and set it up ourselves, which is fine, but the sheets were DIRTY!!! We stayed one night in this POS hotel, before I booked us into the Park Plaza at a hefty price of 250-400 Euro per night (more over the weekend). It was worth it.

We shopped around for another hotel & enquired about cancelling the room at the France Hotel. We were especially shocked at the customer added photos that are on here, so we printed up the hotels own room photos from the website & took them with us ready to show them (France Hotel) the standard of rooms that we had paid for & expected should there have been any problems. We arrived at Amsterdams Central Station & after a short walk found the France Hotel. We went into reception & to be fair it is tired & could do with sprucing up, some decent chairs to relax in & a ban on smoking in this area, but when all said & done it is only a 3 star hotel which in our opinion is a fair rating. Checking in took rather a long time but the reception staff members were extremely thorough & helpful and this was to be the way for our entire stay when we had any questions or needed any information. So after checking in we made our way using the lift to our room, I opened the door expecting the worst but it was a very pleasant suprise the room was clean, fairly modern, a good size with plenty of storage space, nice ensuite & bearing in mind the 3 star rating we really couldn't of asked for any more. Breakfast was next door in the Irish Bar which was sufficient with sliced meats, eggs, sausages, cheeses, brand name cereals, yoghurt , toast, fresh rolls, fresh fruit & a selection of fruit juices, teas & coffees. To sum up our stay here, we did get what we had paid for, it was a 3 star hotel and that is what we got & was accurately described on the France Hotels website. The hotel was fine for our length of stay of 4 nights, its in a superb location on a quiet canal side in the heart of bustling central Amsterdam we would recommend it if you're travelling on a budget & we would stay here again. ** be aware of silly reports on here e.g such as statements of steep stairs leading to the reception and lift, these are 4 normal steps & scam central etc. I believe theres a lot of people who pay for 3 star & expect to get nothing less than 5 star for their money, this hotel certainly isn't the Movenpick but neither are you paying those prices**", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cJust what i was looking for!\u201d", "Author": "Lucy89", "ReviewID": "UR11685143", "Content": "I read bad reviews about the hotel after i had booked it so i was worried on arrival but the hotel turned out to be fine.

We had no choice but to accept since it was a Dutch bank holiday and all hotels were full. No apologies were offered at all - in fact we were made to feel grateful that they had sourced another room for in another hotel. No discount was offered , nothing. 2. The single room in Hotel France that my friend was given was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen - swinging cats beware ! For 130 euros I expected more than this. 3. On the morning of checkout when my friend came out of the shower he found a male hotel staff employee actually in his room berating him to check out (it was 11.30a.m).

We had read some bad reviews, so we were not expecting much, but the week before we were to go, they sent an email telling us that the only quad room they had was in the basement and for an extra $300 we could have two rooms upstairs. We chose to keep the quad room, but it was bad. When someone showered elsewhere in the hotel, the shower and toilet in our room would gurgle, and by the end of the week, it smelled terrible. We had to wade through squishy wet carpet in the hallway, and the smell of paint and other renovations going on around us sucked. I think we may have had a prostitute in the room next to us, as about every 20 min. or so there was someone knocking on the door throughout the night. The good thing was we had no incentive to go back to the hotel unless we were dead tired, so we got out and saw alot. The city was amazing, and everything really is within walking distance for even the moderately healthy person. The train schedule is really confusing, and even asking a couple of locals for help, we ended up on the wrong train, but it was an adventure.", "Date": "March 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for the Budget Traveller\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4618674", "Content": "Paid 140 Euros plus tax for two nights in March.

Booked over the internet as was advertised as a 3* hotel at a reasonable rate. Location perfect for sightseeing and Central station. Got there early so was given a key for the storage room to store our bags, but on returning found the room was unlocked! Then they couldn't find our Room key. This was because our room like a lot of the rooms had the keys in their doors!! So anyone could 'borrow' a key for 20 mins and make a copy. Our room which was an average room (having looked at a few others - see above) was extremely basic. White, artexed walls. Cheap, tacky furniture and 5 holes in the walls and ceiling where electrical fittings were or are to be! Some with wiring on view. In addition, the AC unit was partly boxed in but had no grill, no underside to the boxing and was in plain plasterboard. On going to our room the whole of the Ground and 3rd floors were covered in dust sheets with workmen in several of the bedrooms. We were not made aware at the booking stage or on check-in/payment there was work going on, so after we had looked at our room, and tiptoed around workmen and dustsheets etc, we complained. No refund was offered. They did not accept certain parts of the hotel should be closed when refurbs were taking place. They maintained they were 3*, and that the work would not inconvenience me. No adjustment to their rate, saying 'see what our rack rate is!!' We were offered another room, but after tramping up to the top floor found out they were taking the mick! I explained that as much as my work colleague and I liked each other, as married men we didn't think it was a good idea for us to give up a twin room for one with a double bed!! Next morning, after we were woken up by a Power drill being used next door at 07.40, we had a very good breakfast next door in the Irish pub, it must be acknowledged, but on getting back to the hotel found an American guest arguing with Reception staff about how his Laptop and Passport had disappeared from his room!! 5 girls from London who were trying to check-in above this mans' anger and the work noise decided to go elsewhere, with the threat from Reception that 'we will still charge your credit card for 1 night anyway'!! Dashed up to our room to check our belongings were still there. There are very few rooms with openable windows in the hotel, hence the AC, and I would doubt that the refurb work is anything but cosmetic to cover up deficiencies. I book thousands of bed nights per year with my business (I promise no exaggeration) - this hotel is at best 1*, in standard and more importantly in attitude. Don't stay here unless you're paying 1* rates.", "Date": "September 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Paul, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cok hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3903360", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for only one night on our way to Paris for our honeymoon.

Me, my husband and a couple friend got there for a 3 nights stay.

After expressing my big disappointment, I was told that we still had to sleep in those rooms for the first night and that they could only move us for different rooms the day after. And we did sleep in claustrophobic rooms, hot, with dirty floors and in beds were I had to put a tee shirt in order to put my face on, because sheets weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t properly cleaned. And this was not the end: one day I believe someone from outside stayed there when we were not there and I had to make a big noise and call the manager.
