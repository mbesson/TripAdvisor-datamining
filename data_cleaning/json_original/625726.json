We booked the holiday extravaganza package which included: Complimentary internet Welcome basket upon arrival Bottle of bubbles Complimentary fruit on arrival Breakfast Upon arrival we were sorely disappointed. Check in staff were rude and nonchalant and once up in our room we were horrified to find a mouldy bathroom, dirty carpets, chipped furniture and dirty marks up the walls. We also had none of the welcome baskets, fruit or bubbles as promised. We went down to reception to complain and were told someone would come up to our room. We called down to reception another two times before someone finally came up to the room and he agreed the room was in poor condition. We were given a box of 6 chocolates by way of an apology which we thought was pretty rubbish as we still had not received our welcome goodies. The staff were not concerned and didn't really seem to care and gave us the business card of the manager for us to email on Monday morning. I would recommend you avoid paying the extortionate prices to stay here and book into a nicer hotel where the staff actually give a monkeys about complaints. We received a full refund from the manager after showing him the photos and were promised a voucher for a free stay which never materialised (which we are secretly glad about as I would never stay here again!)

This trip I was located in a Premier Deluxe on the 36th floor with views out over the harbour to the East and Darling Harbour to the West. The room had a separate lounge/kitchenette area, with washer and dryer hidden away in a cupboard. There was a study alcove with desk and plenty of space and the main bedroom was spacious with an ample sized bathroom. What's hot? The location is great and central with access to most of the city with a 15 minute walk. There is a railway station within a 5 minutes mostly underground walk. Restaurants nearby include Chinese, Japanese, French and Spanish - pretty much anything you could want really. Coffee shops and bars are all close. Staff are generally very friendly and very helpful and it's more personal than a large hotel. The gym is very big with decent equipment and there is a GREAT lap pool and spa. The hotel and rooms are all modern and well equipped. What's not so hot? My rate included internet which worked well but was cumbersone to connect - you had to phone concierge, who had to phone you back with a code. Why not give you that on check-in? The shower was good - but in sore need of repair, with tiles coming loose on the floor. On the weekends you may have to put up with large groups and the odd noisy room - probably because the Suites are more catering to the weekday business crowd and they are much cheaper than a hotel.

I've been meaning to write a review for a while and here goes. The best thing about it is the one bedroomed apartments are very quiet - in the bedrooms you can't hear your neighbours. I'm very, very fussy with noise and love it here. The bedroom is seperate to the lounge and kitchen and has a closing door. The apartments are modern and stylish and the toiletries are great - Peter Thomas Roth hair care, body wash and lotion. I also like that a nail file, cotton wool balls and ear buds are provided along with a shower cap. It's the small things that make a stay easier. And I have lots of mini-nail files rattling in my handbag now! Beds are comfy and towels fluffy. My only sticking point is that only two towels are provided per couple and us girls use more than one towel when we wash our hair! The lighting always confuses the hell out of us - we can never work out which switch is for which light - those who have stayed there before will understand what we mean! Staff are lovely and know us by name, which you'd expect after staying there every week for over 1.5 years! Amenities are great - the pool is semi suspended over a walkway and is usually quiet. The spa is good and the gym is adequate for a hotel - 3 treadmills, 3 bikes, weights and a few other machines. The sauna is also good and there are showers for pool hygene. The location is great if you need to be near Town Hall - it's right next to St Andrew's cathedral, near Pitt St mall for shopping (3-5 minute walk), the QVB (2 min walk) and heaps of great restaurants. It's also a short stroll to Darling Harbour - maybe 5 mins and Chinatown. Restaurants we frequent are Chef's Gallery for asian food around the corner on Bathurst St, Diethenes Greek Restaurant (hillarious decore - serious stuck in the 1980s, but unreal Greek food at a great price), the tapas bar at the Sir John Young Hotel on the corner of Liverpool and George Sts and Mamak malaysian in Chinatown. However, if you really want to stay closer to the Harbour Bridge, Opera House and Circular Quay, I would stay that down that end of town. It's a good 20-30 minute walk, although free buses run down George St fairly regularly. When the Meriton on Kent St has very good deals, we have sometimes stayed there, but always wishing we were at the Fraser Suites. The Meriton is OK, but generally smells of cigarette smoke and is not as luxurious as the Fraser Suites. I don't think the staff really care about their customers either. All in all, there's a reason we keep coming back to the Fraser Suites.

The mini fridge makes an occasional hum which was inaudible when I wore my ear plugs also cigerette smoke seeped in from the hallway which annoyed me to a degree. There is also a shortage of power points in the apartment, I had to unplug one of my bedside table lamps in order charge my iPhone. Finally on checkout receiption tried to charge me $60 for internet usage even though I haven't used it, after explaining this they admitted it was a system glitch and waived the charge.

Upon arrival in my hotel room I noticed that we were allocated a room right next to the lifts. I was not too happy about this, because I requested a quiet room away from the lifts. But because they were full capacity, they could not move us to another room. The hotel rooms are pretty clean. The rooms are roomy. When we arrived in the room we noticed a bottle of wine and a letter. The letter or wine was not for us, it was for someone else. We notified reception and they promptly took the items away, but let us keep the wine. This was a nice gesture. The rooms were quite hot when we arrived. We turned on the air conditioning and it was still hot. It appeared that the air conditioning was not working properly. We saw a cleaner come past our room, so we asked his help with the air conditioning and he said it is definitely not working. So we decided to call reception for assistance. They said they would send someone up to have a look. Three calls later and approximately 45 minutes later the manager Ben came to have a look. We told him that the cleaner agreed that the air conditioning was not working. Ben then rudely said \"No offence the cleaners do not really know much about air conditioning\". We were shocked that he spoke so disrespectfully about his staff members! The manager Ben also treated us rudely too, he treated us like we were clueless. I may not be an air conditioning specialist, but I have stayed in enough hotels to know when the air conditioning is not working. Eventually the air conditioning got fixed. The air conditioning did stop working that night. A maintenance worker came to fix the air conditioning before we checked out. The beds in the hotel room were quite soft. The bathrooms were quite roomy and clean. The hair dryer is really bad! The hotel itself is located in a good position. Convenient for travellers who want to stay in the middle of everything and in close vicinity to major attractions. I would advise travellers to be aware of the heating issues with the rooms.

Secondly, the bed was one of the most uncomfortable i have ever encountered (way too soft - no back support) and the pillows were ridiculously high and hard. The curtains although thick and heavy were not surrounded by pelmets so light streamed in the sides and tops. The noise level from the street was incredible, in particular considering I was on the 31st floor. All of this made for a very poor night's sleep. Thirdly, the bathroom, although clean and modern had very poor lighting. It was as if everything was on dimmer. Not conducive to shaving etc in the mirror. Lastly, although the hotel offers in room breakfast, disappointingly it is only limited to non cooked food. On the positive, the hotel is clean, modern and in a nice location. Breakfast in the restaurant was quaint although having arrived at 7:45am with only 3 other people in the restaurant I was surprised to see half of the cooked food empty.

The rooms are lovely and have a real mood about them, sexy and sophisticated and are massive (we stayed in a large one bedroom) Lovely lounge area and separate seating area, good dining space and little kitchen with everything you need. Also has a huge desk and work area where i did actually have to work during my 4 day stay. Again no free wifi ! Australia needs to sort this out... Everywhere in the UK and most places in europe has free WIFI in the rooms now, bit of a joke you have to pay for it ! I just ended up using my phone and tethering. Bedroom is massive, loads of storage another desk area and another big tv with all foxtellchannels (all foxtel sport channels 1-3) which i enjoyed as i could catch up with the EPL. The bathroom was lovely, no bath, but a big double shower and lovely big mirrors and a good washer dryer to use. Great products which were replaced daily. Also the use of a robe during your stay, which is handy for the pool. The pool and gym were great. Had a place to sit by the pool unlike the Meriton apartments down the road, also had towels to use by the pool and a good jacuzzi. The gym was huge with everything you could need, probably best hotel gym i have been in. It had a punch bag, loads of free weights, 5-6 resistance machines plus all the usual cardio stuff. This hotel is lovely and the reception team are great and very helpful ! i requested a high room before my visit and i was given the 29th floor facing out towards darling harbour (sunset every night) it was lovely. They did tell me when i asked for a high room i could pay 30 dollars for my whole stay and i would be granted one. I ignored this and chanced my luck, it paid off ! Unless if I paid the 30 bucks i would have been given floor 40 - 49 with views across the city i dont think it would have been worth it. So why have i not given it 5 stars ? Basically there are a few issues with the state of the property, they are not even massive things. In our room there were scuff marks by the door and on the wall where other people staying at the hotel have obviously dragged their bag along the wall. Also the door between the bedroom and the living room did not work properly and some of the furniture is starting to have wear marks on the corners and little chips. You can over look these things which i did after the initial 20 mins in the room. If you go to any hotel which has been around since 2007 it also is going to have a few things wrong with it. All they need to do is get the sugar soap out and tweak a few things. I would stay here again for sure and in fact i will be using the hotel again early next year as i think the size of the suites are amazing and the look and feel is exceptional. I am going to stay at the 4 seasons though for one night just to see what that is like as it is also reasonably priced.

Going into this I did have my concerns due to some reviews here and Radisson was rank 7th at the time and Fraser Suites 26th. But I wanted to decide myself. I booked a One bedroom suite as part of the City Lights package for $356 per night this included alot of complimentary things of course, bottle of wine, breakfast for two, a guaranteed high level room from lvl 32 and up and also some other things I cant remember. Upon arrival I could see the lobby which was very modern decked out with contemporary design. Staff was very pleasant and check in was quick and was advised my room was on the highest level which was lvl 41which I was happy cause that was my request I made to be on the highest floor. Our room was 4104. Instantly i had a feeling this was gonna be a great experience, as I entered the room I was amazed in how spacious the suite was, decor (which is really important to me) was great. You just wanna live there forever. I dont really understand the negative reviews here because if you compare this to other hotels who specializes in suites and other supposedly 5 star apartment complex FRASER is way above them all. Room was clean, we had a kitchenette area as well, bedroom was big and the views were amazing, NOW to the bed, very very comfortable, im pretty sure they use latex beds, I was scared they were going to do what Meriton does, join two singles together and use cheap beds. So I was surprise by that to. After me, my partner and friends had went to the fashion festival, enjoyed a late night feed and our frens went home. We decided we need a late check out. Even though it was 12.15am when we walked in to the hotel, we asked the friendly staff member for a late check out, and it was done with no problems. Late check out was 12pm. Check out was great, and I had advised I will be back and will request the same room cause I was so pleased with everything. The staff also reminded me that they had fax my bank for the bond to be released back in my account which was very comforting.

The first occasion was for four nights in a studio room which we were quite pleased with no complaints we found it to be quite spacious and probably exceeded our expectations. We went to Noosa for a week and returned for the final three nights of our holiday. We stayed in a one bedroom superior room which in our opinion was wonderful. It had a living room, a fully equipped kitchen, with a larger than average fridge, a microwave, dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer perfect for catching up with the washing before going home. We had two TV'S a spacious bedroom and a large bathroom with a walk in shower and a bath. We had the all singing letters of welcome as returning guests, plus some fruit. I had a shower and it seemed a bit wet underfoot but I didn't take much notice. On the second day I had a shower and I thought this is very odd, the water seemed to be coming back up from the floor after further investigation I found that the tiles were loose and the water was lodging underneath the tiles. ( Read report two previous from Perth) I pressed the tiles with my hand and the water came spouting up. I rang reception and asked them to send a maintenance person so he could check it out. The receptionist pointed out that they were aware of the problem, however they could not move us as the hotel was full. Basically they had allocated us a room which they knew had existing problems and presumably hoped we would not notice or bother to complain about it. I spoke to the duty manager and asked what he could do to compensate us for the inconvenience. He could not refund us anything as we had pre paid. How about a free breakfast. Sorry sir but the hotel would have to pay for the breakfast. We were offered some fruit or a late check out, nothing else. We could be moved the following day but it was our last night so we couldn't be bothered with the hassle. The problem is that you are standing in stagnant water as the previous reviewer pointed out it is probably full of germs to say the least. Apart from this issue we really enjoyed our stay. We cannot compare this hotel on prices as we have never stayed in a hotel in Australia previously. The hotel is well located, being close to all amenities, pubs, restaurants, shops and a large Woolworth's supermarket which is very useful. Darling Harbour is very close by as is the train station. Staff are very friendly and helpful. We would probably stay in this location again and possibly this hotel if the plumbing issues were resolved.

No one followed up and I was told I had to check out. I do not have a problem with checking out but upon looking at other travel websites I found that they were offering rooms at $2000 per night. Rather than keep a customer happy they allowed me to leave and cancel the rest of my reservation. I doubt they were able to get $2000 for that one night so they lost revenue from all of the nights I canceled. I asked to speak to the manager and was told she was on leave and that another manager would get back to me on Monday.

The room was very spacious it had a kitchen with a stove, microwave, mini bar a dining table for 2 and a very big lounge with a beautiful tv and dvd player all with floor to ceiling height windows with the view of Sydney (we could see town hall and st Andrews from our room) the bedroom had a king size bed- best sleep ever! The pillow and bed were extremely comfortable, and there was a second tv in the bedroom on the wall. The bathroom was also wonderful, spacious with a large shower- plenty of hot water. The only compliant would be the toilet it did not flush properly. There was a built in laundry, study desk with free wifi and a large wardrobe- perfect for a romantic weekend away. Now the penthouse..one word AMAZING! As you walk in the door you are faced with a stylish set of stairs. The first floor of the penthouse consists of 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms a kitchen and lounge room, as you walk up the stairs there is another huge lounge room and kitchen with 180 degree view of Sydney, it also faced north so we received plenty of sunlight it was an amazing room. There was also another large bedroom and bathroom with a spa bath- as well as a private study. I would recommend the penthouse for parties- or Hens nights, we had hired a beauty therapist who did massages, facials, pedi and manis for the day in the penthouse, it was absolutely wonderful. The hotel itself is nice, the staff were friendly, we did not have time to look at the indoor pool unfortunately. The breakfast at the hotel served on the mezzanine was nice, they was a choice of fruits, yougurts, cereal, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages for $28.

In fact, as our room had not been cleaned the day after we arrived (we had left a do not disturb sign on the door), reception followed up with us twice to make sure it was cleaned the following day. The location is excellent: it's close to Town Hall station and the CBD. It is also only a 5-10 minute walk to Darling Harbour which is where we ended up going almost every day for breakfast/lunch as well as Chinatown where we twice had dinner. The only negative I can think of is that water kept falling in the toilet bowl for a long time (and very loudly) if we used the left button to flush the toilet instead of the right one.

We arrived at 5pm (had told then 6pm) our room on level 16 was clean, and ready. We found Hotel is very new, maybe 12 months old and contemporary design. No faux gilded luxury, but clean, crisp modern finishes. Staff very helpful (despite WOTIF purchase and I mention this as previous mystery WOTIF booking at another CBD Hotel made us feel like interlopers when we asked for any upgrades). Here staff apologized being full due to Rugby State of Origin on that night but freely offered complimentary late checkout of 12pm. We declined having early business to attend so they countered with free bag pick up and storage from our rooms the next morning. Not bad. Lift very, very fast. Again contemporary styled long room with full length and width view over offices to Darling Harbor (but not for long as new building being built). Rooms are called studio which to me only diff is sink in kitchenette, which is appreciated when making morning cup of tea as somehow filling the kettle from the hand basin next to Toilet does not feel the same. Good work Desk with work chair. Also Comfy designer copy swivel chair and foot stool. Smaller than usual huge LCD TV but that mean it does not dominate room and we go to a Hotel to watch TV? Free pay TV. King size bed! YES Large, modern bathroom with surprisingly, a huge amount of storage. Good towels with lots hot water supply via dual shower of showerhead or hand held hose. Shower only in ours. Note: bathroom AND shower is heavily mirrored so that can be err, romantic bonus or a bit confronting for some?! Location: central as Hotel next to Church next to Sydney Town Hall /Council/Town Hall Station so for those who don\u2019t know, the geographical centre of Sydney CBD. Easy to walk around. We changed in comfortable clothes and walked the 10 min to Cockle Bay/ Darling Harbour. We returned after Lindt Caf\u00e9 Hot Chocolates ($7 each but special) and I showered whilst wife watched the pay TV. Back down the fast lift and out to George Street (50 m) we hoped a bus to the Rocks to \u201cBaroque\u201d restaurant (awesome and affordable French bistro). Say 10 minutes at 7pm on bus. Returned around 9:30pm and enjoyed a great night sleep in again, Kings Size Bed. We woke early and showered no issues with hot water and left at 8:30am to breakfast at \u201cLe Grande\u201d Caf\u00e9. Again, very good French food for $20 all up. So we cannot confirm or deny other reviews that breakfast is overpriced and average but experience has taught us ALL Hotel breakfasts (unless the restaurant in the Hotel is itself of note, like Liliansfells \u201cDarley Restaurant \u201cor Radisson \u201cCelsius\u201d) are overpriced. I.E. Soffitel Wentworth charged $38 a head for typical buffet. Note to Soffitel: nothing out of warmer tray is worth $38 each. Staff wished us well onleaving and confirmed bags storage and on our return at 2pm luggage was stored and ready to go, they called Taxi and we left to smiles.

The location being very central drew me to choose this hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel from the airport, the front counter staff was very quick to allow us to check-in and we were upgraded (with a fee) to a larger family suite. The room was nice, with a good kitchenette and laundry facilities. I thought to myself that I had made a wise decision in choosing this hotel. All went well till the same afternoon when we heard a fire alarm followed by an announcement that it is actually a fire drill. This happened when we were all resting after the flight. A little bit irritated, we just continued sleeping. The front counter staff was all very kind and polite, but they knew nothing about the surrounding shops and eateries. Whenever we asked them about where to get thai food, or indian food, or any food for that matter, we always got back a blank look followed by vague directions. Most of the time, we just walked about and found shops, which are abundant nearby. The location is really good as many shops and shopping complexes are near, but the staff does not have a clue on where the shops are. Mind you, we were not asking for the \"best restaurant\", we are just asking for \"a restaurant\". On the second night, at about 1.00 am in the morning, there was again another fire alarm! I was wondering what the heck is going on! Since we were at a higher floor, I thought I'd better check just in case there is really a fire. When I opened my room door, there was water flowing from the smoke detector on the ceiling! I peeked out and found two people running down the stairs saying fire! I immediately got my family, put on the shoes, got our passports and wallet, and went out of the room. As we stepped out, a front desk staff appeared, and told us to be calm, and that it was a false alarm. He said he doesn't know why the alarm was triggered, but told us to go back into the room. Unfortunately, the water flowed into our room and flooded the front entrance and carpet. I was then adviced to go to the lobby, using the lift and wait there. A little while later, the same staff came down and said he has sorted out the flooding. I went to check and found that they took OUR towels and used them as floor mats to absorb the water! Furious, I told them to sort out the cleaning, close my door, and give me another room. They obliged and gave me a room with a queen size bed for the four of us. Really, it was uncomfortable. Just before going to bed after the dramatic night, I just thought I'd go check if the room was closed and locked by them. Thank god I checked, as the room was just left bare open with all our belongings in it. The next morning, we woke up early and went back to our room, as we had to catch a bus to the Blue Mountains, . We took all the towels from the temporary room to our actual room, got dressed and then left for the Blue Mountains. When we came back, we saw the room cleaned in a shoddy manner, and the carpets still damp. Oh, what the heck, just forget about it and we went on with our activities. Of course, lots of apologies from the front counter staff, but that's all we got. The cleaning service was really bad! On the last day, we decided to go to the Sydney aquarium. It is in Darling Harbour. At Darling Harbour, there were many nice simple food outlets, any type you want! I was just thinking, why didn't they just direct us to Darling Harbour, which is about 10 minutes walking, to get food? Why were the front counter staff soooooo......blurrrrrrrr when we asked them about the eating places around? In conclusion, Sydney is a nice place to visit. However, I would not stay at Fraser Suites in Sydney again. The front counter staff are poorly trained and do not have a clue on how to give answers to simple questions.

There was a strange sliding glass enclosure in the larger suite. When slid accross the width of the suite it made an enclosure, kind of like a balcony about 4 feet deep. You could literally lock someone in the space. I really couldn't figure it out. My autistic son loved sliding the glass doors back and forth and his older brother only locked him in the space once.

Fraser Suites, we stayed there a few times already, because we believe that there has to be something good in everyone.

(just to make sure!) be prepared that they might ask you to wait till your partner arrives too to check in together (hard if your partner attends a conference with an open end discussion as the last point of the program) or change the booking to your name and credit card (even if it was prepaid!). If it's a business trip for your Partner, this would be really helpful! After showing them the print from the original booking again (the name of the person ching in written on it), they might let you check in -after photocopying your photo ID. -You finally get to your room, just close the door have a look out the window to admire the view, there might be a knock on the door with a guy shouting 'minibar'! opening the door before you get the chance to get there... tells you he has to check the minibar if the previous guest has taken something out -remember arriving at check-in counter quarter past 3pm (check-in is from3pm, that's what's written in their bochure...) and after the discussions there it was well after 3pm so there should have been enough time to check the minibar right? The guy might looked at you and ask if you've just checked in??? If you say yes he might open the minibar and start talking to himself :don't know, something's wrong here, can't quite figure it out... checking for another few minutes remember the room in this case has the size of a shoebox so you might imagine the size of the fridge.... then he might come a bit closer to you (still admiring the view out the window) while having a look around the room, giving you the kind of look, like I know you're probably a bad person. Telling you he has to bring a new bottle of water, as there is one missing! You might have an almost full bottle of powerade (know it's bad stuff) in your hand so you obviously didn't take the water out the minibar, just seconds after finally getting into the room.... -when your partner will check in later after, tired after a long conference - they'll do the Photo ID copying thing again, even if they have yours already and even if you're returning 'guest'. -as you might have stayed there before you'll know you can leave the showergel at home as they tend to have a good one...but there could be nothing in the room, so you have to ask for it, the next day as there might have been a bit left in the tiny plastic bottle you didn't throw it away...as you still try to be at least a tiny bit ecofriendly. so of course you won't get a new one again... you check out (in this case) on the first of november 09 and already have the feeling it's enough now -we won't do it again! You might receive a letter from Fraser Suites two days later, telling you that they will charge 3$ from our Credit card for the water from the minibar.... Well how good is that! The guy really knew that you're such a bad person!! It's not about 3$ it's about treating guest should write customer as guest isn't quite right at this place. So in the summary we can't recommend it any more as there had been too many of this 'small incidents' that just accumulate to the stage of 'unbearable' treatment of customers. Fraser Suites is not a cheap place at all and maybe they got to busy too fast. So if you go there don't feel too disappointed if they don't treat you as they should.

The Hotel was very nice, however seemed a little lacking in personality (which is sometimes the case with bigger hotels). Our room was very comfortable and was certainly spacious. There was a clearly defined lounge/dining area (with a washing machine and dryer in a little cupboard off to one side), this area also housed a small kitchen space (not that this was used for the duration of our stay). The bedroom was nice and as we were on the 47th floor we had some nice views of the city and a tiny glimpse of the Harbour Bridge - the room and hotel however, was not chosen for views. The bed was really comfortable - king sized, with nice crisp linen. The bathroom was off the bedroom area and had a good sized tub and a great shower with terrific water pressure. The room was decorated in shades of grey and was quite modern. I could find no fault with the furnishings (taking into account the general wear expected in a well used apartment). Location wise the Fraser Suites were wonderful - very close to everything and close to transports routes to boot. The lobby was quite nice - as were the general use facilities such as the gym, swimming pool, sauna etc. These were well frequented by many guests during our stay. We had one small issue (which I was not sure about mentioning), but have obviously decided to! The first night of our stay we returned to our room after a lovely dinner - bathed, etc and went to slip into the robes supplied, only to find one had what was very obviously faeces on it!!! This was around 11:30pm - so we called down to the front desk to have someone come and collect it - no-one wants someone elses poo in their room after all! This information was met with a giggle... We could see some humour in this situation but would have appreciated a little more professionalism. A young man came and collected the offending robe and took it away - but did not supply a replacement. The next morning on the way out to breakfast - my husband asked at this reception counter if someone would replace the soiled robe. Reception knew nothing of this - no information had been supplied to day staff about this incident. The lovely lady on reception at this time was quite horrified and extremely apologetic. When we returned to our room a fresh robe had been supplied and a message had been received to contact the duty manager regarding the matter. We rang the manager who apologised and sent a bottle of wine to our room.... That was that and nothing was mentioned again reagrding this matter. In all fairness, whoever had soiled the robe had gone to great pains to hang it again exactly as it had been and I'm assuming housekeeping staff therefore did not notice the offending marks...... Perhaps something they could have housekeeping check in future???? Other than this - there were no issues with our stay and the hotel was modern, pleasant and had all the facilities you would expect. I would probably stay here again - but would recommend a check of the bathrobes before popping one on!", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "hong kong", "Title": "\u201cno complaints but not fantastic either\u201d", "Author": "familymanHongKong", "ReviewID": "UR28047413", "Content": "The location is very close to the subway station but of course as a tourist if you could stay next to circular quay I would recommend it to avoid the multiple trips to this central departure point to most tourist spots.

The design is very nice, warm and contemporary with hardwood floors, huge floor to ceiling windows and limestone bathrooms. Everything has been executed to a nice quality. There is also a nice pool and a decent sized gym with good equipment. My only one true reservation is that the housekeeping was slightly cursory, and with so many glossy luxurious surfaces dust, grime and fingerprints quickly become apparent - certainly not a disaster but also not really up to 4 or 5 star standard. While the street isn't the most salubrious, on the slightly run down Kent, it is fantastically convenient to the city. You can walk literally anywhere in the city center from there in no time, it is close to both the restaurants of China town and hundreds of other great eateries that Sydney has to offer. Also right near both Town Hall train station and the monorail stop. All in all the location cannot be faulted.

We have 2 young children (both under 2) so we had booked a deluxe 2 bedroom. Problem #1 - the 2 bedroom apartment is actually a 1 bedroom and a studio interconnected by a hallway. The doors are quite heavy, and there was no door stops to hold the doors open to make it one big apartment. We contacted the concierge 3 times before he finally brought a door stop up to us - however we could only have 1 - as the other one was needed elsewhere!! Ingeniously we managed to tie the doors open using the cords from the robes, however other than when our 18 month old slept in the bed we didn't use the studio side at all so it was really a waste of $200 in getting the 2 bedroom. The hotels location is great if you are doing things up that end of town. Very handy to the Entertainment centre, Capitol Theatre, Pitt Street mall, QVB and Darling Harbour - but for 1st time visitors and tourists there are hotels with better views and facilities elsewhere (Quay Grand at circular Quay is Fantastic.) Although the hotel is in the Spanish Quarter NONE of the nearby restaurants do takeaway - and as we have 2 young children we don't like dragging them out to restaurants at night - the hotel does not have room service - HOT TIP - ask reception for cuisine Courier/Mr Delivery menus and they will even charge it to your account. There was no bath in the bathrooms which may also be harder for some people with children - i do belive that the 1 bedroom premier suites do have baths though.

Also the entire stay the corridors were peppered with vacumn cleaners and blue laundry baskets. Also no in-house movies. Just generally a real lack of service for the price and placement of the hotel. Would be very hard pushed to return.", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cThere are better places out there\u201d", "Author": "JRrrr", "ReviewID": "UR6823087", "Content": "First of all, I have never been charged for a newspaper in the morning before. Fraser really surprised me with this charge. When I checked in, they ased me to fill out a form, in that form it asked which newspaper I would like to receive in the morning. I checked one newspaper, and when I checked out, there was a charge for each newspaper I received. At other hotels, they would always give papers at no cost. So be sure to be ready to pay for the newspapers if you stay here...otherwise, don't choose to receive one. Customer service is not up to standard with the rest of the industry. There was no gesture whatsoever that say \"thank you for staying with us\" from check in to check out. I was disappointed. The room itself is quite modern, I stayed in the studio suite, but let me tell you, it was smaller than the place I stayed in NYC. It was actually one of the smallest hotel room I have always been in. Even my typical local hotel in Tokyo was bigger than this room. I echo the other comments and would suggest that you avoid this place if you have other options.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LONDON", "Title": "\u201cGood rooms but unprofessional, dreadful service\u201d", "Author": "JASONPTODD", "ReviewID": "UR6627722", "Content": "The rooms were of good quality and very modern, although the beds weren't comfortable.

When we first arrived we were issued with our keys but could not find the room. Only when we returned to reception were we told that our room was behind a door with a different number, but that the door shouldn't be closed. We arranged for groceries to be delivered to us and it took them twenty minutes to locate us when the delivery driver arrived (despite the fact that we had pre-warned them of its arrival). The rooms are incredibly small and lacking basic amenities such as a toaster and a book detailing hotel information. The bathroom was filthy, so much so that I would not use it. We asked that it be cleaned and waited for an hour before going out and reminding reception as we went out. Of course, when we returned it still was not clean. Housekeeping did it whilst we were there. It was not cleaned on two other of our five day stays. The first day we let it go, but when we contacted housekeeping on the second day they asked what we wanted done!!! The rooms appear not to have been dusted since the hotel's opening, and some of the glasses in our room appeared to have toothpaste wash in them. The housekeeping staff speak limited English (although they are very pleasant). Our hallway was constantly littered with a dirty linen trolley and the cleaning closet door was often ajar. The staff are incompetent, generally lacking basic customer service skills such as greeting customers with \"Good morning\" rather than \"Are you checking out?\". One evening they were more concerned about what pizzas they were going to order than attending to guests needs, and on another occasion loudly discussed another guest and the fact that they thought she was on drugs. The promised complimentary paper was delivered erratically. We asked for a taxi to be called on one occasion and after a long wait were advised that we were probably better off hailing one from the street. Every time we went to the reception desk we were asked if we were checking out! No, we are not checking out, there is another problem!!! The elevators are extremely slow and the reception area is freezing cold. There is no internet access in the business facilities. On the positive (I have to try to find some!) the recreation area is excellent (although I would be concerned about cleanliness) and the location is very central (5 minute walk to Darling Harbour).", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201clovely rooms, terrible service\u201d", "Author": "ukm2009freqtrav", "ReviewID": "UR6553671", "Content": "the suites here are very good standard - exceptional quality bathrooms and beds - the hotel has only been open 7 weeks. if you are looking for 5 star service however they have a long way to go. ask for a suite above floor 38. the swimming pool and spa are indoors but good quality.", "Date": "January 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cLacks \u2018ambience\u2019 - Give it a bit more time.\u201d", "Author": "Heather3000", "ReviewID": "UR6178457", "Content": "The reception is pretty and service was very friendly. This place has only been open for a few weeks so there were a few things 'missing' from this place. We were taken to a room on the 15th floor in which they said if we didn\u2019t like it we could be upgraded to a room on the 19th floor. The room on the 15th floor was terrible. It felt somewhat like a prison cell where everything (lounge/dining/bedroom suite) was cramped into what seemed like a tiny little box and the views were the back of the brick walls of the surrounding buildings (very unattractive and extremely claustrophobic). For the amount of money we paid, I would have asked for my money back. So we went for the room on the 19th floor in which the room was a lot more spacious, (not as pretty as the website pictures), everything was set out nicely and the view was of the other surrounding apartments (eg: looking out onto other balcony's unsightly rubbish) and a little bit of Darling Harbour). Missing: \u2018ambience\u2019, welcome/facilities book, rubbish bin liners, and complimentary newspaper. Found a dirty towel in the bathroom (bathroom was nice) and a few dirty marks on the bedroom wall. (not what I had expected from a place like this). Luckily housekeeping came around to see if everything was ok and they were extremely apologetic and replaced the towel and cleaned the wall. Breakfast was pleasant. Small eating area (I think this area might be \u2018temporary\u2019 until they find a bigger room perhaps??) . Gym area, pool, sauna and spa were great. Location? Excellent!!! Right in the heart of Sydney city. Everything was close-by, Darling Harbour, China town, George Street, QVB. Great place to stay if you\u2019re staying in the Sydney CBD. After our day-trip we returned to our room to find the rubbish bins had bin liners in them and two complimentary chocolate biscuits were placed in the kitchen area. This place seemed like it was forced to become available before it was actually \u2018ready\u2019. Felt sorry for the staff as they seemed \u201cshort-staffed\u201d most of the time. Overall this place was okay. I would rate it as a 4 star apartment.

My family had two separate suites, one of which had a separate bedroom, and combined kitchen / dining / lounge area; the other was a simple bedroom with tea / coffee amenities similar to a hotel room. Both had ensuite bathrooms. Both suites were very nicely appointed in a business style, with dark wooden floors, dark walls and yellow highlights used in the kitchen area and in some of the furniture. The views from the room were alright, with glimpses of Darling Harbour from our side of the building, but not spectacular. The suite with kitchen was everything a small family could want, with cooktop, fridge, whisper-quiet dishwasher, microwave and dining table, large lounge area with a large flat panel TV and DVD player (with another TV in the bedroom). Good value if you are staying for more than one night, as prices compare to smaller high-end hotels and the rooms are just as well decorated and you get more room to move and the option of cooking a meal or two there. For those who don't just want to laze around or shop, the leisure centre on level 12 was well-equipped, with a lap pool (50m, I think), spa, sauna, and gym area; all brand new of course. Breakfast was marred by having to wait some 45 mins due to the crowds. I would recommend either going early on a Sunday morning (before 9 am) or go during the week if you can, otherwise risk not having the full buffet experience as the food ran a little low. On the other hand, the restaurant staff were very attentive to our needs when we arrived to make up for the delay. At any rate, there are plenty of other places to dine in the area if this is a concern, so don't let this put you off. Location is fantastic, on a street parallel to the main shopping thoroughfare in the Sydney CBD (George St), so a bit quieter than the main road, yet still in close proximity to cinemas, supermarkets, shopping, bars ... the QVB, World Square, Chinatown, Darling Harbour etc. The reception staff are very friendly, polite and helpful. We were never asked to wait as the desk was well staffed at all times. The staff also were very keen to hear feedback and improve the service and facilities, which was pleasant to see, and I suppose a result of the fact that the Suites are newly opened, but hopefully a trend that continues. Overall a really good experience with a lot of bang for you buck!
