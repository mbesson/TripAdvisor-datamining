The other thing that has grown is the noise from bars(all night) and traffic so the easy 5 block(maybe 7 min) walk from the plaza to the beach is just about the right distance away from most of it. hotel is less than 3 years old so it's all in new condition, no bugs or pests of any kind. excellent family oriented service, very friendly and helpful. the included breakfast was definitely better than average. maybe Plaza's biggest problem is it's bargain price, Because of it I think there was quite a younger clientele which made for a noisy 1-3 am and with the big open hallway and there being no carpet to knock the noise down it was more than annoying.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "lovetheyucatan", "ReviewID": "UR58503925", "Content": "We enjoyed our 5 night stay at Hotel Plaza.
