{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Outstanding value! I cannot recommend this hotel/serviced apartment highly enough. - The front desk staff was always extremely helpful and communication was easier than you may be led to believe is likely in China. We relied heavily on the staff for translations of locations (we were in Beijing on business and thus had to travel to several locations during the course of our stay that weren't typical tourist destinations) and they were fantastic.- The apartment itself vastly exceeded our expectations. We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment, and our space was set up loft style with a 2 floor layout; 2 bedrooms above and 1 on the ground floor. The apartment also had a large kitchen, huge main room, respectable Ikea-styled furnishings, and 2 bathrooms. The apartment was clean, well maintained, and even included a DVD player and sound system.- The location was outstanding. The Chaoyang district is large but contains quite a bit of commercial and nightlife/restaurant activity, so you're in the right area of the city IMO. You're also relatively close to some of the main tourist attractions (Tienaman, Forbidden City, etc.).- Considering that we paid around $150/night for 3 people, I feel this was an extremely good value. I'm a fairly well seasoned international traveler, and rarely have I been more pleasantly surprised than I was in this instance. This was a comfortable, hassle-free stay and I'd book it again in a heartbeat.- One word of advice...taxi drivers do have some difficulty finding the building. Once we'd arrived, it wasn't a problem because we had our bearings, but on your initial trip in from the airport, you should be aware that the entrance to the building is off the street...you need to go past a gate into a little courtyard/roundabout.", "Date": "Nov 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR100866786", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Bagman1234"}, {"Content": "Great Value        Loft's Bedroom", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR727202368", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MouMou"}, {"Content": "Great apartment hotel in Embassy area! We booked 8 nights at the Luxury Serviced Residence (An Ascott property) in Sept 08. I had read one other review on Tripadvisor which was positive but it was difficult to find other reviews.We were pleasantly surprised to say the least. The hotel is located in the embassy area which we think is terrific. When we checked in, the desk person took us to our apartment. We were impressed with this personal service and sheer enthusiasm of the tour. She was obviously proud of her hotel's apartment and services. At check in, we were invited to a free party to celebrate the Moon Festival which is a very important celebration in Chinese life. For the party, all we had to do is show up in the lobby and the hotel took care of transferring us to the hutong cafe and hosting the party. (We had a great time).The apartment is large by any standards. The first floor has a living room/ dining room area, a kitchen, and a half bathroom. The second floor has a large bedroom, desk area, and bathroom with a shower. We met several people who have lived at the Luxury Serviced Residence for years. One couple we met at the party has lived there for three years.For those who choose to cook, there is a full sized refrigerator, stove, microwave, hot water pot, toaster, and dishes to match. The only thing we added was some microwavable dishes. There is a 7/11 across the circle driveway for quick snacks and sundries.There always seems to be someone who speaks English on duty. Each time we set out for the day we would stop by the desk and ask that our destination be written out in Chinese. Taxi drivers, in our experience, do not speak English and most do not read maps. There is a subway stop (Jian Guo men) about 1/4 mile away. It is an easy walk and the subway is extremely easy to use. The Bank of China is on the main cross street nearly around the corner. We would recommend this hotel for anyone who prefers an apartment.", "Date": "Sep 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR747201836", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lynclarke"}, {"Content": "very friendly LSR The first week of May 2008 we stayed at LSR.
