{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Remember it's China's 3-star hotel Remember to take off 1 star from China's standard so it becomes the world hotel standard. I won't say this hotel is like a 2-star motel but it's not really worldwide 3-star, yet. I've stayed here for business for 4 days as my office was near. It's at a good location, with many shops and restaurants around. If you opt for better ones go to the ones across the street near Marriott / Ritz Carlton. There's also a huge upscale shopping center there too selling international brand goods. Within 5 minutes you can walk to subway stations which is a big plus.Inside the room the bed is huge and comfy. But that's all. The carpet looks dull. The lighting is inconvenient (you have to switch off the lights at the entrance). The washroom is... odd - they put a plastic mat at the shower area which I don't know whether it's cleaned daily or never... I don't feel right about it. The Internet is free but extremely slow...Breakfast was mediocre - the choice was limited and the food didn't seem fresh. Juice was filled w/ water. I found a fork w/ egg stain on it. If you don't have breakfast option I suggest you to walk around to find better breakfast option.I don't expect it could do a very good job at this price (I paid around 500 RMB), but I hope it's a clean simple hotel rather than one that wants to look like a 4-star hotel.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR230539099", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mikkol"}, {"Content": "3 star hotel that want to be 4 star I don`t remeber staying in 3 star hotels in Asia, but I know several 4 star hotels that are way below comparing to Winterless hotel. This proprety is very well located, near the main street and shoping malls. I stayed in standard and premium room on the 7th floor. Both rooms are with all amenities you will find in China hotels, robes, slipers, toothbrush, shaving cream, comb etc. Matressis are firm, but on the request you can get sofer matress and pillow. Rooms are clean, and shits are changed every other day.Breakfast choices are Continental and Asian, with not to many things to choose from, but definely nobody will be left hungry. Staff is very well trained, helpful and polite. Each floor has free internet access as well as couple machiens for excersise. Beside 2 restorants, and buty parlor there are not other hotel amenities. Depending on a rate, I can recomend this hotel for a short stay.", "Date": "May 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR556537402", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "skendizc"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d530246-r20189975-Winterless_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "530246", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
