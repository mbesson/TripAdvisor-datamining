We decided to treat ourselves to a suite (since it WAS our honeymoon) and reserved the Chez Zoe Garden Deluxe Suite @ 230EUR/nt. The cab driver had a little trouble finding the place, but we eventually made it & checked in. Our room was in the back building & up a curvy flight of stairs. From Reception, it feels like you are walking with your bag about a mile, but it's really not that far. Much easier when you aren't lugging a suitcase. The room was gorgeous and was actually the size of an apartment. It had a large bedroom with a platform bed and there was also a small single bed in this room. Small window seats and a desk, as well. Really lovely & romantic. The bathroom was the marble hamam shower other people have mentioned. I never entirely figured out what I was supposed to do (other than just take a shower) and the brass faucet over the hamam bowl dripped all the time, meaning I had to scoop out the old, cold water constantly. All of the toiletries are wonderful, however, and I am addicted to the soap (it's this sandlewoody olive soap that makes your skin feel like butter). There was also a front room which had a table & chairs, 2 more single beds/couches & a sink. Plus, there was a small tiled balcony that overlooked the beautiful garden. All rooms have wood floors and are connected by a hallway. The bedroom faced the street and could be a little loud (some fellow was talking on a mobile while revving his moped engine for about 15 minutes), but wasn't too bad. Also, the morning breakfast was wonderful. A good selection of meats, cheese, fruit, yogurt, toast, pastries, etc. and very good coffee. There are afternoon/evening cocktails (for a price) served out of this same area & you can enjoy them in the truly beautiful garden. The garden is one of the best parts. There is a roof deck, as well, but the nights we were there, it was too windy to enjoy for long. Fantastic views, however! I think this hotel is pretty incredible, but the room was far too much, really, for 2 people (unless you were staying a week or something). Especially for 230EUR. However, if you had a family staying there or were traveling with a few friends & you were all sharing the space, it would be a better deal & would make more sense. We really loved ending our trip here, but the other hotel we stayed at in Istanbul was literally a block away and half the price (& very nice). However, I would absolutely return & would recommend this to friends as a unique and beautiful place to enjoy the old city. If you are looking for charm, intimacy & style as opposed to a stark modern hotel, this is certainly the place.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oxfordshire", "Title": "\u201cMarvellous authentic beautiful hotel and staff\u201d", "Author": "arderne", "ReviewID": "UR128283615", "Content": "My husband, my daughter, grandaughter and myself stayed here for 3 nights from 19th April for a special 'mini-break'. We arrived late at night and were shown to our room which was absolutely lovely with a hammam style bathroom - table and chairs outside - double bedroom - sort of sitting room with two single beds on stone plinths. It was absolutely perfect - we were all very impressed and happy. The staff were terrific. I would recommend this hotel to anyone - for a party of four - i.e. a couple and two children - I would recommend the Courtyard suite - you could also go out of the courtyard suite straight on to the road if you wished (there were locking doors to which we were given a kay). It really was a wonderful experience, delicious, fresh homemade breakfast etc. etc. We actualy felt dreadful because we were offloaded from our BA flight due to a birdstrike and were told by BA to find our own hotels, meals etc. because there were no hotels available. Everyone at the airport was paniccing. I rang the Empress Zoe and they very kindly offered us a room for three people and to make a bed on the floor. Unfortunately we then found out that my daughter had to work the next day and needed a fast internet connection and her own space etc. etc. and were offered a hotel with 2 rooms a business centre etc. Sadly we, very guiltily, therefore had to suddenly cancel the room (only about ten minutes after booking luckily) and the hotel were extremely kind but I felt very bad about this. Of course, whilst the next hotel offered two rooms and very fast internet it was no where near as wonderful as the Empress Zoe - being a somewhat soulless chain hotel. The staff at Empress Zoe were all terrific and very kind - they responded to all our requests positively and very quickly. The kind of service you would expect from a six star hotel!! Incidentally, there is a perfectly fine internet connection at the Empress Zoe, particularly if you work in the bar or in the lobby but it is a little bit intermittent in the Courtyard Suite. Of course we did not need it particularly on our holiday but due to the cancellation my daughter needed to work throughout most of the day whilst awaiting the flight. On another note, I feel extremely guilty too as, although I gave a small tip on the way in I did not tip the staff on the way out due to the rush - I will recitfy this on my return - if we are allowed back!! All in all I could not possibly recommend a hotel more. Go to the Empress Zoe - it will make your trip to Istanbul perfect and give you the flavour of Istanbul.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cI hope it never changes....\u201d", "Author": "sedoyle", "ReviewID": "UR128189681", "Content": "i first stayed at the Empress Zoe in 2009 with my daughter for a rainy week in January and i brought my husband back in 2012 for his first trip to Istanbul.

Take the warning about stairs seriously, but if you don't mind spiral staircases, it's a dream place with Hamman style bathrooms, riotous colors and delicious lingering breakfasts. We left our luggage for three days while we went to Eastern Turkey and the gracious hostess smiled and kept it safe. Strong shouldered young men carried our bags without a murmer.

On the website, we thought it looked interesting and good for our stay, when we got there, we were immeditely proved wrong, it was much better than that. After the airline forgot our luggage in Frankfurt, we were in a particularly bad mood; but when we got to the hotel that changed. They sent a van just for us to the airport and a friendly man got all our luggage for us. We drove throught the streets until we got to sultanahmet, the old quarter. We walked into the charming lobby with a comfortable sitting area and beautiful art. We were then proceeding to lug our luggage up the little spiral staircase that led up into the hotel, but one of the staff took all four of our bags without even second thought. After we dropped the bags off in our room ( he hadn't even broken a sweat) we got a full tour of the empress Zoe. We were in the deluxe garden suite, on the second level. There were three buildings, the main house, the garden suite building, and a small one with three more modern Mediterranean rooms. There was also an ancient Turkish Hamam (bathhouse) from the ottoman era, adding quite a charm to the whole complex. The garden was astoundingly beautiful, with flowers, trees, herbs, tables, and an assortment of friendly cats. The breakfast, despite what some of the other reviews said, was delicious; and it had a variety of friendly staff to acompany it. There are two decks, one with an amazing view of the sea of mamara, the other with a view over the sea all the way to the galata district, and a view of the haghia sofya. The garden was also a quiet and cool retreat from the busy streets of Istanbul. Our room was amazing, it had a giant marble walk in shower, a room in the back with a double, and two Turkish day beds. The room in the front looked out onto the garden, also with its own deck. It had a kitchenette and a glass table, and another three turkish daybeds ( which also offer a comfortable place to sleep) another enjoyable aspect was the cats, jasper, the patriarch of them all was a regular frequent of our deck, and a kitten, who the toddler daughter of a British family refers to as the \"bad kitty\". Also, they have the best lemonade in the world at the bar, fresh squeezed, set a new standard for lemonade fit for the gods. It's only available at certain times, but when it is, don't pass it up. Another thing that charmed us about this hotel is how it has it's own personality, none of that run of the mill everyday hotal stuff. Just to add more sunshine to our stay, it was only a dive minute walk from topkapi palace, the haghia sofya, the blue mosque, the basilica cistern, and a fifteen minute walk from the grand bazaar. Also, a little down the street is a restraunt that has a big whole in the wall that leads down to an ancient byzantine roman palace. Also, the staff were the friendliest ever. Another note, please vist Artemis, a little rug and nick nak shop built in to the building. It's run by a man named Joseph and his brother, and they are very friendly.

The hotel is a one-off small hotel of a completely different style than any other you are likely to see. It has a warm, personal touch you will not find elsewhere. Every room we managed to view had a decent amount of room, an issue in Istanbul. The staff were welcoming, efficient, knowledgeable and very friendly. Their English was impeccable and we enjoyed many a discussion on a variety of topics, from history to food to fashion and politics.. The breakfast comprised basic fresh produce e.g. cheeses, quality tomatoes, fresh bread and delicious home made walnut cake, with great coffee (and tea). My partner who has no sweet tooth, often had two slices of cake! The hotel is positioned at the top of a cobbled street 5 minutes walk from the Hippodrome between the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, so you don't have to travel far to immerse yourself in the history and architecture of this fantastic city. You are effectively at the end of a street of restaurants and small hotels - this is Sultanhamet remember. Staff can advise recommendations if you ask. You can avoid the repetitive entreaties to enter a bar/restaurant etc if you turn left out of reception and left again at the top of the hill. The hotel consists of a main building over four floors and several outbuildings surrounding a covered, walled garden. The main building has no lift so if you are on the 3rd or 4th floors you will have to negotiate a very tight spiral staircase, then further marble stairs. The room views are well worth it. There are some rooms with street access. Be sure to ask before you book, what is available. Invariably costs are higher for the larger more accessible rooms. The garden was a peaceful haven, that I can imagine would be a cool respite from summer heat, it was lovely even in early December when we travelled. There are a few very friendly family cats that add to the homely feel of the place. Please recognise that Zoe is a very individual hotel at the other end of the spectrum from the standard chain hotels that litter most cities. If you want the comfort and character of a very unique place I strongly recommend you stay here. You are only a few minutes walk from Sultanhamet tram stop so access to the city (and Attaturk airport) is easy and cheap by public transport. As this is Sultanhamet you're in a great place for architecture but it will be touristy with all that that means - crowds at weekends, slightly pushy restauranteurs, noisy traffic but get away down back alleys and across the Bosphorus to Asia you are in a different world. Istanbul is a clean, vibrant megalopolis that you really need to visit. Do so and enhance your holiday by staying at the Empress Zoe.

(The view as the sun rose over the water and the morning call to prayer began was, for me, a spiritual experience! And, I'm not Muslim!) If you go, please check out the delightful garden area --an oasis in itself. A healthy, delicious, Turkish breakfast of olives, cheeses, fresh breads, fruit (grapes, pomegranate seeds), jams, tomatoes, cucumbers, hard boiled eggs, juice, tea and coffee was served each day. The smell of coffee wafted up to my room each morning! What a way to start the day! After a full day of walking around the city and seeing the sites, one can expect to come \"home\" to a bar that is open from 5-11 (staffed by the very profession, personable Suleman) where you can have wine, beer, (or something stronger) while listening to a nice selection of quiet, relaxing jazz music. (Excellent sound system!). Though temps were a bit chilly when I was there having an afternoon evening cocktail or glass of wine in the garden would be nice. Located in Sultanahmet this hotel is conveniently located near the Blue Mosque, the Haga Sophia, the Grand Bazaar (and other sites), public transportation and the ATMS! The only down side is that you have to pass by many interesting and delightful shops selling the incredibly beautiful textiles (think rugs!) and jewelry on your way to get to those places I had the most expensive lunch one day! I went out for lentil soup (delicious all over the city) and came back with a rug and a pair of earrings! I can't wait to return to the enchanting Istanbul and will stay at the Zoe again if there's any room at the inn.

We stayed in the newer section in the Garden Suite and later in the Deluxe Garden Suite when it became available. These were quite spacious, with comfortable beds. Although there is no elevator in this hotel, the Garden Suite was actually quite easy to access through the side-door of the hotel which is higher in elevation than the front door, resulting in only one flight of stairs to climb (the Deluxe Suite is on a higher floor and does require more climbing). Breakfast was in the garden, a lovely oasis. The house cats are usually to be found sunning themselves on chairs/benches in the garden. The breakfast is quite adequate. However the selection did not change in the week that we stayed at Empress Zoe and I did find myself wanting more variety. WiFi is available in the garden and lobby but can be a bit iffy. The early morning call to prayer woke me up the first night and seemed to go on for a long time. For whatever reason, this seemed shorter successive nights but maybe I just got used to it! When we closed the bedroom door, the sound was much quieter so I had no trouble sleeping for the rest of the walk. In fact, I quite liked hearing it - added to the ambience. The staff was generally pretty friendly and helpful but not outstandingly so. Certainly they were very responsive to any requests and did help book some things for us. The location is very convenient, close to Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sofya. You do have to walk about 5-10 minutes (depending on your pace) to get to the Sultanahmet tram station or alternatively to the Gulhane tram station but it's not a bad walk. Using the tram, you can pretty much get anywhere easily. The street the hotel faces is full of restaurants. It's hard to walk down the street without waiters pestering you to come into their restaurant. Similarly, you can't avoid the salesmen trying to get you into their stores. However, just walk briskly and it's fine. From our room, you could hear very little noise from the street other than on our first night (a Friday), but it quieted down by 11pm. We were told that staying in the New City would be better because of superior restaurants and an exciting nightlife but we preferred staying here - the majority of sights was within walking distance and we could otherwise easily access transportation to get us elsewhere. This hotel was ideal for all of this.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cunderstated excellence\u201d", "Author": "Greg C", "ReviewID": "UR119686308", "Content": "Almost leaning against the wals of Topkapi, the Empress Zoe is perfectly placed for the tourist seeking the old fascinations of Istanbul.

Suleyman is the man to ask for real advice. He's been there for 10 years and does not do BS, Indeed the whole EMZOE does not do BS. Everything is straight and above board. There is an excellent restaurant opposite called KOSK which is superb and has great staff and food, and there is a herbal tea shop facing which has great non alchoholic drinks. The area the EMZOE is based in, is Sultanahmet which is historic in the extreme. Basically in conclusion, if you want a generic room, then stay at the IBIS on kennedy cadessi.

There is a beautiful garden that would be wonderful to use in warmer weather, a cute breakfast room that doubles as a bar at night and is a great place to cozy up to a fire with a glass of wine and your laptop.

The hotel bar charges exactly what bars in the neighborhood do for drinks, unlike most hotels which charge double what you'd pay elsewhere.

We had arranged a car to pick us up from the airport which went very smoothly. The hotel itself is very unique. It is decorated using local materials in Ottoman style which is part of the charm of the place. Breakfast is served in a lounge area or in a garden which is like a lush oasis in the hot city (during our stay we only ate outside once when it was raining, other days we were fortunate enough to use the garden). The breakfast was basic (tomatoes, cucumber, yoghurt, muesli, orange juice, tea, coffee, grapes, melons, bread, olives, jams..) but everything was fresh and delicious. The lounge area also has a small bar that serves drinks from 5pm to 11pm. We stayed in a standard double room as well as the famous Penthouse Suite. Our double room was small but adequate and really beautiful. It looked on to Akbiyik Caddesi which is full of restaurants. However, noise wasn't an issue for us, I can't remember waking up to the sounds of people. The room had a small fridge (perfect for storing my insulins and snacks) and a very effective AC. The bathroom was very small but it served its purpose. The Penthouse Suite was drop-dead gorgeous. It was roomy, had a slightly more hi-tech AC and a bigger fridge. It also had a small terrace which was adjoined to the bigger roof top terrace. This caused some problems because some of the other guests were peering to our room from the roof top. But that's the guests' fault, not the hotel's. The hamam-styled bathroom was spacious and made showering feel like a special moment, if you can say such a thing! Overall, the Penthouse Suite was very romantic and perfect for our stay because this summer we had our 9th \"anniversary\". I already hinted to my boyfriend that I wouldn't be sorry to have our honeymoon in a place like that! The staff of Empress Zoe only make this place even more special. Everyone was helpful and friendly and we really couldn't thank them enough. The hotel has a few cats that are very friendly and non-aggressive. One of them became our friend and we were delighted when she came to say goodbye to us on the terrace on the last morning. The stairs will pose a problem for people with severe mobility issues.

When there's such variation in the style of rooms, it's important to fully disclosure any potential issues with a guest room on check-in, but for some reason Turkish culture seems to avoid confrontation in this sort of situation (quite different from the traders at the Grand Bazaar.) Fortunately, as a single guy travelling with a bunch of couples, I wasn't in the room much and was able to hang out with other friends, but be warned there is a huge variation in the quality of rooms at this hotel. Goes with the territory as it's very much a quirky boutique hotel, but avoid, at all costs, the rooms at the top of the first set of spiral stairs which are: tiny, loud (basically on a loud cobblestone street corner), have insufficient blinds to cut out the street lights at night (one of which shines directly into your face), and a tiny bathroom and shower impossible for the average man to bathe properly.

If you're a nighttime person, or someone on a second or third trip to the city, then you have probably seen the sights around here, and could consider staying in Beyoglu for restaurants and bars or somewhere nice along the Bosphorus for a change.", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cHistory at your feet!\u201d", "Author": "lamerazure", "ReviewID": "UR23445728", "Content": "Empress Zoe is a nice property, ideally situated in the middle of the Sultanhamet district.

We agree with many of the positives in other reviews: great breakfasts (never found simit as good anywhere else in Turkey), loved the cats and the gardens, views, etc. The place is certainly not designed for anyone who has trouble climbing stairs and one of our party did...we had not only the much discussed iron spiral staircase but three other flights of stairs to get to our room. But the location is fabulous and though not cheap, the value is good. So overall we had a good experience. But there are some things that need to be addressed by management. For the first 5 nights we stayed in the Maisonette and we echo the things said by others about the views, etc. It was wonderful to sit on the terrace and watch the sun go down over the Sea of Marmara! Problems: We happened to be there during ANZAC week when the street (which has youth hostels on it) was overflowing with Aussies and Kiwis...celebrating until all hours (5AM?!) and making an unholy racket. Not the EZ's fault, but very off-putting all the same. Don't come during that period!! The other issues include a staff that was generall helpful but seemed unaware of certain tourist facts. For example, we told them we were leaving to get a cab for the Dolmabache palace on Thursday AM. They got us a cab, waved us away, and we found that the palace is closed on Thursdays. Wouldn't you think the folks at EZ would know that since it is a major attraction?? Second: We asked them to get us a cab to another major site (Suleiman Mosque) and when we got there we found it was closed for repairs and had been for weeks. Third: Same story with the Pera Palace hotel...cab ride only to find out it was closed for renovations and had been for some time. The staff should have known these things and been able to advise us before we set off for costly rides in the horrendous Istanbul traffic. For our last two nights we had to move to a double and a single. When one of our party complained about the ants coming in the windows on to her bed (and on to her!) she was told that it was unavoidable because of the ivy and that they would send up some powder ant poison.

However, I would guess the same would hold true wherever you stay in Sultanahmet and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, for a minute, regret staying here as opposed to Taksim. The hotel is within minutes of all the top tourist sites which meant I could go back to the hotel easily in the middle of the day for a rest/get an umbrella/get an extra sweater/or drop off my many purchases! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also within a few minutes of a tram stop (which gives you easy access to the Grand Bazaar/Spice Bazaar/Taksim). The hotel couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been better positioned. Also, the area felt really safe even when I walked back to the hotel at night by myself. They serve up a really nice/varied breakfast which means you can actually eat a healthy breakfast (fresh fruit/cereal. Their oranges were really sweet and especially nice.) But they have something for everyone, including freshly baked goods, boiled eggs//tomatoes/feta cheese/cucumbers. For those of you who are addicted to the internet like me, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a computer terminal for guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 use there but they do have free wi-fi in the bar/breakfast area. Lastly, I found the staff to be very helpful/efficient. I always figure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good sign when you e-mail a hotel and they respond to you within hours as opposed to days, which was always my experience with the Empress Zoe. And that high level of service was maintained by the staff throughout my entire stay. One last thing, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a big shopper like me, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss out on the Arasta Bazaar, located only a few minutes away from the hotel (adjacent to the Blue Mosque). Although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot smaller than the Grand Bazaar, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also much less hectic, and unlike the Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar, is open on Sundays.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a short break\u201d", "Author": "fly2steve", "ReviewID": "UR13697352", "Content": "We stayed at the Empress Zoe for 3 nights, the rooms are traditionally decorated and the bed was very comfortable the only bad point about the room is that the shower is very small.

We had an amazing time, due, in part, to the lovely hotel with fabulous staff where we chose to stay: the Empress Zoe (referred to below as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EZ\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). We booked the EZ directly over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphone (with email confirmation) after speaking with the EZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner, Ann, who assisted us in choosing the right room. We chose the Penthouse Suite, and paid the winter rate (posted on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website) of EU140 per night (the EZ gave us a 10 percent discount off the entire bill b/c we paid in cash). LOCATION: The EZ is located in Sultanahmet, which is the old neighborhood of Istanbul where most of the major sites are concentrated: the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, Topkapi Palace, Archaeology Museum, to name only a few. The EZ is only a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk to all of the aforementioned places. This neighborhood is also only a 10-minute walk to the Bazaar District and a 20-minute walk to Eminonu, where you catch the ferries for Bosphorus tours and to go all over Istanbul. There is a bodega right across the street from the EZ which sells groceries and alcohol. There is also a laundromat about 30 meters from the EZ, which washed and folded our laundry for only 4YTL per kilo (cheap) within a matter of a few hours. Moreover, the neighborhood is extremely safe (as we found most of the city to be) to walk at all hours. The streets are full of activity until late, and the presence of police officers (several of whom we asked for directions and were actually really helpful) is impressive. TRANSPORT TO THE EZ: We opted to choose the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transport service from Ataturk Int\u00e2\u20ac\u2122l Airport, which costs EU26, and which was added to our bill. A really nice kid was waiting for us when we left customs with our name on a sign. A new, clean van transported us to the EZ. The driver was another really nice guy who bent over backwards to speak English to us and enthusiastically tell us about his city. Anyway, the EU26 is a good deal, since our taxi ride back to the airport at the end of the trip was around YTL35 (with no traffic\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwould have been a LOT more at peak times). OVERVIEW OF THE EZ: The EZ is an Ottoman Hotel (as described in the travel guides) comprised of several old buildings connected by a common garden, which is beautiful. In short, the EZ is elegant yet cozy, and impeccably clean. There are only approx. 20 rooms. Certainly the nicest thing about a hotel this size is the fact that staff get to know you quickly and the service is very personal. For example, when returning to the EZ, the people who staffed the front desk knew us and chatted us up and asked us if we had a nice day, etc., as did the bartender. Finally, as the Tripadvisor reviews repeat, there is indeed no elevator. However, there is no great labyrinth of stairs, so this was not an issue for us. The hotel staff took all of our bags to our room (and later brought them down), so we never had to carry anything up/downstairs. THE ROOM: We stayed in Room 401, the Penthouse Suite. The room is approx. 400 square feet (my visual estimate), which is accessed from private stairs on the third floor. There is a living room with sofa, small TV (lots of Turkish channels, plus CNN and BBC), a desk with several chairs, and a bar with good-size refrigerator (and two big empty cabinets next to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfridge). The bedroom is a small separate area (not much bigger than the double bed) separated from the living room by a little curtain, and which contains a spacious closet with a mini safe. The entire suite (including bedroom) is surrounded by windows with nice views of the sea and the neighborhood. There is a separate day-bed in the living room, which is very comfortable and upon which I took a few afternoon siestas. The window curtains can completely black-out the room if you want to sleep late. A large bottle of water was in the room upon check-in, and we were able to stock up later at the bodega across the street. The bathroom was great! As the photos we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re posting show, the shower is a little hamam surrounded on three sides with a sitting area, with both a showerhead (great water pressure\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe miss it) and a cistern. So you can take a shower and/or sit and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bathe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and pour water over yourself with the silver bowl. Two big cabinets are under the sink and will hold a ton of toiletries. The hotel also provides olive-oil soap (we loaded up on this stuff at the airport) and shampoo. New towels (including 4 bathtowels) were provided every day. The bathroom also has a heated rack, in case you need to dry anything. A door from the room leads to a cute private porch with a table and chairs, which has a partial view of the Blue Mosque at night. Stairs from the porch lead up to a rooftop sitting area, with several tables and breathtaking views of the sea, Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, and the neighborhood. This area is shared by a few rooms, and we met some nice people up there. INTERNET: There is WIFI located in the breakfast area/bar downstairs, which works great. We were actually able to catch a weak signal in our room, so we could surf the web (albeit slowly). BREAKFAST: We enjoyed the EZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast (included in the rate) most each morning. The breakfast is tasty (and pretty healthy) and includes coffee, tea, juice, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, yoghurt, cereal, and various breads. STAFF: Special thanks to the EZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner, Ann, and her associates, Leyla and Hayati, all of whom were so professional and kind to us. And props to the bartender, whose name I regrettably forgot, who was really cool and greeted us each night with a big smile. Thanks also to the older gentleman who had to schlep our heavy bags downstairs on a Sunday at 4:45 am (we had an early flight!), and did so with a smile on his face, and wished us a good trip. This is Service. Ann recommended a great local (read: not tourist prices) kebab place called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buhara Ocakbasi\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is a 10 minute walk, and where we ended up eating twice. Another fabulous restaurant which is only a few doors down from the EZ is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Albura.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NOISE ISSUES OR LACK THEREOF: Reading the other reviews below, I was prepared to be located next to a hotel construction site. We did not have any issues with noise (other than the call to prayer, which is very cool when you first hear it and we got used to it and were able to sleep through it after a while). WE LOVE CATS: First of all, we were blown away at how many cats live on the street in Istanbul. Some of the kittens will come right up to you if you call them and start nuzzling you. There are three male cats who live at EZ. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m talking about them because we miss them already, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not a cat fan, you can end the review here. Two are yellow cats (one is 15 years old, we were told, and the other is 2), and another is a black cat who we only saw a few times. The two yellow cats would sleep next to each other every night in the breakfast area, and we pet them every night when we returned. The old one will crawl right into your lap and sleep there if you want him to. The little guy, whom we called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pasha\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Ann told us his name\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI forgot it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsorry), would be sitting on our porch every morning when we woke up. So after a few days, the first thing we did was check to see if Pasha was there. So I guess the reason why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m boring you with this cat story is because, as cat lovers, we sort of were able to temporarily \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adopt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd these cats during our stay at the EZ, and their presence made us happy, so there you go.

We were slightly concerned by some of the other posts regarding the construction of the Four Seasons Hotel behind the Zoe, but when we were there in the middle of August the works had stopped however the view from the bedroom window of our suite did ressemble a car park, but how long do you spend looking out of that window when the view from the other side is a wonderful one of the Bosphorus?! The first thing that worried me was the open spiral staircase that leads from the reception up to the courtyard and the rooms beyond, however, if you take your shoes off its much easier to negociate - and a very nice man lugged our incredibly heavy cases up to the suite! The suite itself was at the rear of the hotel, across a small gravelled courtyard and up a small outside staircase to the first floor. It consisted of a lounge area with sofas, a fridge with kettle etc, an amazing bathroom with marble walls, floor and open shower and a lovely bedroom with large comfortable bed and dressing table area. The bathroom had a nice mural on the wall and the bedstead was hand painted with stars and moons. The outside terrace was great for evening drinks watching the sun go down on the river.

The hotel is situated on a very touristy street which means there are bars and restaurants close by, but that comes with the hassle from tourist restaurant touts. Easily enough dealt with, but it can become wearing! Our room faced the street and at night it was noisy, despite being early in the season: in the summer I can imagine that the noise from the lively hostel almost opposite would be intrusive. In addition to the street noise, people coming into the hotel late, loud plumbing and the people next door talking could be clearly heard. I didn't expect to need earplugs. To be fair, the hotel made it very clear to me that the room overlooked the street, and I can imagine that the rooms overlooking the garden would be more peaceful. On the plus side, the room was very clean and the decor was interesting and unusual: the size was okay. The bathroom was very small, but it was a good shower and the toiletries provided can't be beat! I found the reception and cleaning staff efficient, helpful and friendly. The same could not be said for the barman who was surly, and often simply not to be found during opening hours. Breakfast was excellent. The garden is beautiful, and a major attraction, especially in the warmer weather, with the cats adding a homely touch! The views from the roof terrace were spectacular. So - choose your room carefully.

The one thing was the shower was really small, and the curtain would stick to your body when you took a shower which was a bit annoying, but the rest of the bathroom was roomy enough and fine.

The hotel itself is very charming. Decorated in Byzantine style and literaly next to an old Turkish bath, Empress Zoe blends the historical to the contemporary in its decor. The less expensive rooms are a little snug and one musn't mind staying in a hotel with many stairs (it's a historical building after all), but on a whole this hotel is fabulous. You can enjoy breakfast in a beautiful garden with fountains, artefacts and the occasional stray cat that makes a visit. I would highly recommend Empress Zoe.", "Date": "September 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cthe garden and roof terrace are lovely\u201d", "Author": "andykeen", "ReviewID": "UR5604896", "Content": "The price for this hotel is reasonable for its location, and the great feel of the place.

The interior is perhaps not quite the stunning mosiac of ethnic and urban chic that the website and a number of local hotel guides suggest . However, it does seem to depend whether you are in the new or the old house of the hotel. We were in the new house and the main drawback was the labyrinthian interior with no lift (yes, the spiral staircase is an issue if you have a) big cases b) any kind of functional impairement!) That said, the rooms there were well decorated, comfortable & the bathrooms suitably Turkish in their feel. Breakfast was average in terms of its quality - though the setting for breakfast in the small garden courtyard is very attractive. The real reason to stay here is the location - right next to the Blue Mosque and the Aya Sofia, the Bosphorous is a 10 minute walk and the Grand Bazzar about the same. Cabs in Istanbul are a great low cost option but be warned, the traffic in this city makes most western downtown areas look like a ghost town. Take care using cabs between 9am and 7pm if you are in a hurry!! Overall the Empress Zoe offers good value for money and a great location, certainly well worth considering for a stay in Istanbul.", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cdisappointing\u201d", "Author": "lmmNewYorkCity", "ReviewID": "UR5448634", "Content": "We just returned from a lovely visit to Istanbul. I had booked four nights in the penthouse suite after reading the reviews on this website and other guidebooks. I wanted to stay in a hotel that was charming, but reasonably priced.

There are two day beds in the main room and a table. But the room was dumpy, worn and lacked charm. (Our room had ants.) The terrace was the nicest part of the penthouse. I told the hotel clerk that I did not like the room and I wanted to find another hotel to stay at. They told me that they would charge for 1 night (160 Euros) if I left since I didn't give them 24 hours notice.

The staff was very accommodating in general (although the owner got cranky when we decided to cancel the middle part of our reservation in order to tour the countryside, and a stack of postcards I left at the front desk apparently (who knows?) was never mailed). That's back in March 2001, so things may have changed, but one thing that's probably not changed, and that's the size of the rooms. We (1 couple + 1 friend) stayed in some of the regular rooms when we first arrived in Istanbul (sorry, I can't remember more specifics about the type of room) and found our rooms a bit small for the price. When we enquired about larger rooms, we were told that we already had some of the largest rooms in our categories--our friend was told that he actually had a small double for the price of a single! BUT....when we returned to Istanbul, after our tour of other areas, we had spent less money than we had expected, so we decided stay in the penthouse for our last two nights in Turkey. And THAT was wonderful beyond words and seemed a bargain at the price. The penthouse's private rooftop terrace with views of Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Sea of Marmara etc. is one of the most delightful spots on earth, and I don't feel I'm exaggerating. If we ever return to Istanbul we will budget to stay in the penthouse the entire time--I don't care if we have to eat pretzels every meal to pay for it. (And because the penthouse has some kitchenette facilities, we really can save money on meals by keeping some food in our room). I suggest you do the same--you won't regret it. I dug up a photo, which I'll try to post, and noticed some peeling paint in the background, but I was too busy looking at the incredible views to notice at the time.

Breakfast next morning did nothing to improve my impression of this hotel , the man behind the counter looked like someone who had walked in off the street and had been taught to say tea and coffee and for the most part concentrated on cutting pieces of bread which in the end looked like scraps on a plate . at the same time chatting mainly to another employee who was there helping herself to breakfast leaving most guests to help themselves. The garden where breakfast is taken is very pleasant but again I was slightly irritated by workmen passing in and out through a hole in the the wall gaining access to some building work on the other side .
