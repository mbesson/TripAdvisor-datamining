The rooms are not just small, they are tiny! So are the bathrooms! One cannot understand it without experiencing it, really. The bed (advertised as a double) is 120 cm wide, meaning it's what elsewhere is called large single bed. And uncomfortable. Nothing in the room apart from a bed, a TV and two hangers. Not even a bedside table, nor a shelf, so we ended up putting our mobile phones and everything on the floor. And I don't think a small shelf would be considered a frill or a major capital expenditure, as they sell them in IKEA for 4 euros! The rooms are so tiny that I really suggest claustrophobics to stay away from here. And I mean, we were out all day, but that half an hour in the morning before leaving or in the night before falling asleep is the most you can stand inside! And I thanked the sense of perspective in booking a room with a window!! Corridors are ridiculously narrow (barely a person could pass through), there is no lift, stairs are small and, in general, you feel miserable inside. A few good points (still not worthy the downsides) are the staff, generally nice and courteous; the soap dispenser in the bathroom (soap is free!! Exciting for being an Easyjet hotel, isn't it??), so are the plug adapter (we were scared to be charged, but it appears they collect those forgotten by visitors and make them available for free to the next ones, which is at least honest) and that it was decently clean. The baggage deposit also is fine. Although they charge you for it (hey, it's a frill to stroll around London without your trolley on the go!), it is much cheaper than leaving it at St Pancras deposit, if you have to take a Eurostar.

There is no lift so if you have heavy luggage I suggest asking for a lower ground floor room because its quite a trek to the 3rd floor without bags. The main road is quite noisy in the mornings so if you're a light sleeper as for a room on the other side. All in all, a good hotel for the price.

We got into the hotel at 11 p.m., had a full day Sunday for touring London, and then left at 7 a.m. on Monday for the airport. This hotel worked for us as a good base. If we were to be staying in London to enjoy a few days, we would not have stayed here. However, we wanted to see the city, not the room. We were on the second floor, perhaps room 201 or 206, can't remember which number. There is no elevator and carrying luggage up or down can be tricky, but it only lasts for a few minutes. I had requested a room at the end of the hall, unfortunately we got the one at the end of the hall next to that exit door. This room location allowed for some noise from the hall as people went in and out of the hallway next to our door. The floor also squeked a bit outside our door. Walking into the room, there is a bathroom to the right with 1/2-size sink, toilet and shower. A full-length mirror is on the wall to the left when you come into the room. Straight ahead is the window. The window over-looked Norfolk Place, we were lucky to have this with our room being on the front of the building. We had a little bit of street noise as we left the window open to allow some cool, fresh air in. The noise was not that bad and helped to cover-up any noise we heard from within the hotel. A flat-screen tv up on the wall (no remote control, I believe that is extra money), lights within the ceiling and the full-size bed to the right. So you know, there are no tables, no chairs, no luggage stand, no closet and no artwork. It is a room with nothing except your bed and tv. We kept our luggage in the shower when we weren't using it, or on the closed toilet seat. In case of bed-bugs (which I saw no evidence of), we wanted to keep our luggage away from any linens or the bedroom. I am glad the room appeared to be clean. Although the bathroom was small, it provided all that we needed to get ourselves clean. Bare bones, clean, cheap and good place to stay for short stays in which your main priority is to explore the city and not spend time in your room.

I am a fan of the low-cost model and I feel I understand what the easy brand has to offer. But this time I was disappointed. Let's start with the negatives. We booked a small room with a window. I can't really complain about the smallness of it, because it's written there clearly in the room description, but I will point out that the room is the same size as the double bed within it, with a narrow entrance space. There was simply not enough elbow room for two people to manoeuvre (one person, however, probably could have managed fine). There was also nowhere, not even any floorspace, for me to put my bag, so I had to put it on top of the toilet seat overnight. Let this be a warning to those of you travelling with suitcases! Like I said, I can live with that, because we booked a small room. The window, however, is my main source of contention. We paid extra for a room with a window, because a window serves two purposes: to see outside, and to get some fresh air into the room. The window we had in our room was a window by name only; it overlooked an internal service corridor. Our view was of a hoover and fluorescent strip lighting. Opening the window did not let in fresh air, because it opened into another internal room. Having paid EXTRA for a window, I felt somewhat ripped off. One more negative before I get to the positives. While the room was not poorly maintained, it wasn't particularly clean (which is quite an achievement, considering that there's hardly anything in there to clean). One of the first things we noticed was that the previous guest had left something in the easyToilet, which was not a welcoming sight. What's more, the toilet seat was up, leaving it on display for everyone to see. It must have taken a lot of complacency on behalf of easyHousekeeping to ignore that one. There are some positive aspects to this hotel, however. The location is the obvious one. Less than five minutes walk to Paddington, down a quieter side street so that if those mythical windows do actually exist, they shouldn't let in too much traffic noise (you're on your own with the train noise though; even in our underground bunker of a room we could hear the trains, although they stopped at about 1am). Our room actually had very efficient air conditioning which we could control ourselves, which was something of a lifesaver! The staff were very friendly and polite, and checking in and out was quick and indeed easy. So would I stay at this hotel again? Actually yes I would, with a set of conditions. Firstly, that I needed to be at Paddington (I wouldn't use this hotel as a general base for London). Secondly. that I only needed to stay for one night. Finally, I would forgo paying extra for a window, and instead pay slightly more and go for their bigger room option (which is no doubt not big, but may be more suitable for two people). If you can get a room for \u00c2\u00a330 or even \u00c2\u00a340 and don't want any pay-for extras (TV, extra towels, extra pillows, housekeeping) then this hotel might be worth it for a one-night stop. We paid \u00c2\u00a359 for our room, and if we'd wanted to use the TV it would have been another \u00c2\u00a35, so really we probably could have found something better for the price, with TV included. Plus, check in is at 3pm and check out at 10am, so you don't even get to use the TV for the 24 hours that you paid for! If you're used to budget accommodation or hostels, you'll probably be okay here.

The \"no frills\" atmosphere that easyHotel uses to distinguish itself from its competition has rapdily become the very reason why I now despise them. I originally booked 7 nights here for December 2010. This booking was just something to hold me over until I found better, cheaper accomodations elsewhere. \"Insurance\", if you will. I did not consult their refund policy first. BIG MISTAKE. Their refund policy is hard to find on their website and is confusing at first glance, espcially for those that are not accustomed to booking hotels online. It states that if you want a refund, your account (with the HOTEL) will be credited and if you do not use your credit within a year, you lose it. This is not the norm within the industry and I found this unbelievably dissapointing, as I was now out $500! When I eventually found cheaper accomodation, I went back to get my refund only to discover that I had been duped, partly by my own stupiditiy. I figure since I had only made the reservation less than 48 hours ago, it might not be a big deal to get a refund onto my credit card. After calling multiple times, multiple branches, speaking to managers, emailing mangers' mangers, I received no response and realize that my $500 was gone. They do not list any phone numbers on their website for this reason, I presume (but their phone number does appear on the email confirmation if you need to contact them directly). To add insult to injury, they even charge a 10 pound cancellation fee on top of everything. And they try to charge you a bogus early checkin fee if you're there even an hour earlier than the certified 3pm checkin time. So I was stuck staying at this horrible hotel, which isn't even all that great for the price you pay! The location is good but the bathrooms are not cleaned properly; there was a curly brown hair stuck to my sink when I checked in. Staff are well meaning but useless, based on my above issue.

Rooms do not get cleaned during your stay and housekeeping costs extra. Everything costs extra. What's next? An hourly rate for electricity? Oxygen? All of this just shows me how easyHotel is only concerned about \"no frills\" and being complete cheapskates. I was basically robbed of $500!

No more than for two or three nights, but it's cheap, well located, clean and reception staff are courteous and even recognise me (I've been there on close to 20 short-stays by now) Beds are good, but they do fill most of the room. Always enough hot water for the long morning shower, but slightly anoying there's no place for toiletries in bathroom.

A friend booked it for us and warned us it was basic but basic is too flattering a word. He had a windowless \"dungeon\" in the basement while we had a double overlooking the busy road outside. There was scaffolding at the window which made the room even darker and more depressing. It also meant that that the window had to be kept closed when the builders were working. We are pensioners, and perhaps because of this, the receptionist kindly helped us to carry our cases up the narrow, steep staircase. The room was the smallest we had ever been in. We could not stand up together, there was not even a shelf for watch/ clock etc and only two hooks. I got the wall side of the bed which meant that going to the loo in night entailed crawling off the end of the bed into the foot of space full of cases and bags. The bathroom was tiny and the water from the shower flooded into the bedroom. When you consider how long architects have to study for their qualifications, it beggars belief that one of them designed this place with no regard for comfort or function, never mind aesthetics! Clearly making money is the name of the game here. I dread to think what would happen if there were a fire in those confined spaces. We could not wait to get out. The thought of spending more than one night there was grim.

Yes, they warn you that the rooms are small. I had a standard room with window, and that was small enough. A small room with no window must be claustrophobic. Still, it was fine for what I needed. There was a bed, a toilet, a washbasin and a (very good) shower with soap provided. There were pillows, a duvet and towels. And that was it. The one major thing that is missing is anywhere to put anything. There are no shelves whatsoever. This means nothing at the bedside to put things like glasses, watches or alarm clock on. The bed really could have been moved a few inches down to allow a ledge at the head. Similarly, nowhere to put anything in the very cramped bathroom. And nowhere to hang clothes. You really are living out of your suitcase here - except there's nowhere to put your suitcase except at the toot of the bed. Otherwise, as the website clearly states, any extras are chargeable, although I find the prices excessive. I had my own laptop with internet dongle, so I had no need of their TV or wifi. There is no lift, so if you are put on the third floor (as I was) it's a hike. Generally the hotel is quiet, although heavy doors make for loud banging as people enter and leave rooms, and the floors in the halls creak. The bed was comfortable, and I slept fine. All in all, this hotel was exactly what I needed, basic accommodation without paying for frills I didn't need.

What this place has going for it is that it's simple/straightforward to check-in and check-out, the rooms are clean, tidy and secure.

On 16 June, when I got to the reception at 10 a.m., I saw the receptionist arguing with a couple on the size of their room. She promised the couple to try her best to give them a bigger room and asked them to come back to her after lunch. Then I came to her and told her that I was at Room G1. When she heard that, she immediately told me that I need to change my room because someone else had booked my room. I explained to her the arrangement made by her colleague on 14 June and that I have already been occupying the room. She just rudely said the room is for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special needs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and her colleague had made a mistake.

She just refused to check it out and insisted that I needed to change my room. I said that it was ridiculous. On 14 June, the receptionist knew that my bookings were for 3 nights and he did confirm that I can keep the same room for all the 3 nights. If I need to change the room, I would not take the room at the very beginning. It was just a nonsense to change the room for just one night. I also pointed out to her that the non-availability of Room G1 that she showed me on-line was misleading, since I have already occupied the room and that was why Room G1 was not available on-line. Then she told me that I could keep the room. Up to that moment, I knew that she was just cheating me all the way that there was a double booking for Room G1.

Cleanliness & Service: Let me start with the worst part: Bed Bugs (which I fortunately spotted in the first night). This is not necessarily a question of how the rooms are cleaned, but the staff at the reception seemed rather unconcerned. I was not offered another room but had to insist on it, and to actually get the room, I had to return early to make sure that not all other rooms were taken. At least the management seems to have taken care of the problem and my second room (on the same floor) was ok. Other than that, both rooms and their bathrooms were reasonably clean, but you have to be aware that rooms are only cleaned when guests change or for an additional fee. Rooms: The rooms themselves provide the absolute minimum you need. It's sufficient for a weekend in the city but not suited for a longer stay. Like their web page says: there are \"2 clothes hanging hooks provided\", and there is hardly any room for luggage. There is no shelf or hook in the bathroom to put any toiletries.

Thats super cheap and although you could find other hotels as cheap in London none would be as clean or safe as easyhotel was. The rooms ARE small. I stayed in the room with my wife and we had 2 large bags with lots of winter clothes for 5 days plus we did a lot of shopping and i dont think we would have had room to store anything else if we had stayed 2 days longer. BUT, we did stay there for 5 days and it was an excellent experience. When we travel to London we dont spend time in the room. We wake up around 8 and are out by 9. We then spend all day shopping and walking. We get back to the room around 10. Watch some tv and fall asleep by 11. So the money we saved on the hotel we spent shopping. The location of the hotel is really great. Its 2 minutes from Paddington station and there is a major bus stop right in front of the hotel. Most of the buses on oxford street drop you off right in front of the hotel. One cool thing I learned from the easyhotel employees was heathrow connect. Its like heathrow express just a lot cheaper and instead of taking 20 minutes to get to the airport takes around 30 because it has a few stops on the way. Take the heathrow connect so save some more cash. There is wifi in the room i think it was 20pounds for the week. Lots of cool tv stations to watch also. Cheap fast food joins are also near the hotel like KFC, Burger King and McDonalds. I would definitely stay at easyhotel paddington again.

The bed was of a good size, but the rest was almost nothing!!.No space to place anything but on the floor taking care not to step on your bags, shoes,etc.There was a window looking at the narrow corridor of room LG11!! So, it was as if there was no window at all!According to my mind,window is a square opening looking OUTSIDE no matter the view!!!The toilet-shower room was tiny but that worked well wih me.The room,bed, linen shower was clean.There was no noise coming from the hotel ,road but after 6 am and until 12.00 you could feel and hear the underground train passing every 4-5 minutes and if you are not used to that, you will feel annoyed!There was a LCD tv that you have to pay 5 pounds/day toget the remote from reception. If you stay three whole days as I did, you can not avoid staying in that hole without watching a bit of tv. Beware there is no 220 V socket in the room, youhato ask for an addaptor at the reception!Because I love spending almost the whole day out, doing things and coming only exhausted to rest, I did not suffer and itme passed so quickly (I lOVE LONDON) but if you are not a walking person and need more relaxation on your hotel,forget it!!!!

The first time I stayed, I tried the small-size room with no window. The rooms at this Easyhotel were always spotlessly clean. However the small rooms are exactly that - SMALL. Do not book into this type of room if you have more than a small backpack, as there is simply no space to put anything...you cannot even stand and keep your arms outstretched, because the room is very very small. However, it is a good option if what you're after is a bed and a shower. The shower/toilet is a small plastic unit, and the shower was powerful and worked well. Not having a window might put some people off - at least, however, there is an air conditioning unit. The second time, I tried a standard-sized room. This type of room affords more breathing space than a small room, and I had a window, which was welcome. The bathroom was ok, bigger than in the small rooms, but I had the same experience as others on here in that I could not get the shower to work - I could only get cold water. The bed was good. On the down side, the whole hotel is very orange and very branded - you will find the 'Easyhotel' logo on the windows, the walls, etc. The rooms are small. The shower only worked well one night. On the up side, the desk staff are very helpful and friendly, and you can check in at all times after 3pm. And also, don't forget that for this price, you cannot get a clean hotel/hostel room anywhere in London which is ensuite - at this price, in London you'd be expecting dirt and bedbugs, so a small room is a small price to pay for a clean room of a consistent standard.", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cBudget hotel - don't expect much\u201d", "Author": "New-EUtourist", "ReviewID": "UR23303812", "Content": "I stayed over 1 night at Easyhotel Paddington (X'Mas eve).

Overall, not a bad stay, but there was definitely more nickel-and-diming than I'd seen anywhere in ages. I booked a small room \"with window,\" and since I was arriving around 10 a.m. on Christmas Day, I inquired about checking in earlier than the usual check-in time, by e-mailing the hotel. I was told that I'd have to book the previous night (Christmas Eve) in order to check in that early. First, that turned out to be untrue (the hotel offered early check-in for only 10 GBP). Second, even though I did pay 24 GBP to book that room for the Christmas Eve, once I turned up at the hotel, the front-desk clerk tried to tell me that since I'd arrived after 10 a.m. (check-OUT time for the night before), my reservation was worthless. Sound confusing? Quite. I pulled out the printed version of the e-mail telling me exactly the opposite, and started to explain, and he immediately did an about-face and said that, fine, I could indeed check in. I was given a room on the \"lower ground floor,\" which was, of course, a basement. I made my way down the stairs and opened the door. I wasn't put off by the tiny space, but I was quite appalled (as the last reviewer was) that the room \"with window\" actually had a window that had a lovely view of the hallway. As the room was uncomfortably warm, and the a/c didn't seem to work, I went back upstairs and asked if perhaps they had any rooms with windows to the outside world. I was told that for 10 GBP a night, I could \"upgrade\" to a bigger room with a real window. I knew I wouldn't sleep in the heat, so I splurged and got a room on the third floor. It was fine. Again, the a/c didn't cool the room, but the window wide open (there were no pesky restrictions on that, thankfully) cooled things down nicely. In early mornings, it was far too loud to sleep with the window open, however. Speaking of loud, the walls were thick enough to not hear into my neighbors' room, but the doors were incredibly thin and let in even the softest noise, day and night, from the hallway. When doors slammed (as they did quite often), the sound boomed through the room. The bathroom boasted a terrible smell for my entire stay, despite it appearing very clean. Think there must be some sewer problems. The tiny sink didn't drain very quickly, and that it stuck out all of eight inches from the wall, it was virtually impossible to wash your face (given the lack of a washcloth) without getting water all over the floor. The room was indeed small, but I was only one person and only had one piece of luggage. What was more than a little aggravating was that there was not a SINGLE flat surface anywhere in the room. Not a shelf on the wall, side table, nothing. So I was always stepping over piles of things on the floor trying to get ready in the morning. I actually used the outside windowsill to store spare change, etc. The room was clean but not spotless. There were some stray hairs on the comforter that led me to believe it doesn't get washed between every stay, more like shaken out... Oddly, someone \"cleaned\" the room after I'd been there one of my three nights, even though I didn't order this extra service. But there was a fresh towel and the trash was emptied. I'm staying in a Travelodge in Manchester as I write this -- another very basic bargain chain. And though I've only paid half the price of the easyHotel, it's far, far superior. So, I'm all for budget hotels, but the easyHotel really isn't much better than a hostel in my book. The capsule-hotel thing can be done well (see the Yotels), or it can be done shabbily.
