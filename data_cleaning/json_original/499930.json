Breakfast was yummy. I had been told not to expect much from Italian hotels because they were continental. I was pleased with the variety and the quality of the food. Wifi worked well (except if you are standing at the concierge desk). Even the 3g on my kindle. Loved the distance to the termini. It was easy to get from there to the Vatican and other places we visited out of the tourist area of Rome. The hotel we a nice walking distance from the collesium and other places. It was a heavy walking day, but using Rick Steve's audio tours we were able to walked from our hotel see the collesium, forem, do the Jewish ghetto walk and Travestere walk and see the Trevi Fountain and back to the hotel in one. day. It might not be what others would have liked, but it was perfect for us.

Plenty of room for us and the beds were great and the 2 huge feather pillows were the best I've slept on for many a year. Marco at reception was just about the best I've come across for help, he was more than willing to help with anything we asked for, gave him a nice bottle of red for his help. The breakfast was ok, it does need to improve, coffee machine is average, making tea was the best option we found. Fruit juice, fresh fruit, excellent pastries and croissants, yoghurt,plenty of jams, cheese and hams were good, the bread was poor and the selection of rolls very average. There were also some cakes which were very nice but I do like some sort of egg for breakfast and maybe some toast. The area around the hotel is great, plenty of reasonably priced eateries, Il Secchio around the corner does a 12 euro tourist 3 course meal which was excellent, also a half litre of house wine for 4 euro, it was really nice. The main train and bus station is only 2 minutes walk away so when in it's vicinity you see a varied selection of Romes inhabitants, we saw no trouble or any unsavoury incidents and there was never a time when we felt uncomfortable in the area, it was just very busy. The one thing to remember if you like a drink, coffee in Macdonalds 1 euro, anywhere else extortionate, beer is even worse except off a street vendor where you can get a can for 2 - 3 euros.

I booked a singe room with a big bed (queen size) \u2013 that was the only reason why I chose the hotel. The one that was given to me was a tiny (this I can handle) room with a narrow twin bed (which I hate). The worst thing about the room was that it awfully smelled with sewage. I complained about the smell and was given another room with a queen size bed. The room was not exactly clean. I found hair in the sheets. Furthermore, the worst thing about this hotel was that I had a really bad allergy on my eyes after using their towels. I could not open my eyes in the morning. They were red and itchy and achy for a few days. My ophthalmologist explained to me that it must have been a detergent with which the pillow cases and towels are washed what caused the allergy. One more thing that struck me about the hotel was their visiting policy. They refused to allow my colleague in the hotel to help me with the luggage unless he left a passport with the receptionist (which of course was out of the question as I can not imagine a reasonable person who would leave his/her passport at such a creepy place). I guess they had some \u201cmoral\u201d concerns about the visitors but I felt deeply insulted.

The room had an inside view to other nearby buildings, so the noise was minimum, the AC was really strong so we had it turned off for the night. The elevator was one of the things I really liked the most, its the kind you see in old movies where you have to close the exterior metal door manually first before the electronic interior closes, however keep in mind if the exterior door was open in any floor the elevator stops.. I attached a picture to this review. 3) The staff was helpful and very friendly, they gives you tips and advices no matter what you ask them.

We stayed three nights. The hotel rooms are comfortable and spotlessly clean though some of them tend to be very small. We had to switch the room during our three-night stay which was kind of dumb but the new one we got was bigger so we did not complain too hard. If possible avoid rooms on the lower floors facing the Via Principe Amadeo street as they tend to be very noisy and smelly from the many restaurants down below including one particularly unappetizing Kebab house. Even rooms higher up (5th floor) that are facing the street are very noisy (though no longer smelly) - you won't sleep with open windows for sure though with the air-conditioning fortunately working, this should not be too much of a problem. Can't confirm what other revieweres said about walls being paper-thin - either had civilized, quiet neighbors or just a very hard sleep. The breakfasts are bland but mostly serve their purpose with an assortment of semi-fresh white bread, croissants, just one type of cheese and ham, limited fruit, no vegetables. The breakfast room is open till 10am though unless you are staying outside the main season you really want to get there by 8:30am at the latest to get a free table as the room is small with just several tightly packed tables that can't keep up with the full hotel population. The staff was friendly and speaks English, will give you many useful tips if you ask for them. The location is fine, don't trust the stories from other reviewers about drunkars and prostitutes on the street. Although the area around Termini is surely not the prettiest part of Rome, we never felt unsafe with my wife walking the streets even after 10pm at night. There are many budget restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel that offer good value for money which is nice considering that they are mainly frequented by the tourists. The main (red) metro line is immediately accessible and will carry you directly to most of the main tourist sites including Vatican. On the other hand, if you are not too keen on being intimately squashed by the hordes of tourists in the ever-overfilled metro train cars, you will still be able to access many tourist sites within a walking distance. The Colosseum and the surrounding highlights are just 15 mins away with a nice walk through the Terme di Traiano park. In the hotel lobby you'll find handy complimentary one-page maps of Rome that indicate the hotel's location making sure you never get lost. If you travel from the Fiumicini airport, the train shuttle is just 500m away leaving every half an hour (the trip takes about 30 minutes).. The fellow tourists keeping you company in this hotel are mostly civilized with the usual mix of mainly Germans, Americans, Spaniards and French - usually in couples.

We got taxi's everywhere during the 1st few days but next time we will buy our 2 day ticket for the bus tours, as u can get on and off wherever u like and they work out much cheaper!! Breakfast wasnt my idea of breakfast! But all the same it kept us going until our next meal! It consists of tea, coffee, juices (which u couldnt drink!!) Croissants, bread, fruit, yoghurts & 2 or 3 selections of cereal..

My boyfriend and I were on a mini-break to occupy ourselves between Christmas and New Year. We picked the Serena as it was pretty much the cheapest place we could find that hadn't been slated on Trip Advisor. We were not too sure what to expect as the hotel was very cheap and guidebooks warn that the area around the train station is a little seedy. We were however pleasantly suprised by what was on offer. The reception staff were friendly and helpful, the rather quaint looking lift was in good working order and most importantly the room was clean, the bed comforable and we had room to swing a cat. The decor was a little faded but we had plenty of blankets, towels and even soap and shampoo provided. The room was cleaned and the bed re-made each day and we had more than enough hot water for two long showers every morning. Given our booking website had this listed as a 2* hotel we had expected less particularly in a capital city. We had booked bed and breakfast and were impressed with the spread on offer each morning . There was not a lot of variety (rolls with ham and cheese, croissants, cereal, yoghurt) but everything was fresh and tasty and , as you'd expect in Italy, they were serving some really nice coffee. If I was returning to Rome on a budget I'd definately consider staying at the Serena again provided I wasn't travelling alone.

But for 90EURO or more, I would try to look for better hotels around the area.", "Date": "September 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "Laiyee", "ReviewID": "UR3915260", "Content": "We had a very good experience at this hotel. It is less than a 5 minute walk from Termini station, which was useful because we used Termini to catch a lot of Rome's city buses. Although we were close to the train station, the area seemed very safe, and we did not have any trouble in terms of safety. There are many restaurants, internet cafes and laundromats on the street, as well as a gelateria two doors down, which was convenient! The Coloseum and ruins were a 15 minute walk away, and aside from taking a bus to see the Vatican, we easily walked to all of the other tourist sites. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was very good -- an assortment of breads and danishes, cereals, yogurt, cheese, tea/coffee and juice. The rooms were very clean and the bathroom (ensuite) was big and clean.

Besides being close to central station and Piazza Republica, there is a self-service laundromat 3 doors down for those who pack light and need to clean their clothes. I stayed here two different times, and it is true that in the first room on the 3rd floor, the air conditioning didn't work (even though reception was fully cooled) but in the second room on the second floor it did. The second floor also had small fridges filled with cool beverages and I found the bedroom and the room in general to be nicer. I did notice a difference in reception between the people. The man in the morning was excellent in making you feel welcome and in general had a cheery attitude. His customer service was exceptionally good. The younger man during the evening shift was also pleasant, but the woman is not as welcoming or easy going . Whichever room you stay in, it is still good. The cleaning is done well, the water pressure is good, there is a TV with English channels (BBC, & CNN), and the breakfast is very good. I think the price per value is a good deal. The hotel location is great for those who want to stay near central station. I liked staying near the station because you can buy a day pass and can catch any bus wherever you are that will take you back to central station or to another stop where you can catch bus that will take you there. Also there are lots of internet points, 2 self-service laundrymats, a couple of good restaurants, and some good bar/cafes near the hotlel.", "Date": "August 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNo Airconditioning\u201d", "Author": "LondonDesa", "ReviewID": "UR3684832", "Content": "We arrived in hotel only to find that air conditioning was broken.

The room is clean and the beds are very good (box spring mattresses). By Italian standards the breakfast is very good. The airco does not always work, which was no problem during our stay in the second week of May. The only (minor) problem is the refrigerator, which hardly cool the beverages.
