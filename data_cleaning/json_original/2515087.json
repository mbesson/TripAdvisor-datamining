What is good about the location is that the Rue D'Antin is a side street off Ave.L'Opera and is much quiter then other hotels on busy streets. My wife and I enjoyed the Lourve for a day but the crowds made the experience hot and smelly! Try to go off season. July is a madhouse.

We also went to Giverny which was excellent, Chantilly, also excellent, and Musee D'Orsay, fabulous, Les Invalides, fabulous, had dinner at the first level restaurant at the Eiffel Tower and it was very good but expensive. We found the Bistros had good food at typical US prices but the restrooms are a bit filthy and lack privacy so beware.....use lots of sanitizer.

This hotel is centrally located, the wireless connection worked great, the hotel was clean, it has a great staff, and it\u2019s in a safe neighborhood. We returned to the hotel pretty late a couple of nights, and we never felt unsafe. We would return without hesitation. My wife, 4-year old, and I visited Paris recently and stayed at the L\u2019Horset Op\u00e9ra Paris. The two most outstanding features of the hotel are the service and the location. The individuals at the front desk are particularly nice and accommodating. In terms of service, this is a 5-star hotel. Starting with our first long distance conversation with Sabrina, the staff continued the trend of politeness and professionalism upon our arrival. To Cyndie, Damien, Maryna, and the gentleman from Columbia who works overnight: BRAVO. The hotel is located about 5 minutes from the Op\u00e9ra House and the Op\u00e9ra Metro stop. The train system is very much like NY in that you can get virtually anywhere you wish to go. It\u2019s the fastest way to get around town. The walk from the hotel lobby to the Lourve is no more than 15 minutes; which reminds me that there is second Metro stop about 7 minutes away in the other direction, if you need an alternative. The hotel is also 5 minutes away from the bus that takes you to the airport. There are many restaurants, clothing shops and caf\u00e9s within seconds and minutes away. Even though it's in a vibrant neighborhood, it's on a quiet block. We never heard any street noise. The hotel itself is very clean and it is simple. It doesn\u2019t have a lot of amenities such as a pool and a fitness center. It does serve breakfast, although we never had breakfast there. We kept it simple by picking up some fruit and a croissant at a local patisserie named Paul that was a few blocks away. There are many \u201cPauls\u201d in Paris and they all have great baked goods. The room was well kept. It was relatively small by most U.S. standards, but large enough for the three of us. The bathroom was a good size for us as well. Keep in mind that this is Paris so things are smaller, I\u2019m from NYC, so I\u2019m used to this. The hotel provided a bed for our daughter at no extra charge, which is not always common in France. It\u2019s kind of ridiculous that some charge you to place a cot in the room. The manager in one hotel in Cannes, the Cavendish, had the nerve to tell me when I called to ask some questions and clarify their policy, that even when there is another bed in the room (e.g., a pull out sofa), they charge 65 E for the extra person (a four year old) because \u201cwe have to clean an extra pair of sheets and a towel.\u201d How do you bring yourself to say something so stupid? At any rate, if you plan to spend most of your time walking the streets of Paris and touring, and you want a nice, clean, reasonably priced hotel in a safe neighborhood, the L\u2019Horset Op\u00e9ra is a great choice.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wolfenbuttel, Germany", "Title": "\u201cjust perfect\u201d", "Author": "uschi2803", "ReviewID": "UR115679519", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights in this hotel and everything was just perfect.

It is an old building which has been well maintained and the lobby is warm and inviting. Wood panelling is used extensively. The receptionist was friendly and welcoming. My room was ready when I arrived before the 2 pm check in. Many hotel reviews in Paris complain about the size of rooms, but mine was more than big enough. It was classified as a single room with double bed and very comfortable. The decor was made up of wood panels and oriental inspired fabrics. The bathroom was accessed by a sliding door (unlockable but not a problem if you're alone) and was quite modern. The bed was soft and comfortable though maybe not as supportive as I'm used to, though it's just personal preference. The room had large double glazed windows which opened fully, a bonus as the weather was hot. There is also air conditioning with three setttings. My tariff included unlimited free internet access which was good and breakfast which was less good, not bad but underwhelming. I would be inclined to eat breakfast elsewhere if it is not included. There is a room service menu with hot and cold drinks and a small choice of hot meals and sandwiches, though these seemed a bit expensive. I just ordered tea but the service was quick. The television had a limited selection of channels, with only two -BBC News and CNN in English. You don't go to Paris to watch TV but it is nice to wind down after a long day. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. The hotel is clean and pleasant, the staff are friendly the room was cosy and the location is good.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAgree with Tripadvisor--a great place\u201d", "Author": "bktours", "ReviewID": "UR111448872", "Content": "Excellent location, US hotel standards in the midst of downtown Paris.

I booked this hotel through Eurostar with the aim of finding a hotel in a good location. When i arrived at the hotel i was astounded at how good the service was. I was greeted from my taxi by the concierge who carried my luggage to the reception desk where i was given a warm and friendly greeting by the receptionist who was only too happy to help. When i got to my room, (which was located on the 5th floor) I was delighted with the decor, clearly some care had been taken into making this place look and feel authentic. There was a very comfortable queen size bed, a plasma television, minibar and several guides and magazines about Paris. All of these guides and magazines were multilingual which was helpful. There was also a small card on the desk telling me the name of the maid, which in itself is a nice little touch, but when it is also written in English it makes you wonder how on earth they knew that. The bathroom was marble effect throughout and the shower was outstanding for a bath/shower combination. The breakfast was a typical continental breakfast with a range of pastries, cereals, fruit, cold cuts of meat and cheese. I would highly recommend the fruit muesli as it was very good. There was also a range of multiligual newpapers for you to take and read. Other things that impressed me was the free wi'fi in the hotel, the quality of the room service, the politeness of the staff and the general attention to detail. The location of this hotel is absolutely fantastic. It is a 2 minute walk from the Opera house and metro line and a short 10 minute walk from the Louvre. The only things that slightly disappointed me about the hotel were, the bathroom door as it was on a slider and didn't have a lock. The lift was fairly slow as well, i was also given a small electric shock whilst pressing the call button on the fifth floor. Overall this hotel is absolutely fantastic and represents great value for money, I plan on returning in the summer to make the most of Paris when the weather is less inclement.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, friendly helpful staff and comfortable rooms.\u201d", "Author": "RachelK23", "ReviewID": "UR52700384", "Content": "Highly recommended-only a short stroll (less than 10 minutes) from the Louvre.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and were able to deal with all our requests (kingsized bed, extra coathangers, toast with breakfast and booking taxis) and I am sure they would have been able to assist with other things had we required them. This hotel does not have any additional facilities such as a pool or a gym, but has a relaxed atmosphere and a more personal touch than some of the larger hotels.

A most user unfriendly place with lousy sign-age. Thank goodness the staff are obliging. Anyway, back to the hotel. Excellent location in the centre of the Opera district of Paris. However, taxi driver didn't know where it was. After many about turns, and reversing after going down a one way street the wrong way, he found it. (Not in the same league as London cabbies). Very welcoming and helpful English speaking staff. Size of room was average with fair sized wardrobe with built-in safe. Good sized dressing table with drawers for storage. Very comfortable bed, but only one armchair. Good range of international programmes on TV with speaker in bathroom. Very clean and well appointed bathroom, with bath, with fixed and hand held shower overhead. Good range of toiletries. Towels and sheets changed daily. Heating only by air conditioning unit. Very quiet, but if fan turned off, no heating. But with outdoor temperatures at around 0\u00ba c, rooms held heat well, except for our friends on the top (6th) floor. No kettle or welcome tray, but 24hr room service for light meals and snacks. The included continental breakfast arrangement was very nice, with a good range of food to choose from. The only problem, was a horrible smell on entering our room on the fifth floor. It was either the drains or the air-con. Not bad enough to spoil our stay, but would have asked for a change of room had we stayed any longer. To be fair, Paris can be a pretty smelly place anyway.

Situated in a quiet side street off Avenue de l'Opera, It's just ten minutes walk to Galeries Lafayette in one direction and about 15 minutes to the Left Bank in the other. The hotel itself is charming. Unlike many hotels where the lobby is an impersonal space, L'horset has a softly-lit seating area to your right with two large comfy sofas, potted plants and even a collection of books where you can sit and relax after a day's hard sight-seeing. The barman will bring coffee or other drinks here, or - if you can manage without a sofa - you can sit in the bar which is just as cosy and even serves light meals if you are too tired to go out. It's not great cuisine but it's a lot better than the burgers and chips served up by many a bar in British hotels. Again, unlike many hotels where all the expense has gone on decorating the public areas, this hotel's charm doesn't stop at the elevator doors. The upstairs corridors have fabric-lined walls above wood panelling and this continues into the bedrooms, all of which have their own fabric style. Ours was Willow Pattern in red and ochre. The bathroom was completely tiled in marble, both walls and floor. The overbath showerhad both a fixed head and a handset, very handy for hairwashing. I do have a few quibbles. The bedrooms are small - some might say poky - and there is little closet space. This may not matter if you are staying just a couple of nights, but 4 double coat-hangers seems a little stingy for a hotel claiming to be 4-star. The face cloths were thin, disposable mitts - rather like the ones for polishing shoes. Terry ones would have been more approprate. We asked for tea-making facilities (as offered) and while these were provided, the supplies of milk, etc were never replenished. Nor were there any biscuits. The room had a slight smell to it as though someone had been smoking, despite the fact that it was a non-smoking floor. We felt that maybe the bedcover and curtains were in need of a clean. However, these are small complaints in what was otherwise a very pleasant experience. Other reviewers have mentioned the friendly staff and I can only add to that.

Even though her English was limited, she would say \"Hi\" to my mom and I and personally bring little treats to our room. Our room was nice. The bathrooms, though luxurious, are small so be prepared. However, the room was kept spotless and was in very, very good condition -- truly the caliber of a 4 star hotel. The location was excellent! It was about a ten minute walk from the Louvre (no joke!) and close to the metro and RER lines. The Paris metro system is so very easy to learn so don't be intimidated to try it because you really get a chance to experience Paris in a less touristy way and most of the people there do speak a bit of English. One tip I have for travelers is to try and learn a little bit of French instead of just speaking English. Say \"Bonjour\" and Au revoir\" instead of just saying \"Hello\" and go off into your questions. It is really appreciated by native Parisians and enhances your experience. Once again, this trip with my mom was unforgettable and the Best Western L'Horset Opera had a great deal to do with that.
