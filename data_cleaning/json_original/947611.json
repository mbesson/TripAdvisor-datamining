First, the entrance to the U-Bahn is practically right outside the door to the hotel, making travelling by the underground extremely convenient. Second, the bathroom was a good size and very modern and bright. For us, the positives ended there. When we went to go to bed the first night, we found the sheets on our bed were dirty...they had obviously not been replaced since the previous occupant had left (I'll spare you the details). Because it was very late, we decided to wait until morning, pulled the covers up, spread towels from the bathroom on top (we had no way of knowing if the duvet covers had been changed either), and had a bit of an uncomfortable sleep. The next morning, I complained to the staff at the front desk and asked someone to make sure the beds and room were properly cleaned during the day. The staff seemed a bit indifferent to my concerns but assured me the matter would be looked after. When we returned that night, we got to our room to find a couple of folded sheets left on the foot of the bed, and the dirty sheets still place. Although it was again late, this time we did complain immediately. We were told there was no cleaning staff on duty at night but they'd see what they could do. Eventually, one of the front-desk staff did come up and changed the sheets herself, which I appreciated; but it was still unacceptable that it took two days to get obviously dirty sheets changed. In general, we did not find staff very engaging, friendly, or responsive. The hotel's immediate location is not very attractive (although if you take a walk through the surrounding neighborhood, you'll find some interesting nooks and crannies).

This hotel is in a very convenient location right next to a metro station. Worst case it will take you max 10 minutes to get to the city center in Berlin, Alexanderplatz. The price of the hotel is acceptable but you have to pay some extras like parking and breakfast. In both cases the prices were not overpriced when you compare with other hotel rates. There is parking space right in front of the hotel for 2 cars. It is free of charge during the night time but during the day it is 0.25 Euros for 15 min. So We decided to use the hotels parking space for a daily base and it was 12 Euros which is a good price in a city like Berlin. The other hotels mostly charge 20 Euros on a daily basis. The breakfast was good but not excellent but it was very convenient for us because we eat good mostly on breakfast and enjoy the rest of our trip with just a snack later not to lose any time. The breakfast is 9 Euros and worths every penny. There are some supermarkets next and across the hotel and when you need something it is just a 5 minute walk from the hotel. There is even a market 24 hours open. You can buy fruits.. cold beer.. even some international food which can give you a taste of home in a foreign land. The hotel carpets looked kind of messy when we arrived to the hotel but later on a professional staff did a good cleaning. The bathroom was designed very effeciently. There was a small radiator in the bathroom which you could set it for a 2 hours to make your wet towels dry. There was a special shaving mirror which I believed is a must in every bathroom as well. The gummy bear candies were a good surprise for our 2 year old daughter. Shortly, I would say it was not the best hotel I have ever stayed but I would say it was one of the best bargains I have ever made. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who does not need so much comfort but still be in the heart of city with a reasonable price.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Xiamen, China", "Title": "\u201cVery good address\u201d", "Author": "vincextras", "ReviewID": "UR122231244", "Content": "Upon arrival and until us leaving the hotel 3 days later, the staff has been really nice, helpful and provided excellent guidance in order to enjoy the city and the local treats.

We ate at the San Diego steak restaurant which you acces by turning left out of the hotel, follow the building line to the left,, turn left up the first street, walk 100 mtrs and it is there in front of you. The beef goulash soup was the best I have had and a 2 course meal for two with drinks cost 30 euros.....Excellent value. Really busy when we arrived at 7.30pm and stayed full whilst we were in. We also ate at the Mona Lisa Italian Restaurant which you access by turning right out of the hotel and walk approx 100 meters. Again the meal for two with drinks averaged 30 Euros.

We discovered that if you kept one room key in the power slot and took the other one with us that the room was cooler when we got back. The room had a mini bar which was well stocked but quite expensive, so we removed the items and used the fridge to store water etc and then replaced the items when leaving.

I thought the front desk were efficient, but not friendly. I was a little surprised that the front desk would not change a 50\u20ac bill for me.

Most importantly, the U-bahn station was immediately outside of the hotel. It is a few minute (less than 10) ride to Alexanderplatz. From Alexanderplatz, you can either walk, or easily transfer to another U-bahn, to anywhere you want. My only disappointment was the length of time it took to get from the airport (Tegel) to the hotel. I took the airport bus from Tegel (less than 2.3\u20ac) to Alexanderplatz and then took a cab from Alexanderplatz. In addition to some difficulty in finding a cab at Alexanderplatz, the total trip took 2 hours due to traffic (I left Tegel at 1:30 PM on a Friday). Another writer recommended the bus from Tegel to Alexanderplatz and then the U-bahn to the hotel. I had a considerable amount of luggage, so it was simply easier to take the cab. (The cab was less than 15 Euros.) The room did have a small safe, but not large enough to keep my small notebook computer. It also had a refrigerator, which was nice.

Worst aspect was the reception staff who were generally rude/abrupt/unhelpful;for example-the hotel booklet said that tea and coffee making facilities could be obtained from reception and there was no charge.Brits like their cup of tea and so we duly went down to recetion to get the kit.The guy on recetion looked as if guests were an inconvenience to him but went off to get the kettle and said 5 eros please.

Probably a communication problem on my part-I resisted the temptataion to say a few choice words as it later transpired that the 5 euros was a deposit and as long as you didn't nick the kettle you got it back.

From my knowledge of law I suspect that this was illegal-the facilities were not shut because they were being cleaned (which is reasonable) but they were shut because it suited them that way. So take your choice-persoally I wouldn't stay here unless you like being bloody-minded and are prepared to make yourself really unpopular to get the service level you deserve.It was not as if we were paying budget prices-our 4 night stay cost 285 euros (with no breakfast) Perhaps if we had taken breakfast in the hotel then they might have been a bit more friendly towards us!!", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value, good location, good stay\u201d", "Author": "NJ26", "ReviewID": "UR110734537", "Content": "This hotel is great value for money, especially compared to other hotels in Berlin that charge the same as this but are not as nice.

During our stay we based ourselves at the BW City Ost. largely based on the positive reviews on this site. Sadly, and unusually, I find myself disagreeing with many co-reviewers. The hotel is OK but it is really let down by its location. Berlin is a fun city with loads of exciting bars and restaurants but these are not to be found in the Frankfurter Allee and certainly not in the vicinity of the hotel. This is the \"grungy\" area of the city and while there are plenty of cafes and bars which might appeal, they are mainly of the student-friendly style that can be found in any city. Apart from one crucial difference - everything closes by midnight! Shopping in this area is of the Netto or Lidl cheap supermarket variety with some niche studenty type thrown in. Others have commented on the proximity of the U-Bahn and they are right - Samariterstrasse station is right outside the front door (don't worry, there is no noise). Unfortunately until the U5 line extension is completed, this line doesn't provide much connectivity with the rest of the excellent integrated Berlin public transport system. Until then, you need to transit through Alexander Platz. We found the reception staff to be very friendly and helpful and all spoke perfect English. The rooms are tiny (we had a comfort room on the 3rd floor, rear). The double bed was actually 2 singles joined together but the bedding was \"singles\", i.e. 2 single quilts instead of 1 double/king. Strange.

U-Bahn (undergroud) is literally at its door step (mind you, there are 2 exits, the other require ~20steps from the hotel). Given Germany's reputation in automobile (think BMW) and its engineering achievement, the public transporation in Berlin is superb and has one of the best network in Europe. This means there is almost always a train waiting to connect you to the city everytime you step out of Best Western Ost hotel. And for this great accessibility, who needs to stay in the heart of the city, besides, a suburb hotel rate is always more reasonable. compare price using tripadvisor, I got a great rate from Hotels.com. To top it, 2 doors away is a local mini-market, which has long operating hours and will cater for all you basic need from forgottten tooth brush to late night snacks, charging local price and not tourist rate. There are also Burger King and Subway sandwiches nearby. I particularly fancy the bakery across the lane to Burger King, had my breakfast there almost every morning, either dine-in or on-the go. The room is no frill but like most German hotels I read from the review, it is very clean. The room is well insulated, unless u open the window, it is warm and quiet. It meets my high standard for cleaniness. It is exactly like the pictures posted on the hotel website. A few more tips to share:- 1.) Read the info booklet in the room, a lot of amenites not available in the room can be requested from the front desk free of charge. This includes kettle, coffee, tea bags, shower cap, tooth brush & paste, adapter etc. Don't ask me why they are not provided upfront, maybe it is the German way. 2.) Forget about the common pc. It is slow and always hanged. If u really must, bring ur own and u can hook up for free in the room. Too bad no wireless. Couple of things which i think can be improved. 1.) The service. Staffs are not very friendly or approachable. As I mostly travelled in Asia region where people is warmer, I definitely think not greeting ur guest and asking her to bring her own luggage to and from the storage room is out.

The book has many discounts for entry for up to 100 places. The transport service is very regular, from outside of the hotel it is only 5 stops to Alexanderplatz and about 10 minutes of a trip if that. Don't make the same mistake that we did and wait on the S9 station at the airport going to the hotel, ask! Pick up a map on your way through the airport, you'll need it! The hotel is very warm and clean. Too hot actually, we had to sleep with the window open and the noise from the traffic outside was terrible. You can get nearly everything from the hotel lobby like an ironing board and iron, kettle, tea coffee etc, travel plugs, all for a small deposit. They also have toothpaste, cosmetics, razors and shaving gel etc for free, but beware the razors you can only scrape with once, they were rubbish. The beds were comfortable and so were the pillows. The towels were changed whenever you left them on the bathroom floor. On our last morning there, the maid came into our room at 0715 when we were still in bed, so beware use your 'do not disturb' sign. The trip up the TV Tower was ok, we can say we have been up there, we had a meal in the restaurant as it was my birthday, it was very expensive and nothing fancy, wouldn't go again! There was also a wait to come down in the lift . We went to Sachenhausen Concentration Camp, which was worth the visit. We Got on the S-bahn to Orienburg which took about 40 minutes from Friedrichstrase and then followed the signs to Sachenhausen which took about 15 minutes to walk....easy to find. It was free to get in and you could hire a media player for 3 euros each, one for 2 people is adaquate, you don't need one each. There are toilets when you get there and a cafe, we bought a drink before we set off. If you want to see, hear and listen to everything then give yourself a full day and take some food too. Kilkenny's pub in Mitte is absolutely fabulous, it is located at Hackescher Markt (a main S-bahn station) they have Sky Sports and live bands on 5 times a week, it was warm and welcoming in there and quite busy, very reasonable for prices too, Corona's 3.50 euros each. Potsdam is quite lively too, the Winter Wonderland Market place is really nice, all the smells of the hot food and sweets is fab. Don't go the Radisson hotel to see the fishtank, it's not worth it and you have to pay to view the fish in the middle of the tank, it was 27 euro to enter Sealife!!! If you want to visit the Reichtstag,I would suggest going early, the queues were horrendous, we didn't go for this reason. The Berlin Wall we saw and Checkpoint Charlie.....disappointing, but we've been!! A visit to Dunkin Donuts is a must.....love em!!

We were a little worried when it seemed to be off the maps we had in our guide books but we worried needlessly. Berlin has a FANTASTIC transport network - buses, trams, underground and suburban trains, so we were only an hour from Tegel airport and just a few minutes from Alexanderplatz (the heart of the transport system). The Best Western is a clean comfortable hotel with a small public area housing a little bar and a few tables and chairs. The rooms are functional, sadly no drink making equipment but that's the continent for you, and kept very clean. We only wanted a place to sleep and shower really so this hotel fitted the bill exactly. Our room was on the third floor looking out over Frankfurter Allee and was a bit noisy late at night but then we were in the middle of a city. The hotel charges 9 euros for breakfast which seemed a bit steep to us with the current exchange rate being about parity so we found a little cafe about 200m towards the city which served us a couple of rolls, salami, jam and coffee for just 3.80 euros each - she called it a French breakfast. Locally there is a Netto, first one I've ever been in... and a 24hr shop across the road in addition to Italian, Indian, Vietnamese and burger restaurants. Some of these aren't top of the range but we weren't on a gourmet holiday. We ate surprisingly cheaply in the local area and went to Zum Nussbaum in Nickolaiviertel one evening as recommended in our guide book. This is a lovely old restaurant but very small; they serve plenty of draught beers and German food at very reasonable prices. Getting around Berlin is so easy - we got a four person ticket for 16 euros and this was valid on all transport for the whole day. We also found the people very friendly and helpful.. We've been to many cities in Europe for short breaks and this is probably the best. There's plenty to see and do and Berlin is a spacious friendly city.", "Date": "April 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester", "Title": "\u201cEast is Best\u201d", "Author": "GazzatheGrumpy", "ReviewID": "UR26975367", "Content": "Having stayed out in the East during my last few trips to Berlin, I can heartily recommend this place; it's new, clean and good value plus the U-Bahn U5 station Samariterstrasse is literally outside the front door offering 24-hour a day access to the city (what an amazing concept, transport that runs all night!). The surroundings aren't the most picturesque, but walk into the centre and you'll see the famous \"palaces for the workers\" on Karl Marx Allee, plus as has already been said the bakery a few doors away is superb for breakfast!

I class myself to be a keen traveller so in a sense i understand what a good city hotel requires. As the hotel is situated a little out of the city i was originally a little worried, also the cost of the hotel was very fair thus adding to my worries! I can honestly say you have nothing to worry about. We flew into Shonefeld airport and used trains/underground to get to the hotel, it was so easy. The underground station (samaristrasse or something) is literally on your doorstep! as is netto (cheap snacks, subway and lots more...) The hotel itself is 5 short stops from alexadarplatz which is a key area in Berlin, and you can connect to any part of the city from there. So location wise its a thumbs up! As for the hotel, overall i was impressed. It's very clean and well maintained, the staff are well manned and friendly and the facilities are what you would expect from a good city hotel. The room was pretty small and so was storage, but we were only staying a short time so this wasnt a problem. Although you are located on a busy road, road noise is minimal due to well glazed windows! 2 minor faults...theres was no bath just a shower (how am i meant to read in the shower!!) and the room was very hot/stuffy due to poor ventilation and i dont think they switch the AC on until summer months! Overall i'd say the hotel was pleasant and excellent value for money, it provided what we needed for our trip and at all times we felt safe and in good hands. As for Berlin...Its cold, but a great city with many things to see and do. I'd greatly recommend the Zoo, its amazing and has pandas!!!

The hotel must have just opened as our room looked like it had never been used before. Key-card entry and light switches, very comfortable bed and linens, modern yet comfortable design, good-sized bathroom, immaculate house keeping. Though it faced the street with large windows, we heard little to no street noise from the 4th floor. Elevators were nice for luggage. We paid something like 40 euro/night, which for the neighborhood was an absolute steal. U-bahn literally steps from the door and S-bahn a few blocks away, easy access to the Hauptbanhof and airport. Front desk staff was helpful, though it seemed they had some \"new hotel\" types of problems with other guests (lost reservations, mix-ups, etc). But our reservation was without any problems, so no complaints to that end. I would most certainly stay again, even if the price were higher. A few tips: We skipped breakfast at the hotel in favor of a nice bread shop a few doors down, you can't miss it -- fresh bread, sandwiches, and drinks for extremely cheap. If you're also a budget traveler, there's a grocery store in the mall/shopping center on the way to the S-bahn (left from the hotel door) with plenty of good breakfast/snack options. If you're staying for a few days, definitely purchase the \"Welcome Berlin\" card, as it's really nice to hop on and off transportation without worrying about tickets, and the card will get you discounts to walking tours and other attractions.
