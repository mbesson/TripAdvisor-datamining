{"Reviews": [{"Content": "We Loved the Hilltop Our stay at the Hilltop was a lovely experience. The staff was warm and helpful (in spite of the fact that we spoke no Japanese and the staff had only a litte English). Our room was most comfortable. We had a marvelous dinner at one of the hotel's restaurants--great martinis, French wine, delicious steak. We hated to leave.", "Date": "Jul 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR516183149", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "OCPhineasFogg"}, {"Content": "\u9359\u3083\u4e9c\u9287\ue042\u4eb4\u9288\u5908\u5010\u9288\u5e7f\u511b\u9289\u253f\u5061\u9288\u308f\u7d12\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(23378292, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR874795980", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ksk_iii"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u64b1\u4ed2\u9288\u64b1\u4f28\u9288\u5a3f\u4ed0\u9287\ufe3a\u4ef8\u8e47\u51a8\u6e74\u9288\u581b\u4eb1\u9287\uff43\u4ee7\u9287\u0441\u4eda   showReview(21470751, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR262987902", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "haruichiban"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066443-d320611-r8223825-The_Hilltop_Hotel-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "320611", "Price": "$236"}}
