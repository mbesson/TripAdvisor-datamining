But, our agent booked us there and we decided to make the best of it. While I agree that the rooms are pretty small and the bathtubs are a challenge to get into and out of, the location and the service of this hotel more than made up for its shortcomings. First, the location. How can you beat being mere steps from the tram stop, 5 minutes from all the top sites to visit (Topkapi, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Hippodrome etc), close to restaurants, banks, shops etc? We were more than happy to deal with some inconveniences in order to have the comfort of short walks and easy access to everything. Secondly, the staff. Some reviewers criticized them for indifference. I couldn't disagree more! Everyone was friendly at check in and check out. One morning we had to catch an early flight to Izmir and had to check out at 5 am. I requested a breakfast box the previous night. They said no, that we would have breakfast in the dining room. At 4:45, we were given our hot tea, a plate of meat, cheese, bread, fruit etc, all set out on our usual table. Another example....one evening we were waiting in the lobby for a restaurant shuttle. An elderly gentleman (not a guest in this hotel), fell down on the sidewalk outside, breaking his glasses and suffering a significant cut on his forehead. He was helped inside by a passer by, and immediately the desk clerk came out with cotton batting and antibacterial ointment and proceeded to clean the wound and make sure the gentleman was OK. He spent a good 20 minutes with him. This is not an indication of an indifferent staff! Finally, the breakfast. Yes, the juice was horrendous! But we found the same product in every hotel in Turkey. I can't imagine why they use Tang or orange flavored syrup instead of the real thing, but that's the case. The other items were fine. Coffee and tea, cheeses, meats, hard boiled eggs, little sausages, fruit, cereals, olives....yes it was the same every day, but there was enough variety so that it wasn't repetitive. One could stay there a week and have a different breakfast every day. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to those who are used to grandiose rooms, luxurious baths and elegant environments. The Antea provides an affordable option to those of house who want to travel but can't afford the Four Seasons.

It was number 302. The shower/toilet was incredible, just TINY! The Guiness book of records need to check it out - The world's tiniest bathroom! So small, you cannot even open the door. Yes, Really. Getting in and out of the shower for a 6ft 4 in person is best described as dangerous. Very difficult to do. The step is too high, too awkward. Minibar is expensive at 5TL a softdrink. The TV - 19 channels in Turkish, no other language channels. Very hard to sleep. Noise comes from next door, the street and the corridor. The air con has two modes, \"Hot and quiet\" or \"cool and noisy\". Either way, you cannot get to sleep. After 2 nights, I moved to 305. A double bed (the mattress is 6 inches smaller than the bed base(?!) A slightly bigger room, but still small. Bathroom slightly bigger, you CAN open the door to this one. The TV has 26 channels, some in other languages (so why not in all rooms?) This room looked out onto a dark central alley. Turkish music came out - rather loudly from about 10 30 to 11 00 pm, so I could not sleep. Then some jolly Turkish chap telephoned my room after midnight and woke me up - wrong room number, but he still woke me up. Air con is the same as the other room, \"hot and quiet\" or \"noisy and cool\". The bedroom light switch - NOW GET THIS - Is built into the bed's headboard! Yes, really (see photo) This means, that as you turn over in bed, you get to switch the lights on!!!! I managed it 3 times, waking myself up each time!!! Oh what great fun. (Just Bizarre!) Oh, and the showeroom has a high, sharp marble step - you cannot miss hitting it with your foot - OUCH! The restaurant and bar - they seem to be there, but not operating - I guess they have given in to the restaurant competition along the road and given up - they need to do the same with the rooms. Breakfast is downstairs in the basement, no natural light. The orange \"juice\" is just nasty \"squash\" - come on, get some juice in, chaps? Some of the food could be upgraded - lots of it, just could be a bit nicer. I asked two times about the 05 35 bus to the airport. Decided to take it this morning. When I came down, and asked again, I was told I needed a ticket - and it was full. (why was I not told before?) So instead of a 10TL bus, I had a 55 TL taxi - THANKS VERY MUCH!", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galati, Romania", "Title": "\u201cFriendly stuff\u201d", "Author": "ocghro", "ReviewID": "UR71307922", "Content": "Nice and friendly hotel.

The airconditioning in our room was broken and we had to go and buy a fan as it was about 10 degrees hotter in the room than outside. The bathroom was odd and small and any traveller who was large or infirm could not have used the bath/shower facility. The breakfast was inedible. No really inedible! There was a nasty syrupy orange juice having no relationship to a real orange. The milk for the cereal was left out in the warm room and would become more and more \"off\" as the morning wore on. There was cheap cake--at breakfast time and bicuits that looked very old and crumbly. There was a very unpleasant spam type meat that was wheeled out every day and became increasingly curl ed and off colour. The cooked choice tasted of powdered egg and so I tried that only once! We found that if anything ran out it was not replaced. The standard of cleanliness left a lot to be desired. Our room was borderline OK but the rest of the hotel, especially around the breakfast area was filthy. The fixtures and fittings were abysmal---cheap and falling apart with exposed wiring everywhere. There were damp stains on the ceiling and peeling wallpaper in our room--and everywhere else in the hotel. The photograph of the roof terrace must have been taken by a very inventive photographer. In actual fact it was a small area with a few tables and a view of the backs of buildings. A small view of the sea could be seen also. On leaving the room, the electricity would turn itself off, thereby defrosting the minibar and so we returned every time to puddles on the floor.

It was small but comfortable .. the bathroom also was small but nice and clean, had a shower, towels ..hair dryer. The AC was a godsend, perhaps it would have been better if it was more powerful .. but the fact that it was there after a long day of roasting in the sun was enough for us .. Room had free wireless internet which amazingly worked perfectly unlike in many other hotels where I stayed before .. Service was ok, a lady came to change the towels everyday .. she did not make the beds but maybe because we didnt ask her .. there was a DO NOT DISTURB sign, on the back of which was written 'PLEASE CLEAN MY ROOM' ... we didn't know this and so never put the sign up which perhaps she took to mean we didn't want her to clean ..! This did not bother us much though .. The reception staff were also nice, particularly the guy on the night shift who was extrememly helpful and friendly.. The location of the hotel was excellent .. this is where I was pleased we did not go for any other hotel .. whilst alot of other hotels were near the Sultanahmet area, this one was literally a 2 minute walk away from the Blue mosque, Haghia Sophia, Basilica Cistern and many resturants .. Topkapi Palace was 10-15 minutes away as well.. Couple of problems: walls in the room are pretty thin .. you could hear the phone ringing in the room next door, that was slightly annoying .. and the bathtub may prove potentially problamatic to get in and out of for some .. it's actually quite tricky, tub's pretty high and in the shape of 2 steps .. hard to explain but yes .. that wasn't pleasent .. got used to it though .. maybe an issue if you are old or have back problems ..
