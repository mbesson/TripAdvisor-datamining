However, there was lots of storage, the beds were comfortable, and the room was cool and dark for good sleeping after a long hot day. The location was not bad - quite a walk up to north Duval and the harbor, so hesitated to do it more than once a day. Tended to stay close to the hotel for either the first half or second half of the day rather make the trek multiple times.

It's one of the best deals you can get for your $ in Key West. I looked into a lot of resorts to stay in and they were either too far away from Duval Street or had hidden fees. This hotel is directly on Duval street which made it super convenient that we could walk everywhere for dinner, the bars, or events such as jet skiing that we did. Also no fee for parking, wi fi, or any resort daily fee...most all the other resorts had these fees. We paid $260 a night for a balcony king size bed room and it was a beautiful room. It was very clean...the hotel does a fabulous job with keeping it updated and worked on. My favorite part of this hotel was actually the bar by the pool...the Shores Pineapple Bar...for a few different reasons. One being that the bartenders there are excellent. They are so friendly and make you feel right at home. They make fabulous drinks and the chairs are comfortable. I liked this bar alot too because it's nice and quiet. We were there every day and there were only a few people there at a time. If the beach is more your style do not fear! Their other hotel is right across the street called the southernmost on the beach and you can use everything there too..the beach and the beach cafe. I personally preferred hanging out at the pineapple bar at the southernmost hotel because the beach and cafe at the southermost on the beach was always alot more crowded.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toms River, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cSouthernmost Gift Shop\u201d", "Author": "Stephanie D", "ReviewID": "UR126037163", "Content": "The Southernmost Gift Shop on the property of the Southernmost Hotel was delightful.

Our room 296 had recently been renovated and was fabulous. The color palette was navy, white, blues, and browns so it incorporated the blues of the sea without being overly \"beachy\". Storage was great, plenty of hanging space as well as drawer space. There are even drawers in the bathroom and plenty of counter space. Nice toiletries and a real hair dryer - not one of those crappy wall-mounted things. The bed was a little soft for our taste but the linens were nice. There is also a mini fridge and coffee maker as well as free coffee in the lobby. The balcony has two chairs and a small table. I can't say enough about how well planned this room was, I appreciated the attention to details. You have access to the pool and beach area of Southernmost on the Beach also. We spent one afternoon at their pool where they had chair side beverage and food service. The Pineapple Bar at the Southernmost Hotel pool was good but you had to go to the bar for service. There is also a pier with chairs. We went there one evening to view the sunset. Unfortunately, cell towers and satellite dishes installed on the point beyond the southern most point in the US marker really spoils the view but we thought it was better than the circus at Mallory Square. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 12:30 but the front desk gave us coupons for cocktails and offered to store the luggage which wasn't necessary since we had a car. That was another reason I chose this hotel - free parking and WiFi and beach chairs with no resort fee. We went to the Pineapple Bar to enjoy our free cocktails then walked down to the cafe for lunch. The food and service at the cafe were both fine, but nothing exceptional. Best part of eating there is the convenient location and the view. Alan the concierge was great with restaurant recommendations and booking a sunset sail on the America 2.0. We had originally booked 3 days. On our last day we had a change of plans and requested an additional day. The desk clerk said they were fully booked but to check back in the morning. When we did they were able to accommodate our request and we stayed in our same room. We did not book any spa services so I can't comment on that. All of the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the location since you have access to the beach and you can still walk to everything on Duvall, however it is quite a hike all the way to Mallory Square. We also rented bikes and enjoyed riding around town during the day. Parking a car around town is not always easy.

The Southernmost was located on a very small beach but after touring the island we came to appreciate the location greatly as there was very little beach to come by anywhere. The room was cramped but sufficient for the 2 of us. The property had a definite quaint island feel to it, not glamorous but comfortable. I would have to say that they could stand to pay a little more attention to detail, for example our bathroom lightbulb was burnt out for our entire stay. It was annoying and it made me wonder what other things they let go. But again, the location was prime because we were at the quiet end of Duvall St. yet still in walking or riding distance to most everything. (Word to the wise, take a comfortable pair of shoes and rent a bike.) We rented bikes for the week and rode everywhere. Our favorite breakfast spot was Camille's. It was a very short walk from the hotel. Our favorite lunch spot, La Ti Da's, was also a short walk. We had 2 favorite dinner spots, Michael's and Sweet Tea's. You will want to make reservations for Michael's in advance. Sweet Tea's isn't too far but Michael's is a bit further down Duvall. There is a restaurant located on the beach next to the hotel and it was just okay. We ate there once for dinner and once for breakfast, neither experience was good enough to keep us coming back even though it would have been most convenient. The famed sunset at the peir can be viewed just as well without all the crowds right from the Southernmost point next the hotel property. There are plenty of cheesy tours and such to participate in, which we did, and they passed the time but nothing too exciting. It was nice to get a feel for the history of the island and see the architecture though. We aren't big drinkers and that seemed to be what people really came for. I will say that I love to eat and there is no shortage of good food in Key West. One thing that was fun and different was the kayak sunset tour.

I landed right on my a$$, and that was before I started drinking! I also saw another guy slip that day. As for the room, it was kind of tiny and the bathroom door precariously opens into the room and got in the way! The door should open into the bathroom or install a pocket door. Also, the shower curtain was hung too far into the tub and stuck to you while trying to shower. YUCK! They need one of those curved shower curtain rods to give you more space in the shower. The bathroom was a nice size! These are just very minor details; it did not affect our stay! We got a $20 voucher for breakfast at the Beach Caf\u00c3\u00a9. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 was very good; we ate there a few times. The first night we walked all the way up to Mallory Square to watch the sunset activities. It was a nice stroll. We ate at DJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Clam shack on the way back.

After we arrived to Miami and open our lagguage we realised that all our clothes were wet and mould stinky from that room!!!! Disgusting!!! And the worst thing was the carpet itself.

I washed my feet and try it again, if Im not dreaming!!!!! And it was the same: disgusting! Anyway, hotel has good location.

The hotel staff on the beach were also very attentive with lounge chairs, umbrellas, and frozen towel logs (little washcloth sized towels rolled up and frozen to help you beat the Key West heat). The hotel is on Duval St. but its at the opposite end of most of the \"action\" - which is good b/c you'll miss out on the late night bar crowds, but it is a bit of a walk to all of the other bars, cafes and restaurants. Parking is limited so giving up your spot to drive around the island is a risk. There are no elevators. We had a 3rd floor jr suite/apt and had to carry our suitcases up 3 flights of stairs, some very steep. The hotel staff was very pleasant and knowledgeable of local attractions and events. The hotel is a very easy walk to the Southernmost Point - highly recommend the photo op! Overall the only bad thing I could say about our experience was that it ended too quickly! I would definitely recommend it and hope to go back to Key West in the future.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Apple Valley, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place - Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "ilmwpkmd", "ReviewID": "UR122236671", "Content": "This was our first time to Key West, and we were absolutely thrilled with the Southernmost Hotel.

It was a great size room with a huge bed large 32inch tv - masses of storage space etc. It had a lovely little balcony with views towards the main entrance and fountain (I think a pool view would be nicer) There were some great touches in the room like the ipod dock and alarm clock and the BeeKind toiletries. There was plenty of lighting from lamps to main lights and a large air con unit along with mini sofa and coffee table. The bed was super comfy and super large! Whilst there was a queue at check in upon arrival they were expecting me and I spent less than 5 minutes at the desk before going to my room. The resort was clearly explained and those little touches again like the use of all the swimming pools and free sunbeds on the beach were excellent. The hotel is at the quieter end of Duval St but its nice to walk at night - if you don't feel like walking you could get those pedicabs/rickshaw things but for me they were very expensive! Southermost Point is literally a stones thorough away as is the beach. I was impressed by the pools and the staff around the pool but what impressed me even more was that they had a live acoustic act each day by the pool. this is a fantastic idea for any hotel. It beats playing cheesy music from the bar. normally I listen to my ipod all day whilst sunbathing but not at the Southernmost they had two different guys whilst I was there and both played excellent relaxing chill out music.

The last time I was at this location was 2003. However, I feel confident that nothing has changed since my last visit except to improve. I first encountered this motel in 1992 before they had \"taken over\" the southermost real estate property in America. They now have properties all around the original motel. It was love at first sight. In 91-92, I lived on my boat in the Keys but not in Key West, and needed a place to stay in Key West for a weekend away from my boat. What struck me was walking into their lobby with all the tropical foliage outside and the double doors which where wide open, with a ceiling fan above making lazy circles. I expected Bogey and Bacall to be sitting outside the lobby by the pool having a drink. I lived/loved the 50's and I thought I had stepped through a time warp and this is how it must have been. They have done extensive updates to their rooms since those wonderful \"old days\". I have been back several times, the last time was in 2003. I highly recommend this property and although I've never stayed in any of their other locations, I'm sure they are just as well run. I would never stay in them because I love the original location. The Keys are a trip away from America as most of us know it. They have (maybe) 2 Walmarts (probably more now) and very few chain fast food. If you have never been to the Keys, I suppose Key West is the place to go. I loved it there and hope to return someday. However, depending on your wants/needs, there are many other places with an entirely different atmosphere (such as Islamarado and Big Pine Key). Islamarodo for avid fishermen and Big Pine Key for people looking for remote isolation. The Keys and the Southermost motel are a perfect match.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orion", "Title": "\u201cVacation at Key West\u201d", "Author": "Denise B", "ReviewID": "UR120384456", "Content": "Overall, I found this to be a very good hotel.

We chose this hotel because it is one of only few hotels in the Keys that have a beach or beach access. Another couple traveled with us, and since they are from NY, having beach access was important. We reserved a room with a queen bed and it was located on the second floor of the hotel. We were lucky that the room was second to the end of the walkway and faced the Southernmost Hotel on the Beach. We felt the room was a great value since it was newly renovated and was very modern, compared to our friends who chose a room with a king size bed, that was not yet renovated and had a balcony. We stayed for 3 days and had a great time. We spent most of our time at the pool at the Southernmost on the Beach. The atmosphere was great! There was live music, the bar served great finger food, excellent frozen drinks and you could walk just a few steps to the beach. The crowd was a mixture of a few families, luckily with really well behaved kids :), young couples, retirees and some foreigners. We booked the jet ski tour through the hotel because they actully had the best deal after comparing the vendors in town. We took a 4pm tour that lasted 1:45! It was great. Since it was later in the day, we did not burn and were joined by 8 other vacationers in the group. the tour left from The Reach Resort, which is the next hotel over and only a 2 minute walk. We rented a two seater and were led by 2 guides, one at the front and one in the back. We went around the whole island of Key West stopping at a few places as the guides explained what some of the sites were and their place in Key West history. We were at the front since we like to go a bit faster than most and since there were 2 guides, we did not have to stop and wait for those that wanted to go a bit slower. Once we got to the west side of the island, we were allowed to free roam for 1/2 hour which was awesome! As far as the food in Key West, one place stood out; Sara Beth's. It is set inside a traditional Key West house and offers some of the best breakfast food we have ever had. I would recommend the fat and fluffy french toast, porridge and pumpkin muffin. Dinner choices are great all around town and offer a wide variety of menu items and price ranges. If you love seafood, you will have plenty to chose from.

It is a bit expensive, but I think it's worth it. The location is great if you're trying not to be in the middle of all the action on Duval. I'm pregnant, so this was perfect for me...we could walk to everything but weren't overwhelmed by the crowd and noise and drunk people all over. We were debating between this hotel and a few others on Duval, and I'm so glad we chose this...it was soooo clean! I feel like the other places are sort of older and musty. A lot of reviews from the other hotels complained of old furniture. I know they have recently renovated Southernmost, so we must have gotten a renovated room because everything pretty much looked clean and new. They upgraded us to a King Superior room that overlooked the pool at a discounted price. I wish we got the upgrade for free, but the discount was fine. The hotel is literally like a minute walk to Southernmost Beach hotel, so we pretty much went there everyday. The pool area at the Beach hotel is much bigger, and they have a live band that played that was really good and made it more lively. It's hard to get chairs with an umbrella though if you don't go early. I would say to stay at this hotel and not pay the price of the beach hotel since it's literally across the street. We didn't eat at the hotel at all, so I can't comment on the food. The service was great and everyone was super friendly (especially compared to Miami, where we went next)!! We got a nice little box of chocolates with a card on our bed for our anniversary. I only gave it 4 stars because the beach is a little misleading. Southermost beach hotel has it's own \"private beach\" which is just some sand in a very small area, then a pier with a ladder you walk down that takes you to the water. So it's not really a true beach. There is a public beach right next door which they help maintain, and have a beach cafe on. That beach is very sea-weedy and also pretty small. It would have been so much better if they just cleaned up the sea-weed daily. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it would have helped. Esp for such a small beach. After seeing that, we just stuck with the pool and waited till we got to Miami for our beach time. I heard the beach cafe has a good happy hour, but we didn't partake.

We started in Orlando at the theme parks then drove down the cost stopping at Sarasota, Naples, Fort Myers, Homestead etc. we never booked any hotels and just turned up at hotels and motels en-route. Of the entire trip we had a wonderfull time and met some lovely people and when we arrived in Key West during ladys week it was a welcome stop for 4 days of bliss. Ill start with the Hotel. we hadnt booked a room and turned up and spoke to very helpfull staff we asked to see a room and based on this decided to stay for the 3 nights we were at Key West. The reception staff were great as were the bar staff. we didnt spend a great deal of time at the pool but when we were there the pool staff were also very nice with entertainment laid on including wine and beer tasting which was fun. One thing to note is we stayed in the Southernmost but across the road are the rooms for the Southernmost on the beach, its all the same hotel and you use all the same facilities. As far as location goes it was good, your on the far end of Duval Street which is the opposite end to Mallory Square where the sunset party is so its a fair walk. We always found this to be quite nice and after dinner the walk back to the hotel was welcome to let it all go down and then you get to stop at numerous bars and shops on the way back. But if you have a problem walking or suffer with long walks then please bear that in mind as you may want to get a cab. The hotel was the most expensive of the trip but then we did end up being in key west during ladies week over the weekend so had to pay the weekend rates. We also asked the concierge lady to help us with booking our trips and she was great very friendly helpfull and knowledgeable so well worth asking. We did the Jet ski trip which left the beach at the hotel next door and this was absolutely amazing over an hour of Jet ski fun riding the waves around key west. we were lucky we saw some dolphins so keep your eyes open. We then had a very special trip where we got engaged. this was the Dolphin Safari. captain Gary was great and got us very close to two pods of dolphins where we could see them swimming beside the boat. If you do this trip i would recommend the sunset trip as not only do you get and excellant couple of hours on the water (hopefully see some dolphins) and do some snorkelling but you also get to watch the sunset from the ocean and see the entertainers at Mallory square. I cannot recommend this trip highly enough there were only 4 other people on the boat and its very personal and was worth every penny. The only trip we were dissapointed with was the ghost walk. it was more like a long walk with someone telling old wives tales and shouting \"your doomed\" at everyone. you are not allowed into the supposed haunted locations anymore so you end up just standing around outside. Dissapointing We cant fault key west and loved every minute of our stay from the drive down seeing the iguannas to a lovely hotel. We would definately go back to key west and the Southern most hotel. One thing to note is that there is not alot of beach space around key west and most of the activity is on the water, We also stayed at Key Largo for a night but wished we had just kept going and had the extra night at key west or maybe Marathon.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Key West\u201d", "Author": "rcaton", "ReviewID": "UR106959772", "Content": "Absolutely the BEST in Key West.

The room had a fridge, microwave and coffee machine. You have access to two beaches, 3 pools and a beachside cafe at Southermost and I couldn't fault any of them. The beachside Cafe was great and very reasonable, so we used to go there most days for breakfast as well as happy hour. Happy hour was between 4 - 7 and included wine, draft beer and rum runners all for $3. We used to stick with the beer because the rum runners were too strong for us! They also had some appertizers on offer and thay were nice. We liked the land and sea grill the best. We used to spend most of our days by the main pool or on the public beach near the cafe.

Good thing to do if u are gonna be there for a few days is....rent a bike!!!, they are so cheap and is the easiest way to go all the way around the isle, and you don't even have to worry about the parking, you can park it anywhere!....another thing which was very convenient was that Southermost Hotel offers you storage luggage, we were departing @ 7 pm, we check out @ 11 am, and thanks to this service we enjoyed the rest of the afternoon having fun at the pool!!!! Beautiful Hotel, Beautiful Key West!!!!! We are going to miss Key West!!!!!

I tried to include all the information I had trouble gathering on my own before the trip. The Southernmost Hotel is part of a group of 4 facilities that form an \"L\" shape at the southernmost tip of Key West. The Southernmost Hotel (aka SMH for this review) is at the top of the \"L\", La Mer Hotel and the Dewey House are directly \"below\" and across the street from it, the Southernmost Beach Cafe is at the corner of the \"L\" overlooking their private beach and pier, and Southernmost On The Beach forms the short end of the \"L\" with its own pool, tiki bar, and hammocks. Staying at any of the facilities allows you access to all four resorts' amenities. There are other hotels and B&B's in the area with \"Southernmost\" in the name, but these four properties are all owned by the one group. We stayed 3 nights at SMH in one of the penthouse rooms on the 3rd floor, room 332, in late September. The main pool and tiki bar at SMH were under construction (lots of construction goes on in Key West in September, apparently) but there is an additional pool at SMH for guests to use, not to mention the pool at Southernmost On The Beach. We called the 800 number to the resort to book our reservation, which I HIGHLY recommend-- due to the construction, they were offering all of their rooms at $99/night. This offer was not available on any website I checked, including their own. It is only available via phone. I advised the reservations person that we would be getting married during our stay and he made a special note in our reservation to ensure we got a penthouse room. Now, onto the room details. The room itself was very spacious with vaulted ceilings and a ceiling fan. The decor was warm, uncluttered, and airy, and we felt at home right away. The king-size bed was comfortable, but the pillows were flat and lumpy; in fact, the pillows were the only thing in the room that appeared to be old and in need of replacement. Armed with how-to information from the internet, I carefully checked the room for bed bugs (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ignore the media scare on this one, right?) and it was squeaky clean. Opposite the bed was a multi-use storage unit that held a decent-sized mini fridge, a small microwave, coffee pot, and ice bucket on the left-hand side; a large flat-panel TV, several drawers, and a safe in the middle portion; and a closet with an ironing board/iron in the right-hand side. The best part about the storage unit was the safe, which was in place of one of the drawers. I loved the easy access\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno bending awkwardly into a dark closet to type in a code, and it was easy to see into (especially useful when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re leaving and you want to make sure the safe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empty). The worst part about the storage unit were the doors\u00e2\u20ac\u201dif you pushed them shut, they slammed loudly, so you had to carefully close them each time. Available electrical outlets around the room were a bit scarce, and we ended up charging one of our phones in the bathroom. The tile floor was chilly, of course, but the bed was on an area rug so you could put socks on before braving the tile. The far wall was largely taken up by french doors which opened onto a great balcony. The balcony was maybe 6'x12', furnished with a lounge chair, two regular chairs, and a table, and seemed very secluded due to the mostly solid fencing around it. It did overlook the parking lot, but you could also see into the pool, and if you looked off to the far right, you could see the water. A large palm tree waving in the breeze right beside the balcony added to the secluded feeling and ambiance. We spent some portion of every evening on the balcony, sitting in the chairs and bathing in the moonlight. It was wonderful. The bathroom (and the room, for that matter), were painted a warm yellow. The bathroom was well-designed and easy for the two of us to get ready in simultaneously (granted we are both pretty low-maintenance). I loved the shelving on either side of the mirror; it really kept the counter from getting cluttered. The granite countertop was pretty and functional. The handles on the faucet were odd, and at first I kept turning the cold water on full-blast when I meant to turn it off, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. The walk-in shower was very spacious and easily fit two people without crowding. The handle to adjust the water was in an awkward spot, and it was difficult to adjust it to get just the right temperature, but the rainshower-style showerhead was great. The worst thing about the bathroom was that the main light switch turned on both the overhead light and a fan, which was really loud. If I was in the bathroom by myself with the door open and my husband was trying to talk to me from the room, I could not hear him over the fan. The best part about the bathroom was the light in the shower (not attached to a fan, ironically), which doubled as a perfect nightlight with the door almost shut. One side note: If you are a bride getting ready for your wedding, there is no make-up mirror, there is only the mirror above the sink. The lighting is pretty good, and is not a fluorescent bulb, so you can actually feel good about how you look instead of the washed-out, wrinkle-highlighting, blue-tinged fluorescent glow you might get in another hotel, but if you want any up-close-and-personal mirror gazing, you might want to bring your own. There is also a full-length mirror in the main room. As to the hotel amenities and staff, we were very pleased with both. The front desk staff members were always extremely helpful and friendly, accommodating every request we made with a smile. The concierge (dark-haired very fit man with a great smile; I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember his name) was cheerful and offered lots of information on the area, providing a map and printouts of restaurant menus he recommended, and lots of coupons. The bartenders at the Southernmost Beach Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (John and Cindy I think?) were attentive and conversational, and did a great job keeping up with the happy hour customers. Be sure to take advantage of the happy hour there. The drink prices are great, and the appetizer prices are decent, although the portions are small. If you go for the grillers, take the food off the skewers before you grill it or the skewers will catch on fire. Also, they apparently have a featured beer each day which is even cheaper than the happy hour prices ($2 for a beer is awesome), so check that out too. We ate at the Beach Caf\u00c3\u00a9 for breakfast once also; the food was good but the view of the beach and water were great. Speaking of the beach, all the beaches in Key West have a seaweed problem and have to be groomed periodically to remove what the waves deposit there (its mucky and it stinks). Southernmost has a person who takes care of this a couple times throughout the day; he also stacks/unstacks chairs and little side tables, hands out popsicles, and helps move the umbrellas when the sun shifts (you have to rent umbrellas; they are $5 and worth it). Chair usage for hotel guests is free, and you can get beach towels from the front desk of your hotel. If you are looking for a venue to get married in, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend their beach, as it is small and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blah looking barrier wall that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d likely have in the background of your photos. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard their fountain area is pretty for weddings, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t personally see it. We got married on Smathers Beach, which is a public beach. No fees are required to use it, and I thought it was much prettier. Our ceremony was at 6pm and we were practically the only ones out there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the opposite side of the island from the setting sun, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a sunset wedding, you might want to check other venues out, closer to the Mallory Square side. Having said that, our ceremony was early enough in the evening that there was still good light for pictures, and after the vows were exchanged, we went to the other side of the island and watched the sunset over dinner and drinks. I thought I wanted a sunset wedding, but what we did actually turned out better. On a side note, Key West Weddings To Go did a great job on our elopement ceremony and photographs, and Key West Cakes whipped up some amazing cupcakes (vegan even\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey easily accommodated our dairy allergy) for our wedding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I highly recommend both companies; even if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not getting married, stop by Key West Cakes and have some dessert!

Waited for 3 weeks for someone to respond to our written remarks on the hotel's comment cards (the hotel advertises it takes all guest comments very seriously) before sending an in depth email to again address how rudely we were treated. Again, no effort at all from this hotel. All this despite continued verbal assertions that our experience was important to the hotel (from the aforementioned manager, Elizabeth). The property grounds are nice, but when combined with the egregious attitude of \"you are lucky to be our guest\" and the DEMONSTRATED lack of concern for the guests' experience, this hotel is way overpriced and not deserving of the rating it seems to enjoy. We consulted numerous travel sites and decided on Southernmost based on the reviews we read. Accordingly, we felt it was absolutely essential to address this hotel group's commitment to lip service, lack of customer appreciation and dismal business attitude in the very same hotel review channels that helped influence our decision. I absolutely would not recommend this hotel group and consider our stay at a Southernmost property in July the ONLY blemish on an otherwise wonderful weekend.

While this review is mostly about the hotel, but I'll throw in a miscellaneous section at the end. (p.s. this is a comprehensive/long review...) Intro: My wife and I spent four days/three nights in KW. It was our first trip to Key West. We drove to KW from the Naples-area (only five hours), so we had a car available for use during our visit. Our trip was mostly rained out as we only had one day of sunshine.. Quick tangent: we stopped in Key Largo for lunch. There's a place called Bayside Grille that was delicious. Check-in/out: A very smooth, quick check-in process. I booked our room through Orbitz so everything was paid for upon arrival. Check-out was equally seamless. Strangely enough, the staff at the front desk were arguably more helpful than the concierge... 10/10. Concierge(s): Don't get me wrong - the concierge(s) were helpful and well-armed with information, coupons (make sure to ask for any & all coupons!!!), and maps, but my wife and I were thrown off by the concierge's attempt to get us to rent bikes and sign up for other activities fully knowing that the weather forecast for the next two days included rain & T-storms... Again, it's worth a 10-15 minute stop to pick up a handful of coupons for exhibits and bars. 7.5/10. The Room: We booked a room with a king-sized bed. We got a room with a king-sized bed. The layout was somewhat strange with the over-sized bathroom door. I'm not sure what the double-bed room looks like, but I would only recommend this room for two... Nice high ceilings and plenty of storage for clothing, shoes, etc. The safe is in one floor-to-ceiling closet and the microwave & fridge were in the other closet. The bed was pretty comfortable. The TV was an older model tube-TV... sufficient as we weren't expecting an HD flat-screen... The only notable con in the room was the lack of water pressure in the shower. Made it tough to feel clean with combined with the soft Florida water... 8.5/10. Location/Amenities: Awesome. Since the hotel is located on the opposite end of Mallory Street and the loud/late and well-trafficked night-life, you get a nice quiet hotel to sleep at. Additionally, you get access to one of the few beaches in KW. Unfortunately, we didn't get to enjoy it because of the rain. The hotel also offers three separate pools: one at the Southernmost Hotel (smallest w/Tiki Bar), one at the Southernmost on the Beach (largest, most lively, nice breeze off the ocean), and one isolated in the middle between parking lots/off the street (mid-sized, quiet).. The pool and pool bars were enjoyable and there was plenty of seating for us... I assume seating gets tight and really busy during non-summer months. The walk down to Mallory Square took about 25 minutes which felt longer in the rain. 9.5/10. Parking: There's limited parking, but there were sufficient parking spots available during our stay in early/mid-August. The half-witted individual who parked their truck and boat across 8-10 spots didn't do anyone any favors... Also, if you have a car and it's raining, DRIVE it. Parking on in KW is tight, but there are spots available especially near/around restaurants. 10/10. Other: > Hotel Spa: we got massages due to the rain. $50 each, but worth it while on vacation. > Attend Beer or Wine School. Free booze. Drink it. > They have complementary wireless internet. Use it. Your alternative is paying to use the business terminal at the Tiki Bar. > We had the most fun at Irish Kevin's.... Sloppy Joe's entertainment was hit or miss.... Fat Tuesday was good for a few hurricanes... and if you're adventurous (and over 21), check out the rooftop of The Bull.... > Happy hour at the Southernmost Beach Cafe' & Alonzo's (1/2 price drinks and food). > Mallory Square: decent entertainment... The lack of the sunsets were the most disappointing. > We didn't have a bad meal anywhere... so we highly recommended: Camille's (french toast in Godiva white chocolate), Louie's Backyard (fish sandwich), Blue Heaven (anything with lobster), Rooftop Cafe (gnocchi & triple surf & turf pasta), Cafe Marquesa (mahi mahi), and the A&B Lobster Company (suft & turf). > Butterfly Conservatory: located next to the Hotel. It was a nice break from the rain... And one entry fee allows you back in for the rest of the day. > Hemingway House, Lighthouse: unless it's raining, the cover charge isn't really worth the stop in. We had few alternatives so we donated to the historic sites... Sorry if that was way too long... We really enjoyed our trip and would've wished for better weather but made the most of it even though we didn't get to see any sunsets....", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "south wales", "Title": "\u201cBrillant Location, great resort\u201d", "Author": "chs_wales", "ReviewID": "UR74858607", "Content": "great stay, 2 double beds in room, nice and big, lovely big bathroom. pool areas were great, although one of them was only avaliable for a private party, but it had a band and good music. we had use of the beach and pool at southernmost on the beach, 30 seconds across the road. 25-30min walk from top of Duval st where the main bars or a $7ish taxi journey each way. didnt try the food at the resort, although had lunch at banana cafe 2 mins walk from the hotel which was really gd and very busy. conceige gave us a great jet skiing deal around the island and let us use the hotel pool shower facilities afterwards even though we had chekced out. go to sloopy joes and ricks and irish kevins for good nightlife. 2 mins from southernmost point marker and definatly do some jet skiing!!", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "orlando, fl", "Title": "\u201cnot worth the money\u201d", "Author": "georgiOrlando_Fl", "ReviewID": "UR73855588", "Content": "property is huge, resembles a 3 story student apartment complex, only few of the rooms are near the beach, half of the property is across the street, city view means parking lot view, the standard rooms do a good job of making you stay out most of the time, there is no microwave, the frig is a joke, no a/c in the bathroom unless you keep the door open, for $200 a night you can do much better, try one of the inns", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermilion, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cA must stay!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "dheidelberg", "ReviewID": "UR72939045", "Content": "Southernmost has the ideal location for travelers.

If it wasn't for a few minor---very minor---glitches, our stay would have earned the every-so-rare perfect rating. Here's what they did RIGHT: - Location. Southernmost is on the \"quiet\" side of Duval Street, just one block away from the actual Southern Most Point marker. Besides its own cafe/restaurant and bars, many more are easily within walking distance. There are also several rental facilities close by. Private beach and a diving pier, combined with spectacular ocean views on their adjoining Southernmost on the Beach hotel, made the ocean experience convenient. - Helpful desk. Check in was fast and the facilities were well explained. - Nice pools. We visited all three on both properties. Two had bars and towel service, while the other was simply laid back and rarely had more than one or two groups using it. - Friendly mini beach. We were greeted by an upbeat and knowledgeable young man that was fulfilling his dream lifestyle, helping others enjoy the sand and stay cool. - Comfy beds with plenty of pillows and blankets. We slept way too long every night. - AC that works, but... (see below). - Nice shower room. Instead of a traditional bathtub, the room's design was updated with a roomy shower. ...but see below. - Plenty of activities. Swim, Spa, Scoot, Dive, Drink, whatever...we didn't have time to do everything. - First Aid readiness. One of our party had a small scrape, but the hotel was completely prepared and had them bandaged up in a minute. This was just another notch in their unwritten, unstated, \"no worries, no hassles\" policy. - Coupon for breakfast. Ran across a neat little freebie after a google. Complimentary Breakfast for Two...which paid for half of us one morning. Nice! - Breakfast at the beach cafe. Generous portions, huge pancakes, friendly staff. - Great 3-night discount. We landed a deal through AAA for 15% off their lowest rate. This made SMH a rather fair value. - Key West styling...what we expected, and it was *almost* perfectly executed. - Fast WiFi. - Spa...ahhh And, what they got WRONG: - Concierge didn't like it if you didn't buy what they were selling. The short story is: we wanted to know if they had a good rapport with the scooter rental place across the street, because they had the best deal in town. No---SMH did not. Instead, the concierge insisted on convincing me to use a company on the other side of the island at a considerably higher expense. After I declined and switched gears to restaurant recommendations, the person apparently became frustrated (I suppose they are on commission) and gave me names different from the suggestion I overheard from the person they advised just before me. That suggestion, Caroline's, ended up being the best meal we had on our entire stay. Perhaps SMH should review how a concierge is supposed to function instead of a 3rd party sales agent. \"What's best for the guest\" - Temporary pharoh ants. The bathroom had a few of these teensy critters running around in the middle of the floor. One stomp of the foot and we didn't see another bug for the rest of the stay. This didn't concern me so much, since we are also used to dealing with the same ants in our neck of the woods. They are next to impossible. - Beach needed smelly piles of seaweed removed...and they did this the morning we checked out. C'est la vie! - Expensive bar. Strawberry daq in a plastic cup $8, after tip $9. We found out about Key West's plastic cup policy at the end of our stay. I suppose if using plastic cups is the most environmentally sound way to reduce water and detergent use, so be it...but $8 for a machined slushie? Humbug! Gimme a tall glass with a a stick full of fruit, an umbrella, and a back-scratcher. - Ice is not everywhere..just one location on our property. Ye olde ice adventure is one trek that should never be taken, but if so, please point the way! - Shower leaked on floor next to toilet...found out the hard way ;) - Thin walls. We could hear conversations outside our door, loud spring-loaded cabinetry banging, and crowing roosters outside at 5am. - TVs. Our room was equipped with a wide-aspect TUBE screen that wasn't HD, nor had an HD signal. Worse, the aspect was set to stretch-o-vision to make the picture fit. Those of you that know about this stuff will agree that it's an infuriating no-no...on many levels. - Furniture.. The entertainment / closet center, while nice in style, took up too much room and had spring-loaded doors that were hard to close without slamming---something the folks on the other side of that wall were also having trouble learning. The dining/work table could also have been larger. - Limited parking. We luckily found a spot, but kept our car there for three nights out of fear. When nighttime came, if you didn't have a spot, your were out on the street. I wouldn't consider that too big of a deal until we saw some young girl lose control of her scooter and slam it into a brand new pickup truck. (she was okay, but the scooter wasn't) - AC had creaky moving airflow vent...but it sounded like an old wooden ship on the high seas, which put me right to sleep. Sure, there was much to nitpick, but Southernmost got most of the basics right and excelled at creating a relaxing stay for my family. Isn't that the bottom line? Only one person, out of the dozen or so I came in contact with, ran the opposite direction of what I would consider an excellent corporate culture and schema and, with some minor repairs and tweaks (which management is now fully aware), Southernmost will achieve perfection...at least in my book. ---Highly recommended and we would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommend!

It was quite as well for when we just wanted to relax. I also love the fact that the SMOB is a \"green\" facility. The toilets flush with a light option that conserves water. They also have a heavy flush if needed. The room was cleaned every morning with fresh linins on the bed and in the bathroom (if desired, if not they would conserve the towels keeping it \"green\"). The place was spotless when the cleaning service was finished. The balcony lent its self to the stunning views....we really did love this room. We stayed for 1 week with 47 other guests for my wedding. The staff was so friendly and went out of the way to ensure each and everyone of us was having a good time and they regularly checked to see if we needed anything at all! We had a great time during our stay (to say the least). The Song Writers festival was playing on the Thursday we arrived. They were set-up on the beach and played for hours. It was great. The pool bar was so relaxing and the bartenders were friendly and willing to make us whatever we wanted. My husband loved the bloody marry's. He order one every morning. It was like a meal in a cup (as he said). The food was wonderful. They brought us our order pool side, we didn't even need to leave our lounge chairs! The festival continued on Friday at the Southernmost pool, it was fun for all. If you didn't want to partake you could go to one of the other pools on the property to 'get away'. We wanted to be right in the mix and soak it all up, and so we did! Also at the pool was the activities director (we called the \"fun guy\") he was always inviting us to partake in games, corn hole, the newlywed game, and so on. My family and friends loved it! Saturday was the wedding. What can I say but breathtaking! Melissa the catering manager was amazing!! I can not say enough wonderful things about her. She was spot-on with every detail of my wedding and all the planning that went into it. She made it the most special day of our lives! Nothing at all went wrong (as you hear about other horror stories). I am from Buffalo New York and worked with Melissa via e-mail and many phone calls surrounding every detail. She made it so easy and was extremely accommodating with my every request. The entire event was picture perfect! The food was out of this world. We were able to customize the menu to our liking and our guests were blown away with how delicious everything was! Thank you Melissa from the bottem of our harts! The remainder of the say was all about relaxing! The hotel is located at the end of Duval street so it was walking distance to everything! The nightlife was just steps away and yet far enough away to be quite and relaxing if you wanted. We took full advantage of the fishing, boat tours, jet skiing, and snorkeling that were just steps away. We spent the days cocktailing, enjoying the fabulous views, sunning on the pier, and enjoying the perfect sand on the beach. I highly recommend this hotel to a wide verity of guests. In my party we had people who were single 25-35 who found many activities to partake in, couples who are 25-35, couples with small children 25-40, couples 40-65, and even my grandparents had a wonderful stay.

It was a package deal and we only had this hotel and a more expensive one to choose from. I researched it on this site and liked what I read. It was close to the Southermost point and on Duval St. All of the wedding activities were at the other end of town and I didn't mind walking at eating and shopping at different places for the first few days, I brought several pairs of sandals and sneakers and was careful to rotate as not to get blisters. The humidity and sun was a shock to our system. The temperature at home didn't prepare us for what was in store I bet it was close to 90 degrees with at least 65% humidity each day. We tried to stay out of the sun and stay cool- laying under the shade of coconut trees whenever possible - the air conditioner ran 24/7 in our room and the noise from that, blocked most of the traffic outside since our room faced the parking lot on United Street room 163. Pro- We liked the King bed, Con-pillows were way too fat and fluffy. Pro- We had a mini fridge and a seperate area were the air conditioner was were I could do my hair and put make up on Con-no exhaust fan in bathroom Con- beach was small and once in the water I had trouble keeping my footing - rocky I didn't bring water shoes. Pro- Beach chairs included for guests Con- $10.00 for umbrellas. Restuarant was pricey but dinner was good. The resort is not as nice as pictured on website and brochures - signs of wear and tear all over the place. Most of the help didn't speak english and didn't greet us. So if your going for the beach you'll slightly be disapointed, If you don't drive a car- be pre-pared for alot of walking several times a day in the sweltering heat.

Heather provided good drink and food service right to our lounge chairs, and Giselle was great with fresh towels and taking away empty cups and just making sure we were comfortable.

Overall lots of activity there, but a good place to unwind inbetween vacation activities.

The Southernmost hotel I think has the best combination of cost, location and amenities. Do upgrade to the pool room with a balcony. That upgrade is worth the cost. The La Mer Hotel & Dewey House are more like Bed and Breakfast type settings and do have some nice views, but again, not really the style of hotel I'm interested in and not worth the cost. Anyone staying on any of the locations can use the pools/chairs/towels anywhere on the property so why not go for the best value on your room? That's what we did and were very happy. This property is in fantastic location. Close to the action, but not too close.

The Southernmost does not have a restaurant but the Southernmost at the Beach has a lovely, beachfront cafe.

The pool area was busy but not noisy. The check-in was painless and last about 5 minutes. We drove down from Miami Beach along with some relatives. The relatives stayed at the Southermost on the Beach in an ocean front unit. For those famliar with Key West, Southernmost OTB is on the site of the old Atlantic Shores. Their unit (638) was awesome - huge bathroom, large flatscreen TV, and huge balcony. Parking for these units is under the building and great. I can't say enough great comments about the Southernmost OTB restaurant and bar. The breakfast was always quick and just as ordered. We had Corey for 3 out of the 4 mornings and he was great. At the bar, you'll love Cindy and Sara. They are just awesome, quick service, great sense of humor, and will give you good suggestions (no BULL) for other restaurants and bars on the island. We spent happy hour with them every day (1600-1900) and between the specials, the $3 rum runners, and the $3 appetizers, we always had a blast.

Great snorkeling on the beach if you go out near the piers (saw amberjack, permit, barracuda). Hotel room was nothing spectacular. Our first night there our neighbors in the room next to us decided to throw this wild party which kept us awake most of the night. Finally around 3:30 a.m. I called the front desk to complain and the immediately sent security to quiet these people down - which worked. So our first night we got little sleep. Woke up next morning in desperate need of coffee and there was the coffee maker but no coffee pot or filter holder. Asked maid for missing parts, she never came back. Parking is tight and crowded at times. Bartenders at Beach Cafe were a little rude - you can't order alcoholic drinks at bar and take them to lounge chairs on the beach - you have to sit at the bar and drink them. I saw several people get frustrated over this and just order cokes. Drinks at bar have little alcohol in them - overpriced. A/C in the room worked great but is loud. Bed was lopsided and uncomfortable. Lights in restroom would come on real dim sometimes then bright other times. I saw alot of people having problems with their door key cards. Pools crowded but I like the tiki bars at each. I'd pay extra to stay at Southermost on the Beach for the water view. We saved money staying at Southermost Hotel but I'd rather splurge and get beach views. The hotel staff was nice and printed out my boarding passes without complaint. I have to say they were really customer oriented and accomodating. Has to be a tough job dealing with crazy tourists day after day!

Even though the wedding was on a public beach close to the cafe, they were able to set it up so that we weren't interrupted and it truly felt like a very private and intimate ceremony both for us and our guests. The location was convenient because it was close enough to walk to the shopping and nightlife but far enough away to relax. The pools & tiki bar became a fantastic gathering place where our guests from both families spent a lot of time getting to know each other.

He did not seem to disturb the guests and we were comfortable having him there-even if he was the only kid in the pool area. The beauty of Southernmost is that you get access to the Southernmost on the Beach/Dewey House private beach area and beach cafe. It is across a fairly low-traffic street. The beach cafe is pretty good. We had both breakfast and lunch there several times. The staff was very friendly with good service. Note that Southernmost is building new hotels on the beach side. The construction was not loud enough to be heard at our hotel, however the guests at Southernmost at the Beach were NOT happy. Banging started at 8am, they were redoing the roof of the hotel-which resulted in the pool being closed with construction walls on one side. We looked at booking there, and I don't remember the construction being noted.

The AC was powerful and welcomed us back from many long, hot walks down Duval Street. This hotel has 2 swimming pools on the property and then you are also allowed to use the pool and beach across the street at the Southernmost at the Beach. Of course I guess anyone could use those since there is nobody around to actually check to see if you're a registered guest. The main pool at the Hotel has a nice Tiki Bar right there as well. Drinks there can be a little expensive and the pool area gets quite crowded. The pool across the street is a lot quieter and you can bring your own drinks!! (again, nobody really around to check on anything). This hotel is at the southern, quiet end of Duval Street, so it is a long walk to get to the other end where most of the action is. I personally don't have a problem with that, but if you're someone who has difficulty walking, or just doesn't like to, then you might want to rent a car, scooter, or electric car. There are some businesses located in the area though. Just up Duval is a Rum Bar (forget the name) and also La Te Da (if that's your thing). Around the corner is a nice Cuban convenience store that serves very good Cuban sandwiches for both breakfast and lunch. You're also a short walk from a CVS and also another deli and the Bottlecap Lounge. I love this hotel and will continue to stay here everytime I go to Key West until I get bored of it.

For a two-star hotel, the Southernmost met our expectations. Here's the breakdown... ROOM: Clean and fairly spacious. Plenty of room for three people and our luggage. A little bare-bones, with older shutter-style windows and tired decor. Our A/C was noisy, but functional, and that's what matters! All in all, a comfy place to crash after a long day. LOCATION: At the quiet end of Duval Street. It took us about 15-20 minutes to walk to Mallory Square at a sloooow pace. (It's easy to get distracted along the way.) A block from Southernmost Point and right across the street from the Butterfly Conservatory. Several good resturants within a few blocks. POOLS: Here's where this hotel beats a lot of similarly-priced options -- two pools on site and another next door. We only visited the main pool. Clean, clear, not overly chlorinated, cool enough for midday, but warm enough for a night swim. The hot tub is cloudy and a little too hot, especially if you're sunburned. The tiki bar by the main pool serves fantastic (and strong!) drinks. BEACH: Another bonus point for this hotel, since there's not a lot of beach on the island.

We liked the hotel then (except for our view, but made the best of it anyway). . . but what a difference 7 years makes! We have been back to Key West 2 times since our engagement, but stayed at the other end of the island. This time, since we were returning with our 3 year old daughter, we decided to return to the Southernmost for my birthday and our 5 year anniversary. We had a much better room this time, conveniently located right near the pool area (which was great for our daughter to run in and use the bathroom or grab a snack). The rooms were much nicer than our previous stay and the space and amenities (microwave, refrigerator, small private deck) were perfect for our little family! The room was also clean and tropical. It was great to be so close to the beach so we could search for shells in the early afternoon (after sight-seeing in the morning) and spend the rest of the day at the pool. It was a nice walk every night to dinner or the sunset pier, and my daughter loved all the sightseeing she could do on the way (geckos, roosters, people). The glass bottom boat is a must, especially with children -- our daughter told everyone about the shark and sea turtle she saw. For the woman who said Key West is no place for children... SHE WAS TOTALLY WRONG! You don't have to go to a bar to have fun. I don't know what she saw and did, but our daughter loved the trip and we had a great family vacation from our ride through the Keys from Miami (truly breath-taking) to our return home. The staff at the Southernmost hotel were very courteous and helpful. They assisted my husband in booking our glass bottom boat ride, and gave him lots of brochures so he could surprise me with a wonderful dinner (reservation) at La Trattoria for my birthday (where we ate for our 1 year anniversary). Our only complaints about the hotel: 1) We stayed here for 5 days, and the first 3 days the hot tub was not \"hot\" (but it was o.k. because my daughter was able to sit in there w/dad - she was scared of the \"big\" pool); 2) the space all around the pool is wood decking, and we along with many others, experienced some splinters while there and 3) The tile floors in the room, although very nice, were never quite clean, even after the maid swept them and were cold first thing in the morning! But hey, we weren't there to have clean feet, we were there to relax and enjoy, and we definitely did! We can't wait to go back to Key West!

It is located on the southern end of Duval street, the main touristic street in Key West, close to the Southernmost Point. There are 2 or 3 other hotels on the other side of the street (not Duval) that are Southernmost Hotels as well and guests might use all facitilities at all those places. Approaching the Southernmost Hotel it gives a pleasant outside in light coloured wood and with white windowframes, doors and many rooms have tiny balconies, a very southern stylish building. There are outside corridors and a lot of free parking for guests around the hotel.The lobby is a small place and if you pass through you enter the pool area. Besides the lobby is the concierge desk where you can get pool towels and book some snorkeling or diving adventures and get some information about Key West. All staff we were in contact with was extremely friendly and helpful, I have never encountered that anywhere before. We felt at home immediately and knew they would help us whatever we need. Front desk staff did explain us all about the Southernmost hotels and Key Wests attractions without us having asked for it. We got several maps. And we were allowed to check in shortly after 12 noon. Though we only had asked for permission to leave the car, the room had been ready waiting for us at this time. They have plenty of parking and the parking lots are surrounded by neatly gardened plants and trees. You will have to place a parking permit in your window. Southernmost hotel itself has a few buildings with 2 floors, surrounding 2 pools and a Tiki bar. Southernmost Beach hotel on the other side of the street has another pool and a pier as well as a sandy beach and restaurant. Our room was on 2nd floor, to be reached by stairs (no elevators). It was spacious for the two of us and we had a king bed. The room is nicely decorated with a wooden closet that does not fit in its brown colour to the rest of the furniture. The rest was more southern style furniture that looked like bamboo, in white and beige, as well as the closet and drawers were where the TV was hidden in. We got a fridge and in-room safe. The place looked very clean except the green colored carpet seemed to be old and worn and had stains. We had several lamps in room that gave bright light in the evening. Aircondition was not very noisy and cooled the room perfectly. We had a table and chairs, unfortunately with plastic seat covers. Looked and felt cheap. The bathroom was on the very tiny side, but all tiled. The sink was tiny too and had no counter so it was a bit of a problem to put all our toiletries there. Water pressure was good but they need to buy those modern shower heads. There were enough towels provided and very nice toiletries in decorative small bottles. Bathroom has a real window, and lamps brightended the room well in the night. The big problem for us was the bed, is was very uncomfortable, much to soft and probably old and uneven. We did not sleep much and did not sleep well. This beds will prevent me from staying here again unless they put new ones in. Whenever my hubby moved I felt like in a water bed swinging around. The second problem for me was that the walls are very thin. Some of our neighbours watched TV until the early morning and then got up before 6 and talked and shouted loudely. I had to use my ear plugs. You will get some noise from the surrounding street as well if you have a room facing street (but having a room facing poolside might be noisy as well, as long the pool is open). The pool in the courtyard was looking nice, there is a jacuzzi as well. Some of the pool chairs are looking really nice like big fish, are made from wood and are extremely uncomfortable. Most of the deckchairs are plastic ones. No covers, you have to sit on the towels. There is a lot of umbrellas for shade and the huge Tiki bar is right beside the main pool, you can have all kind of drinks there. There is no complimentary breakfast included in our room. But it is only 3 minutes walking distance to the next cafe where you can have breakfast. The wireless internet connection was too weak to work. Sometimes the laptop found connection but did loose it very quickly again. We could not use internet. Coffeemaker was missing a pot. There is ironing equpiment in the room as well as a hair dryer. It is about a mile to walk to Mallory Square on the other end of Duval street, which is a pleasant walk along the historic district with plenty of shops, restaurants and small hotels. You can even use the trolley or conch train or hop on a bicycle carriage. You can even rent your own bike or moped at the hotel, if you want. There is no good parking opportunity in the historic district, some metered parking on Duval, some expensive parking lots on the border of the historic district.

I couldn't have been happier with the hotel area, lots of gift shops around and walking distance to the southernmost point cone to Cuba, which may I say was not impresssed with .The hotel has a nice pool and a pretty atmosphere, the staff were all courteous. This Hotel also has a beautiful pool area and a beach real close. We stayed in a room with one queen bed. We had the smallest room I have ever seen or stayed in. One bed, dresser against the wall about a foot from the bed , a night stand, TV on a cart, a small round table and two chairs, a small closet & a bathroom. It was very difficult to manuver around the room. There is very limited space throughout the room and storage of suitcases was very poor. We did not want to leave 3 large suitcases in the car so we had to bring them in . I had to keep one on the side of the bed and step over & around it throughout our stay. The cleanliness was adequate. Financially it was a great deal at $119 a night for that area. We do not like bed & breakfast places so we would stay again , although would have to spend more for a larger room.", "Date": "September 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daytona Beach", "Title": "\u201cExpectations not met\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3778458", "Content": "The Southernmost Hotel definitely fits the setting of Key West, but they need to step up the service a notch! The consierge was never behind the counter, in fact he was no where to be found the entire time we stayed there. We actually had to sign in for towels and then had to get them ourselves, because there was NO consierge! The beds in the room were to short, our feet hung off the end and we are only 5ft 3\". The toilet was always broken and would not flush. There was no \"No Disturb\" sign, which really was no big deal since the housekeeper never really bothered us. They say there is a beach, but it is pretty discusting and smells like dead fish, not much of a beach that were use to being from Daytona. Also, the pool closes at 11pm and there is a guard who makes sure you do not going in the pool after hours, how LAME is that! Your free drinks that you get at check in is weak and they won't let you bring any other drinks by the pool, they have to be from their bar.....if you on vacation why do you feel like you have to follow all these rules! Anyway, not exactly what I expected. Get a place closer to Mallory Square, it is hot there.", "Date": "August 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "McLean", "Title": "\u201cDelightful place\u201d", "Author": "Jesimic", "ReviewID": "UR3693599", "Content": "A friend visiting from Germany and I stayed there for 2 nights in April 2005 on our first visit to Key West and we had a wonderful time. The rooms are big, comfortable, and very well appointed with a modern twist. The place is very quiet. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast can be taken right on the beach and there are lounge chairs on a private pier to enjoy the Ocean. Duval street is close enough for convenience and far enough for quietness.

We had a first floor double queen with micro/fridge/patio that seemed to be newly decorated. The shower did have low water pressure but that is to be expected on these islands. I've had worse. The hotel staff was very friendly and personal. The tiki bar was very convenient and fun. Guests were very friendly also. Found a great restaurant minutes away in the courtyard area call New York Pizza Cafe. Excellent italian food with moderate prices. We were only supposed to stay 2 nights but were having such a blast we decident to stay another. Only drawback was Hurricaine Dennis decided to make an appearance so the tourists had to leave a 2pm. Better safe than sorry. The only negative is if we were going to stay another night we had to transfer to another room with no balcony fridge or microwave. We didn't see the room but all rooms are non smoking and being a smoker it would have been inconvenient without the balcony or patio area. I would stay here again.", "Date": "July 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiener Neustadt, Austria", "Title": "\u201cgreat time at Southernmost Motel\u201d", "Author": "Sunflower76", "ReviewID": "UR3681924", "Content": "Key West was number 3 on our trip through Florida and we were a bit tired of changing the hotels all the time but the stuff of Southernmost Motel was really nice and whenever we asked we got pretty much information. I cannot agree to the former tripadvisor who said that he got no information, we got the most in Key West (and in total we have been to 6 hotels). The main pool was not so nice for us but they had another pool in the area which was as big is the main pool was but much quieter and nicer. You also were able to use the pool from Southernmost on the Beach and also the beach there but the beach was not very nice with much dirt swimming in the water, so we didn\u00c2\u00b4t go there. Parking is free, so is internet at the Tiki Bar. The ventilator is a bit loud, you can rent a fridge for 5,-- dollars / night. You can also rent bikes. Southernmost Point is just around the corner, to Mallory Square it is a 30 minutes walk and 10 minutes to Ernest Hemingway\u00c2\u00b4s house.
