After the first night we headed out on day just going to do tourist related stuff. But before we left, we managed to set the do not disturb sign which was provided by the hotel on the outside door handle. I managed to forget my cell phone behind because of all the other stuff we wanted to carry (water, camera, money etc.). So as we came back to the room, we notice our only room key was for some reason deactivated. Once we got it reactivated and eventually went into the room, we noticed the bed was done and the bathroom was restocked. Not only that, my cell phone went missing. We reported it to the front desk and they put very little effort on resolving the issue. The weird thing is, we spoke directly to the female housekeeper that cleaned our room the following day and she said that the manager had told her to clean our room even though she was quite aware that the do not disturb sign was clearly posted in front of the room. It was absolutely hard to even get a hold of the manager and had no sympathy for our lost when we did speak with him. May I also mention that another guest just a couple of doors down over heard our conversation with the housekeeper and spoke with us moments after about getting something stolen from her room. She said that she had 200 pesos taken from her room. If you really wanted to take the risk on staying at this hotel room because of its affordability, make good use of the safe. But to be honest, a cheap hotel room does not outweigh the cost of losing something personal and having your privacy invaded. If you were my friend I would say to look for another place. Its not worth the stress. Its better to have a peace of mind when enjoying such an amazing city. Plus another thing, we did not have running hot water on our second day there till later in the evening. There only solution front desk suggested was to let the water run, which did not do a thing. They also need to repair the cracked tub and sink in the room where we stayed in.
