On the front door it stated it was the Hotel Amsterdam, but we soon found out the actual hotel was a little further down the walk. The door we tried to open turned out to be an old office/storeroom area. I suggested they put an arrow on this door to show where the actual hotel was so tourists like us and others we saw didn't get confused. When we arrived the hotel was putting in a new boiler and they told us it would be a couple hours before we had hot water. But unfortunately, that was not true and we were not able to take a hot shower until the following day. Initially our room was to be on the 2nd floor overlooking the canal but when my husband opened the door it was already occupied! We were given another room on the 3rd floor which was clean and everything decorated in RED. (We were compensated for our room mix-up by getting the 2nd day's breakfast for free.) The room was large enough with wood flooring, a king size bed and another single bed, a wardrober, free internet, a TV, desk, chair, 2 nightstands one on each side of the bed, and 2 big windows that overlooked the canal. The bathroom was long and narrow but clean. The shower was great once we had hot water. There is an elevator (lift) which was somewhat scary to go into (at least for me) as it was old and small, and I was afraid of getting stuck in it (we never did). So I took the narrow, curvy staircase up to our room instead. This hotel is rather old and could use a face lift and updated furnishings but it had a somewhat homey feel to it. Breakfast was free your first day and after that it cost 10 euros. After our 2 days free we went elsewhere to eat as we didn't feel it was worth the money. It was mainly a continental style breakfast with pastries and cereals but you could make your own eggs if you wanted to. with fresh coffee and assorted teas. The staff manning the desk were very nice, friendly and very accommodating. The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance to the city center. On our last night we asked the staff to get us a taxi for our early departure and one was waiting for us. We could not have been happier. So overall it was a nice stay with a few quirks but in a good location.

We turned up on the doorstep to book our room, having left our previous (and supposedly more up-market) hotel after a disappointing experience, and we were able to take the last remaining room for the rest of our stay. As the name suggests, the hotel is very homely, and stylish in a casual, informal sort of way. The room was small but full of character and had a lovely view of the canal. The decoration is a little worn-out in places, and the shower-room floor was not very clean (take your flip-flops) - otherwise I would give this hotel five stars. The breakfast is excellent and very comprehensive - it was free on the first day and 10 euros after that. You can even cook your own eggs to just the way you like them! The staff are very friendly and helpful and genuinely ensure you have a good stay. There was a little noise from the street at night, but given that this is on the route between the Rembrandtplein and the red light district then I guess this is just to be expected on a Saturday night. My only concern is that a little maintenance will be needed to stop the decor deteriorating over time, and my only regret is that we couldn't stay there longer. I have stayed in many business hotels in Amsterdam but this little place is much nicer and an antidote to the corporate glitz of the big hotel chains.

The location is very central but situated off the main thoroughfare just enough not to have too much street and canal noise.

It's like busting into your own room, which may be slightly amusing. The view of the canal from the upper floor we stayed in was rather picturesque. The room however could use some redecoration/maintenance and a really good cleaning, particularly the bathroom, which in our room was a narrow little wet room. (Who thought a tiled swamp was a good idea?) It was gross enough that we both bought pairs of novelty flip flops so we never had to put our bare feet on the carpet or the dingy tile floor.

We usually stay in the Eden, Rembrandt Square and I'd misjudged the map reference for the Eureka and it's actually nearer the square than I'd thought. Somehow I'd also mislaid the street name, so it was difficult to locate, but other hotels were keen to advise us and sent us in the right direction with our hotel marked out on a map! Anyhow, 'Eureka. we found it' at last and were given a lovely warm welcome by Will, who is typically Dutch - naturally friendly and helpful. Like others here have said, we were given vouchers for a free breakfast the next morning, then signed in, had a chat with Will and then got the funny little lift to our room, number 45 on the top floor. I had read the reviews on TA and was a bit apprehensive after reading how small some of the rooms were. I aleady knew we didn't have a canalside view, because we'd booked with Expedia and it cost more to have a front view, which we never went for due to the added cost. My partner was immediately disappointed at the tiny size of the room and spent much of the weekend wishing we'd gone to the Eden again. But I enjoyed it and he had to agree it was a great location at least. The room was quite small, just enough room to walk each side of the bed and a bit more space at the foot of it to enter the shower/toilet room. But it was very warm and homely, freshly painted in white with warm red furnishings and had everything necessary. The bed was clean and comfortable, there was a TV, DVD player (with free use of internet, DVDs and books from downstairs), and more importantly for me - a radio! The washroom had a toilet, basin, new looking shower space (like a small walk-in wet room, but no bath in room 45) and had a hair dryer, shower gel, soap, lots of fresh white towels and mirrors. The bedroom had a small corner table, tea and coffee making facilities, a safe, small wardrobe, extra blanket, phone, chair, window blinds and curtains, wall lamps, radiator (we were cosily warm all night) and clean pillows. A few downsides. One was that all the room doors made loud shutting noises, unavoidably, so without meaning to, noises were made whenever anyone came up to their rooms. And in the middle of the night, for some reason the radiator (whether on or off) made weird 'clunking' noises which were annoying but stopped eventually. And I noticed that at least one of the lampshades hanging directly over the dining room table we used, was quite dusty - not good where there is food. The location is fantastic, any direction you walk from outside the hotel, is worth exploring. Waterlooplein and the flea market, Rembrandt Square, Kalverstraat for shopping, the Amstel and so much more - all within a couple of minutes walk! Our breakfast was lovely and relaxing - the dining room is a quaint mixture of homeliness and olde worlde, with a very laid back and charming atmosphere. A box of Scrabble on the table and a huge bookcase sets the scene for a really relaxing visit. And a sliding door from the dining room opens out onto the terrace outside, where you can sit on nice days, enjoying the canalside view with your drink. All things considered, I enjoyed staying here and the most important things (for me) were all here - a comfortable bed, mainly clean all over, private shower, peaceful atmosphere, friendly staff and a great location. Unless you are the type to spend huge amounts of time in your room, this will suit most people. A few of my personal secrets and favourites! - 1) Smokey coffee shop in Rembrandt Square is the friendliest one and has a great atmosphere, Fri/Sat nights you can meet some great people - all you need to do is just get chatting and you've made a new friend. 2) La Place in Kalverstraat is absolutely brilliant for great food at any time of day - coffee, fresh juice and cheese and ham croissants for breakfast and for lunch try their home made soups, then in the evening some fresh salad and grilled chicken or fish with potato wedges - they really do serve lovely food and it's a great place to sit and they even have a roof terrace. 3) Get your sandwiches, slices of delicious 'old' Gouda cheese, juice drinks and fruit snacks all relatively cheaply from Hema and take them to eat in Rembrandt Square or on one of the canal benches watching the world go by. 4) Cafe Tante Roosje on Rembrandtplein is the best place to watch the night go by - try their wonderful huge banana and chocolate pancakes, while you sit under the outside heating with a blanket for covering your legs! 5) Enjoy a slice of chocolate cake and an iced tea outside the Majestic in Dam Square, while Steve the bluesman serenades you with some old 60s classics. 6) Don't leave Amsterdam without trying the freshly cooked fries from Manneken Pis on Damrak, on your way to Centraal Station.

We booked a twin bedded room in this hotel on expedia, paying online. It was not the cheapest option but seemed well-located and the reviews seemed generally good. On arrival, we went to check-in, showing our printed online confirmation. At this point, we were told that we would have to pay an additional 15 Euros, because we had apparently booked our twin bedded room for one person. We showed the disinterested woman at reception our expedia booking, which clearly stated that we had booked one double/twin-bedded room and that the base rate we had paid was for two people. The receptionist at first wouldn't even look at our booking confirmation. She then finally did, and agreed to check us in without making the payment requested whilst she spoke to her manager. She told us that we would be pleased with our room, as it had been recently refurbished and was one of the best they had, which we were pleased to hear, obviously. We were startled therefore when we got to our room. It was tiny, filthy and smoke-filled and, most importantly, did not have twin beds. We were aware that due to the late booking we may have only been able to have access to a double room, but felt it unacceptable that she had not mentioned this at reception. We phoned down to complain and were told that we had booked late and this was all we could expect. I expressed strong displeasure and the woman was again disinterested. An hour or so later, we received a call from the receptionist who said she had spoken to the manager and had been told we would have to pay the extra 15 Euros for the room. We asked her on what grounds, and suggested she or her manager looked on the expedia website in order to illustrate that we had paid the correct amount. She said that they did not want to do that, and very rudely told us that we would have to come down immediately to make the extra payment (which we refused to do, making the payment as we left the hotel later that evening). She told us we could \"take it up with expedia\" if we had a problem. Overall, the experience at this hotel was utterly disgusting and we were both shocked by it.

The carpet was musty and worn with some dark brown stains --- I don't even want to imagine what that was from. And the bathroom was moldy. On top of all of this, the floor was actually slanted. My husband said it literally made him feel off and dizzy. The hallway also smelled of cigarette smoke. This was a very unpleasant, uncomfortable stay.

The rooms themselves (I have stayed in three of them) are very, very small - even by Amsterdam's standards - and beyond the reception there is something rather unkempt and fading about the whole establishment. On the top floor, there is a leak from the roof for instance. The walls are thin, but the rooms and the hotel pretty comfortable. Unlike other reviewers, my experience of the staff at this hotel is that they are consistently friendly and helpful: the male owner particularly so. The breakfast room is incredibly, incredibly charming. The food is good; there are large windows looking out from a rustic room, with (in summer) ducks waddling over the footpath out front. I have rated this \"neutral/average\" because I think the rooms and the structure of the building let down what would otherwise be a very nice little hotel. There are grander, cheaper options in town - few I suspect as well located - and it wouldn't be described as luxury accommodation.

While the less informed rest, bored in their small windowless hotel you can be watching (and in most cases waving to) other boats that pass up and down the canals, smoking some of Amsterdam's finest and relaxing. We love this place and over the years have stayed in two different apartments and five different houseboats (all only a five minute walk to everything you need) as well as the hotel which have all been good. I would suggest the brown colored boat (with the red door) opposite the hotel is the best, but all the boats are amazing and are centrally heated which is important in Amsterdam in the winter.

If you are used to nice places (4-5 star) you'll want to avoid this one... and I mean, RUN. If you are however OK with lower class establishments & are only looking for a place to lay your head at night, you might have an excellent experience. From the outside, it delivers as it has a lovely facade (the pics do it justice) & is located on a lovely semi-quiet, low-traffic street. Inside however, I was not thrilled with the bare asthetics & shaggy magenta carpet, which also covered the typically winding and narrow Dutch staircase. The do have a lift however, which was a plus. I was put into room 25 which is in the back of the hotel & faces into the center of the building, so all you see is a small patch of sky up above, a sky light & tarred roof below, & windows of your neighbours all around. Many of whom talked loudly & smoked a lot well into the wee hours of the morning... This chatter plus the CONSTANT hallway traffic & ghastly-loud door-slamming made my sleep light. Forget about trying to have a lie in unless you brought earplugs & maybe a sleeping pill or 3. The room itself was dark, even despite a seemingly endless array of light fixtures to choose from. The wardrobe was spindly, the decor random & frankly kind of spooky, & the TV didn't work (only for DVD). The bed was low to the ground, lumpy, & took up a lot of the room space. I must say that it was pretty comfortable for the most part though. The bathroom was functional & I thanked God that there was plenty of hot water. The shower is annoying however because you end up getting a wet floor despite the grade in the tile, as there is no shower curtain, only the half sheath of glass to deflect the water. There was also quite a bit of grunge going on in the tile :0 Another thing I didn't like is that the reception desk only opens at eight, so when I went to check out at seven I had to walk a block to get a car to Schipol instead of having one called for me. I know, that's kind of whiny, but it was early & it just would have been nice to have some assistance. On the plus side, the staff are nice, and they have an ADORABLE little house dog.

SHOWER room was small but expected that but hated shower as it was of the type where curtain goes to floor and drains as floor on a slope...this did work ok but would have prefererred something to stand in. STAFF were very helpful and did explain this was their lowest standard of room and could not fault them as during our stay they were most helpful. As been to The Dam before we found this an ideal situated hotel. In the hotel we thought the stairs and walls, decoration in our room was quite tatty. Breakfast was excellent and free on first morning, 10 Euro the rest. I thought an idea would be good to offer the complimentary breakfast on the last day, especially for those who spend that bit too much and a good breakfast before flight home would be excellent.

We had asked for a double room but there was only a twin available and although the receptionist offered to change us the following day we decided to keep it for our 3 night stay.

Although Breakfast was not included in the price, the first mornings was complimentary and was good enough for us to pay 10 Euros each for the following days. The hotel lounge/breakfast room had a cosy feel to it and we enjoyed a relaxing complimentary drink there each evening before retiring. The location is great for exploring the centre of Amsterdam.

My only small criticism would be the shabby mismatched furniture most of which was damaged and had seen better days, there were broken tiles in the en suite shower which worked well but was a bit grubby. The room was not made up every day even though we were out by 9.30 am each morning. That aside our stay was very enjoyable .

The location, friendly staff, and comfortable accommodations exceded my expectations. The hotel is located in the heart of the city along the Amstel, and being an old canal house, staying there was an experience in itself. Almost every major tourist attraction along with numerous restaurants and shops were within easy walking distance. For those that were not, we simply walked a block to the Muntplein station and caught the tram. Being so close to everything really helped cut expenses and made it convenient to stop by the hotel throughout the day to drop off bags or grab something from the room. The staff was extremely warm and friendly, including Moreno the cat who roams freely throughout the hotel. We were offered coffee and pie in the reception area upon checkin, and were also given plenty of tourist materials, maps, and information pamplets. On several occasions, the receptionists helped us with directions and made personal recommendations of things to do and see while in the city. The room was beautifuly decorated and most importantly clean. House keeping was convenient and thorough. No early morning knock at the door! The view of the city and canal just outside our window was breathtaking. The breakfast offered each morning is definately a must. Offering a wide array of food choices, it was both convenient and delicious.

Hotel Eureka has that in abundance. the rooms have a fantastic view across the amstel, with upper floors having balconies. the windows open right out too which would be fantastic in summer. breakfast was good the two times we had it and all the staff where friendly. The location is perfect. turn right and you amble towards the red light district in about 2 minutes. dam square and the leidseplein are also within comfortable walking distance although there are trams if you are feeling lazy. i would also recommend perhaps turning left from the hotel once or twice which will lead you to a local market and the student district which has some nice cafes and shops we had never seen before. overall i really can't fault the hotel. the only thing i would add is that there is a dog and a cat within the hotel so to watch out for any allergies", "Date": "February 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague", "Title": "\u201cAn EXCELLENT choice, good value for money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4164945", "Content": "Sometimes everything falls together: a great location in a very nice area with a lot of restaurants and pubs, a cosy room with a beautiful view and an extreme friendly and helpful staff.

The bathroom was private and the shower was clean and large enough to actually bathe in! Our bed was the most comfortable in all of Europe (we stayed in 4 different countries)! The room was quiet and clean - we really enjoyed staying there and slept very well every night. There is a small dining room in the hotel - and even if you don't take the offered breakfast (10 euros per person), their coffee is wonderful and should not be missed. On our first day it poured rain while we were walking to the hotel from the train station and we arrived very cold and wet - and even though it was too early for our room to be ready the landlady had us come into the dining room to sit down and dry off, then she made us wonderful cappucinos (for free) to warm us up.
