Central Madrid is small enough to argue that there are no bad locattions between the Prado at one end and the Palace at the other. However the museums, Retiro Park, and botanic garden are all on the east end and this hotel is only a short walk from all. The Hotel is also only five to ten minute walk or 4E taxi ride to the Yellow Bus stop which provides an express bus to the airport every 15 minutes for only 5E. Price. In Madrid, as many cities, prices go up and down depending upon the season and events being held. When I was in Madrid the price was 99E for a single and 109E for a double. The other Hotels in the immediate vicinity were a step up but started at 140e for a single and increased rapidly to over 300E. Relatively speaking the Prado was very good deal for this neighborhood. Ambience: The hotel is unabashedly modern European. Shiny white, off set by prime colors, chrome and grey. All very clean and neat. So if you want old Spain or old world atmosphere, look elsewhere. I like Euro modern and this is done well. Room. The room was ample with two side by side singles and plenty of room for luggage and to move around. The was a large flat screen tv. Good size desk and very large bathroom. There was no tub, but the shower was huge with plently of hot water. Hair dryer. The amenities were plentiful with comb, sewing kit, toothbrush and paste, shoe shine, shower cap, razor, soap and shampoo. The towels were thick. Public rooms: The reservation area is small but the hotel offers a good sized, comfortable reading and computer room with tea. The breakfast room is open only for breakfast but is large, bright and pleasant. . WIFI: In Europe most of the hotels will tell you they have WIFI in the rooms but even in many of the best hotels, the WIFI is spotty or doesn't work in the rooms because of the thickness of the old walls. None of them admit to this even when directly asked but it's common a problem. This hotel's Wifi was fast and always worked. Breakfast: The continental breakfast had many offerings of beverages, fruit, yogurt, cold cuts, cerials, and pastries. It was more than adequate: Summary: For over 125-150E, I would have given this hotel 4. stars. For the price, it gets five stars. For travelers who want more luxury try The Hotel Villa Real where singles start at about 14OE. Other neigboring hotels at its level started well over 200E. I didn't see the rooms but the public areas and desk service were top rate.

The streets around the hotel are packed with some great restaurants and tapasbars. The hotel is very easy to reach, there's a metrostop at 300 metres (Anton Martin). The breakfastbuffet was amazing, a big selection of fresh fruits, cheese, charcuterie, bread, toast, pastries,...we loved it ! It was also maintained well and constantly supplied when something was out. There is only one (minor) downside which is the fact that the rooms are quite noisy, we could hear our neighbours talking quite loud in the evening / night (but I guess most hotels have this issue so it didn't bother us that much).

The All Seasons brand has taken what was once a nice, comfortable, traditional 3-star hotel and made it less appealing. The newly renovated rooms seem cold and uninviting, like staying in a cube or pod room. The mini-bar is a thing of the past. The closets have been removed from the renovated rooms, replaced with a while metal modular unit hung from the wall with a bar to hang your clothes. The new double platform beds are small (to make the room seem larger ?) and uncomfortable. And if you're even close to 6'0\" tall, you'll find the bed doesn't quite fit. The renovated bathrooms are probably the best change. The bidets have been removed, as have the tubs, leaving the bathroom a little larger than before. All of the bathrooms now have walk-in showers, but they lack anyplace to hang a towel before or after taking a shower. The breakfast options have also changed. And although breakfast is included in the price of the room, you\u2019ll find that there are far better options within a 10-minute walk of the hotel.

Check in was delayed by hour and for a short visit was a little frustrating. Room was on 7th floor with little balcony facing roof tops- with a little table and strangely one chair. View was a roof top but on quiet side of hotel. Room itself was great and plenty of space in wardrobe and free safe was welcome too. Had mini bar, tv, and bathroom was nice too with normal items. There is no team or coffee making facilities which would have been welcome after a long day walking - although a coffee machine was downstairs by reception. Reception team were very polite and helpful and provided map and tips. You can buy the red bus tickets here also - just over 17 euro each. Bus stops about 5 -10 mins away (turn left out of hotel). In reception area there were 2 computers with free internet. Wifi was free also. There is a cold drinks machine in reception too. Breakfast was 9 euro for buffet. Nice and airy room. Food mostly continental style (ie dont expect bacon and eggs other than scrambled). A sweet little 2 slice toaster which is inadequate for everyone. Service was a bit poor (had to ask for cereal bowl, then for cups, then for spoons - but maybe they were having off day). We came away feeling 9 euro was steep but we werent hungry. Location of hotel very good on Calle del Prado in a narrow street leading to several plazas (with plenty of places to eat and drink, especially tapas). Turn right out of hotel and 2 mins you are at one square,keep walking and you get to Plaza Mayor within 10 mins - and all its array of buildings, eating and drinking places both inside the square and outside of it. You must visit the Mercado De San Miguel near Playa Mayor - it has many stalls selling all sorts of produce for you to try with some wine, some cheese, meats etc. Such a buzz about the place. We took the red bus trip (the historical tour) and that takes about 75min. Red bus is almost always a good way to get and see the sites. The area around the hotel is alive at night and the squares nearby are a magnet for people. When off to bed near midnight (sad) its still very active. Road by hotel is busy (its only a car width) hence getting a room away from the front may be a good idea. Theres so much to see in Madrid a weekend cant be anywhere near enough time but a good taster. For sure you will have tired feet, will try many tapas and have plenty of short stops for a beer or wine. Area is of course predominantly Spanish but most areas were welcoming. Try the small bars on route to Plaza Major. Taxis from airport by the way was fine - always take the licensed taxis (red stripe on them) from airport it was 30 euro (note that they add euros onto the meter price - for airport). Return was more for some reason (almost 40 euro but 5.50 was for airport). Expensive so metro is still a good alternative - see other reports. Few words of advice - Madrid airport is enormous. You WILL need all of the two hours to get from entrance to the gate on way home - which also includes a train ride, several checks of passports and security etc. It is vast but well organised. We arrived at airport at 10.40am and we got to the gate at 12.15 - and we didnt hang about.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottish Borders", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "ScottishSheila", "ReviewID": "UR81332129", "Content": "We stayed here for 7 nights earlier this month and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Back to the hotel cleanliness is of high quality. everyday rooms are cleaned very well and supplied with fresh towels. The rooms are spacious with new furniture and the ensuite is also big and with both a bath and shower incorporated. The only drawback is that if you use the showergel and soap supplied by the hotel they will not be replaced and you will be left with none, so take supplies with you. The breakfast was very good and had a large selection to choose from like cereals, bread, cold cuts, jams, tortilla and for those with a sweet tooth there' s a large selection of sweet pastries too. Obviously coffee, tea, juices and water are available too. In a few words it' s a welcoming buffet breakfast to start a good day with. Next to the reception there is also two computers with free internet and you don' t need any number or permission from the reception to use it. It' s free to use at any time.

The only thing that made me start my holiday on the wrong foot is that I arrived at 6 in the morning after a night awake due to travelling and when I presented my passports at the reception, the male receptionist just made a face as if he couldn' t care less, shrugged his shoulders and told me that they were fully booked! I thought I had made a mistake in booking but the problem was that the rooms were all full until a visitor leaves and the cleaner comes to clean that empty room for us to move in.

We took the #8 line to the Nuevos Ministerios station and transferred to the #10 line. At the Tribunal station, we transferred again to the #1 line and then got off at the Anton Martin station. While there were some stairs involved in the transfers up until this point, the most difficult part was coming out of the Anton Martin station itself (with luggage) as the stairs seemed unending. In retrospect, we should have looked for an elevator, a different exit, or taken a taxi. After that, it was an easy few blocks to the hotel. Although the hotel is not located on some grand avenue, it is close to the Plaza Santa Ana, the Reina Sofia and Prado Museums, the old part of Madrid, Plaza Del Sol, and the Retiro Park. All are within easy walking distance. We arrived at the hotel mid-morning prior to check-in time and there were no rooms yet available. However, the front desk staff was very accommodating; storing our luggage and offering us an internet connection in the lobby while we waited. After using the internet and seeing some sights, we returned to the front desk and were given a room (still before check-in time). Although in an old part of Madrid, the hotel is modern and seems to be of contemporary construction. The room was very clean and modern, with laminate floors, a table/chair, TV, refrigerator/mini-bar, night-stands, luggage platform, and a closet with free safe. The wireless internet was the best we had of our 4 hotels in Europe. It was free, unlimited, performed well, and was easy to connect to (just like a wireless router at home). As is often the case in Europe, a \"double standard\" room gives you two twin beds pushed together. My one minor complaint was that the window to our room was frosted and opened to an internal fire escape exit stairwell. As we booked through a tour company, I'm not sure if we were entitled to a better view or not. However, one benefit of this location was that there was absolutely no outside noise in the room. We did not include the breakfast option; choosing instead to find local cafes. For dinner, we liked the Lateral restaurant in the Plaza Santa Ana. We left Madrid after an easy (downhill) walk to the Atocha Train Station. However, if one arrived from the station, it would involve an uphill walk to the hotel...

The staff was wonderful, and helped us with the reservations. The hotel had free WI-FI. The setup was not so great, though, and we had internet only 2 out of 5 nights. The hotel does have a PC for public use downstairs, so that compensated a bit. Our one complaint about the Hotel Prado is that it has excellent acoustics. We could hear the housekeeping at 7:30 in the morning. We could hear people in the halls talking, heels clicking, doors shutting and opening. No one was trying to be particularly loud, but we heard them loud and clear anyway. Like it or not, we would wake up at around 7:30 -8am every day. And since we rarely went to sleep before 2am in Madrid, we were pretty sleep deprived during our stay. Hotel El Prado is located near Plaza Sta Anna and about a 5 minute walk from the Anton Martin train station. The location is convenient for everything. The museums, the Plaza's, the Royal Palace are within walking distance. The Atocha Renfe train station is on the same line as Anton Martin station, and that was also convenient. The only thing we did not like about the location are the littered (and smelly!!!) streets. Calle de Leon (which leads from the metro station to the hotel) stank pretty badly...

The hotel staff is very nice and actually help out with any questions. I stayed in room 607. I think it used to be a closet. See photos. Since I was traveling alone and not in need of alot of space I overlooked the size. I planned on being in the room only to sleep. There was a huge window in the room, which I thought would be an asset, but I was very disappointed when I opened it -- the view was of a hallway and stairs. The room was stifling hot and when I asked about the air I was told that the air conditioning would not get turned on until May 15. Not the best news especially if your window opens to a hallway. Also, you can pretty much hear everything going on in the hallway. Not so great to hear people late at night or early in the morning talking in the hall or hauling luggage. Again, I'm sure this might not be a problem in other rooms but I really do think my room used to be a utility closet of some kind that management decided to maximize as a room. But, I didn't ask anyone so that's entirely my assumption based on the size and location of the room. I have no idea what the other rooms are like because I didn't ask to see them. I would imagine they're nice because I have seen other photos from travelers who have stayed. I guess my point is that if you're asking for a single room, make sure it is not room 607. Also, if you plan on using their laundry services, keep in mind it can take up to 2 days to get your stuff back. I didn't ask beforehand how long it took and got a surprise about it.
