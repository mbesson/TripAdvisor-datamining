There is also a small mini bar selection of non alcoholic drinks that is within the rate that they replenish what you use daily which again is handy. There is a safe. Room temperatrure and noise were fine and the bed was comfortable as were the pillows and we both slept well every night. In fact our room was right next to the lift, the floor outside carpeted and we wondered if this would bother us but we did not hear a sound and the hotel was full. There are 6 floors and 3 rooms to a floor I think. The little breakfast room is very cute and the food on offer was very good though we only used it on the first day preferring to go out on other mornings as we wanted to experience Paris with the Parisiens. You can get breakfast in your room. There is also a room service menu with a good selection though a cold selection and a little bit pricey. We were really pleased with the hotel and would recommend to friends and return ourselves in the future.

All we wanted was to check in, shower and head to dinner but she made the whole process more awkward than it needed to be...advising that even though I had changed our booking from 7 nights to 4 nights several weeks before our stay and had been advised on several occasions by the hotel that there was no charge for the change - she still felt it necessary to inform me, three times, that the hotel should have charged me - which actually they shouldn\u2019t have given the weeks in advance I changed the original booking, plus the written confirmations I had from the hotel advising there was no charge for the change.

This is true whether they be in Paris for business or pleasure. In my recent case it was both and I truly enjoyed the Hotel in both areas. Hotel Caron is a Boutique Hotel (18 rooms). It is located in the heart of Paris and is close to just about everything. Out the door and turn left, walk 100 yards and one finds themselves in an area of small parks, narrow streets, open air restaurants and Paris life as one might expect watching old American movies. Sight and sounds with music in the park (Saturday evening) gives the visitor the feeling he has stepped out on one of those old movies sets. Turn right and walk 50 yards to a main Paris street (Rue St. Antoine) and there is immediate access to modern day shops, including ATMs, and the Metro (1 1/2 blocks). From the Metro it easy to access major tourist sites for example, Notre Dame, Louvre, Museum D'Orsay, and Eiffel Tower (all which we visited) etc. The Hotel has recently been nicely renovated. Bath rooms have all new fixtures, rooms with decent mattress and furnishings and all have a new TV on each wall. While CNN was the only English language station available, the Hotel does offer free movies to the occupant in English. Couple this with the free mini bar, (soft drinks, water, peanuts, chips, candy) and I found it a nice complement for the guest. I left wondering when the last time I was offered free access to movie and snack at any hotel. The free wifi also allowed us communication back to the US while we were in country. Since most US Cell phone carriers do not operate outside the US or charge dearly for the ability, I found this a very worthwhile and welcome benefit from the Hotel. The staff was magnificent. Every request was promptly attended. Sandra is a special person who made us feel so comfortable while we were guests at the hotel. In the past when we visited Paris, I use to shop for hotels.

I have stayed at all the before mentioned hotels on many, many occasions. My wife and I are well traveled and from the Burj al Arab, to the Dorchester we've stayed at them all... and not in the standard rooms and not for just a night or two. - And your first question would be the most obvious ok, So why??? Why in the world did you pick The Hotel Caron, if 5 star hotels with the utmost attention to detail and service tend to be your prerequisite? Short answer: We wanted to try something different. -And different it was in so many wonderful ways. Your right -No Doorman, No Bellhops, No Elevator Attendant, No world Class restaurant, No Bar, No Concierge, No Butler... OMG how were we going to survive... We had a blast! Fist of all it's like Brand new, modern and in many ways ergonomically correct for its size and stature. The location in the 4th was perfect, and let\u2019s face it, if the 4th is where you like to stroll during your stays in Paris (which we do) then boutique hotels are what you get. The room was delightfully small, intimate and yes we made all 6 of our Tumi travel bags fit without tripping over them. The linens and towels were soft and fresh, the amenities in the bath were delightful and plentiful even if they weren't Hermes, and at night it was fun to just darken the room and turn it into a screening room theater in bed. The size of the Television in this smaller room made it feel like a Cinema Screen. I felt like a kid, it was really a fun stay! And everyone we spoke to at the hotel and yes there seemed to be someone different every time we walked in was fabulous, really sweet and thoughtful. -And I have to be honest with you, and let you know that we are truly fortunate and can afford to stay anywhere we like and I assure you we'll be back to the Caron for sure next Fall.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cDISFUNCTIONAL WITH POOR SERVICE/SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE\u201d", "Author": "JeffGold", "ReviewID": "UR55124931", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from Paris and won\u2019t be staying at the Hotel Caron again\u2014primarily because of the very rude manager, Isabelle. This is a small hotel and there is never more than one person working in the small lobby\u2014and unfortunately in our case, it was usually her. The first night, I phoned downstairs to asked her to call us a cab, and she called back and said \u201cnone are available.\u201d When I asked her when one might be available, she almost barked \u201chow should I know ?\u201d Midday on our second to last day, the hotel fire alarm went off , causing my wife, who was resting, to have to get dressed and stand outside in the cold until it was determined to be a false alarm. Then the next morning at 9:15 AM, the alarm went off again. We were asleep, and had to throw on some clothes and rush downstairs. Isabelle was at the desk both times and told us it was once again a false alarm. Barely awake and exasperated, I told her this was unacceptable\u2014two false alarms in less than a day. With no sympathy, she replied that it was very inconvenient for her as well. When we left at about 11 AM, the hotel\u2019s single, small elevator wasn\u2019t working. We took the stairs, and my wife told Isabelle \u201cthe elevator\u2019s broken.\u201d She argumentatively snapped \u201cit\u2019s not broken, it\u2019s out of order.\u201d My wife asked \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference ?\u201d She said \u201cif it\u2019s broken it needs to be replaced, but it\u2019s only out of order, and the repair company will have it fixed in 10 minutes.\u201d OK, um\u2026. When we returned that night, there was no one downstairs and the door was locked. It was freezing cold outside. I pressed the doorbell, it rang 15 times or so with no answer. A minute or two later (after about 3 minutes) Isabele showed up and opened the door. The elevator was still \u201cout of order.\u201d The hotel itself was fine if not exceptional\u2014the rooms are very small, with very little storage (we had to stack our clothes on our suitcases) but everything is new, very clean, and the beds, linens are excellent. One of the employees, Sandra, was particularly nice and helpful. The 14 euro breakfast was skimpy, and for 9 euros you can eat much better at \u201cMiss Manon\u201dacross the street. For $335+ a night, you can do much better than the Hotel Caron. This is a tiny hotel (18 rooms) with virtually no services, no bar, a single employee on staff most of the time, and a manager that has no business in the \u201cservice industry.\u201d It\u2019s new, and they may still be working out the bugs, but there\u2019s no excuse for two false-alarm evacuations AND the only elevator out of service in a single 24 hour period.
