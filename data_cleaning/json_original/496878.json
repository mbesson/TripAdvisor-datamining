{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not Recommended Like other reviewers, we stayed there because it is touted as being 500 meters from the airport and we were hoping to just walk to the terminal for our early flight the next morning. It might be 500 meters from some corner of airport property, but we had to take a taxi anyway. We also booked because we'd had success with other 3-star properties. This was a dirty, noisy, seen-better-days dive. The bed sank nearly to the floor. The TV was there but unviewable in its almost-on-the ceiling position. The bathroom was awkward at best. Everyhting was just ugly, with little concern for a guest's aesthetic. There was a teen-aged field trip group there the one night we were and they were an unruly mob. Management did nothing to quiet them for the comfort of other guests, then locked down the elevator overnight. We were on a high floor, had an early flight and were more or less trapped until my husband went down the several flights of stairs to ask if we could please use the elevator. Then, beware -- the 5-minute taxi ride from this hotel to the airport is just as expensive as one from downtown. Some kind of flat-fee thing. Stay in a better hotel and skip this mess. At least we highly recommend the near-by restaurant for its excellent dinners.", "Date": "May 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR961988526", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "BridgetownGirl"}, {"Content": "P-U I picked this hotel because we had an early flight out of Florence and didn't want to deal with traffic. Everything had a funny smell, especially the elevator. The bed had springs poking through the mattress and my pillow felt like it was stuffed with small potatoes. Most of the staff was helpful but one clerk refused to let us use a corkscrew from the bar. We walked across the street to another hotel and they gave us one. Bad neighborhood. Hookers after dark.

This hotel was well below the standard of other hotels we stayed at. The rooms were small but the bathroom was the worst! It was cramped and very dirty. I do not consider myself to be a particular person but this place did not meet even my lowest standard. In addition the area surrounding the hotel was very dodgy so you couldn't even go out side for a walk... not to meantion you were incredibly far away from any of the main attractions. I would not recommend staying here if it is at all possible to avoid.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR550258461", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Ottawa_Kitty"}, {"Content": "It's possible to pee, shave and shower at the same time! I stayed in this hotel as part of a Contiki tour.Room was small.....very small. Somebody in my tour complained that they didn't have a bathroom when they should have. That little door that looks like a wardrobe door, open it up. Hey presto, there is the bathroom!Firstly, I will go on about the bathroom as this has to be experienced to be believed. It is so small, that it seems like an afterthought. My room had a shower curtain that was about 40cm too short in reaching the floor. The shower floor seems to have no way to keep the water in. Throw in the worthless shower curtain and it is impossible not to flood the whole bathroom floor each time you have a shower. My roommate and I spent an eternity wiping up the water off the bathroom floor which usually ended up being a few centimetres deep. When the toilet is in close proximity, this isn't a good thing. We both developed a chesty cough a day after leaving this place. Coincidence?Room itself was crummy and in need of refurbishment. Whole room was small and the pillows were flatter than a pancake. Supposedly has air-conditioning. Nobody on my tour could get it to work. Breakfast was like most of the cheap hotels in Italy. Hope you like dry bread and not much else.Not a very comfortable place to stay. Not too far from the centre of Florence though so I guess if you look hard enough, sometimes you do manage to find something reasonably positive about someplace.", "Date": "Oct 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR830240374", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "rjbalfour"}, {"Content": "Disgusting! We stayed at the Hotel Concorde for two nights in June, as part of a Trafalgar Breakaway tour, and it was definately the worst hotel on tour, and in fact the worst we have ever stayed in our lives!The hotel itself seems to be catered specifically for tour groups and is 15 mins taxi-ride from anywhere of interest (typical of all the other hotels on our tour).The rooms were musty, the bed-sheets had a horrible chemical smell, and the air-conditioner was broken - indicating a constant 27 degrees C in our room (it was very warm in Florence during our stay). If thats not bad enough, it gets worse in the tiny cramped bathroom - a shower curtain with black mould and a toilet that would not flush properly.The other people on tour all encountered the same experience in their rooms, with a few too getting nasty big bites all over by mosquitoes or something during their sleep. One person also had their luggage saturated by a leaking air-conditioner from above as well. After this stay, the rest of the hotels on our tour were appreciated in a new light by everyone. I would recommend that no-one books this hotel at their own accord, and if its part of tour, lets just say it will be one of the many unforgettable experiences you have (good or bad!).

Unfortunately, this was included in a tour I was in, so we were forced to stay here for 2 nights. Here are the details.Room: Funny thing is this was not the worst room we were placed in during our trip, but it was still pretty bad. The whole place looked dirty, from the walls to the floor. The sheets were not properly cleaned and gave my girlfriend a rash. However, we were one of the lucky few who had a working TV set. If we want to open the window for some fresh air, we had to open a steel gate to get a beatiful view of the parking lot and traffic. Sleeping on the really worn out spring mattress (which was also dirty) surrounded by the dirtiness, I had to take a shower in the morning to try and erase the memory of this experience.Bathroom: Bare essentials, but at least they had a shower curtain, which is a luxury in Italy. Lobby: Not pretty, hotel staff were not rude, and did provide us with a map of the city and directions for taking the bus. Unfortunately these directions were totally wrong and we had to ask people on the street for the proper instructions. Breakfast: was as generic as the hotel, had the basics, but nothing special.Location: Far from the city about a 15-20 min walk to the bus station, and another 20-30 min to the city centre.Overall: If you spend a whole day walking around Florence, and come back exhausted and fall asleep right away, then wake up to head back to town, then its not so bad.
