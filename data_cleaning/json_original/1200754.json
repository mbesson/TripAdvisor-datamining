Because of this I requested a room that was as high as possible, to try and escape the street noise. I was very happy that this request was fulfilled. The carpark is a very awkward shape, like a triangular ramp. With my 4WD, it made it awkward going down and parking, but it was still possible. However our overall experience was poor. We stayed there one night. After needing an early night after the Chinese New Year festivities, at 12:30am we were awoken by the emergency alarm telling us to evacuate immediately. Not knowing what was going on, we tried to look for the emergency stairs to evacuate but could not find them. We went back to our room to call reception and ask whether it was safe to use the elevator, but there was no telephone in our room! God forbid there was a fire! Naturally, the receptionist was flat out trying to find out what was going on. The ordeal had taken an hour and we were back in our room. Apparently it was a false alarm. The next morning, we did not receive an apology for the interruption. No recognition whatsoever. An apology is all I wanted. As someone who works in customer service, I was appalled by this. To management, train your staff in customer service. If you call yourself a 4.5 star establishment, then you should live up to this expectation. One of our lights did not turn off, the TV did not turn on initially and I found some hair (not the head type!) in our bed.

A scattering of it. The gentleman on reception (Brent) confirmed these points by visiting the room with us. He offered us another room but, given it was small cockroaches in the rooms, I believed the problem to be with an infestation in the building rather than a lapse in housekeeping. I asked for a refund, which (after a phone call from Brent to the supervisor) was refused. As it had been a long day and it was then close to one am, we left and went in search of another hotel. A few days later, a representative of Quest rang me to offer a 50% discount on my next stay. I said I had asked for a refund, and was told I would be called straight back.

As a couple and two friends it was ideal: we had a king size double bed while they had single beds in the other apartment. Otherwise the units were identical with a kitchenette, bathroom with shower only and inside the bathroom a large closet c/w washing machine, dryer and ironing board. Not having a bath was about the only shortcoming - the rest of the apartment(s) were a treat with good quality appliances such as the dishwasher, microwave and HD TV. Having a fully stocked fridge was also a blessing upon arrival, particularly after wasting over 30 minutes gaining access to the car park due to a fault with the machine that programs the access cards. It was about the only gripe we had though as the rooms were clean and comfortable and great to relax in after a day's sightseeing around Sydney's Darling Harbour and China Town precincts. Given Quest World Square is so close to China Town it was no surprise to discover what is probably Sydney's best Asian supermarket within the World Square complex across the road. We were able to stock up with plenty of good quality Chinese food, putting the kitchenette to good use. Not that there was any shortage of good Asian restaurants nearby - we were within 10 minutes walk of Sydney's best Asian eating experiences. The Gym is a major disappointment with two treadmills and five other aging pieces of exercise equipment - recommended only for the dedicated Gym goers who need a daily fix. The lap pool is a treat though - not over-chlorinated as is often the case with hotel pools and a water temperature that makes it easy to do as many laps as you like. After booking through Wotif we were expecting it to be straightforward to check out - everything apart from parking @ AUD$40.00 per day and minibar usage was pre-paid. The problem being no one told the receptionist. After charging the entire account to our credit card, she suddenly realised it was pre-paid. More time wasted when the schedule was already pretty tight - an early morning flight should have been made with time to spare due to the airport being less than 20 minutes away. Due to her oversight though we made it with only minutes to spare after having to reverse the transactions and then re-bill the mini bar and parking costs. All in all though we'd definitely recommend it as a base to explore Sydney from. Not only were we blessed with some magnificent weather, we were also able to relax in a clean comfortable apartment for AUD$80.00 per head in peak season.

The night receptionist & maintenance person had to change the beds and they didn't even have the correct linen. Secondly, what was billed as a \"one bedroom apartment\" was, in my opinion, a studio. The bedroom section was not closed off from the \"living area\" and was only just big enough for the bed. If the bedroom is not separate, it's a studio! The living area was about half the size of what is pictured in the hotel's photos.

You can go food shopping at the Coles, which is literally across the road. It is about a 10 minute walk to the Sydney Entertainment Centre, and it also doesn't take long to get to Darling Harbour.

I assume that this term is an attempt by Quest to be politically correct but I prefer the term \"wheelchair friendly\". As it turned out, it was perhaps less of a misnomer than I first thought because the room certainly presented me with a number of physical challenges. For the benefit of my fellow wheelies, I must let you know that I have partial use of my legs. When I travel, I use a Pride GoGo Ultra scooter. I can stand for short periods when I have something to lean on or hold onto and I can take a few very slow, wobbly steps as long as I have bilateral support. I travel with my husband, who is also my carer, and our six-year-old son. Anyone who travels and uses a wheelchair or other mobility device will know that you can never, ever trust what you read when booking accommodation so it is imperative that you speak to someone at the property before you make a reservation. The receptionist at Quest assured me that the room was definitely wheelchair friendly with extra wide doors. Together with the knowledge that the Quest web site is a proud partner of MS Australia (shown at the bottom of every page), I stupidly assumed that my idea of wheelchair friendly was the same as Quest's. Here is a list of problems I encountered. 1. There is a very steep, short ramp into the bathroom only just navigable on my scooter. 2. There is a lovely large balcony that was inaccessible to me on the scooter due to a very large lip at the bottom of the door. 3. The grab rails near the toilet are poorly positioned to the side of and behind the pan rather than extending out forwards. 4. It is unlikely that a commode chair would fit over the toilet as it is so close to the wall. 5. There are no grab rails in the shower at all. 6. There is no built-in shower seat or portable shower seat provided. 7. The shower rose is fixed to the wall; I expected to find a hand-held shower on a rail so that I could adjust it easily. 8. None of the taps in the apartment have levers suitable for use by disabled people. 9. The hot water tap in the shower is extremely sensitive; together with the lack of a lever tap, this made it very difficult to adjust the temperature. 10. There is no lip into the shower, which is a good thing, however, the drain is such that the housekeeping staff place two extra towels rolled up across the entrance to the shower to stop the water from running across the entire bathroom floor. 11. The tiles are slippery; even more so when wet. 12. There is no knee space under the basin. 13. The two bins in the apartment are pedal-operated (useless for someone with no or little control of legs and feet). 14. The kitchen is not modified for wheelchair access at all. On this occasion, we were staying in Sydney to attend a wedding. When I discovered that there was no built-in shower chair, I called reception to ask for a portable one, assuming that they must have one. They did not. The receptionist was very helpful and managed to find a plastic chair for me to use, albeit one that was splattered with green paint. With my husband's help, I managed to have a shower (not ideal with the water spraying in my face the whole time) and get ready for the wedding. All's well that ends well I suppose, but I certainly wouldn't recommend Quest to other wheelies and I won't be choosing to stay there again unless the owner/manager substantially modifies their \"physically challenged\" rooms to bring them up to par. I suggest that they employ an architect who is a specialist in disability issues.

If you need the extra bedding don't bother booking this apartment, I very strongly recommend against it; you can feel the springs in the mattress just by running your hand over it. The girls had an awful sleep and I was just appalled by it; we were compensated with a single blow up mattress that had gone down by the time we arrived back at the apartment and continued to go down after we had someone come up to re-inflate it for us causing me to wake up in the middle of the night and attempt to sleep on the fold out bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c too uncomfortable, then the floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more comfortable but still had no sleep.

We asked for them to find us a physio to come up and treat her that night and the next morning but there was no outcome to this. Thanks Quest for ruining our highly anticipated weekend, and well done on hiring an arrogant receptionist who rolls her eyes at you when you make a genuine complaint (we were told that the girl was sent home after having an argument with her manager about her bad attitude).

I will never stay at this apartment again and am strongly advising anyone within earshot of me not to stay there either.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cGood serviced apartment hotel\u201d", "Author": "KiwiPete", "ReviewID": "UR25962532", "Content": "This is a brand new (opened November 2008) serviced apartment hotel, a pedestrian crossing away from the large World Square complex in Goulburn Street, Sydney. We had a one bedroom apartment, which included a separate King sized bedroom area and full kitchen facilties in an open plan dining room/lounge area. There was an accessible balcony which looked out onto the street below and into a near-by office building (which was deserted at night and during the weekend). The were LCD TV's in both the bedroom and lounge area, with a CD/DVD palyer also in the lounge. The bathroom facilities included a washing machine and clothes dryer, which were easy to use. Our room was available when we checked in early at approx 11am and we were allowed an slightly extended check-out (normally 10am) when we left, even though the hotel was fully booked that night. The hotel is an easy walking distance to the Central and Town Hall train stations and bus services. It's close to Chinatown, with its numerous markets and restaurants, the Sydney Entertainment Centre and Capitol Theatre. There is a Coles supermarket and numerous other shops and restaurants across the road in the World Square shopping complex. We booked directly with the hotel for approx A$200 per night, during the busy Sydney Mardi Gras Parade weekend, when most other Sydney CBD hotels were either fully booked out or much more expensive. We'd be happy to stay here again.", "Date": "March 10, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Quest World Square", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d1200754-Reviews-Quest_World_Square-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$162 - $270*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2 Cunningham Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2000</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1200754", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/66/d3/f7/1-bedroom-apartment.jpg"}}
