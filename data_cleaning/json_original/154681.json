I'll have to say that the hotel is a perfect option for traveler's on a budget, what you see (pay) is what you get. The hotel is well located, just a 2 minute walk from Insurgentes Station where you can take the metro (subway) or the metro bus (trolley) and which connects you directly with blue and green line that will leave you in Zocalo in no time. It's 10 minute walk from Zona Rosa and Reforma Avenue, 20 minutes walk from Chapultepec. Basically everything is near. The hotel was always clean, rooms offered basic amenities and WiFi signal was always strong. Personnel was always attentive and kind, the restaurant of the hotel serves basic meals for very reasonable prices. For those foreigners concerned with Mexico's tap water quality, Hotel Segovia Regency offers free purify water in every room. Room service and 24 hours open front desk. Now, they're some things that you should consider before staying in my opinion: 1. the hotel needs to be remodeled, furniture (including beds) and rooms are quite old, it's not only a visual thing it's has to do with functionality and comfort. 2. the hotel doesn't have either an air conditioning system nor heating. 3. Room ventilation depends on windows. 4. Bathrooms are not the most attractive ones. 5. Rooms need to be soundproofed (heard noises almost every time while in the room). Overall a decent and basic place not luxurious or trendy at all. If money is not a problem or you're willing to pay 100 or 200 pesos more for a room try another hotel (we payed around 500 pesos for a night). We were on a hurry and couldn't find vacancy in our first option yet Segovia Regency is a the perfect spot for travelers on a budget. It offers a good value for what you pay.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "TX", "Title": "\u201cMexican Adventure\u201d", "Author": "recuerdeme", "ReviewID": "UR120307394", "Content": "We stayed at the Segovia on a whim.

A couple of block down the road is the entrance to the subway which is very convenient. The room was nice and so was the bathroom.

The hotels in the Zona Rosa Cost two or three times as much as the Hotel Segovia even though they are just across the street. It costs about 60.00$ U.S. per night go to their web site and get a 10% discount. I like the Hotel Segovia Regency because the employees make it a career of working here. They are professional, kind, courteous, and friendly. They are their to assist in your every need. In May 2002 there were numerous burglaries from the hotel room safes. I was one of them. The hotel manager and the front desk managers were very helpful in assisting me in contacting the police, moving rooms, and whatever else I needed. I filed the proper police reports and a claim with the hotel's insurance company. After approximately three months the insurance company reimbursed me the cash that was stolen from the safe. Any and all documentation, receipts, letters from witnesses, and photos you can copy and give them is very helpful. Because I use traveler's checks my vacation was not ruined, those were easily reimbursable. My credit cards on the other hand took some time. The credit card companines are not always able to do what they advertise, so beward of high expectations of these companies. You are probably wondering why I am reccomending the Hotel Segovia Regency. I have been staying with them since 1990 and I have stayed with them two times since this loss occurred. The people who work here make it a great hotel. I will continue to stay here. Bad things do happen to good people. So the best advice is to be prepared and have a plan in case something bad, no matter what it is does happen. Note, in Mexico if the crime is not in progress you go to the Police Station and file a report, then they come and investigate it. While it is time consuming this is how it is done. I would rate the rooms as well kept and clean. If you are travelling alone and like spacious spend about $10 more a night and get a double, it is worth the money. The food in the resturant is good. Although there are many fine resturants in Mexico City, an afternoon snack or a late dinner at the hotel resturant will hit the spot. A late night mocha or expresso is always good here, especially with a shot of Khalua. The hotel resturant is open till 11 p.m. The menu offers many choices with some being perpared very well, while some others I did not care for because it is not how I would prepare it. The room service is good, although sometimes the communication gap between my broken Spanish and their broken English does not always produce what I like. If you order cream with your coffee or tea it may be hot cream. Be sure to explain what you want and how you would like it. If it needs to be cold tell them, if you want it plain tell them. And if it is not perfect when it arrives they will fix it to meet your desires. While it is not the newest, nor the most modern the Hotel Segovia is a good place to stay. For those of you who like a nice hotel, central to everything, and with a wonderful staff the Hotel Segovia Regency is the place to stay.
