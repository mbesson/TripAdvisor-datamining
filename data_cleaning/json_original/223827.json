However, the bed was amazingly comfortable, as always. The bathroom was very large, with a nice, long vanity with plenty of room to spread things out. The shower had a curved rod, which made it feel larger. The showerhead had great water pressure and I never ran out of hot water.

It is conveniently located right off I-70 in a fairly commercial area where there are lots of other hotels and restaurants. Damen's Grill in the Holiday Inn one block away is a great place for dinner! The hotel suites are well equipped with two TV's, refrigerator and coffee maker. The main living area is an odd triangular shape, but there is plenty of room. Everything is very clean and nearly new, and the bathroom is huge! On the second floor where we were, there was an ice maker, vending machines and laundry facilities. The hotel serves a very nice breakfast where you can even make your own waffles. USA Today's are available at the front desk. There is plenty of close parking available, and there is an indoor pool on the first floor. All of the employees we dealt with were quite nice and helpful. We had a very reasonable rate of $79 a night, and I would definitely stay there again!", "Date": "July 23, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fairfield Inn & Suites Indianapolis East", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d223827-Reviews-Fairfield_Inn_Suites_Indianapolis_East-Indianapolis_Indiana.html", "Price": "$87 - $140*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7110 E 21st Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Indianapolis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">46219</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "223827", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a7/f8/a7f8593fe62b2c6788780f7889fa287f1large.jpg"}}
