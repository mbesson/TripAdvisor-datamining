I booked for 5 nights early on in the year as a business traveller. I couldn't tolerate 1 night in this hotel so I moved to a different hotel the day after. Now the problems.. I was given a single room on the ground floor. On inspection, the entire room looked old, dirty and tatty. You can clearly see parts of the wallpaper ripped. The desk, wardrobe, toilet, shower and bed were disgusting. Dust was apparent everywhere. As an asthmatic sufferer, I choked in the room and I had to give the room a wipedown. The bedlamp didn't work, there was no running Hot water in the shower! I discovered bedsheets and pillows were not changed. Strands of hair on bed covers. Marks and stains on pillows. This is enough evidence the hotel doesn't care about the wellbeing of its guests.. The worse of all... The rooms are a completely safety hazard. The smoke alarms weren't active - The alarm cover was open and you could see there were no batteries installed. The extension wires were torn out revealing internal wiring. The most alarming sight was the electrical wall sockets. One of them was cracked wide open revealingi internal wires and springs. If a child were to touch that, they could be maimed. To top it off, the walls and windows are thin so you can hear noises from other guests and you will probably be awoken by the underground tube. I told the man at the reception desk I wasn't happy with the room and I want to move out. He didn't even bother to ask why I was unhappy and shrugged his head. No refunds. I've stayed in 15 hotels around London and seriously this hotel should not even be called one. This place needs to be shut down.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cDon't do it...\u201d", "Author": "TarheelFamily_001", "ReviewID": "UR109404219", "Content": "I travel ... a lot.

Hope you like corn flakes or muslei and toast. THIRD: Shabby doesn't begin to describe this place. I didn't see any bugs...but they were luking. This place is beyond needing a facelift...it needs a wrecking ball. Hostels in Amsterdam are nicer. I stayed in a century old hostel in Ljubljana next to the street and train tracks that was nicer. FOURTH: security? a hefty three year old could have forced open the door. OK...it IS close to the Tube and the staff isn't rude. Just indifferent. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to a friend or enemy. Just my boss. I didn't give it a TERRIBLE rating just POOR. But I can't imagine any worse in the Western world.

It was a bad experience. We were very jet lag and looking forward to a sleep. It is very hard to sleep in this place, because the train noise is very loud, and it goes most of the night. Take ear plugs. The hotel is very central and in a good location, but the hotel is very dirty and in need of repair. There is a lot of dust in the rooms, the walls are very dirty, and the bathroom is not clean. Although one staff member was helpful, some of the staff were not helpful, and at times rude. Breakfast was basic. We had to stay 7 nights in this place pre-booked, although we paid for another hotel one night to get some sleep. Most of the people in the breakfast room looked exhausted every morning, I don't think many people can sleep well here.

The hotel is cheap and cheerful, very basic indeed; the staff is quite kind and helpful. Breakfast is minimalist but acceptable (considering the price). The rooms are of inconsistent quality (or lack of): 1st stay: had a tiny room on the first floor. Really tiny - not even place to open the suitcase, but with an incredibly beautiful balcony on the Hogarth Road. Loved it. 2nd: big room on top floor (no lift of course). Noisy with the tube so close, but really spacious for the price 3rd: huge room on the back of the reception. Felt a bit \"promiscuous\" as I could hear everything that was going on there, but liked the high ceilings and the overall dimensions. 4th: tiny room like the first, but no balcony, had to stay there four days and felt pretty miserable. Luckily it was my last - and successful - interview. The decor of all the rooms is really vintage (1940?) but I do prefer a seasoned ambiance than a soulless cheapness. All of the room an ensuite bathroom and a working tv set. Cleanliness is not perfect but not awful either.

It is infested with bed bugs. My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a week and got bitten at least 50 times each, probably more. The bites started some kind of an allergic reaction and we looked like we had psoriasis or something worse. Had to spend a lot of money on medical bills when we got home. And there is also the risk of spreading the bugs to your home. This could require a very expensive sanitation. The hotel may seem cheap but, at least for us, it turned out to be quite expensive. Also it ruined the holiday. The hotel doesn't even reply when we have contacted them to demand a compensation. Even if the bugs don't scare you there are many other reasons not to visit this hotel: There is no hot water most of the day. The breakfast is a waste of time, a paperthin toast with jam. The hotel is very noisy with doors slamming. The bedsheets are bloodstained (because of the bugs I suppose). And the rooms are so filthy you won't believe it!!!

There where 6 of us staying in 2 triple rooms. Room 1 was small and smelt of mould, thats where us guys stayed. The supposed ensuite bathroom and shower are actually outside the room and where disgusting. The toilet door did not lock so you had to hold it closed, the shower room across the hall had dirty walls and corroded pipes. The ceiling in the toilet would leak when the person in the room above used their shower. Room 2 was even worse. There where mushrooms and fungus growing on the cieling and cockroaches running around the floor. In the bathroom the tiled floor was broken and there was mould on the cieling. The girls where afraid to go to bed as they did not know what kind of wild life would be visiting them in the night. When we got up for breakfast we where told there was no room for us. This is without doubt the dirtiest and smelliest place I have ever slept and I have even slept in a field for a night without a tent. I would rather sleep rough than at this place again.
