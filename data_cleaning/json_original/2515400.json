What made it less than we remembered is that now they no longer offer the complementary wine on Friday/Saturday nights which was always a great event. It is also a walk-up building which makes it a work out if you are on the 3rd floor. Parking is $15 additional, which is still way cheaper than the garage and most lots in the area when there is an event.

I called thd front desk and he said come down and he would switch us rooms. Exhausted from a tiring day we finally checked into a clean room. The room was okay but not one of the nicer ones. The next day a maid asked us if we were checking out and we had talked of extending our reservation. The front desk clerk called and we were given until 1pm. We decided not to stay another night and packed up our clothes. I even washed the dishes we dirtied! the phone rang and we decided since we were on our way out not to answer it. Within seconds there was a pounding on the door and a mans voice shouted maintence! Open the door or we are coming in! My boyfriend was in the motion of and did so before the man even finished that sentance. With bags in hand and startled. I commented on how inappropriate his loud knock was and that it was unneccessary that he had been so bouncer about us. He said \"just doing what I am told\". I asked him the name of his supervisor and he said Monica. I told him I was going to speak to her about the situation. And he said that she would actually like to speak to me! So I went to the front desk and asked what the situation was and why it was neccessary to come at us with such force and rudeness when we were already about to walk out the door just before all this had occured. I told her I was a guest and was not being treated very kind and found it to be very disrespectful. She then told me I was no longer a guest and to leave the property. I was very appauld. I told her I was a repeat customer and that I have never been treated so poor at a hotel. I told her I would take my business elsewhere and she told me not to come back!!

The desk staff was most helpful with directions to nearby restaurants. There is no elevator. There are stairs before you get into the building.

They were very polite and answered all our questions and even held our luggage for a few hours after we checked out the last day. 2. Great Location - Within walking distance of the major attractions in Seattle. Plus they have a free shuttle to take you to other attractions that are not within walking distance. 3. Decent bathroom amenities. 4. Okayish Breakfast. Bagels, Breads, Pastries, Juice, Coffee and Tea. Not bad for the price we paid (65 bucks per night). The coffee and tea were available all day, and the coffee was rather good. 5. Walk-in closet was helpful in storing all our stuff. Since we had a corner room, there was a window in the closet, in the kitchen and in the room which made it very pleasant even when the a was not being used. CONS 1. Rooms do need updating. Decor was non-existent in the room though they do seem to have put some effort in the bathroom. 2. Kitchen was almost ghetto like. Ages old fridge and stove and microwave do not make a kitchen to me even though all functioned as they were supposed to. 3. The room backed out into a parking lot where strange people loitered at night. And noise from garbage trucks woke up my baby in the morning. BUT overall, a nice stay.

I can't complain about the locaton--it is nestled in the heart of a fun, eclectic neighborhood with unique shops and restaurants--but I cannot complain enough about the Inn itself. We entered the room and was immediately shocked at the general appearence of the room. Sure, we had made these plans ahead of time knowing that we would be sacrificing some of the amenities of a more expensive hotel for location, but this was god damn ridiculous. This place is not an Inn. It's a very old pre-war apartment building that has been converted into a hotel. We've stayed in old conversions before that are quaint and charming--these owners, however, did not take the time to hide the fact that it used to be residential living for smelly, middle-class hippies Fine--the place didn't look great. Big deal. We went and explored the area and when we returned to take a nice hot shower and relax for the night, we were horrified to discover that the room doesn't have a shower--instead, it has a very large drippy faucet where you'd expect a shower head to be. We went and immediately complained to the front office and were given a stock excuse--something about the age of the building and that sprinklers had been running all day (an obvious lie, the surrounding lawn is an ugly yellow). They later sent a \"water engineer\" and our bathroom shower was upgraded to a \"light mist\". What truly put us over the edge was waking up to find ourselves COVERED in itchy, painful, oozing red marks. We're from a metropolitan city--and combined with the small, reddish stains that appeared on the sheets over night--we knew instantly that this establishment is CRAWLING in bed bugs. Most people won't realize this as only a small minority of the population actually exhibits symptoms once bitten, but let me tell you, we have never been bitten more in one night than our stay at the Queen Anne. If there was any doubt about what happened while we were sleeping, it was quickly destroyed when we actually found a live bug behind one of the pillows--and upon picking it up in a tissue, was greeted with a nice splurt of oozing blood. This is not a knock against the staff or the hotel's intentions. It's a decent building, great staff, and amazing location. It just happens to be infested. We explained the situation to the staff and were promptly given a refund for the rest of the stay.

Working in a Hotel in the U.K I always try to be less critical when travelling as I fully appreciate the hard work and passion that is needed for this particular industry. I have a few major gripes with this property, firstly the amount of time we had to wait for the room. I appreciate that check in time is 3pm however, I am also fully aware that this is a guideline and following good practice there is a way of putting the rooms on priority in order to meet guests needs as much as possible. Prior to arriving at the Hotel I telephoned to see if there was any possibility of getting into a room as we were exhausted and needed to have a shower. I was told they will do what can, when arrived was informed the room was not ready and asked to check back about in about an hour which we did do, then to check again at 1pm which we did and then checked again at 2pm, we eventually got into our room at about 2.50pm. I found this to be a little excessive and extremely annoying as there were also not many arrivals at this time. So we then went to our room after dragging our heavy suitcases up the numerous steps and flights of stairs to walk down a corridor that smelt of a hospital ward consistently ( a couple of plug in air freshners may have resolved this!). The room was in desperate need of maintenance. The ceiling looked like it was falling down! Obviously been painted over on numerous occasions however the corner with pieces hanging down were obviously missed or not picked up as needing attention. Also the pipe in the Bathroom got very hot at times and was no notice or sign warning guests of this considering it was in the way of getting into the shower. I think Housekeeping did a good job considering what they had to work with. It was very hot over the few days that we spent there and was actually quite shocked to find no air conditioning, however we could of coped with just the ceiling fan and the window open, if we were not literally on top of noisy ac units which were just outside our window from other properties. A suggestion maybe to equip these noisier rooms with Air Conditioning. On our last night we were disturbed throughout the evening a a group of High School Teenagers, who seemed to be allowed to roam free. The final straw was when one of them tried to get into our room at about midnight and then 15 mins later knocking on our door. The night Manager did respond promptly to our complaint. I then asked if it was possible to get a late checkout on our last day as our flight was not until 10pm Was told straight away a definate No, not that i will check and get back to you etc etc.. even though I offered to pay half or even full rate so we could rest ahead of a long flight. I was even more annoyed that when we were returned and collected our luggage just after 6pm, it was being stored in a clean room which we could of easily had and payed for, the same was true when we arrived and took our luggage to a clean room whilst we waited 5 hours to get into ours. The continental breakfast consisted of a few pastries, fresh coffee and tea laid out in the Reception Area. Overall the staff were pleasant enough, they do need to be trained in Customer Care skills and be more Accommodating to guests needs. I have stayed in many non rated, 1 and 2 * Hotels of a much higher calibre and cannot keep thinking what a gem this Inn would be with effective staff training and a maintenance programme which often just consists of a pot of paint.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new england", "Title": "\u201cfunky--like staying in your friend's brother's apartment\u201d", "Author": "saab_sister07", "ReviewID": "UR29928651", "Content": "I've stayed at the Inn at QA many times, going back almost 20 years ago.

I'm a single woman, and have never felt uncomfortable walking around there, even at night. It's on several bus lines; I don't have a car when I'm in Seattle, so parking isn't an issue for me. I even take the 194 bus from the airport and transfer in town; there are several bus lines which stop right across the street, so you can get to the hotel from the airport for less than $2. i walked up to Kerry Park (a major uphill walk, but not far from the hotel) which has a fabulous view of downtown, the water, and, on a clear day, all the way to Mt. Ranier. Highly recommend it! The hotel is right behind Seattle Center; I went to the Seattle Rep theater there one night, but you can also just hang out there and enjoy the park. The rooms have kitchenettes and there are grocery stores nearby; a Safeway and Metropolitan Market (more high-end). I miss the QFC that used to be across the street; the store was crappy, but it was so convenient, and there is a much nicer QFC a few blocks away on Mercer.

I checked out the bathroom in another room; it looks like they have done some updates, but they hadn't gotten to the room I had. As other reviewers have said, you get what you pay for. I had a promotional rate--3rd night free, so, even with tax (and the hotel tax in Seattle is around 16%), it averaged out to less than $55/night.

The first person I reached at the Inn by phone after examining the website and learning that two bed rooms were the exception, not the norm, was rather unhelpful. She indicated we would just have to take our chances with a run of house room assignment, but that she would note '2 beds requested.' A later conversation with manager Chris reserved a 2 bed room and on check-in that's what we got - a room with a twin and a \"queen\" bed, although it really looked and slept like a double bed. The rooms are charming, but very old-fashioned. The opening windows are single-paned and unbelievably heavy. They won't stay open by themselves, so need something to shim them up to let in fresh air. While the furnishings and fixtures are relatively new, our bathroom showed signs of poorly repaired water damage. This was a cosmetic drawback, though. Plenty of hot water, fluffy towels, etc. The continental breakfast is very basic - coffee, pastries, toast and juice. The compact breakfast service area in the lobby is quickly overwhelmed if more than 2 or 3 people are getting breakfast, but trays to carry the coffee/pastries upstairs to our own kitchenette and in-room table allowed for an easy 'room service' away from the crowds. The wee kitchenette - 2 burner gas stove, wee fridge and microwave - came in handy there. All very convenient for snacks and drinks - the well-stocked, upscale Metropolitan Market is a block away, as are at least a dozen restaurant choices all within a 2 block radius, so keeping fed and watered is not a problem! The Inn lies just to the west of the Seattle center, a 10 minute walk to the Space Needle and monorail.

We chose the Inn at Queen Anne because of its proximity to the Experience Music Project, The Space Needle and the funky shops and eateries nearby. The hotel was described as \"quaint\" and the pictures on the hotel website were nice, so we gave it a shot. Upon entering the hotel we were greeted with the carpet in the lobby , filthy and torn. Uh-oh, I thought, not a good sign. The front desk had overbooked and even though we had paid for and confirmed our reservations for late arrival 2 weeks prior, they only had one room left with 2 beds. We took it and hurriedly left our things in the room to go grab a quick bite. Upon returning and getting into bed I noticed that the room had no A/C, the windows would not open and that my son's double bed was clean, however the twin they put me in had hairy sheets and was in a former closet. I am not talking about an old fashioned wall pull-out bed-this was actually a tiny twin bed stuffed in a closet. I went into the kitchenette to put my leftovers in the fridge and the fridge had mold in it and did not work. I went to the desk to complain, was told there was nothing that could be done, so we sucked it up and tried to sleep. I took the sheets of my bed and used my sons blanket, but eventually the closet got so stuffy I jumped into my sons bed that at least had a fan above it. In the morning we experienced plumbing issues with the toilet and shower and bugs in the bathroom. Upon packing up I looked under the bed to make sure we got everything and discovered possessions from someone who had stayed there before we did. The housekeepers did not clean under the beds or change the sheets. We canceled the rest of our stay and decided to leave Seattle and drove to Anacortes where we stayed at the Cap Sante' Inn- which was a palace compared to where we had been the night before. I wrote to the manager of the Queen Anne requesting a refund. I received a letter back saying a refund could not be given, however they gave me a coupon to stay again. As if I would ever use it. The word \"Quaint\" that Queen Anne uses in their advertising is not the same as \"Rundown\". My advice to anybody staying there, upon check in go to the room, give it the white glove inspection and make sure everything is in working order before you agree to stay in it. By the way, the Queen Anne had a policy that if you reserve the room they charge your card immediately and will not give a refund without 72 hours advance cancellation.

The mirror/medicine cabinet that was hanging on the wall was barely attached. It had a small shelf below it and it was falling off the wall. All of the tiles around the fixtures in the shower/tub were falling off the wall. Literally. The only thing that was holding them in place was the fact that they were attached to each other and their weight held them up there. The paint in the bathroom looked like it hadn't been painted since the building was built (and that wasn't recently). The black mold all over everything was a real nice touch also. You have to ignore a problem like this for a long time to get fur that long. The rooms all come with a small switch/hub for internet. Unfortunately you have to bring your own CAT5/e cable, that means no WiFi. The TV was big. The breakfast was terrible.

Also, the Inn at Queen Anne has no elevator, which wasn't a problem for me but could be a big problem for some. The other downside was the noise.

Seattle buses have a Free Ride Zone in the downtown area but be advised that this hotel is not within this zone. It will cost $1.50 to get downtown during peak (I used Bus #15). Get a transfer ticket and you'll be able to ride back for free if your within a couple of hours. It is also possible to walk downhill to the waterfront (about 15-25 minutes) to catch the free Waterfront rail line. However, be advised that this rail is not running either but there is a substitute bus (Bus #99). This bus supposedly arrives every 20 minutes but the wait seemed much longer to me.

Let me preface my review by saying I got a package on the Internet. Then I read the less than favorable reviews so I was rather apprehensive on arrival. Inn at Queen Anne are former studio apts in building built in the 1920's or 30's. Actually, while on the bus, I met a woman who volunteered she lived there in the 1960's also said she was one of the first TWA stewardess. In her 70's??? she was still a beauty. Back to QA, it is an older apt and not the Hilton, but I liked it, its location, and the staff was completely accomodating not ever mentioning my Internet status. Actually, I don't think the price was that different from what everyone else was paying. I won't repeat the description of the previous reviewer all of which is true. BUT, I will emphasize the convenience of the grocery store across the store and the bus stop at the corner. Also, emphasize the free shuttle to downtown supplied by Queen Anne. I had no water pressure problems as described, but in a hotel I normally shower in the evening since I believe most people shower in the morning which can cause a problem in older hotels. Water simply gushed out of the shower like it does in older showers that don't have water control. (My room was on the 2nd floor.) Sometimes older is better.:) To the airport. I arrived at 10:30 pm so I took a cab because I didn't want to be transferring at all hours of the night. But on return to airport, I took free shuttle (provided by QA) to the Westin where I got a bus for $10.25 to the airport. Since the Westin is the next-to-last on the route, there wasn't much time spent driving around to other hotels. Then, it was less than 1/2 hour to airport. BTW, the Westin has a fantastic concierge service. Since my convention was there, I got their service as well as help at QA. Also, the Westin openly advertises the bus to airport leaving every hour at 21 and 51 minutes after the hour.", "Date": "November 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Idaho", "Title": "\u201cGreat Little Place..

If the Hilton is what you are expecting find a Hilton and pay the price otherwise do not complain about this nice little quaint hotel! Pros: Very Comfy - everything worked in the room. Rooms were small, but I like to think of it as cozy instead of small. The closets are real large so therefore much of your traveling items can be stored out of arms way. I believe all the units have a small kitchenette which consists of a (2) burner stove, microwave, sink, cupboards, small fridg and enough dishes and silverware to accomedate 2 just fine. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is a continental breakfast offered with coffee, OJ, and rolls - there may be more I was not sure as my husband just went down one morning to get me some OJ and a roll. I can say the roll and OJ was tasty and fresh. The maid server was very nice and did a good job on cleaning daily. There is high speed internet available in the rooms, which is a plus if you are like me and have a traveling office which requires you to work while out of town. Location is absolutely wonderful. Walking distance to space needle and Key arena activities, many restaurants close by and the metro bus lines are right there to take you where ever you little heart desires at a very reasonable small fee. PLUS a grocery store right across the street, drug store about 1 block away some smaller businesses like office supplies etc! How wonderful is this. The staff pointed out that is is about the same price to take a Towncar from the Sea-Tac then a taxi. And they have one that they recommend. I mean why not we did ~ hmmm Taxi or Towncar.. not really to hard of a decision there for the same price. I am sure the shuttle may of been a few dollars cheaper, so if you don't mind a 1 1/2 hour shuttle ride to save nothing more then a couple bucks then take the shuttle, otherwise the towncar is the way to go between airport and the Inn At Queen Anne. Cons: The pillows could be a little fluffier. We solved that by asking for a couple more pillows which the staff supplied without hesitation. There is not that much hot water or pressure. We stayed there for 6 nights and found that if at all possible take your shower around noon or a little after. There is really no need to turn on the cold water knob when taking a shower and the shower head can be rotated to help with the pressure aspect. Other then them two small issues really just one the water pressure (the pillows can be solved by asking for more pillows) - I cannot say anything negative about the Inn At Queen Anne\" Again this is not the Hilton or even the Radisson it is a small 1930's quaint Inn located in a nice area and for the age still holds her head fairly high. It shows and feels charactor. You can almost feel the history within the walls. And the price cannot be beat! We will stay there again if we have a need to go to Seattle again!", "Date": "November 10, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Inn at Queen Anne", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d100537-Reviews-Inn_at_Queen_Anne-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$85 - $130*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">505 First Ave. N</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98102</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515400", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/26/65/0f/inn-at-queen-anne.jpg"}}
