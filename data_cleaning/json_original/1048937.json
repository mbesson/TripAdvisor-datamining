To your left its a 5 mins walk to the Grand Bazaar and to your right again its a 5 mins walk to Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque Etc...There wasnt a single time where I had to take the taxi to any of these locations. Customer Service was excellent. Ozgur the receptionist did whatever he could in order to make the stay pleasant. He's probably the best person to get advice on where abouts to go in Istanbul. He wont just tell you every tour is good for the hell of it. Thanks Ozgur. Not to forget the other guys Kamal, and this young guy who i always tend to forget his name. Also there is great restaurant right across with reasonable prices. The price is bit high in my personal opinion but like I said before the location is amazing. Everything is at walking distance, the rooms are bit small but they are clean but eh in all honesty who goes there to sleep all day anyways. I would definately recommend this to all types of travellers. It has a friendly atmosphere, the breakfast is really good, the staff are helpful and also the owner(deniz) is very down to earth type of guy.Since I was a solo traveller, they always suggested the right places to go. I would definately return back to this hotel in the near future. P.S. Love Istanbul and the people. Had an amazing time....Hope to see you guys soon.

Of course, there was no climate control or a\\c. Also, the hotel is very expensive (more then 100 euros per night), a bit dirty. And also, as we noticed, if there are vegetables, olives or other food left after breakfast, they just hide it, and the next day serve the same dish, not even rearranging it or adding smth fresh. As a result one side od the vegetable dish was covered with thick layer of green mould! When I saw it, i immediately lost appetite. Thanks God there were a lot of wonderful cheap places to have breakfast in the city, so we started to skip hotel mouldy breakfasts. Also, the hotel is a bit far from everything, everytime you have to climb up the hill and walk about 2 bus stops to the center of sultanahmet. In general, the city is wonderful, and every day we got so tired and happy that we just dozed off at once, and early in the morning left the hotel again.

Anyway it could be worst though! About Sultanahmed area: - food - if you wish international cuisine or a good Turkish lunch/dinner + enjoy the old city be prepared to spend for a main course/person between 21-46 TL (9-20 EURO); a bottle of wine starts from 58 TL (25 EURO); - night out: we choose to enjoy the roof terrace of Pierre Lotti Hotel which is 4 min. away and which will be our next hotel to stay if we will decide to return to Istanbul; the food here was reasonably priced and the atmosphere & music was great; - shopping: Grand/Old Bazaar is an interesting experience; I returned to Istanbul after 10 years and can say the Bazaar is shrinking its offer and sellers are not any more so interested to negotiate in a old fashioned way; they are pretty bored and not very happy to talk as before; Enjoy Turkey! http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "buffalo", "Title": "\u201cWonderful staff\u201d", "Author": "wahlstrl", "ReviewID": "UR121350551", "Content": "The general rooms are quite small but comfortable, and the bathrooms are very nice.

Though we had arranged for the promised free pick up from the airport, we were not met at the airport and had to take a taxicab to the hotel. Upon arrival, not only were we not compensated for the 40 lira cab ride, we also were told that we had not given them flight details, which was sent to the hotel 3 times for confirmation. We were placed in a very small room (15 feet by 9 feet) that could barely hold our luggage. This would have been fine had the room not cost us 80 euros a night. Upon complaining we were told that we could transfer to a much bigger room in a couple of days, which to the hotel's credit was honoured 2 days later when we were placed in the Fuat Bey suite, the hotel's largest at the same rate. Even this room was replete with problems. While the size of the room and the service was adequate, the bathroom had an annoying tendency to start flooding for no apparent reason. We had to keep on devising engineering techniques with our towels to make dams to keep the water controlled, and though this was brought to the hotels attention nothing was done about it. The TV also was placed in a very unstable LCD device holder that threatened to fall apart if you moved it to a viewable angle from the sofa. We left the hotel for a few days as we visited Bodrum, and we did get a transfer to the airport. However, upon our immediate return we again were not picked up from the airport, and had to spend more of our money to get a free service. Upon arrival, the hotel not only did not apologize for this, but tried to pin blame on another company. It seemed to us that the hotel manager (Osman) could not care any less with any of our problems and actually ended up arguing with one of our colleagues regarding compensation for this comedy of errors. It struck me as rather unprofessional and certainly did not strengthen our confidence in the hotel's ability to hold up to its basic duty to ensure that our stay was accomodated with at least some sympathy. His solution to our problems? A 20 euro discount on our last night, which was in a small room again as the big suite was no longer available. No apologies, and no attempt to compensate further was made. The only positive note was the very helpful Akif and the night porter, which was truly the only highlight of the stay.

The driver took exceptional care of us when arriving at the coach station, ensuring that we were at the correct place booking us in and what we should do.

Breakfast was a simple but filling Turkish fare with decent tea!!! thank you. Coffee wasn't bad either. This was a hotel that was homely in nature but tastefully decorated and very clean, The web site pictures reflected the interior well. The smallest downside was the roof terrace breakfast room. The view of the Marmaris see is a little distant and the plants looked a little in need of some water.

And if you go up Galata Tower you would see that most of the hotels are situated in these quaint little streets. This is the beauty of old Istanbul. The hotel staff helped us locate the public transport and gave us the opening and closing times of the various tourist attractions, particularly useful, as this was close to the end of Ramadam.

After we got back from touring the country, they happily moved us to a larger room when the one we were given proved a little crowded with all our luggage. The breakfast was simple but very good (though there was no hot food). All in all a good hotel for being in the heart of things.

I took a cab, asking the driver to take me to a hotel near the city center, I would never recommend asking a cab to take you to a hotel, in all the countries I have traveled the quality of the cabs varies. The cab driver took me to this older hotel, in poor condition. The deal they were offering wasn't satisfactory, the amount they were charging was not worth the stay. I then decided to go for an evening stroll, thats when I came across the brand new hotel Kupeli. Immediately I noticed a major difference, the staff was clean, helpful and willing do negotiate a fair price. Given that it was a brand new hotel, the rates were very reasonable. The rooms were immaculate, a nice single room was perfect for my solo travels. The bathrooms were spectacular and the breakfast was awakening. To anyone traveling to Istanbul I recommend the Hotel Kupeli, it made my experience wonderful. I also would like to send a shout out to Ibrahim Susam, when I arrived to the hotel he was willing to take time away from his manager duties to walk me around, get me settled and provide the comfort any good hotel should aspire to.
