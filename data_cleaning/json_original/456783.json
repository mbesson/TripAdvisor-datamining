So, needless to say, have been visiting and traveling throughout the country from top to bottom. I think the Burchianti is a great little find for anyone. The location is perfect with all major sights, train station and lots of lovely little trattorias within close walking distance. We had a gorgeous room (#1) which was frescoed top to bottom! I think they all are except 1 small single room. The windows were sound proof, so we slept soundly with a good mattress, fine linens and great pillows. Although the 'fold-out shower' looked dubious at first, we found that it didn't leak, and had good water pressure. We've stayed at many 4-5 Star European hotels with fancy bathrooms/tub/showers that leaked all over the bathrooms. Mr. Mario, the property manager, was helpful, pleasant and interesting to speak with. Knowing full well that Italy seems to be a country without screens on windows, we closed our windows before dusk, to avoid nighttime buzzing! We were able to pay in cash or credit, so that wasn't a problem. Breakfast was simple, but with good cappuccino. Having stayed at many Florence hotels, I think the Burchianti is a nice find, and highly recommend it!", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR251316137", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MilanoExPat"}, {"Content": "Be very careful We went to B and B Alloro in the afternoon to check in and was told our room wasn't available until Wed. I was really upset because that meant we had to pack up again and move to another B and B even though it was upstairs. Cristin really gave no explaination other than someone else was in our room and they were so sorry. When we saw our room at the Burchianti I was pleased because it was a beautiful and spacious room. I wanted some coffee and it was brought to our room and it was good and hot too, just the way I like American coffee.Ok. we can live with this for one night. After we settled in for bed and adjusted to the noise even with the closed windows, a mosquito buzzed around and I was able to kill it. We went to sleep and I woke up around 2:30 in the morning to another pesky insect buzzing in my ear. I got out of bed and turned on the light. My husband had the sheet over his head trying to sleep because of the buzzing sound in his ear. I started looking around on the walls and noticed where other people had obviously killed mosquitoes in the room. Someone missed a few while cleaning the room.I ended up killing at least a half dozen of them and a few splattered on the wall and left blood. It was so miserable!! The bed was very soft and we ended up with a backache. At breakfast I complained to the manger and he was just dumb founded that there were mosquiotes in the room!!! ??? He was so surprised!! said, where, show me. He started blaming us, accusing us for opening the windows. The windows were opened on our arrival, all three of them because I noticed the heavy noise coming from the street. When we were taken to our room he explained nothing to us about our room, or that we had an option to turn on the AC. It was a little warm in our room once we closed the windows. He never explained about any of the little mosquitoe machines to kill them. He said we should have turned on the AC because the mosquitoes didn't like the cold air!!! I couldn't believe what we were hearing!! We argued for about 10 mins and I could see this guy was a liar and there was a no win situation with him. He even said why didn't you go and tell someone at the desk? At 3:00 in the morning??We knew nothing about the little machines to repell mosquitoes. I do understand they can be a problem in Florence but they should make sure that they aren't in a rooms.This was totally uncalled for and this should not have happened in the first place. We booked 3 months in advance for the Alloro. It is a scam for sure and they must work together. We loved the Alloro once we were in our rooms. There are many other nice B and B's and hotels in Florence esp. Alloro. Just beware of this place and make sure they put new mosquito machines in the room if you stay here.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR200111149", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "steelpa"}, {"Content": "Less than 1 star My wife and I had a room booked at the Alloro BB upstairs, but when we arrived, we were informed that there was some sort of problem and that we would be moved to the Burchianti one floor down. (We have still not been told what the problem was at the Alloro). The room we were given was nothing like the ones at the Alloro. It was small, spartan and had a lovely view of a wall across the alley. The manager, Mario (more on him later) informed us that we would be charged the same rate that we were to be charged at the BB. Someone mentioned in an earlier review about the Mini Fridge that contained two bottles of water and a small bottle of red wine. What they forgot to metnion is that the fridge is not even turned on. We put two bottles of water into it overnight so they would be cold in the morning for our travels only to find that they were no cooler than when we put them in. The shower (No tub) allowed water to get all over the floor. One postiive was that there was an American outlet in the bathroom which came in handy for charging ipods and camera batteries.The key situation is not the best either. You must leave them your room key upon leaving the hotel and then buzz the buzzer to be let back in. This is made worse by the fact that they give you the code for the safe in your room. So not only do they know the code to get into your safe, they have the key to your room while you are away.The breakfast was the worst we had in all of Italy. Pre-packaged croissants, coffee, yougurt and some fruit and juices. Nothing special at all.I will say the location couldn't be any better. Close to train, Duomo, amazing shopping, San Lorenzo market, Mercato Centrale where you can find some great eating at affordable prices. These were all of the reasons that I booked the Alloro in the first place. I would not recommend that Burchianti because of the location. You can find many, many other places to stay in Florence that have great locations.Now, about Mario, I have never met a more clueless individual in my life. Whether it was asking him about where to catch buses, good restaurants to eat in or dealing with him at check out, this guy is better suited for working in a fast food restaurant than managing a hotel. When being asked for retaurant recommendations, he didn't bother to ask simple questions such as what kind of food do you like or how much do you want to spend. Check out turned out be the biggest nightmare of them all as I was informed by Mario that they only accepted cash. I was not prepared to pay cash as I had planned on paying by credit card at the Alloro. After staunchly refusing to pay cash, he decided that he would accept my card until after several attempts to run it through, he kept telling me that the card was not being accepted. I knew there had to be a problem as I had just used the card not one hour ago. I called Visa, and they said there was nothing wrong with my card and as far as they could tell, no attempts to run it had even been made. They said the problem must be on his end. He called his processor (Or so he said) and was informed that my card did not work in Italy, and that is why it would not go through. I guess all of the receipts I had in my wallet were not enough proof for him that they were wrong. He then told me that I would have to pay cash, and when I told him that I was not willing to use up the cash that I had, he actually suggested that I go to change place and take out an advance on my Visa card. If you know what the charges and interest rate are for doing that, then you know It would have been cheaper to stay at the Ritz. As a last resort, we went upstairs to the Alloro to see if my card would go through on his machine, what do you know, in two seconds it went right through. No apologies from Mario or nothing, just that same stupid look he gives all the time when answering any questions.In closing, if it came down to the Burchianti having the last available room in Florence versus having to skip seeing Florence at all, I would have to pass. Stay at the Alloro if you can, but if you find yourself being moved to this property, leave immediately. In fact, try the Tourist House Ghiberti closer to the Duomo. We originally tried to book them, but they were sold out. It is much nicer than the Alloro and 100 times nicer than the Burchianti", "Date": "Aug 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR528284173", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Neftist"}, {"Content": "Very good stay, BUT...

I go to Florence rather frequently. I have stayed at the Burchianti about six times during the past few years, most recently early in December 2007.There are about a dozen rooms. One is a small single. The rest are all spectacular doubles and triples - gigantic and beautifully decorated. The frescoes are old and wonderful, the beds and bathrooms are new and comfortable. Most recently, my bathroom had both a shower stall and a bath-tub.The location could not be better. It is at the absolute center of the old town - five minutes walk from the railroad station, five minutes from the Cathedral, two minutes from the Via Tornabuoni - the fanciest shopping street in this city of fancy shopping streets - and about 30 seconds walk from the huge San Lorenzo market where you just might be able to find a bargain.The neighborhood is terrifically busy during the day, but very quiet at night. Just to make sure that your room is quiet, there are two double-glazed windows and heavy shutters between you and the street, and air conditioning you control so you don't have to open the windows in the summer. Some of the best restaurants in Florence are within a five minute walk.Rela, the owner, does not speak English, but she does communicate great concern for her guests. The manager, Mario, speaks fluent English, and he is a font of knowledge and is tremendously helpful. The night staff also speaks English.In short, a great place, a terrific location, wonderful people, and all at bargain prices.You can't beat it.", "Date": "Dec 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR263623390", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "georgehlesser"}, {"Content": "The Burchianti was Awesome! My wife and I stayed at Burchianti for two nights in October of 2007. It was a great relief after the tiny room we had in our previous two nights in Venice for the same price. The hotel property was well kept and very Florence. It is located on a lovely and quieter side-street just off of a main street with a ton of shopping. The location was quite near to the Duomo, the Uffizi, and great weekend street markets. Our room was cool and comfortable, lighted perfectly for the stunning original frescoes on the ceiling. The room felt very modern but not overly so--maintaining the feel of Florence. The bathroom was a good size and well maintained and the bed very comfortable.As other reviewers mentioned, the hotel manager, Mario was very hospitable and friendly. He made us feel at home from the beginning and really made our stay in Florence. The hotel owner was also quite lovely. She didn't speak English but her hospitality crossed the language barrier and she too made us feel right at home.Two minor squabbles, I did catch a couple of mosquitoes in our room but that seemed to be indicative of Italy generally during the time of year that we were there.

While the studio was a nice space with lots of character, it was unbelievably noisy. Trucks, restaurant recycling clatter, blaring music and loud people in the street just outside your window until 3-4 AM. The bed was two singles pushed together with single foam mattresses that caved into the middle. We had to move it to the floor so that we wouldn't be crippled in the morning. The shower was a tiny space with a broken shelf and a curtain that wrapped around you if you left the water on. To his credit, the manager did knock 30 Euros/night off the price and he gave us a bottle of wine. The location is great in that you are walking distance to many attractions, but this was the most expensive and most disappointing hotel experience I had during two weeks in Italy.

It is a 15 minute taxi drive from the Airport and on average a 15 minute walk from most of the major Florence attractions. The Hotel's major point of attraction are the 16th-Century frescoes painted on the ceilings of some of the rooms.We stayed in the Hotel Burchianti for 4 nights and our cost was 800 euros. One review claimed that the hotel only accepts cash, and although there is a sign on the front desk that claims Cash Only, the hotel does accept Visa.Like any hotel, there are both pros and cons. You need to consider both before booking this hotel.ProsThe hotel is beautiful inside and the rooms are quite spacious. We booked a Junior Suite to accommodate myself, my wife, and my 1-yr old daughter. The room was big enough to keep a baby bed, our over sized stroller / pram, and still plenty of room for our daughter to wander around and play.The bathroom was large and contained both a full standing shower and a jacuzzi (with a shower wand). The room contained a small fridge (good for keeping opened jars of baby food) and an air conditioner that actually worked. However, due to the size of the room and the height of the ceiling, it did take time before the room would cool.The 16th-Century frescoes on the 18-ft ceiling were amazing. It was nice to come back to the hotel, lay in bed, and just stare at the paintings.The staff was extremely helpful. Mario, the hotel owner, provided excellent recommendations for dinner and set up reservations for two of our dinners. Both were excellent dinners. The hotel also booked museum reservations for us in advance. The staff was also particularly friendly, especially towards children.The hotel location is prime. Being in the heart of everything was great, especially with a baby. We could easily return to the hotel throughout the day as needed. We were 10 - 15 minutes from all the major attractions.ConsThe mosquitoes were terrible. Three of our 4 nights were sleepless due to constant bombarding from mosquitoes. I was bitten on average 6 - 9 times per night. This must be an ongoing problem as the walls were covered with dead mosquitoes from late night battles with previous guests. My recommendation is to bring a plug-in mosquito repellent or a repellent lotion. The hotel provided one in the room, but it was old and ineffective. The room does not come with an Iron / Ironing board, nor is one available from the hotel. However, the hotel staff did send my 3 shirts to be pressed by a local laundry business and the price was more reasonable than most hotels that offer the same service.The breakfast is not impressive. Although the bread, cake, or pie that is homemade by the hotel was very good, the remainder of breakfast left a lot to be desired. The majority of the food was packaged except the coffee and the whole fresh fruit. The croissants were individually wrapped and sugar-coated. The cheese and meat pate were individually wrapped. They did however provide yogurt and muesli cereal, and the coffee was quite good. If hotel breakfast is important to you, I would not recommend this hotel.The room service was not up to most 3-star hotel standards. The room and bathroom were very clean upon arrival, but were not cleaned by housekeeping daily. Housekeeping did come in to make the beds and replace towels. One morning however, towels left on the floor were not replaced, they were simply hung up on the towel rack.Bring your own soap and shampoo to this hotel. The soap was not replaced during our stay and we ended up washing with shampoo on the last day. The shampoo was kept in tear-off top packets instead of the standard mini-bottles.On the day of our arrival, the mini-bar contained only 2 bottles of water (one flat and one sparkling). We were charged for neither, however, the mini-bar was never restocked. Also, there are no other items kept in the mini-bar.Overview Summary: We liked this hotel and would consider staying here if we ever return to Florence. We would however consider other hotels. Although there are a few cons to this hotel, I would have given it a 4.0 Rating had it not been for the mosquitoes. The charm of the rooms, friendliness of the staff, and the location within Florence are clearly this hotel's biggest assets.", "Date": "Sep 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR379332255", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "campbfh2"}, {"Content": "Fabulous Host Due to an overbooking with our original accomodation and trying for hours to find a hotel that could take us, our hostess found this wonderful apartment for us in this hotel.

My two friends and I, all from New York, stayed ten days in the big end room with the wonderful painted ceiling and walls. Lots of space, a modern bathroom, a terrific location within walking distance to just about everywhere. Our hostess spoke almost no English and the guests were a diverse group including a couple long-term residents. We were pointed to perhaps the best restaurant of our trip. Yes, there are those medieval-sounding, echoing click-clacks from the alley late at night when the workers and young are all heading home but it's well worth it to adjust to these sounds of the neighborhood. We did and would do it again in a minute.", "Date": "Mar 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR764110180", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Charming Italian Ambience We booked two rooms at the Hotel Burchianti in November. They were absolutely beautiful, spacious, and clean. The hotel is very small--10 rooms on one floor with an elevator from the street. We found the steet to be very quiet, but we are urban dwellers and are used to some city noise. After being there a short time, we started referring to the Burchianti as home.

I stumbled onto the Hotel Burchianti and am definitely planning to use it as my home base when in Florence. I was looking for a place near the train station as I did not want to pay for a cab. It is a quick 5 minute walk from Santa Maria Novella and is just a block to the San Marco church. The owner is a charming lady who spoke as little English as I did Italian. Yet, she managed to convey all the necessary information with charm and hospitality and we seemed to understand each other just fine. I felt as if I was being ushered into her home for a visit. My room was a small and very comfortable single room.... without the frescos that seem to adorn the other rooms. It looked out over a courtyard and was extremely comfortable and quiet. The air conditioner worked great (an important factor in July). Breakfast was delicious, complete with superb cappucciino. Overall, it was extremely homey and charming.", "Date": "Jul 9, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR851106252", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Hillgoddess"}, {"Content": "A Lot of Character, A Lot of Noise We stayed at the Burchianti in early January.
