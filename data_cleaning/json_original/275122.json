Staff was very friendly and helpful, would book dinner reservations, tickets, etc, were very informative about the area, where to find supermarkets and such. They also helped us find alternative transportation to the airport at 4am without shelling out 30euro for a cab. The room was rather small, but well furnished, with a large comfortable bed, lots of lighting choices, large mirrors, a closet, a safe, and a flat screen TV. The free wifi was easy to access, although you have to keep re-entering the passcode, but it had very good reception. The bathroom had an awesome shower. However, the bathroom is separated from the room by a glass wall and large glass door that was difficult to open without bumping into the bed, and didn't close all the way. There is absolutely no sound-privacy in the bathroom, so if you don't like hearing your travel companion take care of business, its best to turn on the TV or go for a walk when nature calls. The windows in our room looked out on an elevator/light shaft, so not a very interesting view, but from other reviewer photos it looks like we were just unlucky with this one. The elevator was a really cool and old-fashioned-but-modernized. The only downside is that if someone forgot to close the gate on one of the upper floors, the elevator will not come down to get you, so you have to walk up the flights of stairs surrounding the elevator shaft. We were only on the 3rd floor so it wasn't too much of a hassle. When we left, our credit card didn't work and we had to pay cash. Several days later, upon returning home and seeing our bank statement, we found that the card had indeed worked and we'd been double charged. We contacted the hotel and within a couple days they had reviewed their records, found that we had double paid and immediately refunded us. They were very apologetic, polite and helpful.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens", "Title": "\u201cnicely situated hotel in madrid for reasonable price\u201d", "Author": "Tsarmuh", "ReviewID": "UR133899336", "Content": "It is a rather good hotel in the center of Madrid close to metro station and a lot of sightseeing places.

It takes a few minutes to figure out the system. When you do, a number of warm jets of water hit you, which is nice. Unfortunately, the shower's drain can't keep up, so it floods over in minutes. Noise wasn't a problem, but the window to our room (the 'family room') opened to a wall.

If we came back in the middle of the day even after an hour we were still frozen. The Manager very polite and concerned but could only offer a blanket!

There is no electricity. There is no services today in the hotel. we are closed.\" Funny enough, the lights were on in the hallway, guests were trotting up and down the stairs, and his computer was on - which he was staring at, clearly realising that they had over-booked. i had e-mailed the day before to reconfirm, and we arrived at 1pm, so it wasn't like we were checking in very late in the day. We got sent to a sister hotel, the Ducal, at Gran Via. No apology, nothing to make up for the mix-up, even an offer of breakdfast or a drink from the bar. Not impressed. Plus, we wasted some of our precious time in the transfer. The shower didn't work in the first room we were given, and we had to move again for the second night. So, all that stuff was very annoying!!!! However, it was cheap - 220 euro for a twin for two nights. The location was great, and the second room had a tiny balcony which we sat out on before dinner, using the luggage stool as a second seat. It does look tired, though - the flooring is fake wood planks and the walls badly need painting: our room had several hand-marks, and chipped paintwork. i had thought from the pictures online it was much snazzier, Also, neither room had a price list for the minibar, again annoying, especially as it turned out to be very expensive for the two tiny bottles of cava we had!! So watch out for being bumped from this chain. You could end up in another part of town from where you chose to be. The only good thing was the staff at the Ducal were very nice.

I had a 5 day stay at the hotel. If you have kids sorry I dont think you should stay here! Reason why? see below.. It location cannot be beaten it is smack bang half way between the museum area (15mins walk max) and the civic area (royal place, cathedral and old town etc 10mins). It is a generally smart looking hotel, although many of the features sound good alas, they dont always work or exist. I requested a 6th floor room 2 months before arriving to be told at arrival that I was on the first floor. The rooms are small but with good storage space and are contemporary and clean. Unfortunately I had to move rooms as the famous power shower (room 105) is squeezed into such a small area it is hard to enjoy a shower without hitting the adjacent sink (plus the shower rail collasped) , note that the 'wetroom style' bathroom didnt drain as fast as the shower! You are therefore limited to a 1-2min shower otherwise you flood the room. Although this clearly maybe a one off and be resolved when you read this. I hope. Reception were accomodating and moved me and my other half to another room ( room 107) , again clean and modern. However many features were already falling apart, the curtains were hanging off the rails, the bedside lights behind glass panels (as shown on the sexy pics) built into the bed unit had slipped onto the floor, which was a bit worrying as they burnt dust on the floor. Despite the double glazing the noise is bad- not one for light sleepers. The traffic police take pride in their whistle technique (Its like mardi gras in Rio without the dancers). The refuse trucks empty the bins at 2am every night, and then you have the club revellers going home. I had been to the bars and clubs of course, but you only get little noise from 4am-7am. One major concern - After a lot of banging directly outside the room at 2am I went out to investigate, opposite 107 is the fire exit. I opened the door to see 5 housekeeping trollies stored there, ready for the next day. Blockin the stair well with sheets, bottle of chemicals etc. I looked up the fire escape staircase and it was being used for storage of all sorts of boxes and bizarrely a pressure washer -right in the middel of the stairs - your would have to leap to get over it! . I was glad not to be on the much praised 6th floor! This must be illegal. I know hotel fires are thankfully rare but I remember 32 backpackers killed in OZ at a badly run place and have been in a few fire evacuation and bomb scares and real bombs thanks to living in london. Fire routes exist for a reaon! Even in a false alarm a rush down those stairs could end up in a fatal crush with it being totally blocked. Quickly and finally two other niggles. My key card had to be reset 2 or 3 times a day, i would leave and then try to get back in my room but it would open so down stairs to get it reset. Once 3 times within 2 hours.Apology? Nope! After 5 days and over 15 visits to reception, i realised the 'petit' part of the name summarised the service. Lastly the high speed internet isnt available in all rooms and the first room the remote didnt work. Petit Palace is part of the \"High Tech\" Spain hotel alas thats an oxymoron. Looks good on the surface, so ok for 1-2 night, but longer stay, nope!

I travelled with two friends and shared a triple room. The room was a bit small, BUT realize that we are Americans, so everything in Europe is small compared to what we're used to. The bathroom is as everyone mentioned... one wall of frosted glass with a squre filigree cut out that let's you see the person sitting down... if you catch my drift. It was conventional and worked for three ladies that had way TOO MUCH luggage. Noise was a factor in the beginning but after 10 days in Spain we realized that it's pretty much the same anywhere you stay (walls are thin). It wasn't terrible but we did hear party people coming in at 5am. We did the same thing to our neighbors the following night so, what can you do but say \"Es lo que es\" (it is what it is). We stayed there our first night in Madrid and went on to do a tour throughout Andalucia. Petit Palace Ducal was pretty inexpensive, compared to the other hotels. You do have to pay for breakfast, I recommend going somewhere else for breakfast if you have the time... if you don't have the time, go for it... just know it is a bit pricey but decent. Very different for Americans, you have to remember you're in another country, be careful with the coffee machine... it's like espresso... didn't drink the coffee, went down the street to Starbucks. There are pubs, restaurants, bars (Cervecias), shops all around. No need to worry about needing transportation. We actually used the metro to get to our hotel from the Airport (Barajas), the maps are straight forward and we got there easily (navigation wise), lugging our 60lb luggaage was a different story. My point is, use the metro. It is less expensive, pretty easy to use and takes you pretty much all over. The staff is as helpful as they can be BUT their English was like my Spanish... which wasn't very good. But between my bad Spanish and their bad English... it worked itself out.

However the rooms were quite small. for 3 people they basically put an extra bed into a room for 2 people so a little crowded. There was no tea/coffee making facilities, the shower leaked so we had a little stream running through the room and the air conditioning didn't work.. Luckily we went in April so it wasn't baking hot but to get some cool air you had to open the windows - not a good idea on the main street through madrid as lots of noise all day and night. I am glad they moved us to the ducal hotel, as we walked past the Arenal and this looked terrible. Right in a small side street directly opposite a night club.

I would recommend it for a short stay. The best features about the hotel are its central location just off Gran Via and 1 min from the Metro, the rooms are clean and comfortable, there is a secure safe in the room operated by the magnetic strip on your credit card (free), and the hotel represents good value for money. There are plenty of good cafes and bars if you head up C. Hortaleza. The downside was the noise from the Gran Via which was quite loud if you had the windows open. The room is air-con BUT only in summer and when we were there is was off for the winter season. This time of year it was 25C in the day and this meant we had to spend a couple of hours cooling the room down with the windows open and then closing them to sleep. The location could shock some - if you head towards Puerto del Sol you will encounter the main prostitute strip that operates day and night. If you head in the other direction up C. Hortaleza you are in the main gay district. That said this is a great area for food and entertainment. Watch out for pickpockets on the train from the airport - a group of 3 people will move around you and distract you by picking up you bag, cursing you etc. Just move away from them - don't be polite!.
