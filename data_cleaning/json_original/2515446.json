A medium-sized DoubleTree situated in the far end of a retail complex of restaurants and stores (Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, a very nice sports bar/restaurant, YogurtLand, Applebees, and more are all within a 5 minute walk from the hotel -- also Mimi's Cafe is just a little further down the road). It's a wonderful, convenient location. Also, the city trolley is right across the street and will take you to almost any place you would like to go in San Diego. Sea World and other tourist attractions are within a 10 minute drive. This hotel is in a very pretty section of town called Mission Valley - a retail area with palm trees everywhere and a very spacious and relaxed feel. SERVICE: We found the service to be excellent. We asked for a certain type of room and the front desk clerk not only got us the room we wanted, but told us to be sure and let her know if it was not up to our expectations. Another clerk called two restaurants for us to make sure they were still serving breakfast. Our car was brought up by valet within 5 minutes. Our bellman arrived within 3 minutes. We called the front desk to inquire about the internet services and we were given prompt, efficient information on how to connect. We were granted a late checkout time when we asked. The overall attitude was one of trying to help us in any possible way and we very much appreciated all the courtesies that were shown to us. ROOMS: The room exceeded our expectations. It was very spacious, newly decorated in earth-tones and had a great view of the pool and surrounding area (including the San Diego River, just across the way (which we never knew existed!). The flat-screen LG TV was large for a hotel (a 42\" I think) with a perfect picture. Also, there was a very nice heavily padded lounge chair with matching ottoman to put your feet up and relax. The sliding glass door has a special opening and closing mechanism that allows it to be cracked open for fresh air to come into the room! It locks with a tight vacuum seal. The lighting in the room is done well..there are plenty of lights wherever you may need them. the bed was extremely comfortable with first-class linens. We slept well...at 6am when all was extremely quiet, we could hear the neighbors in the next room, but the sound was very, very low and muffled, and we felt the insulation between the rooms was top-notch. TECHNOLOGY: We liked how the hotel makes use of technology by having video monitors at the front desk that show you various informational slides about the hotel. You can learn a lot about the hotel from the video monitors. CLEANLINESS & DECOR: The hotel was extremely clean throughout. Beautiful, tall glass jars of orchids were on the entry table in the lobby. The lobbies on the floors also had green plants and sofas. There are elevators, of course, but there is also a lovely, wooden, interior stairway in the middle of the hotel which gives it a warm, homey feel. You can take those stairs to the second level and walk out onto the shopping plaza which is just outside the door. OUTDOOR RECREATION: There are two pools, both on the lobby level: The outdoor pool was large, bright and sparkling with plenty of places to sit and lots of palm trees. There were several fire pits with plenty of seating. There was also an indoor pool that was very large (for an indoor pool, which tend to be small). Also, a very nice fitness facility - again very clean. There are two tennis courts also, that look brand new. WILL WE RETURN? Overall, we really didn't want to leave and are very much looking forward to returning and recommending this property to our friends and family. It will be, after many years of looking, our \"San Diego home\" whenever we may find ourselves in this beautiful city. We have stayed in some of the best hotels in San Diego, but have always been disappointed in one way or another and never found one we would return to....until now! In summary; WE LOVED IT AND HOPE YOU WILL TOO!

I always call to talk with a live person when booking ANY stay with our dogs so they can understand that the dogs will be accompanying us during the stay and to get dog rates as well. I did this when booking my stay in March 2012. Told the reservation specialist that we needed a king bed and that our two dogs would be staying with us in the room. When we arrived I checked in with the dogs at my side and we had gone through the lobby several times that day to visit the Ocean beach dog beach, get lunch and dinner. Mind you my dogs are Akitas and they around 100lbs each. Now these are large dogs, we always left through the main lobby; we stopped at the front desks to get cookies with our dogs and spent about 20 minutes talking with some of our country\u2019s service members that wanted to pet our dogs and other guests that wanted to pet the pups in front of the check-in desk. All this was done in plain site of the staff members in the main lobby. Nothing was said about us having the dogs until the end the of the first day as my husband was taking the dogs on the last potty trip of the night; he was stopped by the a staff member that stated he was the manager and he asked if we were staying at the hotel and my husband said yes and we have stayed there several times before. The manager then informed my husband that we had to pay on extra 75 dollars because the hotel no longer allows animals to stay and if we didn\u2019t pay this extra fee he would kick us out! We asked why nothing was said when we checked in or when we came through the lobby many times that day with our dogs and the manager said he didn\u2019t know. We were shocked because of the steps we took to reserve the hotel and told the booking agent that we had dogs that were staying with us at the hotel. The manager accused us of trying to sneak our dogs in! I told this manager to look in the records and see that I called in the reservation because he did not believe that I did so, he stated that no one calls in reservations anymore they only make them online! He looked it up and the records stated that I called in the reservation! He was very rude and snippy! The customer service was terrible! The manager told us that he was going to catch heat from the CEO because our dogs were staying at the hotel. How is that our fault? We did everything right by stating that the dogs would be staying with us at the hotel! Plus this was the hotels booking mistake! NOT OURS!!! Because of the lack of communication by this manager we were harassed by security and the house keeping because we had the dogs and no one was informed that we were allowed to stay because it was the hotels booking agents fault! This made our stay very stressful! We will never stay at a Double Tree again! Instead of remodeling the hotel they should do some remodeling of the staff!!!

It is actually the 4th hotel I have tried in Mission Valley (obviously the others did not leave enough of an impression to return) and next time I am in San Diego and need to stay in MV this will be my choice. The location of the Doubletree in MV is great because it is easy to get to the shopping areas or nearby places you would tend to go - liked that the trolley is just steps from the hotel and there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance if necessary. Mission Valley is centrally located if you want to do all that SD has to offer - it is just lacking in character which is why I like downtown. But we rarely spend time in our room and it is literally 5 minutes to Hillcrest, 10 minutes to the zoo and downtown, 10 minutes to the beaches and easy to navigate and never traffic....so you can't go wrong in that regard. I believe it was recently renovated and so everything is new and clean. I liked the style and decor of the room and it was actually spacious - more so than similar hotels in the area. The bed was super comfortable and the staff was professional, helpful and friendly. I definitely cringe at the parking fee and internet charge - but that is the standard in SD - so I have gotten used to it. The parking garage is attached and space was never an issue. I actually received an email with the option to upgrade to a business plan which gave me parking and internet for 70% less than if I paid the standard hotel rate - so that ended up being a bonus. The only odd thing that happened was the room did not come with a refrigerator so we had some food from a restaurant in a to go box from breakfast to have for snack later.....when we returned it was gone (assuming maid service tossed or ate it) but the empty wine bottles and paper grocery bags were still there. Is there a special way to communicate what is to not be thrown away? Usually if I do not want something I put it in the trash or next to it. These boxes were on the desk with other personal belongings. Not a big deal....just kind of weird. The only negative is that the bathroom walls did seem thin - could hear the people in the next room - but not their voices. Mostly just the plumbing noises....but they were suprisingly loud at times. The sliding bathroom door is a nice feature decoratively speaking - but not really functional as far as privacy - but those were both things that as a guest did not bother me, but could others.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, Cororado, USA", "Title": "\u201cGood Value - Good Service\u201d", "Author": "Boulder-USA", "ReviewID": "UR126464061", "Content": "We booked two rooms at this hotel at the last minute and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and value.

With a car, the location is very good as there is easy access to most of where one would need to go in the city. The biggest plus for me is the level of staff friendliness and helpfulness. The fact of the matter is that when one has many options for fairly similar types of hotels, a repeat visit will come down to whether or not one has been treated nicely by the staff. If they show that they care that I am giving them my custom then it is more than likely that I'll be back. One negative is that they charge $16 per night for parking in their parkade. This seems to be standard for hotels in the area, but it doesn't mean I have to like it. I noticed that some people parked on the street out front, which looked reasonably secure to me. Wi Fi was $11 per day, which I didn't like paying either, but it worked really really well so that was good. Free or cheap Wi Fi is useless if it doesn't work well, so at least I know I was getting good use for my dollar. Web page load speeds were fast and I was able to Face Time with no glitches whatsoever. That's about all I ask for. I've given this hotel five stars based on a comparison with other similar hotels I've stayed in the last 12 months. A nice room and great staff made this a superior experience.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNice Suburban Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ATLBob", "ReviewID": "UR123791611", "Content": "This hotel is pretty convenient if you're attending a football game or doing business nearby: it's close to 163, the 5 and the 8, is a very short drive to UCSD and is next-door to a shopping mall and some national chain restaurants, and right down the street from Qualcomm Stadium. The DoubleTree is only 15 minutes from the airport rental car site, so it's an easy option for those needing to work in downtown as well. Our room was large enough for two, it had adequate closet space and dresser/storage space for two, and the king sized bed was comfortable. The only small qualm is that there isn't much counter space around the bathroom sink to accommodate two people. Instead, I used one of the two shelves that held the clean towels and shampoo/conditioner (consolidated them into one shelf) and my wife took the entire space around the sink for her stuff, so it worked out OK. Rooms have a medium sized flat screen LG HD TV, a couple of HBO channels and the usual variety of HD local/national stations as well. The hotel area was always clean, the indoor and outdoor pools were spotless and the exercise facility seemed adequate. There is ample parking, but it's not free--the good news is that your room key gets you into/out of the garage so it's easy to come and go at will. We found the staff in the lobby/desk were all very helpful and pleasant to deal with in terms of directions and suggestions. The three elevators worked fairly quickly so there wasn't a lot of waiting around. Our room was booked to include the buffet breakfast, which was OK. There were scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon/sausage, various pastries, yogurt, breads, cereals, etc., but nothing really outstanding or bad. They would also prepare eggs to order or prepare an omelet as part of the buffet offering. There is a fairly large bar/TV area that seemed to get a fair amount of traffic each night, and there was another restaurant that we did not try during our stay. The best overall food item IMHO is the wonderful DoubleTree chocolate-chip cookies that are generously available!

Starting with the maid service and ending with the hotel's unpreparedness for power outages, this hotel was a big disappointment with guest services and comfort. Maid service is very slow, shoddy and confrontational. Yes, a maid had the audacity to make me--the paying guest--wrong for expecting my room to be cleaned and made up by 4p, despite having left my room at 9a; I was gone for almost 7 hours, but when I returned at 3:30p, my room hadn't been touched. This happened on 2 consecutive days. The second time, I contacted a maid who was servicing a room down the hall from mine and inquired if she knew why my room wasn't done. She was custom-service oriented and immediately got on her radio to ask the maid in charge of my room to clean it. This helpful maid then proceeded to admit to me that my maid forgot to clean my room, however, when my maid showed up less than 2 minutes later, she proceeded to justify her actions as to why she'd skipped over my room (apologizing in-between excuses), making me the bad guy for not calling hospitality to request immediate maid service upon leaving my room at 9a. I explained to her that I thought being gone over 6 hours was plenty of time to assure a tidy room upon my return but this maid kept putting it back on me. This is not proper hospitality! Especially for a guest who is paying $138 a night. Secondly, she and whoever cleaned my room when I checked in the first day either needs a good pair of glasses or they just have not developed attention to detail: upon entering my room for the first time, I found hairs in the bathtub drain and hairs around the toilet. I'll just leave it at that, but it would be interesting to hear what that maid has as an excuse as to why she didn't clean the bathroom floor or the tub. Justify that! The biggest faux pas this Doubletree committed was losing its Internet connection--for 2 days. As a business traveler, this was unacceptable. Calling the front desk yielded an answer that tipped me off that this hotel is not prepared for power outages or brown outs. It seems that with the extremely humid and hot weather San Diego was experiencing while I was there (90% humidity & 93 degrees), a brownout had occurred that knocked the hotel off the Internet and no one could bring it back. I was told by the front desk that if I had an iPhone, I could use that instead. How fortunate for me (not!). Again, poor guest services and a bad (sarcastic) solution for $138 a night. The air conditioning in the hotel was also affected by this brownout. Air conditioning was intermittent the 3.5 days I was a guest. I was on the 9th floor and the hallways, elevators and common areas were suffocating! At one point, my room had no air, but I was able to open the sliding door, though it was hardly fresh: my balcony overlooked the freeway and the open door invited the hot, humid air with the 100+ decibel freeway noise into the room. Only two elevators of the three available worked at any given time. Wait times were average. The rooms have just been redecorated and are very pleasing--contemporary and well-appointed with big screen monitors and a nice selection of channels. The front desk was always courteous and this and the newly decorated rooms are why I am giving the Doubletree Mission Valley a 2.

I managed to take a trolley car (or two) and a ferry to go to Coronado Island. I rented a bike on the Island and biked to the beach. What a lovely day. On another day, I took the trolley car and the bus to go to La Jolla Beach( it took a little more than an hour to get there but I don't mind) where I kayaked and went to a lovely Italian restaurant named Pita. The bus I took to go to La Jolla also passes many other beaches. I also took the trolley car to go to Old Towne San Diego. I took the trolley car to go downtown to the Gas Lamp district for dinner.

One drawback is the for-fee internet, which is more than $13/day. What is the point of that? It's not the fastest internet anyway. If you must, you can use the internet in the business center. My advice is to ask for a room that faces the trolley, which is slightly more free of freeway noise.

But if you like to grab some items, eat casually without waiter service (which I do) and take food back to your room, this is not possible. The valet parking was also quite below acceptable standards. They do have a valet parking stand at the entrance. However, the valet doubles as the bellman and never once in 9 chances came out, even when he could see a car arrive from his bell stand.

On the positive side, the room is huge \u2013 bigger by European or even American standards, bed and linens are soft and comfortable, the location is good, and I like their environment-friendly policies and Neutrogena toiletries. The hotel has adapted a CARE culture and seems to be genuine in their commitment to making their guests\u2019 stay pleasurable. However, the staff who received us upon check-in seemed to have had a bad day - we were left to wait for 5 minutes before we were entertained (he was on the phone), didn\u2019t apologize for keeping us wait, and didn\u2019t bother to utter welcoming words, and the check in itself was slow. This normally doesn't concern me a great deal but it was 9:30pm when we arrived in the hotel and our 11-month old baby was already sleeping after a long 8-hour car ride from Williams, Arizona. All we needed was to get the hotel key quick and deal with the payment etc afterwards. (She woke up eventually at the lobby while waiting). Also, upon check-in, guests are supposed to receive freshly baked chocolate chip cookie as a symbol of their warm hospitality but we didn\u2019t get that either. Not that it matters really. But the gesture would have been appreciated. I had been a hotel desk receptionist in my younger years so I understand the importance of customer service to a certain degree and I must say I was disappointed when we checked in because after all, first impression lasts. Meanwhile, contrary to what\u2019s advertised in the website, internet connection wasn\u2019t free in my case for some reason. I was automatically directed to a Hilton HHonors website where I was supposed to pay the internet by credit card or otherwise charged to my room. And there is no refrigerator either. I should have known about this earlier but I just thought this is a given \u2013 a basic room amenity. And again, maybe I was a bit na\u00efve but I was expecting complimentary water since there is a coffeemaker and complimentary Wolfgang Puck coffee for free. Instead, an Icelandic water bottle is available for US5. And parking costs as well. In general, I'm not too keen on hotels that have hiddgen costs for things that normally should be available for free or at least these small fees should just be included in the room charge.

You can tell at some point in time these rooms were updated, probably not that long ago but it was only to mask what was hidden underneath. The obvious was the \u201cpopcorn\u201d ceiling. The minute you see any hotel with \u201cpopcorn\u201d ceiling will probably mean there will be some short-comings.. ie: cheap d\u00e9cor, old fixtures like bathtub drains or under the sink plumbing, dirty tile grout, old doors, peeling wallpaper, rusting walls, no microwave, no fridge and old TV\u2019s instead of newer flat screens, (tubes are so 80\u2019s!). This place had all of the above. Now let me say it\u2019s not a bad hotel, just don\u2019t expect much as far as luxury or cleanliness. Its basically a hotel that had gone through a very decent upgrade, minus a couple of things but has gone through the mills since then. I think that its just as if this hotel goes through so many occupants that it just couldn\u2019t handle it\u2026 here\u2019s another example: The have 2 gas fire pits out near the outdoor pool. The fire pit spits out 3 fires through fire rings and lava rocks. Well on one of the fire pits only 2 of the 3 fire rings were working. Upon further inspection the next morning in day light I took noticed that the third fire ring that wasn\u2019t working was so beyond rusted it had brittled away. So this means it has not been replaced for quite some time. Two pools are better than one! Now they got that right, to include allowing you to swim in the indoor one 24/7. The outdoor pool is very spacious and little one\u2019s will have a grand time floating around the 3 \u00bd foot deep side of the pool while all the rowdy teenagers put each other on their shoulders and wrestle on the 5 foot side. On the other hand the jacuzzi is super small. Its max capacity is 6. Seems kind of odd when you have two sizeable pools and everyone keeps sneaking up to the jacuzzi to check if there\u2019s an open spot to warm up from the cool May California breeze. It has a decent hotel gym and a nice sauna. The food is ok. Window Lounge had a small but hearty menu. Be sure to get the breakfast package when staying because I can see Applebees right across the way getting old every morning. At least with the breakfast package you can mix up your omelet to your liking every day. Speaking of Applebees, its not a far walk from the hotel. It\u2019s gotten bad reviews on other sites but if you know what you want it is a decent choice for food to go at pool side. The All American Grill is also next to the hotel and serves great food but can be a bit loud especially if a games going on. Go Lakers! As mentioned by previous reviewers this place is in a great location! Literally walk and shop! Well for me, my favorite was Yogurtland. For my wife, Barnes and Noble and of course\u2026 Starbucks. There\u2019s Mexican, Japanese, Fast food and a grocery store within walking distance. There\u2019s a movie theater within yards and a trolley station across the street that will take you just about all directions in San Diego.

This is my secound time staying here and there is a reason why I decided to book here again.

We arrived early and the from desk gave us a few options if we wanted to check in early. For us it dident matter so we took a 3rd floor room and we were happy. At night I can understand peoples complaints about the freeway (our windows were open the entire time we were there) but the noise really wasent that bad at all, and as forthright trolly noise couldent hear it go by at night. (trolly service ends at midnight). Since we disent opt to rent a car we payed 14$ for a 4 day trolly pass which also covers transit. We went to seaworld (can be accessed by bus) or around a 18$ cab ride from the hotel, we also went to th zoo and it ended up being a 19$ cab ride there. So great location to both of these places. We took the trolly then bus to mission beach which was about a 15 min ride. Fashion valley mall is worth checking out when our staying there it's the next stop on the trolly from the hotel. All in all great hotel, great service and it's worth talking to the guys who grab cars and call taxis they know alot about places around the area. I shouldent also mention they allowed us to check out an hour later, but I'm sure that depended on how full the hotel was.

In essence, what once was a well run and excellent property has slid into mediocrity on many levels over the last two years. My understanding is that they have had a change in management, which has not improved anything that I can see. In fact, just the opposite. In all fairness, much of the staff team has been there for years and many of them are excellent. It's the person making the strategic decisions, however, that I hold accountable. Housekeeping and maintenance have gone down hill. The pool areas and restrooms off the indoor pool are often filthy and without fresh towels. There was a change in the room srvice menu that left few choices, none especially well prepared from my experience. The property has been talking about a renovation for quite some time, yet little has been done. I am certain that this is a reflection of the economy, but for this hotel to remain competitive, it needs new management and an infusion of cash to update the rooms and facilities.

The hotel itself is situated in sprawly Mission Valley, sandwiched between two large malls and adjacent to a shopping center. We were hoping for something a bit more walkable, although it is nice to be just across the street from the trolley which can take you to nicer places with better restaurant choices. The nearby restaurant choices are limited to chains: denny's, applebee's, Joe's crab shack, \"all-american grill\", quizno's, and more if you head across the freeway to Fashion Valley Mall. We did so on foot, at our own risk, luckily were sidewalks but not many crosswalks so it was a bit hairy. The mall is literally less than half a mile away but like I said, it's not a very walkable area. The hotel is surrounded by busy boulevards and highways so freeway noise is noticeable, but to be expected in that area. Our room was advertised as a \"deluxe balcony\". This was perhaps the greatest disappointment. The balcony did not even have enough room to pull a chair out on, useful only for a smoking fix, although you're technically probably only supposed to do that in smoking rooms. The king bed was very comfy and good pillows too. Parking was a bit confusing, we accidentally came in the back way and so we drove through the shopping center and parked underground. The hotel website had advertised that parking was $18/day. I think if you entered the garage the front way maybe that was true, but the paid parking is easy to circumvent, lots of street and shopping center parking. The pool area is very nice and private with good tree cover, but not too much to get in the way of tanning. Would be a good place for kids. There is also an indoor spa that I did not go in but looked nice and seemed to be working. There are two large firepits outside by the pool adjacent to the bar, which would be a good place to hang out and have a drink, however the drinks at the bar \"Windows\" were outrageously priced. An amber ale was $6.25 and a Coors light was $5.75. Ridiculous. A 4-6pm happy hour brings those prices down, but only by a bit. We dined in the restaurant for breakfast, they had a $19 buffet, we went ala carte instead, which was decent, though pricey. Service was friendly, but slow and they seemed understaffed considering it was a Chargers game and they should have expected to be busy. They give you a warm cookie when you check in and one at turn down service. A nice touch. I would stay here again, but only if they keep the price of the room low. I would also bring my own alcohol.

The hotel is located at a nexus of highways, so it's easy to get from here to just about anywhere else (SD traffic notwithstanding). It's right next to a few strip malls that have a lot of dining options, so that's pretty handy. They do charge to park your car, but there is a lot of free parking just across the street (but be SURE that you're parking in an allowed area, since one side of the street is not and will get you towed). The people at the front desk were very nice and helpful. The free chocolate chip cookies they give you on arrival were a nice touch. Our room was very nicely decorated and was very comfortable. The view isn't great, and since it's near so many highways, there is a bit of background noise, but we were on a high floor, so it didn't bother us that much.

I was a little worried about the location being further from the sites but it turned out perfect for us. My children (3 and 6) loved riding the train into downtown and Old Town for our sightseeing. We bought a multiday pass for the MTS and used the trains to get everywhere. Due to our HHonors status we were given access to the executive floor. The service was wonderful here. We met the kindest lady who managed this room and looked after us each morning for breakfast. She even offered to bring us coupons for Legoland that she had at home. After our day at the zoo the children were too exhausted to drag to a restaurant and we made our dinner out of the snacks at evening reception. This is not something I would normally do (we love to eat out), but it was the perfect solution for us that night. We also experienced outstanding service from the front desk. Upon our arrival at the airport, we called the Doubletree to request the free airport shuttle. We were told it would be 40 minutes before they could pick us up, so we should just take a cab and they would pay for it. Of course the cab driver said he would not wait for the hotel to pay. So as my husband was getting our bags and handing over our credit card to pay for the cab I walked inside to be met by the bellman who was waiting specifically for us. When I told him my husband was paying he literally ran outside and stopped the cab driver from taking my husband's card. What could have been a very bad first impression of the hotel turned out to be an excellent first impression. By the way, while the shuttle is free from the airport to the hotel, when you are needing transportation back to the airport it is $10 a person. Our children were free though. We swam in both pools (indoor and outdoor) used the exercise facilities and the hot tub. The gym was quite busy when we were there. Our only complaint would be the internet service. There was no free connection in the room and a charge to use the business center computers. My husband took his lap top to the lobby one night to take advantage of the free wifi in the lobby and found that even down there getting a connection was a problem.

I would have to say that this hotel location of Doubletree is great, I would definitely return. I would just hope some minor details would be focused on. I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past year and I like it, I really do, however it does not impress me. The building itself along with its surroundings are beautiful as would be expected. The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful, I don\u2019t think I ever heard any staff member say no to a guest request. There parking is ample, although not free, is covered and patrolled by security, which puts my mind at ease a little. The elevators are decent looking although they could probably use some work, judging by the creaking sound they make whenever they open or close. The room is very nice, although somewhat on the small size compared to Hilton rooms, still ample enough to move around and not feel confined. I was however disappointed that Doubletree has not joined the digital age yet and is still sticking with the old analog television set, until it dies I would imagine. The bathroom was a bit on the small side but gives enough room to get done what needs to be done. The d\u00e9cor is more on the garden themed side, compared to the contemporary modern d\u00e9cor you would fine in such hotels as the newely renovated Courtyard by Mariott. The room has a built in thermostat which works very well, and the bed, well the bed is amazing. Never before have I slept in such a comfortable bed, very soft and fluffy. Although everytime I seem to put my head on a pillow it just sinks down, I find myself stacking pillows just in order to keep my head propped up. The service is quick and friendly, they even deliver an edition of the paper weekday mornings right to your doorstep. Housekeeping overall is very good at what they do, however they do have a little lack of attendtion to detail. Nothing major but when I see smudges on the mirrors or wallpaper peeling off I begin to wonder if this is really a 3 \u00bd star establishment or some low end 3 star inn. I would expect more attention to detail in such a classy hotel. The restaurant was horrible, I ate there on two separate occasions in hopes that the food would get better the second time around, unfortunately it did not. The food was bland and tastless, and although looking amazing was rather disappointing. One last note on the parking, even though the spots are ample, parking is extremely tight, even for a small compact car. Keep that in mind when your deciding whether to take the Hummer or the Camry down. Although I would like to see more attention focused on cleaning the hotel rooms properly, and possibly some new chef\u2019s hired in the restaurant, I still give this hotel a big thumbs up. I am always happy when I enter the Doubletree and I never want to leave. I would definitely recommend eating somewhere else for breakfast, and hopefully down the line they decide to upgrade the televisions to flat panel, but other than that I can\u2019t wait to come back to this wonderful hotel.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Braunschweig, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood deal but beware of additional fees\u201d", "Author": "dl2hbx", "ReviewID": "UR28524044", "Content": "Pro: Good deal on Hotwire Amenities Large room Con: Parking fees Internet fees Breakfast not included Expensive Shuttle Road noise from Highways Broken shower Indoor Pool out of order Not the most recent hotel No fridge, no microwave The hotel is a three star property that we got for a very good rate on Hotwire.

The coffee fixings were better than average - Wolfgang Puck brand and they actually didn't taste like sawdust. The room was quiet and the beds were better than average. Bathroom had little counterspace. Ate breakfast at the cafe on site (Fountains Cafe). while picturesque, the fountain also made it difficult to carry on a conversation due to the splashing water sounds.

The first time was about 5 years ago. They have since remodeled. They have added flat screen televisions and bunk beds in what they call their family suite.

It was extremely noisy and since I had also requested not to be near an ice machine or an elevator when I booked the room, I asked to be moved. The second room had two televisions but was right by the elevator. Again very noisy. There was some teacher's convention going on at the hotel and they were very full, so we had to stay there for the night.

The third time was a charm. Though I preffered the bathroom set up in the first room we had better. Each room was a little different. All of them had bunk beds for the kids but one had a king bed and the other two had two queen beds. The on site restaurant I thought was over priced, but fortunately being so perfectly located in Mission Valley, there were plenty of other places to eat away from the hotel. The pool is nice. My kids had a great time in it. For the price I paid and having to play musical rooms, I was not overly impressed. The chocolate chip cookies that they give you at check in do not make up for the inconvenience or the $14 a day self parking fee that they charge. (Note: There is nowhere else to park so you are stuck with the fee.) Nor does it make up for the high cost of eating at their onsite restaurant.

That's deceptive: in no way is the Mission Valley Doubletree the fifth best hotel in San Diego. Disadvantages: - Location. As others have noted, the hotel is surrounded by highways. It is also surrounded by big box stores and strip malls. Because it is neither downtown nor in a residential area, there are almost no sidewalks and it isn't a great area to walk around at night. I noticed some people call this hotel convenient because it is on the trolley line. The trolley itself isn't terribly convenient--it's really far better to stay downtown, or near the water. - Parking: the Doubletree is next to a HUGE parking lot, half of which is totally free (associated with shopping mall). The $12/fee is leveed on the honors system, which means that you'll feel dishonest if you don't pay, and like a sucker if you do. - no in-room fridge. This is a must for business hotels. Even much less expensive properties have in-room fridges for leftovers and drinks. - Location. Think of the city or town you live in. Would you recommend that tourists stay 20 minutes out of town in the shopping mall district, or near some of your city's greatest attractions like the gaslamp district, zoo, or surfing beaches? We were there for a conference , but ran into other guests who were on vacation and upset that they were miles from the water.

(It is only actually a few miles from downtown.. but w/ California traffic; it is about a 10-15 minute drive) The hotel is also right across the street from the Trolley; which we did take advantage of the first night we were there. We took the trolley to seaport village. It is definitely worth taking for the experience.. especially if you have young children..they will love it! One caveat though.. make sure you have small bills to purchase the tickets from the self serve machines. We only had a $20 and my husband had to run back to the hotel to get change because the ticket machine only gives up to a few dollars in change.

My family and I were out and about all day so we didn't get to use the outdoor pool, which closed at 10 pm..but the indoor pool is open 24 hours which was nice and we did go for a late night swim at 11 pm. :o) There are firepits outside next to the outdoor pool, which looked very nice to sit next to. There are also lighted tennis courts at the hotel. The fitness room was under renovation when we were there; but they were offering passes to the YMCA which was located right next door.

I have no complaints. This hotel was very very clean! And there are 2 pools for the kids and a nice hot tub!

There is TECHNICALLY a $12 daily charge to park, but at the recommendation of Trip Advisor reviews, we just parked and took a chance. We had no issues, and saved $60 - nothing to sneeze about!

The room was quite comfortable and well appointed, including two phones with internet ports and the usual array of toiletries. The hotel has convenient access to two interstates and a metro \"trolley\" that runs frequently to many areas of interest, yet it is sufficiently insulated from most traffic noise. There are a number of restaurants and small shops in the Hazard Center next door, and other shopping and so forth within easy walking distance. Our dissatisfactions were these: (1) The hotel has a Fountain Cafe, its only dining facility, that is described as being open at all three usual mealtimes, but in fact has not been open for dinner for some months, according to two employees. They said this is due to the availability of several good restaurants nearby. The full Fountain menu was reportedly available in the lounge; we tried it once and the food was well below average. We never saw more than three occupied tables in the Cafe for breakfast, so we decided to eat that meal elsewhere as well. (2) The plumbing noises from the adjacent room were quite loud, and obviously came from each one of the fixtures as it was used. When we complained to the front desk, we were told that no other room was available. (3) Parking in the covered garage costs $12 per day, and there is a disclaimer of responsibility that includes no guarantee that the garage will be monitored. Indeed, we never saw anyone resembling a security person. The access gate was always in the open position, and so no key card was issued to guests who paid for this service. (4) There is a small \"concierge\" desk just inside the lobby doors. One of the staff there was borderline rude when we asked for advice and directions. Most of the employees, however, were quite cordial and helpful. We understand that Hilton Honors has recently increased by quite a lot the number of points required to stay here.
