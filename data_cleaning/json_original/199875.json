When I asked to first see the Double Studio room that I had booked in advance, my request was denied and was told that it was company policy to first complete the payment. I had a bad feeling about this place and if I hadn\u2019t arrived late that evening at around 11pm, I would have gone elsewhere. On seeing my room, I realised that my fears had been justified! I was shocked and disappointed to discover that my Double Studio apartment was actually a tiny room with some kitchen appliance built into a wardrobe. To make things worse, the TV and phone did not work at all and there was a horrible stench of sewage coming into the room. Despite raising my issues with the receptionist/ manager, nothing was done to resolve the situation since they had already been paid for the entire stay. I was promised that I would be moved to another room but on the next day the manager did not seem to care and no action was taken. I repeat, DO NOT STAY HERE!

We stayed at the Philbeach Gardens, Earls Court. The photos are NOT accurate. You can do better than this even in London for this price range. 1. Do not sign up for an extended stay (more than three days per the hotel rules). We wanted to leave after 8 days of our 13 day stay, but we had paid for the full stay in advance, and the clerk pointed out the policy posted on the wall in the lobby: no refunds for extended stay. Pay a day at a time if you insist on staying here. There were plenty of open rooms. 2. Even for a discount rate in London, this one is not worth the money. Our room was 10 x 10 feet at most. The bed took up the bulk of the floor space. Upon entry, the room smelt of sewer fumes. The kitchenette took up the rest ... at least it worked. 3. The quality of the room renovation was poor. Paint job was sloppy. The furniture was real cheap and worn. 4. The tiling on the bathroom walls were cracked, and the shower handle fell off. Two of the lights did not work. The halls were noisy because of the wood floors. Other guests were noisy. The windows did not in the least keep out any of the street noise. Bring your earplugs! 5.

I was given the 'Best room' on the top floor for which I paid top $ for. It was a dump. in fact It was so bad it was funny. Bearing in mind it was November - we arrived to find the windows wide opened. This was because the heating was unable to be turned off. the room was on the Earls Court road, so our choice was either road noise or heat stroke. There was no TV remote - as apparently the previous occupier had run off with it!. So we were advised to climb on a chair to reach the TV controls on top of the wall mounted TV. The shower was amazing - no idea you could get that many cracks in tiles and the novelty toilet seat [it was not attached so kept falling off] was fun too. But I think the highlight of our stay was the bed collapsing at 3 am. It is a cheap bed with removable wooden struts under the mattress - which when you moved - came out. Needless to say I asked for the manager - who apparently does not actually exist - so I was given a phone number to call the day after I left. As of course you have to pre pay - the attitude of the 'management' appeared to be ' we have your money, so we dont care how good /bad your stay was' Interesting experience and if you want an urban endurance course experience or are possessed with a masochistic streak - this is certainly the place for you.

So we got our suitcases and walked back to Earls Court to speak to the Management in Person. We was met by a Receptionist who initially wouldn't get the Manager but eventually someone can out to us, got some keys and showed us two rooms (amazing as we was told that they were fully booked). Not one word of sorry for the terrible experience we had suffered. We stayed the night as we could got find an alternative for the evening at such short notice. Be warned that the building is dangerous, exposed electrical wires and inadequate fire precautions. Terrible, terrrible place. In a nutshell - The scam is to pretend Hotel is fully booked, show you a filthy alternative, try to squeeze more money from you by showing you somewhere clean but for double the original price quoted.

Upon check-in we were requested to pay the full amount of our stay in advance (quite unusual, travelled around the world never experienced such terms and conditions, hah); without the full advance payment we were denied to see our room (or any rooms for that matter) and to our query were told this is their Company Policy. It may start to shine on you at this point already that such precondition is part of their PAY or get 'stuck' scheme as the website agent already reserved \u00c5\ufffd100 on my bank account to secure our online booking. Hey, the studio apartments are about 2x2.5 meters, so it's either you stand or lie in bed - no running around, and my son has a single bed the size of these ridiculous 'doubles' :))) Later in the evening after our ungracious check-in (remind you: after the full advance payment of 4 nights!) we ran into some sanitary and health problems (broken tiles, broken shower plexy glass, broken metal hangers in the shower room, mildew, etc) which we immediately reported at the reception and asked for another room. We were offered an 'upgrade' at \u00c5\ufffd80 surcharge and shown a decent (but still miniscule) room which we denied claiming we booked a superior room in the booking system where there no 'luxury room' options - only rooms at fixed prices. Next morning after a refreshing sleep in the 'mini double bed' (140x190 dubbed a double?) massaged by broken springs in the matress we were greeted by the happy bedbugs. I didn't miss out the chance to give one little guy 15 minutes fame on camera prior to final termination. This really had us going and we were ready to move out immediately. We offered the receptionist an amicable solution with them granting us a refund and us leaving in peace (i.e. forgetting all the nuances of our stay and not following-up on the story). We were confronted with ignorance and absolute denial by an obnoxious receptionist (the same one who claimed their company policy is to show our room only upon full payment). I asked to talk to the manager and was told she is not on the premises, I also was denied any contact to the property manager/owner (name or contact telephone number). Hey, she was the invisible woman with no mobile number in the 21st century! We checked-out nevertheless and agreed to come back at 1.00 PM to meet the manager and discuss the issue. We returned at 1.00 PM - of course no manager was around - and were told that the manager will not be on the premises that day. We were again denied any assistance and contact to the hotel management. At this point asking for a full refund and/or invoice we were denied both by the receptionist. As we checked into another hotel by then (of course not into a free room) I made an official complaint at the police as we were not given any invoice OR refund - I was there with my pants down - who knows what lies could have followed if we don't record the issue. Further to this - following some helpful legal advise - I have made an official complaint at the Health Department of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. These were needed for the records to avoid any future lies by the Hotel. Eventually we got an invoice from the hotel 2 days after (!) after our check-out only with the direct assistance and presence of a helpful Borough policeman. No refund was paid by Dylan Earls Court, meaning we are short of GBP 360, not to mention all the stress and ordeal as you can imagine.

Upon calling to confirm the reservation, I was informed the location was changed to their \"newly acquired\" property near Earls Court. Not as convenient, but ok. If it was a new property, I assumed it would be comparable to the Dylan House location I had originally booked with. We arrived at Philbeach Court location, and curousily were told we were at the wrong location, that we were booked for another property. Granted we were a bit tired after a day of travel, and didn't want to cross the city late at night to chase down the right hotel booking, so I asked if she could please see if we could stay here. With a deep sigh, a room was found. We needed to pay up front, for three nights, cash only. The 3 weary travellors then went up to room 27. I'll have to say that honestly, the room was beyond unacceptable. My husband is a simple Missouri man, and doesn't get too fussed about things; but even this caught him off guard. The bathroom is perched up two filthy, carpeted stairs, and the \"door\" to the bathroom is a bifold closet door! So, when you are inside, it can't be opened of course, since closet bifold doors are not designed to be operated from the inside... As expected, the bathroom is small, but I've never seen one this small. The toilet shifted as did the sink whenever used -- as if they were not installed properly. The \"kitchenette\" is a small cabinet, and awkward for even the simplist of tasks (like hot water). The walls had not been painted in some time, as evidenced by scrapes, dents, smudges and various unsavory splotches of unknown origin. There was an exposed nail on one of the steps leading up to the bathroom(wear shoes!); the light switches had a grubby sticky look. One generally got the feeling this was not a respectable hotel. Now, I will have to inform you one thing the room did have going for it :clean sheets and towels. Thin, a bit thread worn, but clean. What a relief! HAD the room been comfortably under 100 pounds per night, I might not have too much to complain about. London is a very expensive city. But, we paid 130 pounds a night (or about $210). One thing that would have turned things around was some effort on the part of Dylan Properties to care about our experience. We had requested to check out a night early. We could indeed leave early, but without any any sort of refund, partial, minimal, or otherwise. And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the full extent of the front desk \"customer service\". No one even asked if if we wanted a different room; or if there was something they could do to make our stay more comfortable, etc. We went to a few hotels right in the neighborhood to see if it was just us, or were all hotels like this? We found the Mayflower Hotel, one block up, for an additional 30 GBP a night, and booked that for our last (4th)night. This hotel is AMAZING: the room had a full kitchen, tastefully and well thought out furnishings, and breakfast is included! After returning home (we are from Seattle, but living in Germany for a short spell), I spent some time communicating with the booking agency to relate our experience and concerns. I was told twice, over a period of 3 weeks, that \"they were working on it\",\"so sorry your experience was not good\" etc etc. I even suggested a couple of things they could offer to make up for our experience: vouchers for future trip; refund one night; anything. To date I have not heard back a word. Emails to the addresses listed on the Dylan house website have been returned as undeliverable. If this review is helpful please indicate. I'm sure our experience is not normal for London hotels over 130GBP per night; but your best bet is to stick with recommended hotels from guides, such as Rick Steves.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middlesbrough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOn the Positive Side our rooms had several walls without Cracks...\u201d", "Author": "DylanSurvivor", "ReviewID": "UR108040886", "Content": "At the Dylan Court you could be treated to...

Here is my overview: 1. The booking process was fairly easy at the website. THE WARNING: The site owners mention that this is NOT their website. It supposedly belongs to some company called Adverstising On Line (AOL). Hence changes to the reservation cannot be made onsite - any changes made are not honoured. In short, even though the website carries their brand, they do not honour their commitment 2. Check In : Fairly smooth process. You have to pay the entire amount up front. Read the contract carfully!!! 3. Rooms : I had got the standard double room. The photographs on the site are not at all representative of the room. The room is dilapidated and is smaller than you could imagine. The linen is old. There are broken appliances lying in the room. Another point - Wi-FI is not included in the room rate, though there is no mention of a charge on the website. One look at the room and a smell of the place and I wanted to check out. 4. Customer Service : I confirmed with the desk when i could check out from the site without a penalty. The contract signed says that anything over three days is a long term stay. However, the gentleman at the reception assured me that i could check out after 48 hours without a penalty. I made alternate bookings based on this. However, when i went to check out, the hotel manager refused to honour that commitment. They said the employee was new and there was no refund for the two extra days (that were committed to me) since it was mentioned in the sign-in contract. Further, since i did not book directly with them(there is no webiste for this), they could not change the reservation. In short, they have stolen GBP 150 from me as a result of this. Please avoid this location - the management is dishonest. 5. Location : The property is well located on Warwick road in Earl's court and a short walk from Kensington High Street. Be warned, however, that it is on a busy street and you will hear traffic all night and all day. 6. Other : There is a penalty of GBP 50 for not returning the key - be very careful about this if you are still adventurous and decide to stay at this site. This is an absurd charge and something you need to be cognizant of.

The kitchette consisted on a very small cupboard with a microwave, kettle, hotplate and sink. This very small space was a massive fire hassard! There was a sign explaining how to use a fire blanket but no sign of a fire blanket or extinguisher in sight!! The bath had the taps at one end and the plug/overflow pipe at the other.

The bathroom was the smallest bathroom i've ever seen, i'd say if you were above average weight you wouldn't be able to turn around in the bathroom, or the shower, I struggled at 9stone! My partner and I had to brush our teeth one at a time as we both couldn't fit in. There was a gaping hole in the shower wall, no window and very dark. The hairdryer was an ancient brown plastic box mounted to the wall which wasn't even connected to the tube which blew out pathetic air. The room was ridiculously hot but the sash window didn't stay open so we had to prop it open with a wicker basket. When getting ready we had to leave the main door open just to let some air in. Nowhere to store anything, we had to do things one at a time as there just wasn't the room.

They were renovating further down the building and i'm assuming the part we stayed in, where reception is, is yet to be done. Also, i know they always advertise their best rooms and pics on websites, but this is totally false advertising at it's best. The only positive thing is the location, about a minute walk from Earls Court tube which is on the Picadilly line for the City.

I said this would not be acceptable, as we had booked for 6 nights and were working and did not want to have to change half way through our stay. They reluctantly agreed to let us stay in that room. WELL, when we were shown to my room I nearly laughed- it was nothing like the pictures on the internet, and it was a tiny dark damp room with two bare beds with old brown blankets on them, the bathroom door was a folding \"curtain\" door. The bed bases were bare, and the curtain was half hanging off the window. There were damp stains on the walls and broken light fittings. I complained and explained that we did not want to stay in that room, and that they had misrepresented themselves online. We were then shown to another room which had a double bed and 2 singles, was pretty shabby but an improvement on the last one, so we stayed in that one the night. In the morning, we discovered that both of us were completely covered in BED BUG bites. We packed our things and went to reception, where they told us there was nothing they could do. We called Wotif and got a refund. This hotel is staffed with liars, who try to cover up everything, and the whole place should be shut down due to environmental health. I have never been so disgusted in my life.

So we said that was unacceptable and we were offered a single room & a double room. So we first went to check out the double...only fit for someone under 5ft tall! The bed was tiny, there was no space between the toilet & the walls and the bathroom was like a dungeon - you had to step down into it & it was dark & the light fitting was hanging off the ceiling!

I then sat on the bed to decide whether to complain about the damp smell & realised that the bed covers were damp...so back up to reception. I was then given a key for room 2 - not an electronic key like the other rooms but an actual key, the receptionist led me out front to what I can only describe as an outhouse! Because of needing somewhere to stay I just accepted it as it wasn't damp. The bathroom was also again very very low and as my friend was 6ft 2\" he wasn't going to have a comfortable shower in any of the rooms! I then realised there was no kitchenette, wardrobe, microwave, tea/coffee facilities or for that matter anything else that was supposed to be in every room!

We were a bit disappointed that it was more expensive than our first choice AND breakfast was not included, but not wanting to go to another altogether unfamiliar part of London, we took it anyway. The first impression was quite good: a nice, clean reception, professional-looking, though it soon became quite clear that one of the receptionists was new. Checkin went quite slow, also because her English wasn't all that clear, but you know, new job, we've all been there. And anyway, we were on holiday, so it's not like we were in a rush. The lift was not working, so we had to climb the stairs to our room on the second floor, where we encountered our first obstacle: the keycard didn't work. Well, it did eventually, but only after about 5,000 tries. We were a tad annoyed about that, but we let it go. Don't want to start complaining after 5 minutes of being here. The room, on first glance, looked okay. Very small, but being budget travellers, we're sort of used to that. We did notice on closer inspection that the plastic cover had fallen off the fire alarm, and that the front of the bath had come off exposing the wooden board behind. All the curtains were closed when we came in, and it being a rare sunny day in January, Di decided to open them and look out. Big mistake. As soon as she gave the curtain a pull, the rail came off the ceiling! The room being quite high, and we being quite short, we couldn't put it back up, so we told the receptionist \"the curtain has fallen down\" and she promised to have someone in to fix it for us. However, when we came back that evening after a visit to the theatre, it was to find that only the fire alarm had been fixed, but the curtain was still crumpled on the carpet as when we left. Clearly someone had been in, and I wonder how they could possibly have missed that. Anyway, it being quite late, we decided to leave it for the moment, even though our window turned out to be right in front of a street light so that we didn't sleep much. On our first morning in this hotel we woke up stiff and cold, because the blankets were really quite thin. When trying to make tea in the little kitchenette, we soon figured out that there was no power to the socket where we were supposed to plug the kettle in. We put the kettle on the nightstand and plugged it in there, where it did work. Also, we had to test the little cups of milk in the fridge in a glass of water first, as some were past their sell-by date. When we came back from a brilliant day in London, we found our curtain still on the floor, even though the maid had been in and must have noticed it as well. When Di wanted to go for a shower it turned out that our used (and still wet!) towels had simply been picked up off the floor and folded up again! So, yeah, not much good to be said about this place. The staff are very friendly even though they don't actually solve your problems, and try to be helpful with questions about London transport and so on. But if you want (more) value for your money, we do suggest trying your luck elsewhere. There are a lot more of these kinds of hotels in London that are cheaper and do offer you breakfast, and may even have rooms that don't fall apart.

A couple of years we found out that my wife suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and has problems with her balance. She now uses a so called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rollator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd i.e. a walking aid on wheels, not a wheelchair. For our purpose we were looking for a hotel suitable for handicapped people. To store the medication for my wife the hotel had to have a private fridge as well. In the available Dutch brochures the only one we found was York Hotel. The hotel is situated in our favourite area, Earl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court, shops, restaurants and the busstops nearby. (I mention busstops specificly, despite the fact that Earl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court Underground Station is wheelchair-friendly - I checked it personnally - and as long as not every Underground Station is wheelchair-friendly, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll use the busses. After all, what we do have is time, but this aside). We stayed there from January 24th untill January 28th 2006. The first hurdle a handicapped person faces is the hotel entrance. Always stairs, 4, 5 or more steps to get to the entrance doors. The entrance of York Hotel is excellent. The distance from the fence to the hotel entrance is about 4 yards. The distance is covered by platforms, every platform is large, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, large enough for a wheelchair. Every next platform is raised about 5 inches, so getting into the hotel is a piece of cake. The only minus point is that the platforms are very smooth, they could be slippery when they are wet. One has to be cautious. The receptionists we spoke to were all very kind and helpful, and so was the other staff. We were given room no. 15, ground level. A large room divided in two parts; a bathroom and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153living\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. At first glance the room is suitable for handicapped people, but looking at it with a critical eye you see a lot of shortcomings, as if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done in a slapdash way; Yes, there is a spacious bathroom, a very good shower and a toilet especially equipped for handicapped people. No complaints on this front. On the other hand, the drain cover is about an inch below the shower floor, this is dangerous. When you by accident step on the edge of the draincover you easily can lose your balance and fall. Yes, the bathroom is provided with a red emergency cord, but when you slip and fall in the bathroom and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand up again you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to reach the emergency cord: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situated in the wrong place, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too short. It should not hang down from a wall, but cover all the walls in a horizontal way about a foot from the floor. We notified the staff about the shortcomings but nothing was done about it. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153livingroom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd itself is not very large. Rather small actually. Bed on one side, wardrobe and kitchenette on the opposite side and a very small path in between. The fridge in the kichenette met our requirements. There is just enough room left to store your luggage (including our rollator). There is no room available underneath the bed to store luggage. This space is taken by a massive wooden box. The bed is too small for two people to be comfortable. The small path is not level with the floor. Halfway it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little elevated. When you are not aware of this you might fall. There is no room to fall forward or backwards, only sideways. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get stuck between the massive wooden box underneath the bed and the wardrobe/kitchenette/fridge unit. To get up again you must be a contorsionist. In this room a handicapped person cannot be left alone! You will find a flat screen TV on the wall. A deposit must be paid in advance for the remote control. Only a few channels could be found. We informed the management about this, but nothing was done about it. (Where did I read all this before?) A ventilator completes the furniture. The breakfast restaurant is situated in the basement. An elevator takes you there. Standard is a simple continental breakfast, extra charge for a full English breakfast. We had fried and/or scrambled eggs, sausages daily, and toast, jam, milk, orange juice, coffee and/or tea as much as we liked. A full stomach to start the day. Reading the latest reviews from the beginning of 2007 I am afraid that nothing has been changed to the better. York Hotel is not mentioned anymore in the Dutch 2007/2008 winter brochures.
