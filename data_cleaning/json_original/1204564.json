{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fantastic! Spent two nights at Chic  Basic Bruc apartments. There were three of us in a one bedroom apartment which was very clean and spacious. On arrival, we telephoned the office so that their representative would meet us with the key (card system) and we only waited approximately 10 minutes. We were shown around and then were left to settle in. The bedroom contained two beds, used either as a double or two singles and there was a further double sofa bed in the lounge, all of which were very comfortable. Bed linen and duvets and ample towels were provided and these were very clean.The heating system worked wonderfully and there was no noise at night. It was possible to hear the metro if you listened carefully, but there was no noise to disturb you, whether awake or asleep.All in all, we had a fantastic time and the apartments are in a superb location in Barcelona. We will definitely be using these apartments again and will hopefully try some other Chic  Basic accommodation in the future.", "Date": "Dec 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR770427927", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RepTrougher"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1204564-r23116779-Chic_and_Basic_Bruc_Apartments-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "1204564", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
