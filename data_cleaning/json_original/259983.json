Alitalia cancelled our flight and the representative had the gall to assure our 6 women travelers that this was a \u201c4-star\u201d hotel when we inquired. I\u2019d like to see her send her mother to this place. Bad karma, my dear. Wallpaper in the hallways literally peeled and hanging. The smell of disinfectant spray overwhelming from the first time you open the door to the hotel making it impossible to get a clean breath of air. Dim, dank atmosphere throughout the hotel. The curtains in the lobby crispy with dirt and festooned with webs. We knew we weren\u2019t staying from the start, but looked in the rooms just to be sure. Indescribable. Stained and shiny \u201cbedspreads\u201d (tarps?) over the beds, just filth everywhere. Mold. We should have taken a picture, but were too busy running away to think of it. The place screamed bedbugs and other things I don\u2019t even want to think about. We piled our bags on one of the lobby tables, so as not to have them touch the plastic, stained \u201csofas\u201d. The front desk attendant, to her credit, actually didn\u2019t speak to us at all, just robotically took our passports on arrival and handed them back as we left as if this is what she does over and over each day. Reminiscent of another weary traveler we watched attempting to access his room, swiping his card over and over, and just getting a red \u201cno access\u201d light. Like the hotel of the damned. Yes, we had the same hotel shuttle bus driver as described by a previous poster, surly was the perfect word, and I\u2019ll repeat it. And yes, he did use his cell phone most of the time while he was driving, making it impossible for us to use our phones because we couldn\u2019t hear over his shouting. We had him drive us back to the airport so we could get the Marriott shuttle. He liked to yell at us, not sure why, don\u2019t care. He works for a toilet, so that\u2019s his world. Escaped to the Courtyard Marriott who put the whole group up \u2013 I\u2019m used to this chain from business travel, but must say it was a cut above its usual good standard.

Restaurant was fantastic \u2013 clean and stylish, like the rest of the hotel. We had a lovely dinner, and outstanding breakfast the next morning, a buffet with every conceivable breakfast food, including a selection of different kinds of granolas, juices, yogurts, all kinds of fresh fruit in addition to all kinds of cereal, hot eggs and meats, cheeses, pastries. Beds were super comfortable, bathroom sparkling clean and a great Grohe shower. Front desk kindly provided us with some basics that we were missing. Business center was set up comfortably, and we were able to get everything done there. Hotel even provides multi-country voltage converters built in to the outlets. That was really helpful! Save yourself the horrible experience, especially if you are a woman traveler, your safety is so much more important than a free room.

Words really cannot describe it - The only thing I can say that is positive is that the bathroom was cleaner than the toilets in Rome airport. Which is not really saying very much. We were picked up by the shuttle bus - the 15 minutes I was told it takes were considerably more. Try 40. The hotel - It is not a 4 star. In fact it should not have any stars at all. One guy at reception answering the telephone and checking people in and out. Obviously not thrilled by his job judging by his general attitude and frankly I cannot blame him. I had to wait for him to answer x number of phone calls before I checked in. The room - dilapidated is actually a polite description. The archaic TV worked once I realised that everything was unplugged at the back. It was a hovel actually. Disgusting carpets, a bed spread that made you think twice about sitting on it. The furniture was falling to pieces and the room stank of air freshener. I decided to go down to the bar - which they had according to their info sheet. When I asked the guy at reception if they had one he laughed like I had asked whether they have a spa -which would have been very funny given the quality of the hotel - and said no Madame. So I had to go out along some singularly uninviting streets to find somewhere to have a coffee and something to eat. I decided to leave on the shuttle bus half an hour earlier having seen the traffic - If I had not been lucky enough to find a taxi I would still be waiting for it as it never appeared and I would have missed my flight.I was cheerfully assured by someone not to worry - that it would eventually come and that it is always late. It took me at least 25 mins to check out as the reception was inundated - I was 2nd in line but the receptionist was still on phone duty too. If I had been staying there for the night I would have left as I arrived. I was charged 100 Euro for the privilege of using the room.

I was traveling with my family, and we have two young kids ages 2 & 4. It had already been a long day, because of the delays, and we were a little relieved when they finally cancelled the flight (i.e. the kids were getting restless and tired and in need of a nap). The airline bused everyone on the flight to the Airport Palace Hotel for the night. The hotel sign does have 4 stars on the marquee, but it is obviously dated. The hotel staff quickly got everyone a room and a lunch buffet was setup and waiting after we dropped off our luggage in our room. Was it a great meal? No, of course not. The hotel had 300+ tired people check in with little notice. Was it satisfying? Yes, and they did keep bringing bottles of wine coming to the table. I am guessing that this hotel is only a refuge for stranded flyers, and has contracts with the airlines. I can't see anyone ending up at this hotel on their own. I have to laugh at some of the other reviews. Our room was clean, and the staff was trying hard to please. Bumped passengers are not people you want to deal with in the sevice industry. We asked a bell hop for directions to a nearby market to buy some milk for our two young kids. There was not a store close by that we could walk to. So the staff guy offers to run down the street to their sister hotel to get us a liter of milk. The guy gets the milk for us, and doesn't want to take any money for it. I gave him some euros regardless, and I appreciated his eagarness to help us out. The neighborhood? At first sight, I thought of a Chicago working class neighborhood with the numerous apartment buildings and the laundry hanging out to dry and kids hanging out at street corners. After eating, my wife, kids and I took a stroll around the neighborhood. We found a nice little park a few blocks away for the kids to play in, and we picked up some great dessert treats in a little family run bakery. We talked to some locals at the park, and everyone was super friendly. I never enjoy flight delays or cancellations, but I feel like it was a good experience for my family, and I think it will make us hardier travelers in the future.

It seems the entire clientele is there due to airlines or tour groups. We had no problems with service, cleanliness, the room or the food fortunately. The location is near the airport and the free shuttle from the airport (look for the big gray buses) is very handy. It is also near the train into Rome--the purpose of our detour there. For one euro you can take a train all the way into Rome. Our trip to the Vatican was about 35 minutes long, including the transfer from the train to the subway. The neighborhood for the hotel is very quiet, and by 7 p.m. all the stores and even restaurants were closing up. Very odd. there are a couple stores nearby for needed toiletries (for stuck air passengers) and an Internet cafe, but it was closed when I went by. The room was small, but functional. No complaints. The free dinner the airline provided us at the hotel was served buffet style and by the time we got there, a large group had cleaned out most of it. Honestly, after a bonus beautiful day in Rome sightseeing, all we really needed was the free wine on the table and were were good! If I had been counting on dinner I would have been very disappointed. We were worried about the signs warning of limited bus capacity in the morning for our flight, so we got to breakfast right at 5:45 when it opened and had no problems or complaints about the food. Very competent, self service buffet style breakfast. The staff is obviously well equipped and experienced at dealing in volume. The hotel has a computer for use, but is very expensive Internet at .35 euro per minute. There is a decent bar off to the side of the lobby, where we saw many of our fellow travelers. I didn't have a chance to check out nor use any other amenities. One thing i would highly recommend for an afternoon layover at this hotel if you are inclined--a trip to the ruins at Ostia Antica. this is only one train stop from the hotel's Ostia Nord, and Ostia represents ancient Rome's port city and is a beautiful, excavated city. Think Pompeii but not nearly as big or crowded (and without the human tragedy of the volcano of course). it is a relaxing way to see Roman history. Overall, I am fortunate we didn't experience any of the problems of our fellow travelers at the Airport Palace Hotel.
