The location is perfect - the hotel is next to the Barri Gothic and next to the La Ribera/El Born, but not in the middle of either, so congestion and traffic flow is not an issue. The hotel is modern and efficient inside, but retains a good deal of charm from its original construction 100 years ago. The interior is much like a W Hotel - very sleek and modern - so don't anticipate a quaint, 1900's interior. The staff was friendly and spoke excellent English, Spanish and Catalan. They made dinner reservations for us frequently and handled many issues for us. I highly recommend this hotel. One piece of advice - most of the light switches are on the bed's headboard panel, if you can't figure out how to turn on a light, call the front desk - they sent someone right up to show me.

Wifi was very infrequent in our room (but they did give us a cord for wired). There was work going on a couple of doors up from our room (but it was ok and I guess you have to do that sometime). The pool was shut for a function the night we went up (but lots of hotels do that). The airconditioning in our room didn''t work although it did in the corridors -- they never did fix it or get back to us -- as the window was open when we got there maybe the last person had the same issue.

There is a metro stop just steps away from the front door if you want to go further afield. The room was nice - very contemporary and minimalist, the bed was huge and extremely comfortable and it had a large bathroom with full size bath. The mini bar was stocked each day with soft drinks which were complimentary. This was a nice touch. The roof terrace is wonderful. The pool is not large, but it is nice to have a pool in the centre of Barcelona and the views are superb. We went up there in the day and also when it was dark - this is a must. Staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful.

Breakfast was in the restaurant each morning, as although we asked several times how breakfast in the room was organised we were still no clearer and therefore ended up just having it in the restaurant - a shame!

We arranged a taxi from the airport to the hotel which was quite expensive at 40.00 euro one way. i would recomend getting the train so long as you dont have too much luggage as this is much cheaper and really just as convenient. The hotel itself was very nice. We arrived quite early (10am) but had no trouble checking in as our room was available for us. We had paid for a superior King room, which we had hoped would have city views as advertised but unfortunately we only looked onto a neighboruing wall. this didnt matter too much though as we had not travelled for the view from the room. im not sure thogh if the upgrade would be worthwhile, but i guess this will depend on each individual. the room was spacious and had an enormous bed. i think it was two singles together but was very comfy. the TV had a couple of english channels mostly news and film four. all standard bathroom appliances and plenty of waredrobe space. The hotel itself was not very sound proofed. we could hear alot going on above and beside us. it didnt effect us too much at night as we had a few drinks in but if you were just trying to chill in the room it was a little annoying. unnfortunately we did not eat in the hotel so i cannot comment here. the hotel was tidy and when we left our 'turn down' sign out the room was turned around very quickly. the rooftop bar would be amazing in the summer. it was quite cold when we where there over Easter but that was down to bad weather only. its a great place to have a couple of drinks or even just chill and read if thats your thing. i would warn through the bar is VERY expensive. 1 Vodka Tonic was 9.50 euro!!!!! so buyer beware when signing to the room as this can be quite a shock on the bill otherwise. the spa, well i say spa, the wellness centre as it is called was very good. We had massages and a pedicure and they were both very good. A full body massage was 98.00 euro and a pedicure around 50 i think. Gratiuity not included. we had no trouble making an appointment but do note it is only a room so two appointments cannot be carried out at the same time. the hotels location is bar far its best selling feature.we were only a two minute walk from Las Ramblas and all the best shopping. the city bus tour stopped just up the road and there is plenty of public transport nearby. if i am honest if i was going back i would likely stay closer to the beach than the city but for first time visitors this is the place as it is easy to walk most places.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cYoung family\u201d", "Author": "SebastianHuber", "ReviewID": "UR127634035", "Content": "We were staying with our 5 month old child at the hotel.

Staff are very friendly and helpful and the service is excellent. We arrived late on a Wednesday evening and were checked-in by a very helpful receptionist. She recommended some local restaurants that we might want to try and her recommendation was spot on. The rooms were comfortable, spacious and had an air of luxury about them. A free minibar in the room was a pleasant surprise and it was stocked with water and cola and a chocolate. We slept well although the pillows take some getting used to, being so long and slim. The electric window blind is a nice touch and proved a hit with our kids. The only negative thing is that the clock radio is turned off every time you remove the key card from the electric switch by the froint door meaning you have to reset the time every time you re-enter the room. The breakfast is very good and worth trying. Although it can be a bit pricey, it's well prepared and there's a good choice of hot and cold dishes, as well as proper coffee. The swimming pool on the roof is an additional bonus and the views on a good day are fantastic. We spent a relaxing day lounging around, taking in the views and soaking up the sun.

It is very well positioned for the old town and most of the sights. However it is on an undeniably noisy main road. Having noted the recommendations on Tripadvisor, I particularly asked for a room at the rear of the hotel. I booked directly, by telephone, with the hotel - always the best route for getting the best deal I find. I was offered a good rate, including breakfast. On arrival I was told that we had been upgraded to a Suite. However this turned out not to be a Suite as most people might expect with a sitting area or similar. The rooms are well finished but quite small. Even the 'Suite' had room for only one chair in front of the bench-like table along one wall. The justification for calling the room a Suite seemed to be that the entrance door did not open directly into the room, but into a short corridor affair. The bathroom was nicely fitted out. Everything was, otherwise, adequate. I wouldn't choose to pay extra for a 'Suite' though. Although the room was on the side of the hotel, overlooking a side alleway, some traffic noise did penetrate but really no more than the noise from average air-conditioning. Incidentally, the a/c was working and could be controlled to maintain a comfortable temperature. The breakfast was good, but expensive if not included in the room rate. If it hadn't been we would have eaten out. Service was good and the Internet access was free on the hotel's three PCs'. Our only complaint was that some sort of a a conference was being held at the hotel, and the delegates regularly blocked the doorway and pavement having a smoke, with no control exercised by management. Not a good image for a top rated hotel. PS.

The room was very hot no matter how high we had the air conditioning and the air con unit seemed pretty ineffective to boot. The room we stayed in had messy grouting in and around the tiles, but I think people who are design conscious do notice these things, and generally the bathroom needed a bit of sprucing up.

Yet just like another five-star hotel I stayed at in Barcelona last year (Hotel OMM) the service and attention levels are not at par with more established luxury chains like Mandarin, for instance. Like young wine, this hotel has to mature and focus on giving more attention to detail befitting of what they charge per night, which is not little money. Wi-fi should be standard and free. They charge 5\u20ac/day for access. When it started to rain, they had run out of umbrellas for guests at the reception. Drop the useless robe and put umbrellas instead in every room. The gym is tiny, more a room with equipment stuffed into it. I was not the only guest grioing about the gym during our stay. This is perhaps a personal preference I was disappointed that windows don't open easily (I like some fresh air into the room before sleeping) and to do so someone must come from reception to open and close them for you. While the parking is expensive (\"special\" rate of 28\u20ac/night) at a nearby public garage they gave us a hard time with it because when we wanted to drive somewhere they had not informed the garage as they should have and as a result we could not get out until we had called the hotel, told them about our predicament and so on.

Upon arriving at 10:00am, we were happy to find that our room was ready! We were in a Loft Suite on the 5th floor, facing a pretty side street. The room was exactly as it\u2019s represented on the website. It has a large bedroom with 4 windows and a spacious 2-part bathroom, with one large shower unit and one shower/tub unit. Although it\u2019s big, it\u2019s just okay in term of d\u00e9cor. Our main shower was clogged the entire time we were there, resulting in several soaked floor incidents. The bedroom itself was comfortable, but it was disappointing that the windows did not open. Especially on the lovely days we visited in September, it would have been nice to have some fresh air in there. For the price we paid, we have no complaints (booked through a promotion directly off the website). Here are some pros and cons we found at the hotel: PROs - Modern & Clean - Nice touches, like fresh baked muffins at turn down (this wasn\u2019t consistent however); free mini bar with small waters, 1 coca-cola and 1 OJ (no substitutions allowed) - Two internet enabled PCs in the lobby, free of charge - Very quiet \u2013 they aren\u2019t kidding when they say the walls are virtually sound-proof - Near everything! We took a cab only one day, and that was to Park Guell - Complimentary city guide published by the hotel; on the website it was advertised for 10euro, but one put in our room complimentary. It was better than the Frommer\u2019s guide we brought and we used it to explore the neighborhoods - Rooftop Pool and Lounge \u2013 absolutely stunning. The water is freezing in the pool but it\u2019s worth a swim \u2013 you feel like you are swimming off the edge of the building! Also very relaxing in the day and in the evening for drinks. They offer a variety of snacks as well; I\u2019d skip the small snacks (which are the equivalent of Lay\u2019s potato chips) and opt for the sandwiches. Are they overpriced? Probably. But they are simple and good! We loved the toasted ham and cheese. Also a variety of fresh juices and some drinks (limited). - Front desk was friendly enough if you required assistance. - Wellness Suite: I had two massages from Mareia \u2013 she was great! Very friendly and skilled and not to be missed CONs - No open air in rooms; windows bolted and no balcony options - Pool could get crowded and loud in the late afternoon when other tourists were arriving for pre-dinner drinks. - Service at the rooftop bar was pretty bad. First of all, I\u2019ll say if you want something, go directly to the bar area; don\u2019t wait for them to come to you or you\u2019ll be waiting all day; it\u2019s easy and convenient this way. However, the first day, the server ignored us for about 10 minutes and kept talking to her co-worker. Half the service staff we encountered over the days seemed annoyed at their jobs and clueless, although there were a few \u201cokay\u201d experiences. Two nights (early evening) they literally \u201cran out\u201d of almost every liquor. They keep the bar barely stocked, only very limited wine selections, and don\u2019t seem to know how to make very many cocktails. We had drinks at Hotel 1898 one night and had a completely different (and better) experience. - Front desk, although friendly, is not going to go out of their way necessarily; I came down with a bad sinus infection the fourth day we were there. My partner went down to see what they could do for us or if they could let us know what to get from the pharmacy (we spoke only basic Spanish). They pretty much just told him to go the pharmacy and offered zero additional help. Also, when we asked for restaurant recommendations, they were the same 3 places in all the basic guide books \u2013 no really insider information. - Certain small inconveniences: There are no wine glasses or openers in the room; and you can\u2019t request one because, as they told us \u201cthey only have one\u201d at the hotel; so you must call room service, have someone come up, and open your wine. Wireless internet in the room is 5euro a day. Again, you can\u2019t just log on, you have to go downstairs and get a user name and password. Small things, but many hoops. We enjoyed our stay. I would definitely entertain staying here again, and would recommend it, based on what the traveler was looking for. But in my next trip to Barcelona, I will probably try staying somewhere else first. I liked Hotel 1898 from what I saw. It offers balcony rooms, a full bar on the rooftop and much more seating; the pool isn\u2019t as spectacular, nor is the location on La Rambla, but I\u2019d probably give it a try. Good places to visit in the hotel area: - Cat Bar: Vegan and beer bar; open late - La Locanda: if you get tired of tapas, try the Italian food here. The pizza and lasagna are fantastic - Gilda by Belgious: Our favorite restaurant. Small, hip and delicious, with great service - La Cervateca: Hip beer bar \u2013 one of the only there, with a great selection and cool vibe - Vincon: For shopping on the Passage di Gracia Happy Travels!", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ribeirao Preto, SP", "Title": "\u201cIn Barcelona wtihout a Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Guto J", "ReviewID": "UR118650614", "Content": "I made my reservation, in the Official Website of the Hotel 45 day's before my Trip, and when I get there in a 240,00 Euros a day, for my surprise I didn'd have a room, you know why???

It was very hard to follow the experience we had (which was fabulous) on the Regent Seven Seas cruise line, but that's for another review. We had spent one day on tour from the ship and went to a lovely winery in the hills of Barcelona. Then we stayed on for 3 more days at the Grand Central. It was located in the Gothic City area which was very well situated. The staff was very nice but we found the hotel to be a bit dark. The hallway was dark, the rooms were dark, the lobby was dark. The rooms were okay, nothing special. One thing we did find outrageous was that we wanted some ice, which they brought up (none in the hallway as in other hotels) and we were charged about 5 euros for it. For ice??? There is a rooftop pool area which was very nice. Our plan was with breakfast which was not really great. We had to pay for one breakfast because we checked in early. It was expensive for such a poor selection of food (buffet only). The rooms were clean with electric window shades. On the whole we didn't love Barcelona -except for the Gaudi buildings and church which were amazing. The other negative about the city was that we were warned over and over to beware of pick pockets. Everytime we went out it was always with extra caution especially on the Las Ramblas which was nice but very crowed. We did fall victim to being pick pocket on a very quiet residential street. BEWARE if you are standing under a tree and you feel something wet on your back and realize it's was a pigeon doing his job, only to have a very nicely dressed man come out of a very nice apartment building offering you help you with some water to clean you up. He also helped himself to some money in my husband's pocket. So needless to say I know this can happen anywhere, but it did leave a bad taste in our mouths.

After staying here I felt compelled to share my experience. I leisure travel relatively frequently and have stayed at a variety of places ranging from little hotels to bed and breakfasts. I have to say that I really enjoyed my stay at the Grand Hotel Central. The complaints I reviewed online here were very trivial once I observed what the review was pointing out in reality. The hotel is very modern in design. The rooms are realitively spacious with digital televisions and a VERY comfortable bed. Things are designed with style in mind and things like dim lighting, IPOD docks and sleek bathroom doors set a really relaxing and contemporary vibe. We stayed on the third floor....noise was not an issue at all like I had read about from some of the reviews, although I can only speak about the third floor. The rooftop pool was never truly crowded either. The sunrise and sunset are worth getting up on the roof for and relaxing with a drink poolside overlooking Barcelona is worth the price by itself. The fitness facility is just that...a place where you can catch a light, maintainance workout while you're on travel...it's not a gym...nor does it need to be. It's efficient. Internet they charge for in your room, however downstairs exist two computers with FREE internet access that no one ever uses. They also have a little library, which is a nice touch. Breakfast is a rip off BUT they offer you a much better breakfast rate when you arrive which isn't as unreasonable. You do not have to buy breakfast if you don't want. What makes this hotel worth it is the design the pool and the FRONT STAFF. It was one of the best staffs I've experienced ever. They were helpful, hospitable and literally assisted me on SEVERAL occassions (this was three to four DIFFERENT employees) with getting around the city and pointing out things to do on a map. It took them 15 minutes out of their day each time and they were fantastic! I cannot express enough how great they were.

The staff were really helpful and they gave us excellent local advice about anything and everything we asked about, so if you're not sure about anything just ask them and I'm sure they'll be more than happy to help. The rooms were really nice, well laid out and very comfortable. The rooftop pool is just incredible and has to be one of the coolest places in Barcelona, during the day its a great place to cool down with amazing views over the cities rooftops, by night its a classy bar where you can have a drink looking out over the lit up infinity pool at the city lights of Barcelona.

The photo on the website makes it look much bigger than it actually is but the main problem was the lack of any functional air conditioning - almost every day it wasn't working and even when it was working you could barely tell it was on - there also was no access to water in the gym - the combination of no air conditioning and no water makes for a very unpleasant workout and one which could actually be quite dangerous if someone overheats. There was not enough cardio equipment to cater for all the people who want to use the gym, especially early morning and early evening and there were no free weights. One of the bikes was broken in a way that was dangerous (the seat wouldn't stay in the position it was adjusted to so it would just randomly collapse when you were using it). We complained many times about the gym during our stay - the staff were sympathetic but nothing was done to improve it - however they did give us a reduction of our bill when we explained the situation at the end.

Well, location was very central with everything easily accessible and when we checked in, the reception area and reception staff did not disappoint. On entering the corridors / rooms, the lighting was very poor ( my sister walked into the door handle as it was practically invisible to the naked eye!!) but the beds and bathroom seemed clean and comfortable, if somewhat spartan. However, unbeknownst to us, these were to be the only plus points of our stay.......... The pool and \"cocktail bar\" are nice to look at but with nowhere near enough space for the hotel guests to sunbathe or even enjoy a glass of cava - which if you ordered, would be 10 minutes in the making, by an abrupt and unhelpful waitress, and be served at room temperature, without fizz. Same for any soft drinks - they were stacked ON TOP of the fridge, nicely warming in the sun - and when they ran out of stock, they didnt bother to replace it - even every day things such as coke light and sparkling water! (which they could have brought up from the bar on the ground floor, but obviously couldnt be bothered doing). Other drinks mishaps include ordering 2 panaches - they only had enough beer for 1; ordering a premium vodka -to be told they had run out and only had an obscure cheap brand (unless we went downstairs) and finally, on deciding to try some of the bar snacks, noticing that the whole bar top and preparation area were crawling with ants!! Needless to say, we steered clear of the pool bar after that!! Breakfast was another disgrace, again attended by unsmiling abrupt staff - an offering of cold eggs, greasy bacon and grey sausages, along with warm orange juice and water. There was a decent selection of cereals and fruit, but these were cleared away by around 10.50 a.m., even though reception state breakfast is served from 7 til 11. To top it off, the exit from the elevator into the restaurant was blocked by a maintenance worker painting the surrounding wall - at 9.30 in the morning, right in the middle of service.

We wanted celebrate our 9th wedding anniversary in Barcelona. Having read a number of Tripadvisor members` reviews, we had chosen Grand Central. The location. Very Central! Very close to the underground and so many Barcelona sightseeing attractions. The reception. When you enter the hotel, you get a good impression. Modern, spacious but cosy. Nice and helpful staff. Very needed, especially when you have to get off a taxi straight from the bus/taxi lane. The rooms. Not very bright, as many other reviewers had written. It didn`t bother us much. You do have neighbours when you live in the centre. The rooms were equipped with everything you needed (we don`t really use hotel toiletries; just afraid of allergies). As long as the room is clean (it was), the towels are snow-white (they were), the soap to wash your hands is provided(once we started using the first bar of soap, the next one was given on the fourth day...), a bathrobe (you have to ask for it), a pair of slippers (were provided) and maybe some other extras (like cotton buds, cotton pads or mouth wash), we are happy. The extras weren`t provided (the hotel is a 4-star). A pair of flip-flops were supposed to do the job of ordinary slippers. I hate all the flip-flops in the world but the hotel didn`t know that... I have to admit that the flip-flops were very useful when we wanted to use the hotel swimming-pool on the roof. We stayed on the second floor we could hear the underground trains. But that didn`t bother us. One more thing. Because the bathroom is almost an integral part of the room, it`s almost impossible to use the bathroom at night and not to wake up the other person. The roof. Great view! No matter what time it was, always fantastic! But the roof it self is far too small for such a hotel. If you really want to enjoy the roof, you have to start doing it just after breakfast. But if want to relax on the roof after sightseeing Barcelona some time in the late afternoon or after dinner at night, you must be really lucky. There were also people who weren`t staying at the hotel coming for a drink up to the roof bar. How did they get there, if one has use their hotel card in the lift (?). The people we saw didn`t walk up the stairs, for sure! I don`t mind other people using the hotel facilities under one condition: the hotel guests are the priority. Everything would be ok, if the hotel had a lobby bar. But unfortunately, it didn`t. And the mini bar in your room doesn`t provide any alcoholic drinks (but what`s the fun having a drink in your room?!). The breakfast. It was just fine. Nothing very special but also nothing to complain about. Good choice of food, everything fresh and tasty. We just had breakfasts in the hotel restaurant. There are really lots of nice places to eat out in Barcelona. The last thing about the city, not the hotel. Be aware of thieves! There is no place in Barcelona you can feel safe. We`ve never been to a place like that. We travel quite a lot to very different places. There were times I felt uncomfortable, but never unsafe. Until I visited Barcelona! Such a great place to see, amazing architecture, really good food and wine. But the feeling of constant threat is able to spoil everything. You can get robbed or even mugged while walking in the street. You don`t have to be careless to experience the bad things Barcelona has to offer. We were walking after an early dinner (it was around 9p.m.) back to the hotel. Two guys on bikes just grabbed my mother`s handbag and that was it! Because there was just some money in the handbag, we didn`t bother to inform the police (they didn`t want to come to the hotel and the nearest police station was really far). Of course, it wasn`t the hotel`s fault that my mother got robbed but nobody asked a single question how we were the next day. We were their guests. What you expect from your host? A liitle sympathy. I guess. Anyway.

What I had actually booked was a \"free upgrade to a superior room\", which I read on the website had excellent views of the city. This was an offer promoted on the Grand Hotel Central website, which I took advantage of and which the hotel failed to deliver. Upon complaining, the rather disappointing extent of the offered remedial action was free wi-fi for the first two days of our stay. We were told the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing else that could be done. Breakfast was my other disappointment. Considering breakfast for two cost the best part 50\u20ac, I found the staff rather uninterested in my dining experience. It wasn't that the service was bad - there simply wasn't any. Everywhere else I dined in Barcelona I received friendly, courteous and, above all else, interested service. If it had not been for these two disappointments I would have given the hotel 5 stars.

A nice touch is the little refrigerator in the room with complimentary soda pop, juice, and water. I would definitely stay here again. My only disappointment was with some of the business amenities. There was only one copy of the Herald Tribune in the lobby and someone took it every day so no other guest could read it unless they bought one. A good hotel should have at least a few copies of each paper and many give a paper to each guest who wants it one. I also was disappointed by the internet fee being charged by computer and not room. I was traveling on business but had brought one other family member with me who had a computer as well. Even though we were paying an extra 50 euro for a roll away in the room and the 5 euro a day extra computer fee, being able to have two laptops connect to the internet from the same room cost double. In many hotels the internet is free, so after paying a daily rate of 5 euros that should suffice for a room as many people travel today with 2 lap tops. I also was disappointed that there was no coffee or tea available in the lobby or room for breakfast and that the hotel restaurant did not have an affordable continental breakfast menu. All of these make for a good business hotel to mix with the vacationing crowd. One felt that the hotel was trying to make a lot of money off of extras at an already pricey hotel.

Located in Vie Laietana, it is far from the busy hustle in La Rambla but close enough to walk to. It takes no more than 5-10 minutes to walk to La Rambla through little cobble stone streets and squares. We found a perfect square called Plaza Real right by La Rambla. It had a few restaurant choices and a fountain in the middle. Great for people watching. We had a triple room, which had an oddly placed bed right by the room entrance. Other than that the room was gorgeous and clean. The toilet and shower has a tainted glass sliding door separating from the room. One little problem, the room can get quite hot, woke up sweaty and hot and we had the temperature fan setting to the coldest it would go. I can only imagine how hot it gets in the Summer. I do really suggest you take the sightseeing bus which starts right by the hotel. You can get a discount at the concierge desk at the hotel. You can also walk 15 minutes from the hotel and head to the marina and to the beach. This hotel is in a great location and has excellent service.

The hallways are dark and creepy and you literally can not see anything in your room without a flashlight! We honestly spent more time trying to \"find\" things in our room than almost anything else we did there! It was just weird and annoying. The hotel management is aware of the darkness/ lighting problem and they said they are\" working on it.\" My suggestion to them? Repaint the place and put in adequate lighting!", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cSuper cool hotel\u201d", "Author": "chris2222", "ReviewID": "UR92980792", "Content": "I had a wonderful experience with this hotel.

The overall experience started well when we arrived and were taken through our family package details that included free entry to the acquarium, a guidebook setting out walking tours from the hotel and complimentary taxi transfer to the airport on our return journey. Oh yes, and the minibar contents - including juice, coke and cava - were on the house. The positive experience continued throughout the stay: the staff were friendly at all times and attentive when asked; the breakfasts were excellent - great choice and very fresh; the room was very quiet even though the hotel is on a main road; and overall cleanliness was faultless. The gym, while small, was well stocked, with plenty of towels and (free) water available. Another great part of the hotel was the library where you could have an espresso (free), read one of the many design books, or sit at the huge desk and work on your laptop - as many people did. The location of the hotel was really good - most of the city is walkable, even with children. We walked back from Montjuic one day - a long walk but one that meant we saw parts of the city off the tourist trail - and down to the waterfront another. There were some things that could have been improved: the pool is unheated so not a viable option in winter; the air con was too weak - the room was a little stuffy; and the room service we had one night was limited and portions were small - we went for the chicken, for example, and got just that - a big leg of roast chicken with nothing else at all! Oh yes, and the room we stayed in (a very comfortable suite on the top floor) had just one window, so natural light was very limited and, as in many hotels, electric lighting was more form over substance...oh yes, you have to pay for WIFI (though considering all the other free things on offer this is not a big deal) Overall, though, our stay was great - the hotel was very comfortable and the staff welcoming.

My only complaint is the hotel didn\u2019t make me feel like I was in Spain, which I found common in the modern hotels we stayed at in Spain. We arrived early in the morning and the hotel stored our luggage while we started to explorer the city. The first day we used one of the hop-on-hop-off buses, which stop about half a block from the hotel, and saw most of the major sights. We then checked into our room later in the afternoon. Our room #204 (a central room) was located on the second floor and was very clean, modern, and comfortable. The whole room looked brand new and was one of the nicest designed hotel rooms I\u2019ve seen considering the actual square footage of the room. It had plenty of storage (all built-in), very nice lighting, and great electronic blackout curtains. Unfortunately, the view was of an alleyway and a couple of offices. The room had an LCD television, DVD player, mini-bar with complimentary water and juice (replenished once a day), and a large desk. We didn\u2019t use any of the hotel facilities other then the pool, which is located on the roof and although very small, it has an amazing view. There is a Starbucks a few doors down if you need your American coffee fix and a natural grocery store next-door, if you want to stock your mini-bar with groceries. We walked and used public transit most of our visit. The beach is about a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel, Port Vell (great seafood) is about a 10 minute walk, and La Rambla is less then 5 minutes through charming little streets with great restaurants and Tapa stops.

The only caveat is that the plumbing makes an eerie Hitchcock-like noise in the rooms above, particularly noticeable in the mornings.

Also, the shower, as typical in Europe, did not have a shower curtain nor a full door...it was like a half door, which made it difficult keep the bathroom area dry while showering.

This little treasure of a hotel is everything you could need while straying in Barcelona. The rooms were small and if you have a lot of luggage it will definitely take up a lot of room but hey - if you are in Barcelona staying in your room is not an option. Its a wonderful city and you more than likely will not be spending much time in your room other than to sleep!! The hotel has a cute little fitness room with a couple of bikes, a treadmill, an elipitical and a weight machine (which broke while we were there). The best thing about this hotel in our opinion is the location. The staff were friendly and quite helpful. The beginning of our trip was delayed because the airport in Barcelona was closed due to the volcanic eruptions in Iceland. Forcing us to stay in Frankfurt. When we did finally arrive in Barcelona (a day and a half later) our luggage did not. We arrived on a Sunday with nothing and had to try and find a place to buy some clothes. This was not an easy task as just about everything in Barcelona is closed on a Sunday. The hotel staff told us that we would not be able to shop for clothes because of the Sunday Closings. However, we did manage to find quite a large indoor type mall down by the water which worked until we could do some real shopping the next day. My tip would be to anyone travelling to Spain (or Europe for that matter) make sure you have a change of clothing and some small sizes of toothpaste etc. with you in your carry-on luggage. This volcanic dust is very unpredictable and can cause some serious delays for people. Also we called the Credit Card (Visa) that we paid for our tickets with were givin $500.00 each for clothing etc in travel insurance. You trip is automatically insured when you pay with Visa Gold. I loved Barcelona and was really happy with this hotel. Thanks to all of those who took the time to review this hotel in the past it helped us in our choice and I know that if you were to choose this hotel you won't be disappointed .", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel to stay, everything was wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "Wekke01", "ReviewID": "UR63384329", "Content": "I would advice this hotel to everyone.

Unfortunately no free wi-fi which is pretty ridiculous these days. The hotel itself is about a half block from the Jaume metro stop. Its on the edge of the Born district and a short walk away from Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. Lots of great restaurants and shopping nearby. Speaking of the metro, that is my one complaint about the hotel. Its literally right on top of the metro line so in our room on a low floor the rumble was somewhat noticeable. The only reason I mention this is because this was our first stop after arriving from Canada so jetlag was in full effect magnifying any little disturbance. Once the jetlag wore off, we didn't notice it at all. A higher floor would probably alleviate this if its a concern. All in all, great design oriented hotel in a great location.

The central location really won our hearts as we could explore the city in the morning/early afternoon then head to the beach (25-30 min walk) in the late afternoon. We didn't go up to the pool until after 6 pm usually, always seemed to have open lounge chairs and was a great way to relax a bit before heading out to dinner. Only drawback (but definitely would stay there again!) was that there wasn't wifi in the pool area. But then again not \"being connected\" was welcoming! Also, the bathroom is a bit dark, so shaving wasn't easy and also the sleek glass wall in the shower area kept getting the floor quite wet.

I liked the little extras like the weather forcast pillow cards being delivered to your room and the fresh pilow cases. The room was a corner suite on the 4th floor and provided a great view of the La Merce festival. The room was noisy, I stay in hotels across London for work each week and this was much louder at night so I suggest you pack some ear plugs. The nice touches such as the Cava and chocolates are great - but you get a bit narked when they forget to refil the fridge and you cannot have a Cava in your lush bubble bath before you go out. They also forgot to fill up the water but we got some more from the pool. The pool was quite quiet when we went and always had a choice of loungers. It is very subtle lighting, made darker by dark wall treatments but overall it is really relaxing. However as an interior designer I agree that they should do something to make the bathroom lighting better for shaving and make up. Then I really think it would make the room perfect.

As most people do, I'll start with the positive, what little there is. This hotel oozes with style. From the lobby to the rooftop pool, everything is visually quite stunning. It's sophisticated and modern in an urban way that seems just right in such a stylish city. The room I'm in has a beautiful wood floor, a lovely minimalist bathroom with sliding glass doors and slate tile floor, and the furnishings are very cleverly laid out so as to maximize space. The location is very convenient, walking distance from just about everything and the Jaume I metro station is about a block away for what lies outside of walking distance. There's an organic supermarket down the street (and room in the minibar fridge to put things) as well as cafes and banks and pharmacies - anything you'd need. I'll admit that I picked this hotel mainly for its location and I was not at all disappointed in that regard. The staff, too, at least the ones I've encountered so far, have been nothing but friendly, helpful and gracious. Nothing all that exceptional, but definitely everything you would hope for. I don't fault them one bit. HOWEVER Underneath this sleek exterior is a whole wealth of aggravatingly poor design and planning. The bed, for example. It looks beautiful the way they make it up and very inviting after an arduous cross-Atlantic flight. It's quite bouncy, good for jumping, I'd imagine, and I'm seriously not at all picky about beds - I'll happily dream away on the hardest of futon mattresses - but I can actually feel the springs poking up through the skimpy cushioning and I can't fall asleep for more than a few hours without one of my limbs falling asleep. This morning I noticed a bruise on my hipbone from lying on one side for too long. My neck and shoulders ache something fierce and I now understand why they put little note cards everywhere advertising in-room massages. After sleeping on their beds, you'll need one. My second major complaint: the lighting in the rooms. There is not enough of it. And what little there is is so infuriatingly poorly positioned it makes me want to scream. In the lobby, the poor lighting feels moody and seems almost appropriate. But there is no excuse for what they've managed to do in the rooms. There are three recessed overhead lights, one directly above (maybe slightly behind) the head of the bed, one directly above the sink and one above and slightly in front of the toilet. There is also a desk lamp on the desk, some sort of lighting inside the closet and a coil of Christmas lights behind the headboard that serves only to add atmosphere. That sounds like enough, doesn't it? Well, the desk lamp is perfectly functional, I won't complain about it. And the atmospheric closet and bed lights do what they set out to do well enough. But the light above the bed is pointed in such a way so as to blind you should you want to read in bed lying on your back and if you should try to turn over and lie on your stomach, it takes some real effort to position yourself and the book in such a way that the pages are illuminated. And it also somehow fails to sufficiently light the side of the room it is responsible for. The light over the sink also points straight down, casting shadows on the face, making it impossible to see in the mirror. I caught a reflection of myself in the mirror of a well-lit bathroom yesterday and I absolutely looked like a clown, having applied too much blush and crooked eyeliner. And my boyfriend keeps cutting himself shaving. The third overhead light, over the toilet is totally mysterious to me. It allows you to see the floor in front of you perfectly, and somehow fails to pour any of its light into the shower, making it the darkest single corner in the room. I simply don't understand it. Speaking of the bathroom, it certainly looks very pretty and modern and spotlessly clean. But if anyone anywhere in the hotel flushes their toilet while you happen to be in the shower, the water turns scalding hot for a good 10 seconds. The showerhead is on one of those poles where you can slide it up and down to your desired height, which seems quite nice until you realize that there is no way to make the showerhead stay where you have put it and have to do a kind of dance in order to remain in the stream of water. And the shower has no door or curtain, only a panel of glass 2 or 3 feet wide that does nothing to prevent the entire bathroom from getting wet. The walls are very thin and poorly soundproofed and, even though I thought I had booked an \"Executive Room\" on a high floor with views over the city, I was instead lucky enough to be assigned a (cheaper, smaller) room overlooking a playground where children can be heard screaming until well past midnight. I have a few other smaller complaints, like the food we ordered from room service late last night being pretty bad, though admittedly very prompt and convenient at 4 in the morning when we couldn't sleep, the air conditioner is rigged so that it turns off when you leave the room, meaning you always come back to a room that is hot and stuffy, and the rooftop pool, albeit totally picturesque, doesn't have nearly enough seating to accommodate the number of hotel guests who want to spend time there, and from what I can tell, all the seats are snagged up early in the day by the middle-aged British tourists who sit there all day swilling their wine and discussing their assets (I'm not even being facetious - at the pool today I overheard two distinct groups of people discussing their vast finances) and, at least for me, standing room only and people twice my age acting half as mature makes enjoying a glass of wine on the rooftop at sunset more or less impossible. I haven't been to the gym yet, but I passed by it today and it looks like all the equipment is brand new and, like the rest of the hotel, it's very clean. Same goes for the business center. In short, it seems to me that what you are paying for when you book a room at the Grand Hotel Central is the decor, the location and the courteous staff. Everyone and everything is nice and pretty. But take all that away and you are left with a hotel I wouldn't spend $60 a night to stay in, let alone 200 Euros. This hotel has everything you could possibly desire, except for what's most important: beds you can sleep on, showers you can shower in and functional lighting - pretty serious oversights in my book.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire", "Title": "\u201cvery central, very chic\u201d", "Author": "fiftys0methings", "ReviewID": "UR19851423", "Content": "This was our first trip to Barcelona, for a special occasion (50th birthday) we couldn't have picked a better location, as most of the other reviews state.

The lobby is furnished with low black leather sofas and tables with burning candles and is very welcoming and calming. We were in one of the smaller bedrooms which was decorated in the same style with cream and brown walls, wooden floors and Japanese style furnishings. The twin beds were very comfortable, but annoyingly, for some reason my husband's bed kept sliding away from the wall when he was trying to read in bed. I didn't have this problem, maybe because I am lighter. The other two slight irritations were that the reading lights needed adjusting as the spot lights focused in the wrong direction and the door to the bathroom, as has been mentioned in a couple of other reviews was almost transparant, which looked very smart and in keeping with the decor, but is not very practical - luckily, we were not too bothered as we have been married for nearly 40 years! We only had a stool in our room, but that was fine as we were usually so exhausted from our sight seeing, that we were quite happy to lie on the beds and watch TV. In our case the breakfast was included and we found it excellent, apart from the sausages and bacon not being quite hot enough. There was a very good choice of cold meats, cheeses, rolls and pastries, fruit and fruit juices, even champagne! The hotel is very central and about a 10 minute walk to the Ramblers, but we preferred the local area where there are some lovely shops and tapas bars. The best tapas bars are to be found at the end of the road next to the metro - turn left out of the hotel and then, I think it was the 3rd road on the left.

I wanted somewhere fairly classy and central and this hotel definitely delivered on those counts. I can see what people mean about it being a little dark inside but it's not so bad that you can't see, just very low level lighting. It's done well and overall the designer nailed the 'cool' factor throughout. Walking into reception it just oozes class with a lovely lobby. The staff look smart without appearing aloof and all we encountered were very friendly and spoke excellent English (shame on us for not learning more Catalan....). We stayed in a 'Central' Room which wasn't the biggest but perfect for us. It was nicely laid out with wooden floors and plenty of cupboard space. The in-room safe was very welcome too, especially after hearing the horror stories about pickpockets. The bathroom was a decent size and spotlessly clean. Again, the mirrors and mood lighting are very contemporary and cool. The electric black out blinds were not only a great toy but also very effective. Although we weren't in direct sunlight they managed to completely black out the room when we wanted an afternoon nap. So well that we only woke up at 9pm. The only downside was the bed. On booking the hotel it seemed impossible to get a double bed unless I splashed out on a suite at double the price. Instead it was two beds pushed together. Usually I don't mind that and can get over it but since the beds aren't connected in anyway (zip down the middle for example) and they're on wooden floors, they slide apart at the slightest touch! Any bedroom 'activity' (catch my drift?) resulted in the bed sliding across the floor and we weren't exactly going crazy! Effectively, if I wanted to cuddle up with my girlfriend we had to sleep in a single bed. Not good. Another minor quibble is the room lighting is so low that if you do want a bit extra and you're in bed, the only way is to put the spotlights on, shining right in your face. The pool on the roof is stunning. It's a shame I didn't get to use it but the views are incredible. There weren't too many loungers up there so if you're planning on using it I'd get there early and lay your towel down, German style. The location on Via Laitana is PERFECT. No doubt about it, we couldn't have been in a better place. It was just a 5 minute stroll to the Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. The Born area, Bari Gotic and Olympic port areas were all maybe 10 or 15 minutes walk. There's a Bus Turistic stop 5 minutes left or right out of the hotel. Overall, even despite the slidy beds I'd have no hesitation in staying here again.

The hotel location was great, the hotel room was great, totally agree with a majority of the other reviews about the beds beind really comfortable. We were having a fantastic time and on the eve of our last day (Thursday 7th June) we enquiried as to whether there was a safe locked room which our luggage could go until we returned from sightseeing, as our flight was a late evening flight and we had to vacate our room at the hotel by 12 noon. We were advised that the hotel had a concierge room which was locked at all times and only staff had access to this. We felt comfortable with this as with the hotel being a 4 star, lovely hotel we didnt feel we had anything to worry about. Low and behold, when we returned to the hotel early evening to collect our luggage before going to the airport we were advised that unfortunately it looked like the hotel had 'mistakenly' given it to someone else!!!! We had everything in our suitcase, passports, car keys, house keys, as people who have visited Barcelona in the past, and all the tour books advise not to carry personal belongings when sight seeing/visiting the beach as there are pickpockets/handbag snatchers. We finally got back to the UK on the Saturday, after a visit to the police station to report the 'lost' luggage, and the hotel manageress booked us flights and contacted the British Consulate to enable we were allowed to get back home without passports etc. After nearly 3 weeks of returning home, we are still trying to sort out the paperwork/keys etc which was in the suitcase, and havent unfortunately had any positive news from the hotel about the luggage. For all the years that myself and my partner have travelled, we have never heard of a 'good' hotel to loose your luggage while it's in their conceirge room - can understand the luggage being lost at an airport but not at a hotel. Has this happened at this hotel before - as I have asked the hotel and they dont seem keen on given me an answer strangely enough.

Of course, all people are different and expectations in hotels vary widely. But, for me, when it comes to hotels in big cities there are very few aspects which I demand to be spot-on and nothing less. First up, location. Few people spend their annual fortnight's hols in somewhere like Barcelona, Amsterdam, Munich or similar, so time is often tight. Grand Central is slap-bang in the middle of town, on a busy but stately road close to the cathedral. The old town with its alleyways, tapas bars, shops and sights are within very easy reach on foot. Weekend trips traipsing around from sight to sight can be tiring, so the next thing you want is a good bed. At this hotel I can honestly say as soon as my head hit the pillow I was off. I didn't wake up again until gone 9am - a sleep from heaven. Well filled but soft pillows, crisp sheets and a mattress with true firmness without being hard. Another bonus, the electronically-controlled blackout blinds keep out the sun should you want to turn in early-ish or have a lie-in. Oh, and the room, corridors, lifts etc were spotlessly clean. One of the cleaning ladies also gave me a very friendly smile and a \"hello\" - how often does that happen? Nice. I didn't have the breakfast (I had just a coffee, not really being a breakfast person) but looking around I didn't see any disgruntled people. Another real bonus is the rooftop swimming pool. The view of Barcelona is simply stunning, and if sunbathing is your thing you'll be delighted. My only criticisms: the rooms could do with better lighting; and the minibar, included in the price, contains only water, cola and a drab alcohol-free beer. A bottle or two of the excellent local Estrella Damm lager would have been a nice touch. Come 1am I really didn't have the energy to phone down for some for a nightcap. Would I stay here again? Definitely.

Whilst we were allocated the smallest room on the floor it was still ample for our needs with a VERY comfortable bed. The rooms are stylish and modern but, as is often pointed out in reviews, the lighting is quite subdued and via lamps or downlighters so for anyone wanting to apply make up or put in contact lenses it can be a bit of a struggle!

The bathroom was small but adequate and very clean, Molton Brown toiletries were supplied (although only 1 small container of shampoo and 1 of bath gel). The wardrobe contained 1 robe and 2 pairs of flip flops, only 6 hangers and a room safe. Although the bed was a double bed I have a feeling this room may be one which is often used as a single. Since the hotel is on a very busy road we had requested (via e-mail) a quiet room and were allocated a room at the back of the hotel \u2013 no view, but at least no traffic noise. I would imagine that rooms on the front can get very noisy. The wooden flooring can also mean noise can be heard from rooms above. We were particularly impressed with breakfasts here. Plenty of fresh juices (and even cava on ice!), f resh fruit, cereals, yogurts, meats and cheeses and a wide variety of lovely breads and pastries.

I booked with the hotel directly, by phone, and asked for a quiet no-smoking room. The hotel\u2019s website state all bedrooms have soundproof bedroom windows but this is untrue. When I arrived the reception staff took ages to decide what room they were going to give me. I was shown to a bedroom with dark walls and spot lighting on the ceiling. As the room did not have much natural light, it needed the electric light on constantly. Even then the room was still dark. Although the room was on a high floor of the hotel you could hear constant traffic noise and additionally the intermittent sound and vibration of the metro. At night, it was necessary to use blackout curtains to prevent the lights from surrounding buildings and the cathedral shining into the room, which had the undesired feeling of sleeping in a box Next day I asked to change room. I refused a room with direct views of neighbouring TV aerials and in close proximity to what I believe is a mobile phone mast. I also refused a room that smelt of smoke. I eventually accepted another room, similar in design to my existing room although much smaller, but it was quieter. It was a lower category room and was promised a refund. Yet when it was time to leave the reception staff did not want to give me this refund. After 30 minutes of discussion they reluctantly agreed to give me a very small reduction indeed. The reduction given does not reflect in any way the price difference between the categories of rooms when I look at the prices on the website. The reception refused to show me or print off the prices of the rooms or inform me how they came to this reduction figure. Additionally during my stay, I asked the reception staff for a nice restaurant nearby for dinner, about 10 minutes walk, which served local food. One person just said that there are many restaurants in Barcelona! Other reception staff told me of a restaurant that looked like a dingy workman\u2019s caf\u00e9 down a narrow alley that was serving pizza and pasta, another restaurant that was very expensive and empty and another that was 40 minutes walk away.

Having read some of the reviews before we went i was a bit apprehensive about the hotel. However it wasnt as bad as many of the comments on here. The biggest positive was its fantstastic central location. The staff were also very helpful, always smiling. The hotel itself is well designed and maintained but the rooms were hot though...a little uncomfortable to be honest and it was a little noisy with the traffic from the street, so I recommend you ask for a high floor.

It was the first time i had been and really loved the city...there is so much to do and see...it was handy that the hotel was so central and with the help of the guys at reception we found some really cool bars for drinks and dancing. The hotel itself was very plush, we had a city room (you have to ask for 624) as part of our package with a fab king size bed and views of all the rooftoops...it was so lovely at nightime! We also had included dinner in the restaurant which would have been nicer if there had been more people (but it was a tues night), some wine and candles in out room! There was also cava in the mini bar...bonus! The pool looked lovely but unfortuately its not heated so didnt get to try it. The breakfast was really good, be sure to ask for the hot breakfast menu tho, we only found out about it cos i seen someone with bacon and eggs! I am very surprised about the comments made before as we had such a lovely time and couldnt fault the hotel at all, that is why i felt i had to write.

Our only major complaint was that we got a twin room when we had requested a double. Leo Sayer tried to tell me that all the rooms were like this, I'm not sure this is true but my Spanish is pretty poor and I didn't fancy the old Basil Fawlty approach.
