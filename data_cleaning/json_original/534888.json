{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Absolute Disgrace Im 22 and am just back from Barcelona where i was on holiday with my Boyfriend (27). We stayed in Barelona for ten days in total, the first six where spent in the city and we decided to break up the holiday with a stay at the beach so we booked the Apsis BCN Events in Casadellfelds.Firstly what is not mentioned on their website is that the hotel is actually located right in the middle of an Industrial Estate and quite literally on the motorway!!!All bar one member of staff were incredibly rude and should not be working in the hospitality industry and no one seemed in a rush to do anything (including check you in).When we got to our room eventually, we found the following problems* Mini bar unstocked and filthy dirty, (this was not cleaned for the duration of our stay even though we had advised reseption of this)* Lining behind curtains ripped* Carpets all along our floor (2nd Floor) filthy dirty* In room safe would not work for the duration of our stay* On wall card taker for electricity kept falling off!!* TV remote brokenAnd just to put the icing on the cake when we woke every morning at around 10am we found the delightful smell of sewage coming up from the drain pipes in the bathroom!!But it was the end of our holiday so we decided to make the most of the situation. so we decided to head for the beach, when we asked at the reception how to get there we where told we could either get a taxi or walk and that the walk would take us only about 20 minutes, so we decided to go for the walk. 40 minutes later we arrived at the Beach!!!! But we persisted and continued on with our day, with the dread of the trek home, only to find that we would get a bus which stopped just across the road from the hotel for just \u9227?.30!!!Not only this but there is also a railway which goes just behind the hotel!!We went for a meal on one of the nights in the hotels restaurant which was very over priced and average.On the following night we decided we would just have some drinks and bar food, only to be told that they had no Vodka and couldnt make Mojitos and the only bar food they had consisted of chips or croquettes, they ran out of Pizzas!!!???!!!Needless to say our last meal was spent elsewhere.The only saving grace of the hotel was the pool, which although clean on the inside was a disgrace around the area surrounding the pool. The bins where constantly over flowing and never changed and the whole area needed a good clean and sweep down. All of issues where brought to the attention of the hotel reception and the majority of them where left unacted upon.The whole stay was very disappointing and it is beyond me how this hotel can call itself a four star accomodation. Its a disgrace.I would never recommend this hotel to any of my family or friends and would strongly advise anyone who is considering going there to reconsider.", "Date": "Aug 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR774379558", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "bobby1986"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel We go to Barcelona every year for a week or so. We love the place! We have tried hotels in and around Barcelona. We always have a car and without doubt you really do need to have a car if you want to stay at this hotel. It is a 20minute drive into Barcelona. We got this hotel for just under \u9227?0 per night BB. It was excellent value. The breakfast was self-service buffet (scrambled egg, bacon, fruit, cheeses, breads, cereals, coffee, toast, etc.). We thought the choice  quality of the food was excellent. After breakfast we used to take our coffees out onto the first floor veranda overlooking the pools. It was shaded and full of good quality wicker type furniture.......an extremely good start to any day.There are 2 outdoor pools, both are a good size. One is suitable for children (50cm deep). Our 2 year old wanted to spend all day, every day in it. The pools were never crowded and the hotel provided an endless supply of fresh towels at the poolside. They had a small wooden garden type shed that sold drinks and snacks during the day. The pool is next to the busy C32 motorway but the hedging all around the pool blocks this from sight. We never found the noise of the traffic to be off putting.The rooms are large. We noticed that the rooms on the pool side of the hotel appear to be larger than those on the front of the hotel. We were on the pool side and the room had an extremely large bed. There was a long 3 seater black leather sofa in the room. The tv was LCD (flat screen). The aircon worked perfectly. The bathroom was spacious with a shower in the bath. There was a fridge and safe. The floor covering was lamenated wood. Behind the hotel there was a very large new looking shopping centre full of cheap and reasonably ok restaurants. Across the motorway from the hotel was the olympic canal, where I assume sailing, rowing, etc. took place during the olympics in 1992.If you want a hotel on the beach, this is not your hotel; if you want one in the centre of Barcelona, this is not your hotel. However if you have transport and want an excellent hotel to stay at in the Barcelona area, then this is the place for you. I would go as far as to say that it was the best value in hotels that we have come across in Barcelona. It was spotlessly clean and we found the staff to be most helpful although they wanted \u9227?40 to do one load of laundry for us; instead we took it to a laundrette in that shopping centre behind the hotel and paid \u9227?5 instead.No place is perfect but next year I will stay here again.......provided we get a good deal.", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR647162176", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "YoungIrishman"}, {"Content": "return visit return visit after 12 months and found the hotel very satisfactory.

There is no free internet, the hotel restaurant is overpriced and because they host so many events, there was noise all night. When we stayed at this hotel, there were 2 weddings going on that lasted through the night and we could hear every song that was played.

We stayed at Apsis BCN Events from April 24-27. Check in was easy and quick. It took us Less than 10 minutes to get our room. The rooms were spacious and extremely clean. The hotel is ideal for business conference meetings. The bathroom on the lobby floor is gorgeous. the staff members at the front desk were extremely helpful in helping us get around via train system because the hotel is at least a 1/2 your from the city center. But it is easy to learn. However, the trains shut down at 12:00am so that means if you party in the city center, then you would have to take a cab back to the hotel which can cost 30 euros or the bus which we never took because it would take over a hr. Right across from the hotel is Canal de Catuylna where you can go rollerskating, canoeing and other cool stuff. Great areas to visit in Barcelona is Ciudad Olympica and Port Vell. In Port Vell area you would find La Champanaria. Were you order a sandwich and then you get a bottle of Champaine. Just be ready for the crowd. You have to push your way in.I encountered one negative thing during check out. Make sure you look at your bill carefully because they charged me for the bar in which I never used. It was only a 1.50 euro but stil it should not have been on my bill.Overall, I would not stay here again only because it is too far away from everything.

The reception is very modern with funky light fixtures and the room that we stayed in was also very spacious and modern. The rooms were cleaned everyday and to a good standard. Nothing appeared to be too much of a problem with the reception staff, they also booked a transfer to to the airport free of charge. I would say it would be helpful to book your transfers (if you haven't already) with the hotel rather than paying over \u62e220.00 for it. The two drawbacks were the actual location of the hotel as it took us about 40 minutes or so to get to Barcelona via the train. The train station is about 15 minutes walk from the hotel. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you have very small children due to the location of the hotel. It appeared to me that they mainly accommodated for the business clients rather than tourist as such. At the time I was pregnant and didn't find the walking too much, as the weather was nice. The other drawback was the the pool. As the hotel is located near a main moterway you found that you could hear the noise at the pool. However, having said that me and my husband found that we were the only ones using the pool throughout the satisfy which was quite nice. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are looking fir a relaxing beach type holiday but rather if you want something comfortable and nice to go and sightseeing!Also a word of warning me and my husband got stopped by men (who weren't wearing uniforms) pretending to be policeman. They stopped us just a few minutes from the hotel. They asked us rudely that they wanted too see our passports and contents of my bag. When refused and questioned after a few minutes of asking they fled away in their car. After talking to a real policeman in Barcelona later that day we found out that this happens a lot in Barcelona so just be careful. Lucky we didn't hand anything over!

The only room we were offered as a replacement was not normally let out as it had a broken window. Overall found the staff rude and unaccommodating.

Minus points: the location, right by a motorway (so using the pool and loungers right next to it and was less than appealing) and one mile from the beach, only one English language TV channel - and that was CNN, so less than great for the fair number of British visitors there when I was.

The size of the room was very adequate and was comfortable. We were on a room only basis so didn't try any meals although the breakfast spread did look good. We had a car for the duration of our stay of 5 nights. This made the location very good for visiting Barcelona, about 20 mins by car. We found parking easy and used the underground car park at the Colombus Monument. This was good for the Barcelona Touristic Bus.

In the evening we drove 5 minutes to the beach. There are 2 or 3 beachside restaurants serving the usual fare. We also visited Port Aventura which was just under an hour away. Fantastic day for all.For those without a car, there is a big mall across the road with the usual collection of international chain stores together with a good supermarket and plenty of eateries.

Everyone had to wear ear-plugs in order to sleep.* The staff was mostly uncooperative and inattentive, though there were a couple of exceptions.* The restaurant is fairly sub-par (stay away from the beef) and keeping with Spanish tradition does not open until 8:30pm for dinner - go elsewhere.* Non-smoking floors have ashbins near the elevators, and as with most hotels guests smoke in the rooms anyway - just be prepared.* In the shower, water pressure varies from minute to minute and occasionally will switch from warm to cold briefly - highly entertaining. It also has incredibly soft water so expect to spend a long time washing soap off. Oddly, one day the water was hard - I have to assume they have a water filtration device that is malfunctioning.* The king beds are actually two small twins pushed together.
