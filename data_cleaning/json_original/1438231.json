Upon check in we were asked if we wanted to upgrade the room for an extra $50 AUD per day, we declined but the lady at the front desk was quite persistent. We declined again - and then she gave us the upgraded room anyway, I think this is because they had in fact already arranged the cot we requested for ou son into this upgraded room. As such we got the upgraded room at no extra cost. The staff at check in were quite hopeless at putting a hold on our credit card, and managed to put three - yes 3! - different holds on the card. I brought this to their attention on the 2 nd day which they disagreed with and I had to how my Internet banking to prove this. This took almost 3 days to rectify. The daily charge for wifi in the rooms is ludicrous, as is the cost for laundry. As others have noted the pool still isn't available for use. Breakfast buffet was ok, good selection of foods however many were not kept hot enough for my liking. Daily we had to ask the staff for coffee cups and coffee. On 2 occasions we were also missing some cutlery from our table. Checkout was 12pm, about 10 minutes before this a staff member came to remind us to check out, as were already vetting luggag not the hallway this was no issue. When we got to the lobby the clerk advised that we had a late checkout until 4pm! No one had ever advised us of this, and it would have been useful to know especially with our young child who was due for a nap. As we had already packed and exited the room we went to the lobby lounge for a snack and drink. The prices are out of this world! It would be cheaper to get a taxi to Times Square and eat a a restaurant! We were also told hat all snacks had a minimum 30minute wait as the kitchen wasn't ready, even though the menus stated snacks from 12pm. Overall this hotel was a huge disappointment.

We had an wonderful time - check-in was seamless and we were upgraded to a Premier Harbour view room on the 29th floor WOW what a room and a view!! My son had a roll out bed which was fine and there was a curtain which separated the lounge area from the beds so we all had some privacy. Bathroom was huge with an amazing shower! View across the harbour was stunning. The room was cleaned daily and free bottles of water each day was a nice touch. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and couldn't have done more for us. The location is great - (ignore the road of small car lots, they are really quite quaint - I guess that why it's called Oil Street, but they should not put you off) It's a few minutes walk to the MTR or Tram and busses stop outside the MTR for Stanley Market which is handy! The Hotel shuttle was great friendly driver and we used this on a few occasions. The breakfast we had on 5 days as part of our deal (we were room only) and was truly scrumptious! We did use the hotel pool at the sister hotel once and this was no problem at all - I just got a receipt for each journey and this was paid back immediately by reception - really easy! We will definitely stay here again and genuinely think this is one of the best hotels in HK and we have stayed in a few but mostly in Kowloon.

The breakfast was fine though I thought quite expensive for what you got. Room service was very efficient and all staff were very attentive. The hotel is conveniently located about 2 minutes walk from the Metro station. If you are coming from the airport on the train and metro, do be prepared to lug your suitcases up some stairs in the Metro station. There are numerous restaurants along the side roads near the hotel and at least two Starbucks nearby. The area is mixed from automotive part shops to fine dining. The only thing I did not like was that the rather tatty local garage next door did oil changes straight into the storm drain... and no doubt into the Hong Kong Harbour.

The view is fantastic , only problem you need to sit on the bed to see it as the sofa faces a wall. Their club lounge was closed for repairs so you get put into the dining room , view is great but the chairs are awful, food is pretty average. The pool is closed has been for a while so for kids there's not much to keep them occupied. If you're a coffee lover, they don't have coffee makers in the rooms, only instant, Starbucks is around the corner but they dont open until 7am. You could get roomservice at $8 US a cup. They also charge $20 day for the Internet this is a complete rip off. It's free in a couple of areas in the hotel but there is limited seating. best bet go to Starbux or McDonalds it's free.

The foyer of the hotel is quite remarkable with a grand entrance leading to the reception area. The rooms are very comfortable and well maintained and the bathrooms are both luxurious with plenty of room. Although this hotel is located in a high traffic area close to busy highway, we were not affected by any noise. Just make sure you have a room which faces Victoria Harbour as the views are quite spectacular. For dining the hotel has a few choices. The Harbour grand caf\u00e9 offers banquets style feasts with hot and cold varieties for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is also the Le 188 dining room which offers sophisticated dining with panoramic views of the Hong Kong skyline with floor to ceiling windows on three sides of the dining room. There is also live entertainment and this is the perfect experience for the true romantics out there. Attached to this dining room is an outside terrace area where you can sit and enjoy a drink or cocktail in the warm Hong Kong weather. The service is absolutely flawless and I commend all the staff on their warm nature and impeccable service. The restaurants are abundantly staffed so it feels you never wait long for (we measured that the longest time for a plate to be cleared in the caf\u00e9 was about 25 seconds!). The hotel is a short walk to the Fortress Hill MTR station and the area itself has a very local feel which many small shop front stores, numerous mechanics and unrepaired streets. There is also an abandoned building complex directly opposite the hotel but this added to the feel of Hong Kong with both the modern and also dated parts of the city. A great hotel in a location with easy access to other areas of Hong Kong.

They work hard and are always keen to help. Probably by way of compensation for the swimming pool being out of action, we were upgraded to a club room on floor 40 which gave us good views of the Harbour along the Hong Kong island shoreline and all the current building work. Surprisingly the room was small, lacked storage space and showed signs of wear and tear - we had to lift a unit door back into position each time after it was opened. A free bowl of fruit was provided. Uniquely the bathroom was situated within a glass panelled section of the room, without lowering the blind - all activity would be on full view !!! Bathroom facilities were very good - the shower especially so. Cleaning was good but not perfect, there was an accumulation of dust behind the room door and in another corner of the room. All used toiletries were readily replaced but guests were not permitted to make use of the room fridge which unreasonable bearing in mind the weather. We used the breakfast buffet - an excellent selection but rather pricey we felt. The hotel is situated close to an MTR station, which was very handy as we used the system a great deal, and taxis were readily available. There is a definite dicotamy at play here though. The hotel in all its marble covered air-conditioned oppulence sits in the middle of a working neighbourhood. Just a stone's throw from the front entrance a local garage operates a repair and maintenance service on the kerb side which must be negotiated en-route to the MTR !

What an awesome find\u201d", "Author": "travelyun", "ReviewID": "UR137237528", "Content": "This is an awesome hotel in a city that is flooded with mediocre hotels. We travel to HK at least once a year for holidays for the last 12 years, and this is the first time I stayed in a hotel that I loved every moment of it. We booked a superior room but was upgraded to premier, which contributed to the very pleasant stay. We were on 27th floor, quite high up but just below the club floor. The room was massive by a lot of countries standards - it was 35 square metre, with a super king bed, a couch, a desk, a TV unit, some surface for luggage (underneath is mini fridge), a big wardrobe, a massive bathroom with a round bath, and they also squeeze in a rollaway bed for my 5 year old. We stayed for 5 nights and didn't feel cramped at all. Room itself is of very modern decor and tastefully decorated. This is a very new hotel, around 4 years old, 5 star. There's a lot of details to how they have furnished the place. Everything works too, perfectly. Plenty of hot water, great pressure, there are even two showers, one the usual type and one from the ceiling! Bathroom is very very nice. View itself is a very rare find in HK. We have panoramic view of Victoria Harbour, I have to say I have never had such a view from my hotel room before. At night it's amazing with all the lights, and during a clear day you could see miles. Slight downside is that there's a construction site outside at the moment that finishes work at about 5pm, starts at probably 8-9am, which could be quite a pain if you stay in hotel during the day. We were out every day so this wasn't a problem. Otherwise there was no traffic noise at night and we slept really well each night. Staff - I have to comment on the staff. I am not usually too concerned if staff is bad - after all I just want a nice hotel that I could stay in. But staff here is excellent - totally contrary to the two previous comments before mine. I really don't get where these people were coming from - every staff I talked to had been very willing to help, they all had a big smile when they saw us. CHeck in and check out were both super efficient. They helped us to carry our luggages to the airport express shuttle. They opened the door for us EVERY time. Every time I rang Concerige to ask for some directions/timetable/shopping info they were helpful - if they couldn't help straight away they offered to ring back in 5 minutes. The only night that we had some problem with the neightbour (it was a wedding party), I rang, and they sent someone up straight away cos the noise was gone after 10 minutes. We were also recommended to a nearby restaurant for dim sum/yum char - and it's so good that we went back 3 times! Location wise, this is the only aspect I've given 4 star instead of five. That's because its about 3-5 minutes walk from Fortress Hill, a MTR station that is slightly out of the way (two stops to Causeway Bay that has a lot of shopping/eating). To get to the hotel from the MTR, you need to cross a very busy street and then a couple more little side streets, one of which is lined with car servicing shops, which could be slightly off putting. We usually stay in City View Hotel in Yau Ma Tei, which is very central location, but boy that hotel just cannot compare! So even the location isn't as good, we still think this is a hotel that is far more superior in every other way. My husband said the only downside he could think of is that the pool was closed during summer. This has been quite disappointing as we took our togs and wished to have a dip at the end of a hot summer day. Maintenance should be done during winter months surely? Despite that, we will be back to this hotel. My friend also stayed here with her mum and son and they had the superior room (31 square metre) and it still seemed pretty good to us.

We had a pleasant stay. It's a pricy hotel, but you get value for it. We are airline staff and they do give industry discounted prices for a room. Just write to the hotel and ask for it. The location: from the metro station Fortress Hill, it's a 5 minutes walk. The hotel is a bit hidden, but it's right on the boulevard. This boulevard is currently (april) under construction and there's a highway between the boulevard and the hotel. It would be a good idea to build a bridge or so over the highway for easy access, but I'm sure something like this should be part of the reconstruction plan already. We can't tell about the kitchen, as we didn't use it. There's many cheap breakfast options in the surrounding streets, which is a good option to save some money here. We used the bar on the top floor though. It is recommended to have at least one drink here at night to enjoy the spectacular view over Hong Kong harbour. The room is luxury, with good beds and a good bathroom. Be sure to book a room with harbour view on the higher floors! At night you can enjoy the wonderful Hong Kong light show from your own room. The only slightly disappointing issue was the pool... The reason why we chose this hotel out of many options was the pool, to be able to relax a little bit after a long touristic day in Hong Kong. But the water temperature was only 21 degr C.... Not inviting to stay in for longer than 5-10 minutes, despite the nice setting. That is too cold for a pool in a 5* star hotel, I would recommend to heat up the pool to a 27 degr C temperature year-round.

We had booked 2 Deluxe Harbour View rooms. My requests of being on the highest floor (Level 40, which is a harbour club floor) and having interconnected rooms were fulfilled. The hotel is modern and new. Although it is located adjacent to car repair shops in North Point, there are a plethora of cafes, restaurants, fruit/vegetable grocery stores, convenience stores and small shops nearby. The MTR (underground subway) station (Fortress Hill) is also a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. Tsim Tsa Tsui, Admiralty, Central, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay are all within a 3-15 minute train ride away (2-5 stops). Upon arrival, the service provided by the concierge staff was excellent: they helped me unload my luggage and quickly brought them up to my rooms. The lobby was very spacious, well-lit and welcoming. The marble front desk was impressive. Check-in was efficient. My rooms were very well appointed, clean and were furnished with some unique features, such as a printer (complimentary) and an electronically-controlled blind/curtain that could be raised and lowered for privacy purposes in the toilet/bathroom. Housekeeping was generous with the amenities, re-supplying disposable slippers, body lotion, shampoos, combs, toothbrushes, tea/coffee etc. daily. There was also quite an extensive pillow menu. Shoe shining was complimentary. My room had a nice harbour view from my room but I would have preferred a more 'landscape' view. The hotel provides complimentary bus shuttle services to Causeway Bay every hour and various other places. On Level 41, there is a nice restaurant/bar and the Harbour Club. There is also a buffet lunch/dinner, a Japanese Restaurant, Lobby Lounge and fitness centre in the hotel. However, I have two small issues with the hotel. Firstly, the Internet costs HKD130/day for one device. I was lucky because from my room on Level 40, I could access wi-fi from the Level 41 Harbour Club. Secondly, my request for an English and Chinese newspaper to be delivered to my rooms daily were received with a sense of surprise. After putting down my request, the front desk called me to ask whether this was what I had wanted as if it was something extraordinary. This was quite bizarre given that complimentary newspaper is standard in 4-5 star hotels Having said that, the hotel fulfilled all my requests (including the newspaper one) such as extra towels, more soap and tea bags were fulfilled very promptly, usually within 5 minutes.

The hotel lobby is beautiful. When we arrived we could hear a harp playing, we originally thought it was coming from a speaker system. We were surprise when we actually realized that there was a women at the top of the stair case heading to the ballroom playing the harp, real nice touch. The lobby was clean, with a slight floral fragrance. We checked in, the front desk was courteous. There was a bank of elevators to the left of the lobby, they were a polish copper color, clean and quick, they also didnt have that jerking sensation on starts or stops. The room appeared small but it was very well layed out. There was a clear pane of glass that separated the bathroom and room, it did have a button activated curtain that would come down in order to have privacy. The shower/tub area was good, there where 2 shower heads one directly above and a hand held one, plenty of hot water and good water pressure. There wasnt a separation between the shower and tub which got everything wet but it wasnt a big deal. There was slight discoloration on the wall next to the shower wall, I would venture to say that it was mineralization/soap scum. the beds had a pillow top which made them comfortable along with large pillows, we had two single beds the beds were adjacent to each other. (if you rolled over to far you would be on the next bed). The internet cost $130HKD (cable/wifi) per computer. We had a harbour view but there was some construction going on so you could see cranes and construction equipment. As another review stated the surrounding area is run down.

Throughout our stay, we were kept informed as the hotel got back to some normality and received a complementary bottle of wine for our patience and understanding. We were not able to use the pool (but the hotel shuttle bus took us to the Grands sister hotels pool). The spa reopened on our last day and while the treatment was good, the surroundings had been affected by the fire. Not withstanding the fire, the Harbour Grand is clearly a 5 star hotel. Our room was an adequate size, very well appointed with a marble bathroom with wet room and the bed is very comfortable. We had a harbour view which is stunning but it's worth noting that there is a lot of construction work along almost the entire waterfront. The breakfast buffet is very comprehensive, catering for almost every cuisine and in bright airy surroundings. But above all, the service throughout our stay was second to none. The hotel is 5 minutes walk to Fortress Hill MTR station and 10 minuted on the train to Central and the Star Ferry.

Though I am aware of poor management of the hotel, I never thought of safety issues and after this fire, I have learned to be cautious now in all hotels when I travel, because I realize now how important good management is. I was on the 29th floor when I was woken up by loud banging on my door. I answered the door and could hear a dim ringing of alarm from some distant floor. I concluded there was a fire alarm of some sort, but never thought there really was a fire. When I opened the door I saw smoke rolling down the hallway towards my room (the last one on the floor) and the fire doors were already slammed shut at the other end of the hallway. There was not one soul anywhere in sight. I had one exit next to my room so I rushed downstairs, only to find the 25th floor (supposedly a fire breaking floor) piled with what seemed like construction materials, tables and furniture. I thought maybe I should go to the 26th floor to see if I could make it to another stairwell, but found a similar situation of smoke and fire doors slammed shut, so I returned to the 25th floor and tried to find my way in the dark and debris to another stairwell. Luckily I did and I ran down the 25 flights of stairs as fast as any human possible could, and by the time I got to around 8th floor, there was smoke coming up the stairwell. I thought the lower floors must be burning and I would probably be stuck. One can imagine the panic I felt, being the only person this whole time, not knowing the extent of the fire in the building. There was no announcement, no hotel personnel, no fire alarm going off on my floor and no guidance whatsoever. Luckily I made it down and I saw a huge crowd of probably up to a thousand on the dead end side of the street. To make a long story short, I did not get to return to the room until about 12 hours later, and the hotel's management and response later was nothing short of ridiculous. The ineptitude and complete lack of training was disheartening for a city that I have always been proud of. The misrepresentations made later to keep guests in their rooms so they would not move to another hotel was also unconscionable, as in guaranteeing that the air conditioning would be coming back within hours when I could not sleep the next night (after having practically no sleep at all already the night before with the fire), that the hot water would be back on when it was running out quickly the next morning, and similar assurances to keep signing guests in when in effect it was in no condition to provide accomodations. A hotel management personnel even tried to tell me that the building was never on fire and that a sign burnt and fell down on the 7th floor which caused burning downstairs. I discovered later that the people in the room next to mine slept through the whole fire until the firemen broke into their room at 8 am in the morning. Many would have perished, including myself, if the fire was not contained in time. The total disregard of fire code regulations and laws by the Hutchinson Group (owners of the hotel) by virtue of their stature and influence in the community is worrisome.

Firstly, I highly recommend the 'Airport Express' train from HK airport. It takes 24 mins to reach Central station costing HKD80pp. We then grabbed a taxi to Harbour Grand costing a further HKD45. A taxi from the airport is HKD360. The train was easy to access from arrivals, quick, clean, efficient and much cheaper. We caught it back to the airport too. Very impressed. We stayed on a room only basis and had a harbour facing room on the 17th floor and the room was spacious and clean, with a massive shower. No problem not getting brekkie included as Starbucks just round the corner. Ther hotel wanted HKD 215pp per day for brekkie. No thanks. Like everybody else says on their review, the hotel is slightly out of central town but with Fortress Hill station a 3 min walk away, you're never far from anywhere and the MTR impressive service and low cost shames the London Underground. We were there for 4 days and got an 'Octopus' card which is essentially a travel card which works on MTR, trams, ferries etc (Londoners will be familiair with Oyster cards, same thing). A small gripe, I didn't find the Consierge especially helpful. It was our first trip to HK and looked for some guidance on several places to visit and got little feedback other than suggesting where to go if we want to go shopping....thanks very much. Over all, if you don't mind being slightly out of SoHo or Wan Chai where all the evening action is then this hotel is very good and no complaints.

The staff here are very helpful and friendly and that was a great introduction to the city. A special mention must go to Leo in the Harbour Club. The location is controversial, but I get the feeling this is not a typical business hotel and that might explain it's capacity (seemed quite full) whilst being outside the main 'hub' of the city. In reality I think this is perfect in fact, since the walk to the MTR (Fortress Hill) takes only 2 mins and it is less than 5 mins to central from here on a direct line. There are some great places to eat along electric road - very cheaply too. I have stayed in a few hotels in HKG over recent years and none have had this (most spectacular) view from the harbour club floor (41) and the restaurant there. I have a feeling that this may only be achievable from this floor (and possibly even only from this part of Hong Kong Island) but when you price up breakfast it is not as bad a premium as if first seems. We will be back for a night in a week or so, and are not on the higher floors (we were on the 37th floor) so I will be able to compare then. The breakfast upstairs was good and the canapes and cocktails in the evening a nice touch, with free soft drinks and beer throughout the day. However, there is a huge construction project going on next door. It looks as if a new skyscaper is to be added to Hong Kong's increasingly cramped address book. This was not in progress when I visited and would have cost them my booking had it been. The pool area is very pleasant but under these circumstances it was not the relaxing haven I had expected. The level of noise is remarkable, it made hearing my children virtually impossible - and that is some achievement! The pool is also freezing and the children were shivering after only 10-15 mins of swimming. There also were pieces of glass, sharp wire and a screw, amongst the items we removed from the pool floor - one of which cut my son's foot. All rather bizarre for a 5-star establishment - as was the response (a sticking plaster). All in all, this did not spoil our stay but I would hesitate to 'recommend' this to families/people seeking R&R until the building site next door is more complete.

There was a good Business Centre too but a pity that the person behind the counter did not even know how to arrange for a DHL package to be picked up. Why it did not feel like a heavy weight 5 star hotel: weird location. The surroundings are rather run down with no trendy shops to speak off however there is a 7-11, 2 supermarkets and MTR station (Fortress Hill) is a short walk away though. It is not conveniently located i.e. From Fortress Hill. It is a few MTR stops to Admiralty (which you will need to get off in order to get to change MTR to Tsim Tsa Tsui). Suggestion: get the free shuttle buses from the hotel if it takes you to where you want to go (they go to Causeway Bay, Admiralty, Central). Slow elevators in Hotel. Made worse by large tour groups jostling for the elevators. If not too much more expensive, suggest getting a room from 28/F upwards. You will get to use elevators in a different elevator bank from those that tour groups use (they appear to generally use rooms up to 27/F). If you are after good sized rooms (by HK standards), want to feel comfortable in a large hotel with modern amenities, are not bothered too much by its location and its surroundings, and can live with service that does not go the extra mile, and cost is important (it is slightly cheaper than others more conveniently located hotels in the same class) I would say this is a good choice.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cFull Harbour View\u201d", "Author": "HongKong1234", "ReviewID": "UR126426183", "Content": "A short walk to the MTR station, brand new hotel.

A real 5 star experience. We found the best way to get around during the day was the metro/underground using Fortress Hill which is only 3 stops from central. I have never felt so safe on an underground system as I did there. We did also go on Star Ferry, buses, taxis and trams as well. On speaking to other tourists on a trip to the Buddha we realised that the compromise of very central v views was worth paying as others didn't have any view out of their hotel due to the built up area nature of the City. The open top bus tour was also an excellent way to find out about HK. We also went to see the Pandas at Ocean Park Theme Park and went on the cable car ride which gave great views over Aberdeen, Stanley and Repulse Bay. The night market in Kowloon was well worth a visit giving you a chance to experience the \"in your face\" Hong Kong. Once again 20/25 minutes back on the metro. Don't bother with the airport transfer which takes around 70 minutes as you are last hotel on the stop, get a taxi as it costs around the same 350HK$ or take the train and then taxi.

The evening refreshments included sparkling, white and red wine and water, soft drinks and beers, the latter three being available all day. We had a late check-out of 15:00 hrs, after which we were able to stay in the lounge until we left for the airport at about 20:00. This was very much appreciated as our flight was not until 23:30 hrs. I had made a mistake with my booking, booking only for 2 nights when I needed 3 nights. I had failed to pick this up both on the confirmation email and when I checked in. The staff did not inform me until I asked what time I need to check out the following day. By this time it was 16:00 hrs and no fuss was made. They gladly extended my stay, offering me the same room at a good rate. The following day I had trouble with the airline website, struggling to check in on line and print my boarding pass. They gladly helped me with this also, although it was a website problem at the time. Generally they were extremely helpful and pleasant.

I upgraded to one King room so I could be next to the room with my children. There unfortunately were no interconnecting rooms on the club floor but this actually worked really well with the age of my children. Everyday fresh fruit was delivered to our room as well as complimentary bottle water. The room was very clean and had no awful smells. The bathroom was great with a large round bath over which was a rain shower and a standard hand held shower. The bath amenities were well stocked including toothbrush/paste, loofah and bath salts as well as the usual amenities.

I stayed here for a week over New Years and found it to be a great location. Although there isn't a major shopping district around the hotel, there are still the essentials: Mannings, Wellcome supermarket, 7-11, McDonalds (with McCafe - good value coffee in Hong Kong!) and a Starbucks so you will never be without food nor caffeine. I found the Harbour Grand to be significantly cheaper and more spacious than other hotels that are closer to Central and Causeway bay.

The rooms were comfortable and nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were always helpful and efficient, contrary to some of the reviews on Trip Advisor. We had booked and prepaid for a Grand Deluxe Room and requested non smoking , a king bed and an extra bed for our 7 year old. On arrival we had been upgraded to a Premier Room on a non-smoking floor with a King Bed and the complimentary extra bed was made up and ready in the room. The view was spectacular from the room being able to see Central, Wanchai and also Kowloon. We took the Airport Express to Central and then the Airport Express transfer to the hotel which is only the second on the route so was very quick. On the way back we decided to take the A11 bus so we could have the scenic route. The A11 stop is right in front of the Fortress Hill MTR stop which is a couple of minutes from the hotel. We found the position convenient for transport so easy to get around. My son enjoyed the Ding Ding trams which run nearby and are easier I think to get around than in and out the MTR. The hotel has a free shuttle that we used a couple of times, do pick up the schedule from the concierge. We had the buffet breakfast one day and found it quite comprehensive and enjoyable. As you would expect in a five star hotel it was quite expensive. There are cheaper breakfast options in easy walking distance from the hotel. The only problem we had with the room was the bath took a long time to run away. We had maintenance to the room on a separate issue and they arrived and attended to the problem immediately. It may be worth noting that if you have any mobility issues then you would not want a room like ours with the circular bath as you have to climb into it and it may be awkward even with the provided safety rail. I would recommend this hotel, yes it may not be in the thick of the action in Causeway Bay or Central but the view and comfort of the hotel make up for that.

Then, a very convenient location near all sorts of public transportation including the underground (MTR). It's not the most central location but if you enjoy seeing more than the typical touristic objectives you will like it. The central area is 10 min away by underground and aprox 25 min by tram. The Causeway Bay area is reachable by foot, if you enjoy a 20 min walk. The rooms are a bit small for the price but clean and well equipped. The bad part concerns the staff. The people at the reception are not able to help, despite their somewhat friendly attitude. Some of them are barely speaking and understanding english. We were unfortunate enough to have problems with the low room temperature. The outside temperature was below 10 degrees Celsius during the night and the hotel didn't seem prepared for it, there was no heating, our room became very cold and as result we woke up frozen in the morning. We claimed this at the reception, they sent somebody to check the heating, the guy simulated working on something, but the next night was exactly the same. Then again claims and discussions, again no result. Luckily, the outside temperature did increase after the 3rd night so our problem was solved.

Michael on the concierge desk was exceptional in being helpful when it came to us choosing what we were going to do for the day as we chose to do things ourselves instead of booking on scheduled trips.

Michael is very helpful in assisting you to navigate the public transport if your destination in not accessible via the MTR. The hotel itself was ALWAYS spotless as were our rooms. I have to say as we stayed for 1 week I struggle to see what more space would be required, we have stayed at other hotels in other countries and have had rooms of similar size and considering that space is somewhat sparse I struggle to see what peoples issues were. We did not leave a deposit by credit card and this was not an issue either or us or the hotel. Would I come back??? - without a shadow of a doubt, would I upgrade next time??? - NO!!

To get to the hotel, you have to exit the station from exit 'A', then cross the main road and walk down Oil Street for a little over three minutes. Though this is a very quick walk and very connivent; be prepared to walk through a very isolated part of Hong Kong (there is a car repair shop and also a waste treatment area you have to basically walk through). Once you get to the hotel, the lobby is amazing. Check in is simple (on the 41st floor if your in a Club Room) and if you get to the Hotel after 11.30am you should get the room depending on the time of year. The rooms are very large compared to some Hong Kong hotels, and are very moden and clean. If you want the internet, be aware that it's a HKD130 a day charge. This is an awkward hotel to recommend due to it's location, mostly due to being over 10 minutes train ride from the center of Hont Kong. If your either a solo travler, or a family with teenagers this would be a hotel to look at. Family's with young children and also business travellers note that the Harbour Grand is a long distance from anywhere and a different hotel might suit. Also for any couples, this is a good hotel due to it's luxurious rooms.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cACCOUNTING SYSTEM ARCHAIC/EMBARRASSING.\u201d", "Author": "Rick B", "ReviewID": "UR122346272", "Content": "We booked this hotels New Year (2012) package, which included a number of things, but namely, the evening buffett and breakfast buffet. Our room (which was upgraded to a suite) was without a doubt one of the best we had ever stayed in definately 5 Star. But what let this hotel down was their cumbersome and archaic accounting/bill system, which went something like this: 1. On attending the New Years Eve buffet, you stopped at the reception area and quoted your room number, then escorted to your table - all good so far!! So the only thing you had to pay for was your drinks, sounds easy doesnt it?? But as your relaxing and enjoying your food, a female dressed in a Santas Costume approaches and produces a print out with your meal bill (remember already paid for) and your alcohol bill - by this stage I'd only had one beer. After explaining that youve paid for the meal, please check our room/account on your computer, I want to drink so more so give me our alcohol bill at the end of the evening. 2. Nope, you guessed it, some 15 mins later same lady returns for round 2, same paperwork, now outdated as Ive had two beers, insisting I sign it, then giving her the same explanation again. She then moves away to bother other guests. Similar arguments and grimacing as this just didnt make sense. 3. Now she's back again (on third beer) now go through step 1, step 2 and this time tell her to go away of I'll call the manager regarding her conduct/manner. Santas helper thinks this is all very funny and moves away again. 4. At this point in time, both my wife and I are really angry regarding this upsurd behaviour and billing system. Never have we encountered staff harrassing guests during meals to sign paperwork for meals already paid for or sign drinks bill/s when guests clearly havent finished drinking. 5. Most Hotels not just 5 Star Hotels which boast hosting international travellers, request your room number on entering the rest (to check payment/s) or if you have some coupon produce same at the rest reception. 6. Then at the completion of your meal, request your drinks bill then pay for same (or charge to your room), not pay for drink by drink!!! 7. Our overall experience at this hotel was tarnished by this crazy and embarrassing practise of annoying/harrassing guests whilst they are eating. We were not the only ones harrassed by Santas helper. And to top if off, this same practise of approaching/harrassing guests during their meals continued over to the breakfast buffet on new years day. 8.

The bathrooms in each room are glass-front with fancy fixtures and a walk-in shower. This is where we found the style-vs-substance start to become a problem. The faucets are to the side of the sink, which would be fine as a design choice except that somehow water just seemed to get all over the counter. Our walk in shower was lovely, except that the water never fully drained from the floor. Towels and toiletries were basic, actually a little less nice than what I would have expected. The rest of the rooms themselves were ok. We had rooms with two doubles, which was somewhat laughable because the beds were literally about 3 inches apart from one another. Beds and pillows were comfortable and towels were plush. Views from the rooms all seemed to be great harbour views. The suite was obviously larger, had a meeting table and full kitchen, but didn't appear to be all that much nicer. We found the location to be great. We weren't looking for a tourist/ex-pat bar scene/designer shops. This is a hotel in a real peoples' neighborhood in HK and we appreciated that. It's within easy walking distance to MTR stations, and near the stations are plenty of places to eat (fast food, bakery, congee-and-noodles type of restaurants). There were even multiple grocery stores to choose from to get snacks and drinks. Because of all the local activity we never felt unsafe. We went out at night to local restaurants, got up early and went to fruit stands and small cafes. Slightly to the east is Victoria Park. We even walked through the park back to the hotel after a late dinner out and felt completely safe. Service was a huge disappointment. One of the families we travelled with wanted to change rooms (to be on the same floor as another family) which first staff seemed to accommodate by offering to have the switch made and luggage moved. However later that day we arrived back to find them claiming to have no record of such a thing. The family was even dealing with the exact same individual whom they had talked to that morning! It was straightened out eventually. More disappointing was the concierge. They gave undesirable information (advising one family to take a cab up to Victoria Peak, rather than the much more popular double decker bus ride and Peak Tram!), or were just plain wrong. Ie told us that Maxim's at City Hall was open for dim sum in the morning on a weekday. We even called the restaurant to verify; when we noted that nobody answered the phone the concierge said \"Oh, they just don't take reservations.\" Our family wasted significant vacation time because of that. Paying for internet at all was really ridiculous when theoretically you could just go to the nearby McDonald's and use theirs (with a purchase). It was also relatively expensive. That being said, it was fast and easy to connect. Overall, it was clean and stylish, and generally we were satisfied with our stay.

I'd read some of the other posts on here and was a little concerned about the service and the distance but we found the hotel to be in a great location with breathtaking views. We took the airport express to Hong Kong station and picked up the free airport express shuttle bus. The hotel is stop two so its just over 15 minutes from the station. We had paid for a club level room so when we arrived we were taken up to the lounge on the 41st floor and given a welcome drink by Jay, the lounge host, while we completed the formalities. Our bags were automaticaly taken to our room for us. The hotel is very close to Fortress Hill MTR station, around a 5 minute walk to the station, with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Some other trip advisors have noted the immediate area being a little tatty. There is a garage opposite the hotel which is a bit dirty, but the area is safe and busy. We booked a harbour view room on the club floor which offers an amazing view of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the harbour. The view from the club floor is simply stunning. The room is smaller than the other hotel rooms on our holiday, but that was to be expected given we were stopping in an expensive city. The bathroom has a walk in bathtub which was very enjoyable after a day walking around, rainfall shower and high end complementary toiletries. The AC was very powerful which was a big plus! We had breakfast each morning in the club lounge which offered a good selection of hot and cold food, both western and asian. Eggs are made to order and was a selection including eggs benedict, scrambled, omlette and fried. During the afternoon an afternoon tea was provided, which included sandwiches, desserts and hot food, together with hot and cold drinks. Of an evening canapes were provided along with alcoholic drinks. After a tiring holiday this really was the best of the three hotels we stopped at. The service from all the staff was exemplary, nothing was too much trouble and the staff were friendly, polite and helpfull whenever we needed anything. The food was of a very high standard, and there was a varied selection every day. And finally, the views both during the day and night were amazing. One minor point, and in agreement with other tripadvisors, you would really expect a hotel of this quality to provide free wifi/broadband. As we were in a club room we could access wifi for free in the lounge, but we would have had to pay for access in our room. The costs quoted were extremely high so this is something to be mindful of.

We did not find the location to be that out of the way or problematic. Yes there is an auto detailing shop across the street, but there are a sufficient number of cafes, restaurants, shops, bars, etc to meet most needs within easy walking distance. The Fortress Hill neighborhood is not Central, so don't expect the slick, luxury goods stores. It feels like a neighborhood where everyday HK residents live so in that sense we found it refreshing. But there are two Starbucks nearby, several interesting local noodle bars, etc so we didn't feel deprived. The walk to MTR is easy and the ride into Central is quick. As for the hotel itself, it is quite nice. Rooms have a luxurious feel, beds are comfortable and the views are excellent. We found the service to be very good too, particularly the concierge desk which was quite helpful during our stay. Only minor complaints are design-related. Grand, over the top opulent lobby with soaring ceilings, gaudy lighting and marble has virtually nowhere to sit down. I've never seen such a huge lobby with no seating. Was meeting a colleague one morning and waited thirty minutes with nowhere to sit - can't imagine what they were thinking. Likewise, two minor design flaws in the rooms - the shower/tub is quite large and works well but it is extremely difficult to get into. You have to slide open a glass shower door and then step into the tub over a roughly 18-24\" high wall into the tub. This is awkward and would be very concerned about an elderly person attempting it. Also the single oval sink has the spout and handles on the side, not behind the sink, which makes it quite awkward to reach one of the handles. Basically you have to reach over the spout or put your hand through the water to reach it. Once again, chalk it up to what were they possibly thinking?

We also met up for a few days with a cousin of mine. They had both been here before so I had a distinct advantage. The hotel is set in an area where local people work. It will not appeal to everyone so if you prefer to be nearer to high end shops then central will be more to your taste. We love the area as we got to see local businesses and people go about their daily lives. Such lovely, hardworking and cheerful people. We never felt any fear no matter what time of day we were out and about. My only advice on that score is be careful on the mrt at rush hour times. The mrt is a stones throw away from the hotel and is a cheap and wonderful way to get round HK. The old Government buildings opposite the hotel are to be demolished so that will mean that there will be a better outlook. Once inside the hotel it's a different world. I can only review the club floor as we paid the extra money and boy was it worth it to have that extra luxury. The room wasn't so big but in such a highly populated place you could n't expect it to be. It was very clean and there were a good array of toiletries. The newpaper arrived each am in a velvet bag. There was fruit every day and compementary water. It was our anniversary whilst we were there and we arrived to a lovely rose on the bed. Ten minutes later we received a complentary bottle of champagne and a card from the management. So far we loved it We were on the 37th floor and the club lounge was on the 41st floor so you got the best views while you tucked into breakfast. Eggs were done to order. Afternoon tea was included with the club perks and was very welcome after a long day sightseeing or shopping. There is also a buffet at night . Cocktails and wine is served between 6pm and 8pm. Beer and soft drinks are served all night and the buffet is repenished till about 8pm. I only drink wine so the lovely Gloria who looked after us made sure that I had wine if we arrived late. The other hostesses are wonderful to and make sure that you want for nothing. This can be anything from booking a meal or taxi to help with planning a trip. Daniel one of the concierge on the front desk in the lobby was wonderful to us and always gave us extra info when we were going to say the peak. he told us to go up on the bus and down on the tram. Then told us about the area we then found ourselves and what there was to see, buy and eat. There is a outdoor swimming pool and gym. I only used the pool but the gym looked in good order. We didn't actually eat in the hotel restaurant and I think it was mega expensive(188).

The hotel is relatively new and very comfortable, with a really nice bed in the rooms. It's priced lower than comparable hotels on Hong Kong Island and I would recommend it for value. Fortress MTR is a 3 minute walk away - although I would recommend checking directions before traveling as it's not obvious how to get to hotel when you walk out of MTR station the first time. Breakfast is okay not great. Wifi worked well although did cost around SGD20 per day in addition to the room price. I only have three small complaints during my stay: first, I went to the hotel bar on top floor for an evening drink at around 11pm, but was told there was no room - even standing at the bar - which i found strange considering i was a paying guest of the hotel. Second, there are different lifts for different floors, which makes it awkward if you are visiting a friend/colleague staying in the same hotel. Also, the lifts were very slow. Third, I tried calling room service three times during my stay, and all three times noone answered the phone.

The beds are massive and very comfy my persistent lower backache has gone since I stayed here.We ate in their 188 restaurant with its stunning views, however this is an expensive thing to do, the food is good but the portions are small and the choice is poor if you don't want fish or meat. My husband and I had just drinks one night and paid \u00a345 for 3 very small wines and a beer.This is not a restaurant for the children they won't like the food choices. We had no breakfast in our room rate and this was not a problem, we got hot breakfast outside and also there are an abundance of pastry shops.The area is fine, I did some of my best shopping locally and Fortress Hill MTR is very close, you are in Central in minutes.There are a couple of laundries nearby, I was getting a big bag of clothes washed and ironed for less than \u00a32.50, in just a few hours. the laundry prices in the hotel are ridiculous and for people with more money than sense if we had used the hotel laundry we would have paid close to \u00a3150 instead of the \u00a37.50 we did pay.Its is very easy to get cabs directly outside the hotel there is a constant stream of them. The lifts are fast and efficient and the concierge is charming and professional.Doors are opened for you all the time and the staff are very polite and helpful. Housekeeping are discreet and thorough.I have read people moaning about the area, a few mechanics on the road outside, honestly, this is rubbish, its great and like all HK very safe,, loads of shops and places to eat nearby even a Starbucks and Macdonalds just down the road. Everything is available in HK.The only negative is some of the reception staff have poor English, It took nearly 45 mins to complete checkin and after a 13 hour flight this was not fun, I think if you scratch the surface with the receptionists you will come across some problems. A special mention to Lily Yung who was beyond helpful when one of my sons fell off the bed and caught his head on a desk and had to have 5 stitches at the local hospital, be careful of the beds, they are that bouncy.The lobby staff can arrange trips and China visa's, It has been a marvellous stay and we would definately return, my husband has loved it and he is a good benchmark as he moans a lot and likes things done well, he has loved the pool and the way the rooms are laid out with Feng Shui principles in mind.

Lobby lounge staff were above the way-below average service standards.

We were there for business and needed to be close to a friend who could babysit our son for a couple of days, so we chose the Harbour Brand based on proximity and hotel reviews. This review is quite wordy but I wanted to detail the particular events that occurred so people can have all the facts prior to making their booking. We stayed in a Premier Harbour View room which was around AUD$1650 for 5 nights and did not include breakfast. We requested an early check-in and when we arrived we were offered a room on a smoking floor until our non-smoking room was ready at the regular check-in time of 2pm. We were happy to be accommodated and arrived at our room and immediately ordered room service - wagyu beef burgers and 2 japanese beers - Asahi if I recall correctly. The meals arrived however the beers were Budweiser and the beef patty was slightly undercooked although tasty. We fell asleep for several hours and woke around 3.30pm - I called the front desk to inquire about our original room and we were informed that it was still not ready. As we were going out we said we could relocate when we returned in the evening. We returned around 7pm and immediately went to the front desk to organise our relocation. They said someone would call us in half an hour to relocate us. So we trooped upstairs - half an hour later the call came to inform us that someone would be at our room shortly to relocate us. Another 15-20 minutes ticked by - our son was ready to fall asleep and we made another call to check on what was happening. They assured us someone was on their way and again we waited another 10-15mins. My husband then went downstairs to see what was happening and make a complaint and 5 minutes later a bell-boy arrived and we were relocated to our original designated non-smoking room. I had requested a roll-away bed for my son but this was not present in the room and I didn't bother to ask for it as he was ready to fall asleep so he slept with us in the king bed. When my husband complained the response was that the hotel was extremely busy and hence the delay. The following day I was contacted by the Guest Services manager to discuss what had happened and he acknowledged that the level of service we received was not acceptable and we were offered a late (6pm) check-out as recompense. As we did not require a late checkout I asked for a car service to the airport on departure - this turned out to be a long-winded journey on a very tired-looking airport shuttle bus rather than the private car service I had envisaged. In the interim we enjoyed good customer service although room service meals were consistently served with missing items that were specified on the menu. Also for the entire duration of our stay there was only white bread available - all other bread options specified on the room service menu were not to be seen for reasons unknown. The hotel was well located for MTR services (nearest station Fortress Hill) however access by taxi was difficult as it resides in a rabbit warren of one-way lanes. Consequently waiting for taxis was also fraught as the only available taxis were those dropping off people to the hotel - there was not a steady run of vacant taxis on offer. I waited for half an hour one morning with my son from about 8.10am. Our overall experience of this hotel for AUD$330 a night was disappointing. Whilst there were many good qualities including good customer service response (apart from the first day) there were too many mistakes/issues to overlook and for the amount we paid I expected more bang for our buck - there was nothing complimentary included and the recompense offered for the poor service received on Day 1 was a little insulting. Based on our experience we would be hard-pressed to stay here again.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cStaying at the moment..\u201d", "Author": "BrisbaneKerry", "ReviewID": "UR118779910", "Content": "We are on club floor!

This is strange because in all the other 5 star hotels we've visited the choice was always ours. Either eat at the main restaurant with more choice for breakfast or eat in the club lounge where the choices are fewer but with more service and quiet atmosphere. Not in the Harbour Grand.

I do have a harbour view room but the drapes are behind the desk so it is not easy to get them open for the view. Hotel service is very good and the hotel staff is very attentive. We ate two meals in the hotel restaurant on the third floor (there are multiple restaurants). They serve both a lunch buffet and evening buffet. The first night we ordered off the menu. The next day we had the lunch buffet. The food is average, as is the service, but it is nice to have it available in the hotel. We toured the fitness room. There are a few pieces of equipment and a swimming pool. The pool was pretty busy so I did not use it during this visit.

After much research we chose to stay at the Harbour Grand Hong Kong and thoroughly enjoyed our whole experience. I decided to pay the extra to have the \"club room facilities\" I was so so pleased that I did. Once we arrived to the hotel, we were guided to the 41st floor to book in. We were immediately greeted and seated with refreshments and personalised check in. I found this really helpful, Shan recommended places to go and the best way to do them. The view from this lounge area was breathtaking, changing constantly with the weather. We used this club room daily, buffet breakfast was included (wonderful choices) and from 3pm refreshments and small pastries with hor derves were available, as well as free access to the internet with the 3 computers provided. It was a very exclusive treat, being greeted by name each time, we loved the luxury that surrounded us. Sometimes at night we didnt feel like a heavy meal, after a long hot day seeing the sights, so we would just retreat on the lounges and enjoy the night view, helping ourselves to the pastries. Our room was compact, yet had all the amenities required, immaculately clean, furnished very tastefully with a wonderful view of the harbour, situated on the 38th floor. Yes I agree the hotel is situated in a grungy area, car repair shops and vacated buildings. BUT in life we are all surrounded by the ugliness and beauty of the world, in all types of aspects. We felt completely safe where ever we ventured, night or day! I would have let my son travel on the trains at night or walk the surrounding areas alone, if he wanted, where in Melbourne I would never permit that. The MTR (public train system) is so close and so speedy, I am still amazed how perfect it was. A short walk 5 - 10 minutes to Fortress Hill Station and then the wait for a train is only 1- 3 minutes, unbelievable! Each train interconnects and you are in the shopping districts within minutes, highly recommend. Buy an Octopus Card at the airport, only HK$150 (cash) and you just swipe and travel everywhere you like on all public transport, until it runs out or just add more cash and off you go! So you can be where you want to be quite quickly, also the hotel provides a shuttle service at specified times, to designated areas which is also useful. The hustle and bustle of the city makes you feel alive with excitement and when the day ends we would go back and shut the doors to our peaceful hotel, this was much appreciated. We were lucky with the weather as in it didnt rain, but wow was the humidity high, relief was found by jumping in any air conditioned shop you could find.

We'd been to HK before but a very long time ago. Previously we'd stayed at the Excelsior on HK Island and we found it to be extremely good. The only reason we didnt stay there this trip was because they dont have a pool and, thinking (laughingly!!), we'd have time to sit back and relax a bit!! The hotel is a bit 'far out' located past the Wan Chai area and amongst motor repair 'shops' some of which are done out on the street! The general area is one of major renovations going on. On check-in we found the cavernous Lobby to be stunning but sterile, with, seemingly, miles of marble flooring. Crystal chandeliers abound - and thats about all you can see, There was classical harp music playing somewhere - turned out to be on the stairway!! We noted that we couldnt see the other parts of the hotel easily, like the bars or lounges etc. We were informed we'd been \"upgraded\" from our Superior Harbour View room to a Deluxe one. This was apparently one of the \"Club\" floors but without the Club access/priviledges. When we asked what they difference was, we were told it was a higher floor hence better views. OK!! We asked how much to upgrade to use the facilities( as we had considered this when we booked the hotel) but it was something ridiculous like $200/n!! No free Wi-fi either, anywhere in the hotel. Most hotels in Asia have this free in the Lounge at least. The time it took for the lifts to appear was unbelievable. They were SO slow, you could've been waiting for a funeral procession. But once in the lift, they moved PDQ!! The room was very nice and the shower was unusual with the fact it had a glass wall separating it from the b/r.It had a separate bathtub which was quite small and angled into the corner. The bed was very comfy (no complaints there apart from the weird thing these hotels have about not having a top sheet in the bed linen). At least the doona was adequately sized so you didnt get cold 'nether regions' when you turn over in bed!! I was so thirsty I opened one of the bottles of water not realising the ones in the fridge are NOT free of charge, only the ones on the dresser. Bugger!! I never consume anything out of a mini-bar because of the ridiculous price....but, too late this time. I thought I'd just replace it but couldn't find one the same size. You had to call Housekeeping to get a bucket of ice (we had our Duty Free to drink) all the time. The tea and coffee weren't replenished which is annoying. Its such a small thing to do and yet they obviously couldnt be bothered.. We didnt eat in any of their restaurants, so can't comment on that. However, one night we went to go to the pool and were told it was closed even though the staff were still in the Fitness Club, we were too late! We found the Concierge to be very helpful, but there wasnt a lot of info re the hotel shuttle buses, as to where they went - same for the airport shuttle. It was a bit confusing. The MTR was quite close and were a few small supermarket-type shops and the usual fast food outlets. As my mobility isnt great, that was the major thing for us - being able to get around without too much trouble. As others have written, taxis are plentiful and reasonable and the MTR close-by.

It would be great if they could come with some kind of label, to put our doubts to rest. (Since we couldn't tell them apart, could the staff?

Many reviewers complained about the distance from Central or Kowloon, but they really are not taking into account how close the hotel is to the mtr and how efficient the system is. Plus, there are a few cheap but tasty eating places close by.

I strongly recommend that you get a floor on the Club level which gives you access to the lounge on the top floor.

This hotel was better than we expected. We had average expectations because the price was considerably less than its other 5 star competitors. However, after staying there we realised that it certainly does live up to its 5 star rating. The room was as you would expect from a Hong Kong room 'cosy' but plenty of space for our holiday. The bed was super comfy and we had plenty of channels and a decent TV. A unexpected bonus was a small LCD screen in the bathroom. Better than reading a book :) The bathoom is very nice. A combined bath/shower, but spacious and very clean. The view from our room was fantastic however we never used the couch other than to dump our shopping on. The harbour club is a fantastic extra, so I would highly recommend potential guests to consider paying extra to upgrade to the benefits. The biggest reason is because of the excellent service we received. They were always friendly, remembered our names and even remembered our cocktail orders from the night before. The most impressive example of this was the first morning we asked for a special muesli order which required ingredients that weren't in their club room buffet. They were kind enough to organise a bowl of oats and a green apple thinly sliced. When we returned the next morning they greeted us and asked if we would like the same order again (Just from memory, not from information they had save on the computer) and we never had to remind them again for the remainder of our holiday. I will say this, I thought we could have had access to either the large buffet downstairs but was informed that we could only use the buffet in the club lounge which is a much smaller offering. The view however is fantastic. I think if I pushed the point, we might have been able to get a morning down there, but there was a reasonable amount of variety to keep us happy. The gym is pretty good and served it's purpose, but it's not far from a Fitness First, so we were able to use our Australian membership there as we remembered to take our cards anyway. The location is not the most convenient we have stayed at in Hong Kong (Wan Chai is a much more convenient location) but because the public transport is so good in Hong Kong, it really wasn't that big a deal. The shops in Causeway Bay are only a short $2HKD tram ride away or a quick underground train ride away from the Fortress Hill MTR station which is short walking distance. There are plenty of food options around in particular a great 'hanging meat' restaurant where we had plenty of roast meats, rice and kai lan for only $13AUD for 2 people. Whilst it is not the best hotel we've stayed at, it certainly is one of the best. Value for money (Room, Service, Club Facilities, Location), Harbour Grand is hard to beat in the 5 star hotel category.

Having stayed last time in touristy Kowloon we loved this hotel's location in a local neighbourhood still close to the action. An authentic HK mix of high end offices and hotels, local shops and eateries and yes, one or two small mechanic shops which truly aren't a problem. Very safe day and night with people out until late, shopping and returning from work. We booked two adjoining rooms for 3 nights on the Club level which was definitely worth the extra expense - with the endless round of free breakfasts, afternoon teas, cocktails and canapes we rarely felt the need to eat out! The Club has a spacious lounge on the 41st floor with soaring ceilings, plush furnishings and spectacular views from each side of the room through floor to ceiling windows. It has a casual vibe which means you are free to come and go as you please, help yourself to drinks, make use of the free wi-fi/computers and stay until late if you wish. Our girls loved their non-alcoholic 'mocktails'! Most mornings breakfast was served in the restaurant which juts straight out over the Harbour with 280 degree views of Central and Kowloon. Our Grand Deluxe Harbour View rooms had great views to Central and across to Kowloon and some of the most comfortable beds we have slept in.

Being vegitarian was OK the hotel was more than happy to accomodate us and we found one or two local buddist places that were fine. Tried the MTR this time as it was at the end of the street, would really recommend it. Cheap, clean, efficient.

The first time was my first trip to HK, and I liked the place so much I figured I'd go back. The lobby smells great. I know that's an odd statement, but it does. Whatever scent they have piped-in is amazing. The lobby itself is huge and beautifully decorated. I reserved a room on a Club Floor, requiring that we check in on the 41st floor, but mistakenly attempted to check-in at the front desk. One of the staff escorted my friends and I up to the 41st floor and made sure we were situated before heading back down to the lobby. Check-in was quick and without issue. I had forgotten to select some preferences during my online booking (I forgot to request two twin beds and a third, rollaway bed) and had emailed the hotel shortly after. All my post-online-reservation requests were met without hesitation or inconvenience. All the staff were incredibly gracious and spoke English very well. The rooms are average-sized for Asian 4- and 5-star hotels. Three people in one room felt a bit cramped at times, but we made do. The beds are wonderful and the furniture is modern and comfortable. In all, the room was well-appointed and actually looked exactly like the pictures online. The bathroom is great. Of the four walls that make up the bathroom, the \"wall\" facing the living area is actually just a glass panel, allowing an unimpeded view of Victoria Harbour. This makes for a beautiful scene. The privacy curtain that comes down to allow bathers to do so without an audience *did* let a lot of light through, though. This was especially bothersome at night while using the bathroom as you undoubtedly disturb anyone sleeping in the room. The tub was round and big enough for two, and the rainshower feature was great. The lightswitch for the bathroom, however, was near the front door to the room, which was a bit inconvenient in the middle of the night. We had access to the Club Lounge and was very much worth it. Breakfast in the morning was small, but had all the general Western and Asian necessities and we never left hungry. Plus, there were refreshments and beer available all day, and an afternoon tea that made for a nice snack before heading out for dinner. Plus, Internet access in the Club Lounge was free and relatively speedy. The furniture in the club lounge is nice and modern, but the chairs were not particularly comfortable for \"lounging\" - they were really big and it was hard to rest against the back of your chair AND reach your cocktail table at the same time. We didn't try the restaurant, 188 Degrees, so I can't comment on that. But the view from the Lounge, especially at night, are amazing. The hotel has a pool and fitness center, neither of which I used. The pool is under renovation, but looks great. The fitness center is actually decently-sized for hotel standards, and all the machines looked new. Maybe I'll save that for next time. A few minuses: -Internet fees in the rooms are astronomical. I still don't understand how that's possible given the rates for the rooms. Internet is so common these days it should be like running water and heat and A/C: standard. If it weren't for the Club Lounge, I wouldn't have had access at all during my time. -The location in North Point is very close to Fortress Hill MTR station, but the two blocks immediately surrounding the hotel are a little dodgy, and full of car-repair garages and other light-industrial businesses. We never felt unsafe or at risk - though we were three men who could handle ourselves in most situations - but it isn't a very picturesque walk from the MTR station to the hotel, not a scenic cab ride. -The hotel has 8 elevators, if I remember correctly, that serve all floors. The only \"Express Elevators\" they have, are two or three additionally elevators that only serve the ground floor through the 5th floor. I think that's a horrible waste of resources given that there're 35 or so floors of guest rooms. On more than one occasion, a tour group arrived in the lobby at the same time as my friends and I, and we had to wait upwards of 5-7 minutes to get an elevator, and then we were crammed into an elevator like sardines. They need to re-evaluate the concept and allocation of the Express Elevators. Even with the couple of nit-picky things, this hotel was great a year ago, and it was great last week.

We stayed here on our last leg of our honeymoon and were welcomed with a bottle of champagne and lovely congratulatory card from the hotel team. It was a lovely touch and made our stay extra-special. During our stay we dined in Le 188o restaurant which is highly recommended. The live jazz contributed to a relaxed and indulgent atmosphere with spectacular views of the harbour. The food was excellent, much better than that of Kwan Cheuk Heen restaurant on the fifth floor which was cold, rushed and poor in quality. Definitely to be avoided. The Club Lounge Reception staff were particularly attentive and offered excellent service. We stayed here for three nights and wished we had stayed longer. Our flight home departed extremely early in the morning which meant we missed breakfast in the hotel. This was not overlooked by the Club Lounge Reception staff who offered a breakfast box to take away without us asking for one.

For sight-seeing we would recommend the Big Bus Company tour which we caught from the Central Pier. It was roughly 25 pounds each and although expensive in comparison to the local transport it offered a very informative tour taking in sights around Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, Aberdeen Bay and out to Stanley Market.

Requested a room with 2 single beds on arrival, the check in staff acknowledged, but when we arrived at our room, it was a king bed configuration... not nice after a 12 hours flight and anxious to hit town before the shops close, the slow lifts doesn't help either... However, when I returned to the lobby and reported the mix up to another staff, she apologised and quickly arranged the right room for us, then she personally walk me up to the newly assigned room and made sure everything was OK. Very nicely dealt with. Our room is on the 28th floor. Decent size room by Hong Kong standards, very clean, modern, with flat HD TV, cordless phone, very nice view of the harbour. Can't really ask for more for the price I paid. The bathroom is probably the biggest I've seen in a Hong Kong hotel. Like others have mentioned, not a lot happens in the area, the garage wasn't a bother, just another corner shop. Can't really say location is a problem since its safe and the MTR(Metro/Tubes) station is very close by. But at times, it takes a few minutes to cross each road(theres 3) to get to the station, quite annoying knowing that its so near by. And if its at night, after a few drinks, I just wish my hotel was more central. Most of the staff I came across were polite, doorman always did his job with a smile. But they let themselves down on the last day, when I was leaving for an early morning flight. I had plenty of luggages and literally needed someone to open the door. The doorman wasn't there, (ok I didn't expect a doorman to be on duty at 5:30am) but staffs at the concierge were busy doing their own work, I had to ask them to open the door, they didn't respond very well... Overall, if their rate stays low, I will stay at this hotel again. Services were hit and miss, location is not the best, but I can't complain about the room.

The hotel is convenient for the tram, MTR and bus and the hotel's free shuttle will take you into town. It's well worth seeing the deals on offer, or ask, about upgrading to the Harbour Club. You can have breakfast, including eggs benedict, afternoon tea, including scones etc and alcoholic drinks from 6-8pm. This includes a range of cocktails. The staff are very helpful and warn you when the bar is closing! Having breakfast looking over the harbour really gets you going in the morning, ready to explore. Tea and coffee is available all day and free internet access. The rooms are a little small but who wants to spend time in their room! (Although the beds are really comfortable). The bathroom is a treat and the range of toiletries superb! (flannel, soap, shaving kit, toothbrush and toothpaste, sewing kit, shower gel, shampoo) See the travel desk as soon as you arrive and arrange some trips, we particularly recommend the \"Come Horseracing tour\" Also, take your swimmys, the outdoor pool (even in December) is beautifully heated and you can see across the harbour.

Rooms were still quite small but probably quite large in Hong Kong standards!! The hotel is still quite new so everything is lovely and clean and fresh. The view from the room is the main reason I chose this hotel and it didn't disappoint. The beds were probably the best hotel beds we have ever slept in - very plush and comfy. The bathroom was fantastic - lovely big bath with overhead shower head - very easy to use. Location was not an issue. There are a few small car repair places around the hotel but it is definitely not a problem and I always felt safe. It was actually quite nice staying out of the madness that is Hong Kong, and I think the view makes up for this. Breakfast buffet at the hotel was a little disappointing so we only did this once. Very expensive and almost no fruit to speak of. The eggs they use for the omelettes came out of a carton which totally put me off!! The dinner buffet however, was exceptional!! There are plenty of little eateries around the hotel (Starbucks x 2, McDonalds, 7Up, small bakery etc) so we got breakfast from these each morning. Train station is only a short walk away (2-3 min). Room service was great - reasonably priced and tasty. Concierge were helpful and they have a harpist playing in the lobby every night which is a lovely touch.

We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants,they are very expensive,if you want to eat locally walk towards the main road and on the first road on the right is Henry's Kitchen,second right is Coffee Millano which we thought was the better of these two Italian restaurants or try the Woooden Table opposite. Otherwise go to Causeway Bay on the hotel shuttle bus or the MTR or taxi where there are lots of restaurants Red Pepper was our favourite.Also a Thai restaurant in a small street of restaurants just to the left of the world trade centre where the hotel shuttle bus stops. A taxi back is very cheap. Our only negative comment about the hotel would be the lifts as you usually have to wait a long time for one!

Our friends were given a lower category room and wouldn't have been the wiser until they saw the room we had, despite being charged the same room rate as us. Afte staying for 5 nights, we decided to upgrade to a suite on level 37, giving the hotel over 24 hours notice to arrange this for us.

They then offered us a suite on the 32nd floor, which was ready immediately, so we took it as we did not wish to wait 3 more hours for our original suite request to be ready. No apology was given. We entertained 4 guests that night in the suite. The suite had a kitchenette with 2 electric elements for cooking, a fridge and a freezer, yet there was not a single utensil in the entire kitchenette. Not a knife, no wine glasses, no plates, no dishes, nothing. For the (hefty) price we paid, we would have expected the suite to be kitted out with glasses, utensils, dishes, etc. It was bare. We then asked for a late checkout (3pm, only an extra hour) and were assured that was fine. Upon returning to the hotel at 2pm our room cards no longer worked. Front desk never apologised, they just re-activated the room cards. We were also quoted incorrect pricing several times, even after quering the pricing. There were too many incorrect prices supplied to be an innocent mistake!!!! Our friends were initially given a lower category room yet had pre-paid for a higher category one. They complained and were moved, once again, no explanation or apology offered. The hotel appears to be a 5 star hotel but the service, constant errors made, and lack of any professionalism on the front desk is not of 5 star quality at all.

Not having been to Hong Kong for 25 years, and realising that it had changed considerably, we debated about a harbour view, and whether we preferred a mainland or HK Island location. Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor we booked Harbour Grand Hong Kong on line. Their instant confirmation and very friendly correspondence set a positive tone for our stay. After flying overnight from London we took the Airport Shuttle Bus, a journey of 45 minutes, and arrived at the Hotel at 8.30 a.m. As experienced, independent travelers, having covered all continents and extensively explored 75 countries, we realise that everyone\u2019s impressions and satisfaction levels of hotels differ widely. However, we only got as far as the foyer door to be certain that this was to be a special stay. Quite obviously this hotel knew what service meant and that guests were very welcome! The sophisticated elegance of this hotel\u2019s entrance foyer is dramatic; but it was the smiles at the entrance that said it all. Despite us telling the reception staff that we were hours early and could we please have our luggage looked after until check in time we were immediately taken up to Floor 41 - we had booked a Club room. We were shown to a table in what we came to realise was the Club lounge, and ten minutes later were treated to an unexpected but very welcome breakfast. By 9.30 a.m. we were unpacking in our luxurious and spacious room on the 40th floor and gazing out at the fabulous harbour views. For one glorious week we enjoyed the Club hospitality - smiles, chats, genuine interest in where we had been and what we had planned - from staff who can only be described as wonderful professionals. They are absolutely world class. It was a pleasure to stay here, have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and would definitely stay again. Sure, it is located to the east of Causeway Bay, but is easily accessible via trams, buses and the quite brilliant MTR underground system [Fortress Hill station]. In its price bracket this hotel is an excellent option and well worth considering. By the way - on Trip Advisor there were comments about this hotel being in a local area where \u2018locals\u2019 live and where car servicing takes place along the road. Yes, there is and it does; and this adds to the interest and great charm of the North Point area. This is Hong Kong, the real Hong Kong, where we wandered at night down to Victoria Park to watch the beautiful lantern Festival; and admire the locals by day as they exercised, chatted, lived; where it took but a few minutes and a couple of stops on the MTR to reach Causeway Bay with its restaurants and shopping; or to take the quaint trams that rumble through the main street to Central and beyond, thereby accessing The Peak, the Central bus station, Star Ferry to the mainland; and so much more. We purchased a transport card and highly recommend them. It\u2019s called an Octopus Card. For the equivalent of $20 Australian each we made multiple daily trips on trains, buses, trams and ferries, including ferries to two of the outer islands. This was exceptional value, but best of all it was very convenient as there is no queuing up. At the end of the week we were taken by the Hotel\u2019s courtesy coach to the Central Railway Station where airline check in was completed in minutes, and the technological up to the minute train whisked us to the amazing airport for our homeward journey. Now we\u2019ll save to be able to return to HK and Harbour Grand HK.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cMy wife and I had a wonderful time at this beautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "jhassinger", "ReviewID": "UR86882586", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here in November 2010.

As soon as I walked into the hotel I was impressed! For starters, they upgraded us to a club room on the 35th floor which went down well with me and although we couldn't use the club lounge, I was just happy with the kingsize bed! The bedroom wasn't massive (probably because the bed was so huge), but the layout was well thought out and the bed was so comfortable, I wished I could have taken it home with me! It was nice to have a cosy duck-down duvet and pillows. You also get a pillow menu! The pictures of Hong Kong on the walls were a really nice touch, and we had a really good tv and a good range of channels. I also thought the bathroom was a good layout although dubious at first with the glass front. I shut the electric curtain down on that straight away!! Really liked the wet room shower, had a decent hairdryer in the room and there was a good space in the wardrobe with an ironing board and Iron. I found the room very quiet and the hotel in general, eg: the lifts, the corridoors and communal areas clean and tidy. So comfort in the room wasn't a problem at all! The service was impeccable. I found all the staff friendly, helpful and extremely professional. My bf and I were in the lift with a staff member and she asked us how our holiday was and took a genuine interest in how we were finding out stay. I also found all the staff at the concierge and the doormen very friendly, considerate and willing to help. The restaurants in the Hotel are very expensive but fantastic. I went to the Japanese restaurant with my bf which was pricey but it was excellent food and also had snacks and drinks at the bar at the top of the hotel which again, was expensive, but very well done. It's worth going upstairs for a drink (even if it's just the one) as the view is stunning. The location of the hotel is good. I noticed a few people mentioned it's a bit 'out the way' but the MTR station Fortress Hill is literally minutes away at the end of Oil Street, the trams and buses are plentiful and if you get the free shuttle bus with the hotel to admiralty or HK station, then it's really easy peasy to travel! To give you a bit of a guide my bf and I took a taxi from the hotel to get to the Peak tram and it cost about HK$40 which is roughly just less of \u00a34 and it took about 10 minutes to get there (Travel time will depend on the traffic of course!). The surrounding area of the hotel is a bit 'old fashioned Hong Kong', basically quite 'local' but I actually really liked that. I found it safe and just around the corner of the hotel isa bar called 'Encore' which is cheap and cheerful. If you want cheap eats, then walk to the crossroads on Oil Street and go left and you'll find some local restaurants, very popular with the local chinese and some of the menus are in english which is always helpful!! You'll also find some interesting boutique clothing shops in the surrounding areas which I thought were decent value for money and very unique as I couldn't afford any designer shops in the main shopping malls. Also there are a few food markets around which are fascinating and great for going through to get a better feel of the culture of Hong Kong. (Take note, these are not posh farmer markets, they have livestock and are not for the faint hearted!) The facillities at the hotel are also good - there is a decent fitness space and a small swimming pool on the third floor. The lobby lounge by the japanese restaurant is nice and they have brilliant cakes!

The staff are extremely stressed out and was shouting at customers not a nice way to greet customers. The pool was clean and so was the gym. However, the jacuzzi's were cold. Take your camera to the pool as your get panaromic views so it is not that necessary to pay for the view in your room. It is noisy down by the pool as the motorway runs right next to it and there is a dredging/reclamation works happening too. I had amassage for 800HK dollars and it was nice, but the massage rooms were not very relaxing, there was beaming light in my face and not very professional.

The views both from my room, the Club floor lounge and Le 188 where breakfasts are served were amazing. Quality of the room interior and amenities are great. However, the walls are quite thin as noise of room doors closing could be heard. Breakfast selection at the Club floor was also pretty limited and slightly cold. I wasn't that bothered by the location cos its just approximately HKD45-55 by cab to Central. Plus the MTR station really wasn't that far. As mentioned, there are scheduled shuttle services available. There is also a good choice of local eateries around if you do venture around the area. Service-wise, apart from the service staff on the Club floor who were pleasant, the service of the front-desk staff in the lobby were severely lacking. No smile offered during the multiple times I approached the front desk or concierge for help. At check in, the receptionist merely methodologically processed the paperwork and did not smile or apologise even though the room was not ready ( it was already 2pm). As I approached the concierge to leave my luggage, the staff behind the concierge counter merely pointed me to her colleague standing 4 feet away from her!! I then decided to head out since the room was not ready, but asked for my luggage to sent up to my room when its ready. Surprisingly, I was told to come back, get my card key from the front desk and then inform the concierge where my room is. On other occassions where I forgot my room key and had to ask for a replacement, the front desk staff eyes all appeared glued to their computer terminals and couldn't be bothered to raise their heads to help. Overall, if all you are looking for is a hotel which is new with an amazing view, then this hotel is fine.

So the bathroom is a bit quirky as it is basically a green house............but the privacy bling did not work! After several visits to confirm that the thing was broken a handy man was sent who spent 20 minutes fixing it. Not a good start especially when recpetion refused to move us if they could fix it. Breakfast in the room was 1 hour late and it took 2 calls to even achieve this. Not once did the person on the phone say sorry. No free wi-fi in the room or lobby so asked to use the business centre for 5 minutes to check an email. Was asked how much time i wanted to pay for.............this is free everywhere else but again they wanted to make money. Following a busy day we wanted a drink in the hotel bar only to be told we couldnt go in because i was wearing shorts. I have no problems in restaurants/hotels in Singapore but here it was an issue. The bar was empty and only after causing a fuss did we get a drink in the corridoor to the bar. Not a good way to treat guests. To be honest the location is not an issue as taxi's are very cheap and the MTR is round the corner. The hotel is just ruined by the staff and complete lack of being able to sevice the customer. Either save your money and stay in Kowloon or go for a mainstream 4 or 5 star hotel that will actually be a 4 or 5 start hotel, not one that is pretending to be one. Hong Kong was great and the hotel did not impact the trip but if you have a choice stay away from this place.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201clocation & service lets the hotel down\u201d", "Author": "globalgal444", "ReviewID": "UR64337696", "Content": "A newish looking hotel. but serivce delivery appears to be erratic.

On the negative side, Oil Street is just that -- a bunch of car repair shops line the street around the hotel -- so the area needs a bit to be desired. This is really a 3 star hotel in a 1 star area -- staying on a club floor brings it up in stature a bit. -- there is a reason why this hotel is priced markedly less than other hotels of its 4 or 5 star ranking. A 5 to 10 block walk away are local shops and markets, frequented by Hong Kong residents, not tourists -- and a recommended diversion from downtown. It is interesting to see the fruits, vegetables, meats and of course fish (many live and \"prepared\" on the spot). An excellent restaurant is just a few blocks away, called \"Very Good Restaurant\" with excellent fresh seafood all reasonably priced -- again, a local, not a tourist, restaurant.

My main criticism is the service we received in their signature restaurant Le 188. We booked this along with another couple for our anniversary dinner. We took a dirink at the bar while we studied the menu, the drinks took an age to come and for some reason he got the order wrong. Once we had ordered my friends oysters came quite quickly, but after this we had a fair wait for our starters, during this time they told us on several occasion some bread was coming. First of all two Foie Gras (pan fried) arrived looked quite good, we then waited for the wives' to arrive which they did several minutes later, still no bread. Asked once again for bread as I like to eat bread with Foie Gras, could not wait any longer as my dish had now gone cold. After we had all finished some bread finally arrived. The same thing occurred with the main course, two arrived and then the second two arrived 7 minutes later (timed it). The food was poor quality (lots of poor quality foam !!) The service diabolical, and the response to our complaints poorly handled. The guy in the restaurant offered us a 20% discount, what he didn't realise was that we knew that as residents we were entitled to a 20% discount. We had stayed the few nights previouis in the Conrad which was excellent, Here I found the rooms noisy even though we were on 27th floor. The air conditioning was terrible, in the room difficult to get a comfortable setting. Other areas of the hotel were freezing cold i.e the restaurant. In fact most things were cold that should have been hot i.e. the food. We lost a camera and asked concierge to find us the phone number of a restaurant where we had been, he did so, and I asked him if he would call it for us. He refused saying that he could not call outside the hotel on his phone as it only had an internal line. I told him that I thought he was lying, and asked to see his superior (I would have had to phone off my UK mobile).

The views of hong kong are amazing and the beds were super comfy, service was outstanding, however it is on Kawloon side yet this isnt a problem.) When we went to check in to the Harbour Grand we were told that a double room like we requested was not available, after complaining they managed to \"find\" one on a smoking floor, we said no. So she looked again and eventually found one with a great view on the 30th floor but warning the rooms are very small. We went to unpack and found two closets yet neither had any shelving and there were only five hangers. Room service is a no no, breakfast in your room is not advisable. My boyfriend ordered a full english with no baked beans.... they then forgot the bacon and sausages and my waffles and apple juice all together. We then had it another day after complaining about the hotel to a manager (who was very unhelpful) to the worst waffles I have ever eaten, that were cold and my boyfriends fry up again was not right. One of the things I really look forward to when going to a hotel is the amazing breakfasts you can get, but here it really isnt good. The housekeeping is so bad they didnt pick up anything at all and only half cleaned the room, once we had complained they did step it up a bit. I really would not suggest this hotel, whats the point in staying in a 5 star hotel to have to complain about things that should be done automatically.

Mcdonalds, Subway, Burger King all close at hand for Westeners worried about the food, there is also a clutch of very good authentic Chinese restaurants close by. These make for very interesting meals !!! Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, we love it - in some ways it is nice to come back to a hotel a little out of the way and quieter after a day exploring. Don't let other reviews about the street put you off, there are about 2 garages and the walk to the main road with the trams and MTR is no more than 100m, it is fine.

In general, the hotel seems to be brand new and everything ranging from rooms to facilities is shiny, modern and well-polished in a neo-Jugend (Art Nouveau) style. Very nice! The huge lobby is quite impressive and most evenings there is live harp(!) music, a pleasant little feature. Less pleasant is the 24/7 muzak terror prevailing in other public areas of the hotel... The location is OK, it takes a few minutes to walk down to Victoria Park (and another few to Times Square). The area around the hotel is fairly bland and more of an office area rather than a residential area. There aren't many restaurants around apart from some very local and simple joints and junk food chains. A great asset is the close proximity to the Fortress Hill MTR station and the same goes for the tram stop on King's Road. The rooms are very modern, nice and clean with great harbour views! The broadband is as always sorely overpriced (140 HKD/night) and disappointingly slow and shaky. In addition, the room description on e.g. hotels.com is very ambivalent when it comes to the inclusion of the broadband in the quoted rate or not. I can assure you all, it is NOT. I had to fight quite a bit to negotiate the internet fee to more reasonable levels. The gym is super fresh (amazing views!) but is slightly under-equipped, but for basic needs it's OK. The pool and the pool area are most enjoyable, swimming in February overlooking Victoria Harbour is a true highlight! The service is generally unexperienced and pretty unflexible at times, but they are trying very hard, at least. The hotel restaurants are shockingly overpriced, but the breakfast buffet is really great! Make sure it's included in the price, it's one of the best parts of this hotel!

It is a modern building with accompanying design and functionality. The room was tastefully decorated, well maintained and perfectly cleaned. Land being at a premium in HK, every inch is squeezed out. Therefore the room was not greatly spacious though I only felt this by the rather smallish window. All the staff were friendly and helpful. It is a very busy place with crowds of people coming and going yet the doorman always had a smile and staff said hello as they passed. Again not the most spacious - but the bathroom was the most practical luxurious one that I have encountered. I despair at tastefully designed yet impractical design. At the Harbour Grand the bathrooom kept the water here it ought to be, the controls were simple and I had a great bath/shower experience. The glass dividing wall may make some uneasy, but the provision of an electrical modesty screen should comfort the more bashful. Room service was efficient and operates 24/7. The top floor bar is spectacular though spoilt by a massive lighting display that undermines the late night views. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and set my day off with a bang. The range of produce was impressive and tasty. There is a complimentary shuttle bus to the WTC and HK station. This operates to the second and synchronising my watch with the one in the bus proved beneficial. I recommend the rail link from the airport as the best way to reach HK central. Once in HK the underground system is brilliant and Fortress Hill station a very short stroll ( 5 minutes max.) from the hotel. A Starbucks enroute makes it even better. On the negative side there were the usual issues. (1) The pool was out of action. In any case it is actually at ground level and overlooked rather than on a roof. It struck me as unappealing and to be avoided as a deciding factor when selecting a hotel. (2) The banks of elevators are not connected so you have to select each bank seperatly. When the car arrives the indicators are not obvious. (3)WiFi is not free and the 24hr period is a calendar day not 24hr. So logging on at 9pm gives 3 hrs of wifi for \u00a313! To end on a high note.

When we booked, we flagged an arrival time of about 2pm - in fact, we arrived at 3pm so expected we would be able to check in straight away. Upon arrival, the foyer was full of people either checking in or waiting towards the sides for their rooms to be prepared. Luggage and bags were piling up near the front door and the bell boys were struggling to keep track of who each item belonged to. Upon entering, we walked towards the lobby desk with our baggage (no one had offered to take our bags) By the time we got to the front desk, the hotel had only booked us in for 1 night, despite us having email confirmation from them that we had booked (and paid for) 2 nights. After having to convince the staff we had a 2 night booking of a harbour view room, they mentioned that there was no room made up for us for two nights, and to \"go somewhere else\" for about an hour while they made up a new room for us (an \"upgraded room\" given that we had to wait). Having no where else to go, we waited in the lounge for an hour, where only the chef acknowledged us and said 'hello'. At 4pm we checked if our new upgraded room had been made up, which it was. We were handed the key and the lifts were pointed out to us. Again, no bellboy or staff member offered to help us with our baggage and we took these up ourselves. We then found that our \"upgraded room\" that had just been made up for us while we were waiting (keeping in mind, the original room we had booked was a harbour view room), only to find a very small, dark island facing room where the only spare space was taken up by a baby's cot (and we dont have kids or a baby!). Calling for the manager, we again had to wait while a further room was prepared for us (again, taking our baggage with us ourselves). While we ultimately got our harbour view suite (with some great views), the lack of service we experienced for these first few hours from checking in to getting a room for the duration of our stay tarnished our stay at the Harbour Grand.

It's very safe and conveniently located down a block from the MTR. We asked for a room with a pantry; housekeeping provides the kitchen stuff if requested. We only needed the microwave to warm up water for baby cereal so we didn't request the other stuff. You also have to call to have them plug in the microwave. We had great views of both sides of the harbor from our rooms on the 20th and 17th floors (we went to Macau and came back). The windows are in the corner as opposed to right next to the bed, but I was fine with it since our toddler was with us and I didn't want the lights to distract his sleep. I just sat on the ledge and looked out after putting baby to sleep. I could see the harbor from bed but the view was definitely better closer to the window. The pier right outside of the hotel also provides great view (and nice city skyline photo op) as well and is a nice little area for a toddler to run around. The bathroom does have the glass wall, but there's a screen you can roll down to have your privacy. The hotel should label the switch inside the bathroom because I first thought it was for the hair dryer until I pushed on it and saw the screen come down.

The room is quite luxurious and offers many facilities like LCD TV,DVD player, LAN connection, minibar, toilet facilities, wardrobe, electric kettle. The bathroom is very clean and the toiletries good to use. The bathroom has glass walls and hence there is no privacy. The room has two windows - one at 90 degree to the other. One window offers the view of the city and the other a breathtaking view of the harbour and Kowloon side. The room has a nice and comfortable bed and has many drawers to store things. Some considerations/negatives: 1) The hotel staff though very cooperative and helpful, will never go too much out of the way or treat you like royalty even if you are on honeymoon. Frankly, I had expected that we will be daily surprised with compilmentary gifts.

On arrival into the hotel the reception is very grand and really makes an impression. Check in is quick and efficiant. I booked and Grand delux harbour view room and was a little dissapointed that it only had 1 window raher than the 2 showed on that room on their website. However the view was good, even if a little obstructed by the room next to us. ( we were tucked in the corner of the hotel) The room itself was goos size but, a squeeze with the extra bed for a child. The bathroom was beautiful and the shower and bath were great. The glass window was novilty, but in the end we just left the blind down as it was a pain to keep waiting for the screen to go up and down. The sliding door is noisy if your not carefull closing it. There is very litlle space to hang towels and nowhere to dry your swim stuff. The bed and pillows were really comfortable. The location is OK, a short trip on the MTR or tram to the center, too far to walk. Well in the heat of august anyway! The hotel is located right next to some car repair shops and a old disused building, maybe not what you would expect of a hotel aiming for a 5 star status. But the area has a safe feel to walk around. A previous reviewer mentions a bath in the path that forces you to walk in the road. Sure enough its there, but I did not have to walk in the road to pass it and it would not put me off staying there. There are lots of coffee shops, fast food restaurants and a great itailian near by. Eating in the hotel is very expensive, and somthing I did not try as there are many other, better locations to eat for less, But we did visit the L188 for a glass of wine and enjoy the night view.

As other reviewers have mentioned, this hotel is in the 'soft opening' phase, so we got a real bargain... We stayed in a Premier Club Harbour View Room for around HKD$2000 per night with every fourth night free and let me say that this is outstanding value. We were met at HK station by the free shuttle bus which whisked us to the hotel where we were met by very friendly staff and one of the most amazing lobbys and chandeliers that I have ever seen... very impressive. For the first night we stayed in a Grand Deluxe Harbour View Room which was lovely and perfect for a couple staying one or two nights or a busines traveller, but for us for a longer stay we felt we needed some more room (and more importantly a sofa) so we decided to upgrade to the Premier room and feel that it was well worth it. It has a HUGE round bath, a lovely bathroom, king size bed, lovely sofa with a foot stool and a large flat screen TV, everything you could really need and plenty of space for a longer stay (by HK standards!) The rooms are brand new and are tastefully furnished and feature Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries which are a nice touch. What really puts this hotel ahead of the rest are the warm, friendly staff who really go out of their way to please you and make your stay enjoyable. We really felt like guests and were treated like Kings and Queens! (Thanks to Kayan, Lafisa, Apple and Sunny just to name a few!) We have stayed at the Sheraton Kowloon and the Kowloon Shangri-La and found the staff quite cold, but at the Harbour Grand it is just the opposite. Executive Club access is certainly worth including in your package, we were treated to an amazing buffet breakfast (one of the best I have had), high tea in the afternoon, cocktails and canapes in the evening (full cocktail and spirit list available on a complementary basis for two hours) and a smattering of other benefits including free internet access on one of three computers in the Club. We took advantage of the gym which is fully fitted with the latest and greatest treadmills, elliptical trainers and weight machines and overlooks the fabulous heated pool. It was lovely to while away the afternoon there having a dip overlooking the harbour and watching the boats go by... We found the location very convenient as the MTR is only 5 minutes walk away and you are only two stops to Causeway Bay and five to Central. There is also a free hotel shuttle to Causeway Bay, Hong Kong Station (Central) and Tai Koo. The views from the hotel are just the best in Hong Kong, and I agree with a previous reviewer, they are just a good as the peak! You can see down the Hong Kong Island with a clear view of the night lights but also see the Kowloon peninsula, the best of both worlds. It has been a treat to sit in the Club every evening with a cocktail and admire the view from the 41st floor! Overall, I would recommend to stay at this hotel whilst it is so reasonably priced as it may not be for too much longer as more people discover its charms... it is still in soft opening stages, but even if there are minor hiccups the staff more than make up for it, and the rate certainly does!

We had booked airport transportation with the hotel, so hotel's driver was waiting for us as we came through with our luggage. He escorted us to a nice S-class Mercedes and we were on our way to the hotel. The location of the hotel is nice, close to Fortress Hill MTR station, maybe 100-200 meters from the hotels front door and also tram stops are close. Plenty of small coffee shops (Starbuck etc) near by, and also many local restaurants (and McDonalds and Burger King), especially on Electric Road. Entering the lobby is amazing experience for the first (and the second and the third etc...) time ! It is huge and looks just so amazing. White marble floors, big (and I mean really, really big) crystal chandeliers on the ceiling and so on. Check-in for guests staying in their club rooms is on 41 floor but our check-in was on the lobby. Everything went smoohtly and took only few minutes (even with the temp check :) ). They escorted us to our room on 23 floor and our luggage arrived only few minutes later. Room was very comfortable, beds were especially nice, even the extra bed for our son. The room did feel a tad small with the three of us, but it wasn't too bad. For 2, there is plenty of room. The rooms are equipped with all the usual stuff, nice 42\" flat screen TV with good number of english channels, coffee makin facilities, minibar etc. Bathroom was beautiful, it has the oh now so hip glass wall which gives the nice illusion that the actual room is bigger than it really is. Bathtub is fun, it's a round one, I'm not sure if it is the most practical one, but hey, it sure looks cool. Rainforest shower head was lovely and the water pressure was more than adequate. There are only two complaints that we have about the rooms and they both concern bathroom : 1) Those sliding doors, they are awfully noisy if you are not extremely careful with them, if you slide them even a little too hard the banging sound is very, very loud (and will definately be heard in the rooms near you !) 2) There is no place to dry your towels, swimsuits etc if there are more than one people staying in the room. There was three of us, so we really had to use our imagination on how to dry our stuff after a pool visit or after a day on the beach. We ate breakfast twice at the hotel and while it is a bit pricy, it is really good, with wide selection of asian and western food. We had drinks on the Le 188 Restaurant & Lounge on the 41 floor, they make mean martinis, which were not overly expensive by the way, and the views, wow, incredible ! Other facilities, we only used the pool and it is good sized pool, hotel says it is 27 meters and yes, maybe the whole pool is, but the actual swimming area is not, maybe about 20 meters, but still, good size. View from the pool is also great, you could see Kowloon and IFC2 and other Hong Kong Island skyscrapers while laying in hot tub, not bad. But still, I think they should have build the pool one floor higher (it is on the third floor) or then build lower fence, then the view would have been absolutely amazing. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to Causeway Bay and Hong Kong Station and somewhere else :) We only used the transport to Hong Kong Station after our check-out. We happened to be here during typhoon Molave and that caused the only little mishap on our trip. My wife happened to wake up 4am on the night when the typhoon was at it's worst and noticed that our floor was completely wet ! So, we called to the number that the hotel had given before the typhoon (they had delivered a nice \"what to do\"-guide on the previous day) and after a couple of minutes, staff came to our room to check the situation. Pretty soon they realized that we could not stay in that room, so they arranged as another room. All this, from the phone call to the time we got our new room, took 20 minutes, most ! So, even though the situation was difficult (and as I talked to the guy who escorted us to our new room, he told us that no, we were not the only ones), they handled it very, very well (ok, they could have offered us upgrade etc for the rest of our stay, but hey, let's not get greedy here:)), and that, in my opinnion, tells a lot about the attitude of the staff and the hotel in general. All in all, this hotel has a lot of potential, and if they get everything running (even more) smoothly, they will be in very good position. If you are staying at this hotel during their soft opening (like we did), you have to remember that you are sort of like a guinea pig :) They are testing things, they are learning things, heck, they are even fixing the building all the time. But they try awfully hard and the staff is very, very friendly and eager to help you (like the time we came back to hotel after some serious shopping and we had purchased extra suitcase for us, I really had to almost fight with staff and tell them so many times, no, this is empty, ww just got it, I can carry it :) ) But because you will be sort of test customer, you get to try this great hotel with a bargain price :) But yes, we loved it !
