The hotel is spotless and the rooms are extremely extravagent with amazing views over the lagoon or ocean. It isnt too crowded and you couldnt fail to relax there which was a complete contrast as we booked into the Atlantis for 1 night at the end of our stay and it feels like your staying at a train station with all the ebb and flow of people,a very stressfull last night.

A real wow factor on arrival especially as two Rolls Royce Phantoms and a Lamborghini parked outside the main entrance. Staff very welcoming and friendly and we were promptly shown to our impressive 2 bedroom suite with three bathrooms! Very spacious rooms and extremely comfortable beds, flat screen tvs and fully fitted kitchen all superb. The pool and beach areas also excellent and I would certainly stay again BUT the dining options are very limited especially if you have taken a half board option. There was little if any selection really suited to children with no 'childrens menu' on offer and we were suprised that there was only one restaurant. Breakfast was good and plenty of selection, but lunchtime always posed problems with waiters as no one was quite sure what food we could have on half board. A poolside menu was available with a good choice but producing a daily menu with the half board option proved difficult on more than one occasion. None of the staff were sure whether the daily beach BBQ was available as a half board option. However the food we did have was good but the hotel needs to provide much more in the way of half board and childrens menus. Despite the hotel still only 6 months old it seems staff training in the dining room needs addressing! On one occasion our cutlery was changed three times before we had seen any food! I would recommend staying but only on a bed and breakfast basis and eat out in the evening in one of the amazing shopping malls taking the free shuttle bus service or a taxi. Note also that children are not allowed in the bar area next to the dining room so there is no facility to enjoy a pre dinner drink unless its at your table. The hotel was booked through British Airways and I would add that the package was a good price with excellent transfers, a large BMW was our vehicle to the hotel and two cars took us back to the airport, an Audi A8 and a Mercedes! The BA flight was good on schedule both ways, although the World Traveller food is still not as good as Emirates!", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dhahran, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cWoW Facility & Very Poor Services\u201d", "Author": "komosani", "ReviewID": "UR124658933", "Content": "This hotel considered to be one of the luxury hotels in Dubai.

If you were unfortunate enough to be at this one in the first week of January, you'd think they'd never run a hotel before! Where to start? Arrived early, room not ready. Not a problem. They suggested breakfast. It was cold. Went to first room. It overlooked a construction site. It hadn't been snagged and there were no electrical sockets. You couldn't even plug the bed side lamps in. We were moved to another room, which had been snagged. It was excellent. Feeling better... First night...gas is cut off. No hot food! Are they serious? Forced Decamp to Atlantis...amazing. Day two; Pool - service is the worst I have experienced any where in the world ever! (including the carribean - at least the Bajans are cool In being slow!) - it took 45 mins to get a glass of sprite (provided you went to remind them after 40 mins). Pool bar wasn't open. Pool restaurant was still being built (despite a reassurance from the hotel directly before I booked that everything was finished). Not particularly relaxing while they cut tiles for the badly needed 2nd restaurant. Shall I go on? Ah..being woken at 2am as a dozy cleaner decides that it is the best time to use a floor cleaning machine outside our room door!? The service staff are simply appalling, with the exception of the spa staff who were great. The spa - actually it isnt really a spa! It is some treatment rooms; no jacuzzi, no sauna, no steam...spa is a slightly optimistic description. Gym; rubbish. Two treadmills is hardly sufficient for the size of the complex. Went three times; three times returned having not used equipment, because they were in use. Lunch - it took one hour for the pool staff to bring the menu! It became a standing joke. By the end of the week, we had spent time purposefully away from the hotel because the service was doing my head in. I even went to a supermarket to buy my own drinks so I didn't have to ask anyone for a drink? Can you believe it? I certainly can't... I brought it to the attention of management...did they sort it? Did they make it better? No. It actually got worse. The manager actually suggested I went to stay elsewhere, which makes me sound like the guest from hell. I'm not. I have never written a review before. I have never before felt compelled to write to a hotel manager whilst in residence to outline the extensive issues I faced. To suggest I go elsewhere was insulting. The rooms were great and I suspect once phase two is complete and the staff have been (a) sacked (b) more recruited and (c) trained...this will one day be a fabulous resort.

I had stayed in the Kempinski, Mall of the Emirates the previous month for business and heard about their new hotel on the Palm. We were advised that the hotel was on soft opening so there would be no alcohol on premises during our stay, a sacrifice but not a huge one as on previous visits we would normally go out at night anyway and we could stock our room bar with duty free anyway. Our first impression on arrival was Wow at the look of the hotel from the outside, it is stunning. However the reception area late at night wasn't quite as impressive but they are still building and some of the reception shops are yet to open. We were then brought to our two bed room which was huge! The room looked fantastic, the bedrooms were very spacious with plenty of room for a family of 5. We also had a huge open reception room and a very large kitchen. Outside we had a very spacious balcony as we were right over reception. There was however a problem, our room smelled of cigarette smoke and there were butts and an empty packet left outside on the patio. Normally i wouldn't complain but it was quite a strong smell. Also we had requested a room with an outside Jacuzzi and were told there was none available. We decided to just get to bed as it was late and let management know the next day. The next day Matti really took hold of our complaint and said he would do his very best to change us to a better room. He duely delivered on his promise and had us upgraded to a 4 bed suite which was HUGE ! When we got there we were all stunned at the size of the room. 4 huge bedrooms, two huge reception areas upstairs and down, 3 patios and one with a jacuzzi. Amazing! After that the service was excellent although at times slow at the beach area. The pool and beach area was very nice and extremely clean and new. We felt very well looked after and really enjoyed the stay from that point on. The staff at reception were great especially Norman and Matti who made us feel really welcome.

The complex will when completed plans to have 18 (approx) eateries from what I gathered will be almost a mini mall style area, however not completed so cannot comment.
