The staff is typically friendly and helpful, on our last stay we did get placed into this one room that was laughably tiny on the first floor, I thnk it was 117 or something like that? but it was so small to open the door and let my mum get past me I had to stand on the bed, to be honest though we thought it was really funny and would have kept the room if the shower hadn't of been too small for my mum to keep using, but when we explained that and told them which room it was they were really good about switching the room for us. Also a note that when the elevator broke down on one of our stays when we were leaving one of their staff carried my very large heavy suitcase down a billion sets of stairs for me, whcih I thought was excellent service.

At the arrival we were told that they hotel did not have enough twin-bed rooms for all, so that some had to share a double bed. As you may imagine, that was not accepted, so they had to give some of us single-bed rooms instead. I had paid for a single-bed room, and as I paid the same as two guys paid for a twin-bed room I expected a room at the same size. However the single-bed rooms are very very small.

I asked the plumber, who came over and apparently fixed both problems - only to reappear in no time. I asked him again, he came again (I was covering my nudity with a towel), and again it was no use. I gave up and did my best to manage keeping my grievances to myself. I fought with the niagara by pouring hot water into it, i.e. was cooking my dungs, with the inevitably resulting smell.

When he insisted on being connected to my room, she told him the line was occupied. Later, when I inquired into these peculiarities she narrated, with ever-increasing enthusiasm that a guest whose first name was identical with mine had really left (the poor chick was not taught to check for the surname as well) and the line, well the line, ah, she asked the technician to see what was wrong about it.

As we were early prior to checkin the staff labeled our bags with what was a piece of sticky tap and a raffle ticket. Mean while the other staff behind the desk were franticly rushing around trying to find my details. One bag was taken and the other left in the foyer so meant we couldnt leave and had to wait a further 5-10min before the same chap came back for the other bag. During which a couple were checking out who at the time seemed very perterved and unhappy about their stay. Only until our return to check in and move into the room an hour later we seemed to have the same issue with the bags. Finally bags arrive and told to go and the the lift to 2nd floor. On the lift opening I can only but describe this as if you held a match box upside down and pushed the middle piece as if opening. I am the largest of persons but neither am I small 3persons if you are lucky will fit in this lift. Again on the lift opening to second floor you then begin to see space is something of an issues with a room door 2steps away and corridors that looked like rabbit worrens. Stairs twists and turns and dead ends everywhere. God forbid a fire emergency evacuation as the exit signs don't seem to help much either. Finally on finding the room on initial inspection seemed quite clean although has to be the smallest I have ever stayed in (nothing as shown on the picture on the website). A twin room beds diagonal to each other but so close the may as well be one and the bases of the beds dirty, stained and ripped in places. Worn carpets, a solid matrice where the floor was probably the more comfortable and again very dark and dingy. On a closer inspection the door to the \"bathroom\" only opens 3/4 the way as the sink was behind it. The floor, tile grout and silicon seal joints around the bath had mould. A shower head full of lime scale and so on and so on. Back to the rabbit worren on leaving the room the labyrinth of corridors managed to beat our memory something King Henry 8th would have been proud of in his hammersmith gardens. We ended up on a lower ground floor where we bumper into a maid and asked for help to the exit. She replied in broken English \"no exit\" more than slight worrying but eventually finding our way out 2min later with releaf. We stayed 2 nights \"unfortunately\" and on the evening returning on the second night the beds hadn't been made from the night before. The only plus side is the location, I wouldn't recommend the Berjaya to anyone unless you are paying 70% or less than the given price per night, however if you are disabled and are thinking of staying get out your barge poles!!

The hotel seems to be a bunch of old row houses put together. It is like a little maze. Our first room had a shower that I could not fit in. It was very uncomfortable. I asked to have my room changed and the new room was much better. Also, the toilets didn't flush that well. I asked the manager if they could have some vegan food available for us in the restaurant for breakfast. He said that he would. The first morning they had nothing but toast. We asked him again later that day and he said they would have soy milk for us the next morning and that the fruit they provided was vegan. The next morning came and they had no soy milk. The fruit looked like it came out of a can. I think the price for the breakfast is not worth it anyway. Go out for breakfast. You'll do better. Also, there is a great panini shop around the corner.

Don't let the attractive reception or exterior of this hotel fool you, nor the photos you might see on the internet. When I arrived at this hotel, everything was going well until I got into the cramped 2 person lift and ascended to my room. The corridors are incredibly small and the rooms are tiny. When I tried my cardkey in the door it didn't work so I went back to reception to tell them. They informed me that my room was 'dodgy' and the porter would let me in. After the porter let me into my room I was surprised that, even though the sun was shining, I had to turn on the lights because the window was so small it didn't let sufficient light in. The bathroom was so small, I could barely wash my hands in the tiny sink without getting water everywhere. The shower was also stained and everything about the room just seemed cheap and unfinished. Already dissappointed about the price i'd paid for such a dissappointing room, I realised that I wasn't happy with having to fetch the porter everytime I came and went so I complained at reception. Thecustomer service skills of the staff were little to none, and they told me there was nothing they could do about my faulty door. They weren't even understanding or apologetic, and didn't offer me any kind of compensation. The next day when I was due to check out I got a knock on my door at 2 minutes past 12 and a voice telling me I was due to check out. Never in my life have I come across this in a hotel. I got an online discount but the hotel rates are \u00a3130 for a twin room. I'm glad I didn't pay the full price as what I paid was already enough.
