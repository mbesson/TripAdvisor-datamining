We took the kitchenette suite. It was clean with a comfortable bed and plenty of room for the two of us. The room had A/C (a must in July!) and a TV. We enjoyed our stay as we were close to the beach and the main drag. The staff was friendly and helpful and housekeeping was prompt and competent. The hotel is quiet and comfortable at a reasonable price. There was construction going on next door but only during the day and the hotel discounted our rooms because of the \"noise\".

(2) Friendly, hassle-free front desk. (3) Price & availability. (4) Generally clean & pleasant. Not quite as good: (1) Construction was right next door to us during our stay, and I suspect it will be going on for months. (I was not told of this when I booked it.) This was noisy, including at night, and spoiled the ocean-side view a bit. (Although there might not be any such view once the construction is over.) (2) They asked that we limit use of toilet paper in the toilet. Never was quite sure what was allowed there. Words were something like \"do not fill toilet with toilet paper\". Many bathrooms in PDC want the TP to go in a trash can, not the toilet. My wife and kids liked the place, and thought I did a fine job of picking the hotel. I did not even try to book a hotel unitl mid-February. Availability was a problem by then. Based on comparison shopping on the internet, and using on-line booking agents, Tree Tops is a pretty good bargain. For that price, I can't complain. I got the booking through Worldlinks Travel, which was pretty hassle-free. Non-hotel observations on PDC generally. Places tend to not take credit cards, even if they say they do on the menu or if you ask directly. They want cash. One even said our card was \"denied\", when I know it wasn't. Beware of every single transaction, even at what look like more upscale restaurants. They don't have the bottle of wine you ordered, and neglect to tell you the substitute costs $13 more. Those \"free drinks\" they offered only come free if you order a meal over $20 (when most cost less than that) which they only tell you after you got the drinks and after you ordered. Etc. There is no such thing as a hassle-free transaction. The exception being the booking of Tree Tops through Worldlinks Travel, like I did.", "Date": "April 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "princessW", "ReviewID": "UR7290933", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Treetops for 5 nights, early in February, and we were very pleased. It was our first time in PDC. Yes, our room was \"no frills\", but it was clean and we had a great shower. We also had a mini fridge and coffee maker. On our first morning there, we had breakfast at a cafe just around the corner, on Avenue 5. We bought a pound of coffee there and they ground it up for us and gave us filters. The girls at the front desk, Amitra and Marchella were really sweet. They don't have a safe in the rooms, but there is one at the front desk, which we felt comfortaable to use the whole time we were there. The best thing about Treetops is the location. You are steps from the beach in one direction and steps from the main drag in the other. Yet, when you went to your room, you never heard a thing, so we always got a good night sleep. The stone path to the rooms is a little tough, especially when you first arrive and wheel your luggage to your room. Yes, the pool is just about useless, and the bar isn't worth your time, but you have all the bars that you would ever want right around the corner. Because the rooms are situated on either side of the pathway, beyond the front desk, there is only one entrance to the hotel. A night guard is on duty after 11pm. My husband is a pretty paranoid person, but even he felt safe here. We stayed during Super Bowl, and Treeetops did have a Super Bowl party in the bar. All in all, we met some great people, had the best time, and would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Ansgar IA", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be back\u201d", "Author": "neilhernan", "ReviewID": "UR7215076", "Content": "Four couples stayed in Treetops in late February 2007.

We paid $94.00/night, and that price is reasonable. The staff is polite. The courtyard of the hotel is pleasant, and the shade that it provides keeps your room cool during the day-so it didn't matter that they requested us to turn off the air conditioner while we were out.

The pool is under cover which makes it ideal for anyone needing to avoid the midday sun. They also have good-sized safety deposit boxes in reception for no extra charge. The only negative really was the noise of the aircon units which are on the balcony walls, which make sitting on the balconies in the evenings difficult.

Not bad but not great. Husband & I were looking for a clean comfy room for sleep in between diving. The staff was friendly & helpful. The room was clean but very sparse in accomodations. The a/c did work great. The large mini-fridge was convenient. The tv was tiny with no remote control for late night channel surfing. The only mirror was tiny & high up-- I'm a short female so that was inconvenient. The water pressure wasn't good at all & we didnt have hot water on our last night/morning. The bathroom windows were not covered & we were at ground level so it was weird having to hang towels up for privacy. They were very stingy about towels. The pool was not good-- completely covered and cold cold water! Very close to the public beach though so just walk on down & grab a chair or sqaure of sand. Hotel very conveniently located downtown-- all restaruants & shopping right there. DIVING: best dive shop in town located directly across the street- DIVE MIKE. Excellent guides, great service.
