{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cheap Stars in D.F. I stayed in a Porto Novo suite my first night and a regular room for two nights. For $85, the suite had a king bed, sitting area, huge Jucuzzi bathtub for 8, and very large bathroom. It's new, has great styling (inventive architecture and fresh, trendy paint), bilingual staff, underground parking, 24 hour security all over the place, great restaurant with good prices and teriffic service, a well-stocked bar, and it's QUIET. Taxis are instantly available, and you'll need them, because despite all the advantages, it's not real close to anything, but it's not real far from everything. For $50, you get a Hilton-sized and quality room that is also quiet. It's a great place and I'd stay there again.", "Date": "Feb 5, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR103184776", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d252595-r853592-Hotel_Suites_Porto_Novo-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "252595", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
