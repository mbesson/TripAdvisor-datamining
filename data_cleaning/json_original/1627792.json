Right on the beach, nice pool, bbq grill area, game room, fitness room and free DVD rental. Room was very clean and well equipped and had 2 towel exchanges a week. Limited activities. Staff was very courteous and friendly. All balconies face the beach, but first floor all you can see is the pool or parking lot. We were on the 5th floor and the view was great. Bring sandals to wear in the room, with so much fine sand you just cannot keep the floor clean. The very wide and nice beach is the attraction here.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, West Yorkshre", "Title": "\u201cCatalina Beach Club - w/e Dec 24th 2011\u201d", "Author": "Ambers56", "ReviewID": "UR122152026", "Content": "We have just returned from a two week holiday in Florida, the second week spent at CBC in Daytona Beach. We were on the third floor in a one bedroomed apt with a balcony, overlooking the beach/sea, which was brilliant to wake up to each morning. On arrival the unit smelled very clean and we were provided with ample towles, toilet rolls, soap, shampoo and conditioner etc. The furniture within the room however was very tired and mismatched and in need of updating. As their were only two of us we had the benefit of a bathroom each in the unit and the walk in power shower in my bathroo was fantastic.. The phone calls twice/three times a day touting for us to attend timeshare presentations were annoying to say the least and this was despite being told at check in that we were not remotely interested in attending. After the first couple of days we just didn't answer the phone. On the plus side they provided us us with a complimentatry newspaper every day, DVD rental was foc as was use of the safety deposit box in our room. There were two flat screen TV's (Lounge and bedroom) and 2 DVD players. During our stay in the area last year we had already been to NASCAR and done the tour so this year we went to Ponce Inlet Lighthouse and museum, visited the Friday farmers/flea market and spent a day at St Augustine where we thorouhly enjoyed visiting the\" Old Jail\" museum. There is not an awful lot to do in the area at this time of year aprt from enjoying the sun and swimming pool area at the hotel if you are lucky enough to get the weather (which we were this year). The hotel has an excellent games/recreation room and we played a game of bingo, table tennis and shuffle board in there. There is also a foc internet cafe in there with about six computers, a printer (to do your online airport check in) and plenty of books/magazines and jigsaws. Overall we enjoyed our holiday and will certainly miss the view we had each day however in my opinion this hotel is not gold crown standard and having been twice now to the area probably will not go back there again.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't go back\u201d", "Author": "beachbum95", "ReviewID": "UR121887716", "Content": "We just returned from Daytona Beach and spent five nights here. It was OK. We were actually supposed to be there for 7 nights, but moved to Orlando for the last two. The floors never seemed clean, which I can understand to a point with so much sand around. Bathroom in master bedroom was SO tiny, couldn't even shut the door without standing between the toilet and counter. The unit was very \"beachy\" looking and that was great. Patio door opened onto a balcony overlooking the ocean and that's where I spent each morning drinking coffee. That kind of made up for some of the other things that were lacking. I must say that one of the security officers was about the friendliest employee we encountered. Upon checking in, we were told that \"the rooms haven't been released, so we will call you when you can come back.\" She wasn't too welcoming. And, the phone calls 2 or 3 times a day, wanting our attendance at their sales meetings irritated the daylights out of us. We told them from the start that we were not interested, but we still got phone calls morning and evening. Also had notes stuck in our door every morning for the same reason. I know this is how these places work, but when they're told no from the start, they should respect that and BACK OFF. That is one reason I would not return there. Overall, it was an average location. Can't say that I would recommend it to anyone, honestly.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "W.C.

There was one bedroom with a bathroom attached however if you wanted to close the bathroom door you had to stand on the side of the toilet. The floors were all tile and looked clean but were very dirty. Later found out why, the guy that mops the floors uses the same mop and water for each room. The pool was nice and opened until 11 P.M. each night. Secure gate to get onto the beach. The beach was nice, the sand was like suger and squeeked when you walked on it. The chairs around the pool need new cushions badly, there was nothing left of them. There are grills for anyone to use down by the pool, nice for a cook out. Room furniture could use a good cleaning or replacement. We asked for a room safe key, it was not offered when we checked in. It was free for the week, just so anyone wanting a safe knows they are available. Saturday morning was check out for everyone and you had to be out of your room by 10A.M. not a problem getting up as the cleaning people started slamming doors and rolling noisy carts down the halls at 6 A.M.

The CBC was the polar opposite of the place we came from. The CBC's lobby was beautiful and inviting (it was Christmas time, so it was decorated from head to toe with all sorts of Christmas decor) and the front desk staff was so friendly. The resort was very secure; you had to have a key card to use the elevator and get into rooms (e.g. fitness room) around the resort. Our room was gorgeous and spotless with a lovely view of the ocean. We had two full baths (awesome) and one had a walk in shower, which I loved because it made me feel like I was in a rock video. :-) Seriously, all the applicances were in great condition and the flat screen tvs seemed like they were brand new. The only downside was that the dishes and mugs couldn't be used in the microwave. Not a big deal!! Sometimes it was hard to connect to the wifi in the room, but there was a great game room on the second floor with several PCs w/ internet access (and a printer) that could be used for free. This resort was so nice that we didn't want to leave.

We've been watching free DVD \"rental\" movies on a big HD flat screen, walking on the beach, sitting on the balcony with a great view. I got up early today and photographed a nice sunrise. Fresh towels twice a week. Friendly staff. Card access required for access = Secure. At first I thought the layout was funny, with the Master Bedroom having no windows or balcony but, that's where you sleep. Balcony is not much good while you are sleeping. You spend most of your waking time in the kitchen and living room, or on the balcony... This is a great layout! Wife was able to easily sleep in to almost 10 am yesterday and felt very rested. A/C in the elevators _is_ appreciated, I've found that elevators can get real funky smelling at these beach resorts.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Catalina Beach Club", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d1627792-Reviews-Catalina_Beach_Club-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1303 Atlantic Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Daytona Beach</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32118</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1627792", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/83/7f/7e/master.jpg"}}
