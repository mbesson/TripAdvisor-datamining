This has to be the worst experience of a Bed and Breakfast Establishment, in my entire 62 years of living on this planet.I can `only speak for myself,and not my wife.As a Major Organ Transplant Recipient,and also a double below knee leg amputee,this is most certainly the last sort of establishment that i should within a mile of.My chances of catching an infection from this lot,was very very high.On arrival,we were asked to pay the remainder of our 2 night payment up front.We were then ushered into a back room,along beside the reception area.The first thing that met us,was an extremely vile,ghastly smell,from a burst main sewer pipe,directly outside our bedroom window.The toilet was no more disabled friendly than fly in the air.There was no room to open 2 suitcases,unless you used the top of the bed.No kettle in the room to make tea or coffee.There was not even 1 seat on view.But of course the room was too small for one, anyhow.Then there was the dangerous,steep, filthy,stairway,down into what they describe as the breakfast room.Quite frankly,our 2 wee staffy doggies eat in a far superior eating area, than what we had here.My wife asked for corn flakes.The young man who served us,must have emptied the entire contents into her bowl.He maybe thought that we were staying away from the premises for a month.She also asked for toast,which surprise, surprise,she is still waiting for,and we have been back home in Dundee now for 5 days.I asked for scrambled egg and toast.It was in front of me within a minute.This must be a world record.But alas,the bread was barely lukewarm,which can hardly be described as toast.The scrambled egg was barely edible.We were planning a 2 night stay,as we had laid down a deposit for it.But,we decided to head back to Bonnie Dundee,Pronto.I demanded a refund for the night we cancelled.After a bit of discussion with the receptionist,who eventually telephoned the owner,i was then handed the refund.

Wish we had read reviews before we went. Felt slightly ill at ease when asked to pay balance on arrival at the somewhat scruffy reception - why oh why didn't I ask to see the room first!!! This \"hotel\" is absolutely dire - I hope they use our \u00c2\u00a385 per night charge to buy a new bed and some desperately needed paint. I take issue with some of the reviews which justify the disgusting conditions at this hotel because it is cheap - firstly I don't think it was cheap and secondly soap and water don't cost much so there is no excuse for this hotel to be so dirty. The only reason we stayed was because the sheets were clean and we were only there for a very short space of time. Furniture was old, grubby and damaged - we didn't even unpack - as the drawers were very grubby inside. Paint and plaster coming off the walls dirt on the skirting boards inches thick, the bedside lamp was vile - even after a shower you felt grubby due to the surroundings. There were no tea and coffee making facilities - probably just as well really!!! We used the deli on the corner for a late cuppa. Looked into the breakfast room on the first morning but turned tail and preferred to go and pay for breakfast - bit annoying really when you have already paid for it. Second morning decided to brave breakfast - well cup of tea really before heading off. When I say cup of tea I mean half a cup of hot water with tea bag on the side - no pot or top ups here - half a cup that's your whack. A bowl of pre-poured cornflakes was planted in front of my daughter (you didn't even have portion control) and two slices of \"toast\" was plonked in front of me - don't expect a toast rack or your toast in nice triangles. Don't expect \"would you like anything else, is everything ok for you\" - they don't ask because they really, really don't want the answers!!! It's location is extremely good and for London the price is competitive, however I have stayed in places far cheaper with excellent breakfast, friendly staff and delightful rooms - there is no excuse for this place - it is an absolute disgrace, Big Issue sellers would turn their noses up at this one. Come on Griffin House - clean up your act and give your guests a decent experience - you put London and the rest of the UK to utter shame.

After all, for 70 quid a night, it would be quite reasonable to expect \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or even \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in London for less than 120 a night. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in many hotels over the years. Some cost a lot less than the Griffin House and were virtually five-star apartments (The Salisbury Hotel on 57th Street in New York is amazing), others cost a lot less and were hideous (The Globe Hotel, Oswiecim, Poland begs some politically incorrect comparisons with the former death camp across the railway line). But the Griffin House Hotel takes the Golden Turd in the All-Time Overpriced Dump category. When I checked into the Griffin House and was struck by the profound sourness of the staff. Since I decided to give up living in Britain during the Thatcher tyranny, a kind of officious and humourless pseudo-customer-service has emerged, where you the customer are told you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very important yet treated as an undeserving cretin with the audacity to be giving them money. But the Griffin House staff have entered a new Superleague of crapulence in the arena of customer f***-you-ness. I paid for my two nights on arrival and was given the key to my room \u00e2\u20ac\u0153down the stairs and next to the Breakfast Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the basement? Yes, in the basement. The room was so small that the bedside tables were across from the creeky double bed, since there was virtually no room either side. The walls were stained by a tide-mark of damp rising from the floor. The shower was in a cupboard. Yes, a cupboard shower. Its nozzle bracket hung loosely from the wall, and when I took a shower the floor quickly with filled with water around my ankles. The toilet cupboard was fitted with a motion-detector air freshener, that spat Glade at me every time I entered the room, and if I dared move while sitting on the seat. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take too long having a dump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come out smelling like a disinfectant cake. The signal for the free wireless internet was unserviceably weak. I complained, nicely, and was told I could get a better signal in the Breakfast Room next door. But I was then questioned by other staff about what I was doing loitering there. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What room are you from?! What room are you from?!!!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The view from my window was the window of the kitchen, six inches away, which lit up 6:30am every morning and emanated with the clanging of pots. The first morning I just wanted the hell out of the Hotel, so I avoided the free breakfast in the Breakfast Room and ate at the Pret a Manger near Marble Arch. The second morning, however, I thought, hey, what the hell, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paid for, I might as well get something for my 70 quid a night. And, I have to say, this decision it worth every single penny. I was treated to a new and unaired episode of Falty Towers. It was truly hilarious. I took a seat at one of the three four-seater tables (a curious choice of seating, giving that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooms are either singles or doubles). The cook/waitress/entertainment came out of the kitchen to take my order. I had Option 1 or Option 2, the basic difference being eggs or cereal, and the choice of tea, coffee or hot chocolate. Could I order a black coffee? The milk is on your table, of course, the coffee comes out black. And how dare I ask such a ridiculous question. Since the coffee I ordered never showed up, they could have got away with spoiling me so much for choice anyway. I was distracted from my scrambled eggs by a French woman and her two daughters entering the Breakfast Room at 9:40am. The cook/waitress ordered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sit! Sit...! Come on...! SIT! We stop serving at 10am...! Sit or you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anything!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The party of three was coerced to sit across two different tables, the kids looking quite distressed and intimidated. Their order was taken with the same minus-scale level of respect I had experienced. Then the cook/waitress brought out three glasses of orange juice and slammed them down in front of each diner as though she was closing an auction. I was expecting next a large pot of gruel and Mr Bumble shouting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MORE?!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It would have been hilarious had the kids not have been trembling. I can just imagine what they would say when they get back to Lille or Paris or Lyon and tell their friends and family about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tres merde\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd time they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had in London. Since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at the Salisbury Hotel in New York, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve told so many people about it, and I know friends have told their friends, and so that place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation will only grow and it will get more clients. The staff at the Griffin House just do not get this. I mean, who cares if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a crap time in their dumpy hotel, when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of suckers out there, like I was, who read the misleading description of the hotel, think they might be getting 70 quid of hotel value and are duped into booking. Just after I checked out, I went for a pint at the pub on the corner, the Duke of Kendal. The barmaid asked where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been staying and we had a conversation about what a thoroughly crap time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had at the Griffin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh! I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend anyone stays there then...!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. And that too is why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this review. Just generally, if you get a bad vibe about a place when you arrive, ask to see the room *before* you pay anything. But more specifically, please save yourself the feeling of being ripped-off, abused and imprisoned in a basement and avoid the Griffin House Hotel. In short, I have three things to say about the Griffin House: 1. Do not stay at this hotel. 2. Do not stay at this hotel. 3.

The best they could offer was to put a 'camp bed' into the double room (i suggested the possibility of upgrading a single to another double and was met with a very un- friendly huff).

No lift and 3 flights of stairs later- 1 flight to the top floor was steep and very un-forgiving with suitcases and wearing heels, we arrived to our rooms. The 'now' triple was cramped and to get into bed you had sit at the bottom of the bed and crawl up, the bathroom door was off the hinges, cracked tiles and a sink you could barely wash your face in. One single was not actually that bad, except the shower knob came off in your hand and the other single room was hysterical... a shower in the cupboard (literally), wires hanging from the tv around the satellite box (that fell off onto me) leads across the floor and of course the bag over the smoke alarm.
