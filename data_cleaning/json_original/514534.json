I wanted one with a pool, and was weighing up Urban, Wellington and this one. So glad we went for this. Price was fantastic at about 100 euros a night. We got a quiet room (I imagine most are), which was a good size with the kitchenette and a view over the pool. Bed was comfortable, a/c worked well, We usually walked into town - it was about 30 minutes to Puerta Del Sol along some lovely roads, and about 15 minutes walk to the large park. Very safe neighbourhood. Two streets over is the main luxury shopping street, and it is an easy trip to the airport on the metro with only one change from Colon (and only 5 euros per person one way). Metro was very easy to get around Madrid, with two stations close by. There is a small Carrefour on the next street so you can get breakfast supplies, and the pool area was nice - it does not get sun being in the middle of high buildings, but is well maintained and relaxing. Reception staff were all friendly and helpful, and housekeeping was very good. I agree sometimes there is a small \"drain-y\" smell in the bathroom, but they do all they can with what they have, and it usually clears quickly. I would definitely return. On food, like the other reviewers we ate at Bar Tomate and it was our favourite place over 4 nights in Madrid. We also liked Metro Bistro although this is a little far from the hotel really (we caught the metro there). We also ate at Botin (so you can say you ate at the oldest restaurant in the world) and whilst the service was good, it was like joining a coach group - ship in ship out, with substandard food.

We (3 adults and 1 child) booked 2 rooms, including one (of two only; rm 602) with a balcony. Both rooms (the other opposite rm 602) were clean (but see later) and well furnished. There is \"not a scenic view\" as such from the balcony room but it was where we all congregated to watch the Olympics and basically enjoy the cool air and have breakfast/drinks. We did not cook (there are hobs in the rooms) but did use the microwave to heat up some food. Everything worked; the free wi-fi and pool were the main reasons for picking this hotel. The location is very good. Easy to get bus to town centre, tourist info centre. A 15 minute walk away are Prada, LV Gucci, El Cortes supermarket, little cafes and other lovely shops. Also, short walk to get the hop-on-hop-off tourist bus. If you fancy the Hard Rock Cafe (go by 7 pm otherwise be prepared for a long wait!) this is less than 10 minutes walk away. ALL the members of staff we met were very pleasant and helpful; the bartenders make good mojitos and the prices were less than cafes in Plaza Mayor. We did not have breakfast in the hotel. This is served in the small area before you step out to the pool area. BTW, you will not be able to resist pressing the button to start the \"metal sculpture\" each time you go by. The pool is tiny and the water was not warm as it is surrounded by tall buildings. This did not stop my lot jumping in! Taxi from airport cost under 25 euros. Well worth it with luggage and the heat! Being picky now - we requested non-smoking rooms. The balcony room was a smoking room but did not stink of smoke. The ash tray on the balcony had not been emptied. All in all, highly recommended hotel. Prefer staying in a small hotel.

First, the ambiance is very strange. There seems to never be anyone in the lobby, hallways, or anywhere else. There is no restaurant, which I don't like. The breakfast was average, and had several items, but very small compared to a normal hotel (like an NH) and moreover, looked like items had been carried over from day to day. Moreover, you had to find someone to give you some coffee, and servers were not friendly nor ever offered to give you anything. The tables for eating were very uncomfortable, like cocktail tables, and uncomfortable chairs. Overall, not a real dining room. It's not a cozy place. The people at the front desk moreover are not pleasant and not helpful. The rooms are average size, but there is a lot of noise on the street. The bulbs in the room are very dim and you cannot even read. The room has an uncomfortable configuration of furniture and the shower is very small and uncomfortable. I noticed that the floors were not properly cleaned each night and there was mold on the wall. I had a very unpleasant experience when I wanted to switch hotels, because I was not happy, and they informed me I would have to stay three additional nights. They said they had a 48 hour policy which was not written anywhere, and yet could not be varied. It was only when I asked a Spanish friend to help me out that they agreed that I could leave. What I would say is that they were arrogant, perhaps because I was a foreign person, although I could speak Spanish.

The location was also great, on a quiet street with many sights in walking distance - the Prado, Thyssen B, Retiro Park, Plaza Colon and Metro station. Even Plaza Mayor was in walking distance or a short metro ride. We would easily stay here again and recommend it to all of our friends.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "2", "Value": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spanien", "Title": "\u201cnice location but...\u201d", "Author": "fbob454", "ReviewID": "UR5712099", "Content": "This hotel has an excellent location but it was not what I expected. First, some of the staff were unkind and the manager in particular was a very rude, unhelpful and nasty person, something unsual at the Espahotel chain. The rooms are nicely decorated, and especially the bathroom. However, rooms are pretty small and surely not big enough for two people (a double room may be OK for one person only). The room has a kitchenette, but next to the wardrobe, which is not very practical. The tiny sitting area is compact too. The hotel itself does not have any facility (I saw a dirty and empty swimming pool which did not seem to be in use). There is no wi-fi either, so I guess it is not ideal for business stays. Overall, the hotel has a good location but it is not worth the price. There are much better choices in Madrid.", "Date": "August 26, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Amador De Los Rios", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d514534-Reviews-Amador_De_Los_Rios-Madrid.html", "Price": "$124 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Amador de los Rios 3</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28010</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "514534", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/db/f6/dbf6299fa8a5012c4e2fd92c7f0fca2a11large.jpg"}}
