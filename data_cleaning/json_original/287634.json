{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Trip of a Lifetime In planning a trip to Italy for a milestone birthday, a friend gave me a write-up on il-Borgo. I contacted them online with many questions and they responded immediately. I was sold. This was the second week of a two-week visit to Italy - and I was traveling alone the week at il-Borgo, so the surroundings were even more important. The facility/accommodations, the service, the tours, the local restaurants/cuisine were superb. The general manager, Alessandro, goes out of his way for every guest to ensure every need is met. I have traveled all over the world and never have I felt as welcomed - il-borgo makes you feel like you're home. I can't wait to return and have recommended it to many friends and work colleagues.Claire Fiore CrawfordHackensack, NJ", "Date": "Nov 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR283175774", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lonetraveler47"}, {"Content": "A fantastic experience We just spent a week at IL Borgo, a small hotel in the hills of Tuscany. The reasonable price included a wonderful bedroom suite, an excellent breakfast served by a basket outside our suite each morning, driver and guided tours in a number of Tuscan villages and cities including Florence, Siena, Volterra, San Gimignano, and Lucca. Each night we were dined in a different restaurant and the food and service was exceptional. Alessandro, the manager of IL Borgo, was very attentive and took care of our needs. He arranged side trips to ceramic and crystal factories as well as a trip to Castillo Banfi at our request. The scenery was superb with numerous views of vineyards and olive groves. To say we were pampered is an understatement. We loved every minute and hated to leave. We are already recommending this exceptional place and experience to our family and friends and look forward to returning in the future.", "Date": "Oct 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR479416849", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Frequenttraveler9217"}, {"Content": "The best of Tuscany My two sisters and I recently spent 9 nights ( Sept. 8 - Sept. 17, 2008) in Tuscany. The place we stayed, Ill Borgo, had been recommended by a friend who stayed there in 2004. It was a trip of a lifetime. The man in charge, Alessandro Guerriere, is a class act. He arranged everything from the airport transportation to his villa, our apartment, a driver for all of our excursions, the excellent restaurants where we dined, and great places to buy anything italian we wanted. The place we stayed was spotless, with twice daily cleaning. The Lessons of Tuscany was a great idea for us, because we were not very familiar with Italy and did not speak the language), We were driven to San Gimignano, Cinque Terre, Florence (twice), Sienna, and the Castello ki Verrazzano winery.  We changed our itinerary 3 times while we were there and Alessandro was always so willing to go along with any changes we wanted. Some days after we had toured all day we decided the next day it would be nice to just explore the little town of Montagnana and enjoy the pool at our villa. Those were some of our favorite days.  After our excursions we would return to Ill Borgo and have about 2 hours to prepare for our evening meal out. Daniel our driver for the week would pick us up, take us to the restaurant, and return 2- 3 hours later (depending on our wine consumption) to bring us home. One evening we dined at a castle in our own room! We felt like princesses. The views from Ill Borgo of Tuscany are breathtaking. If you are looking for a authentic Tuscan experience this place has it. We all hope to return with our husbands some day.", "Date": "Oct 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR702426532", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "knabe08"}, {"Content": "A lovely hideaway in Tuscany We arranged to spend a week at the Villa Bossi-Pucci in early October as part of a tour group of ten individuals. The weather was warm and mostly dry and sunny (one day of rain). The property more closely resembles a condominium in the US, though the grounds include an olive grove and a large park area with many trees and paths, as well as the original villa (there are apparently plans to convert it into a hotel). The units themselves (ours had a single bedroom and bathroom, a small kitchen and a living room) are spacious, pleasant, clean and well equipped, very comfortable for a week's stay. Only some of the rooms shared the spectacular view of the Tuscan countryside (we were among the fortunate -- room 414); others looked over the parking lot or into the courtyard. There was a swimming pool and although it wasn't warm enough to swim, we spent some time relaxing around the pool after our day trips. Continental breakfast (except for coffee or tea, which you prepare in your room) was left in a basket on our porch each morning. There was also a small gift in the basket every day (e.g., a diary, a fancy pen, a calendar, stamped postcards), which spoke to the ambience of the Villa and the thoughtfulness of the management. There was a complementary bottle of water and red wine waiting for us in our room each day, another thoughtful touch.  The theme of the trip, and a theme of the Villa, is learning about Tuscany; we had on our schedule a cooking and a wine class, guided tours of towns and cities in Tuscany each day and dinner at a different restaurant each night. The Villa offered additional afternoon courses, none of which our group took; with such a busy schedule we all welcomed the few hours to relax between the day tour and dinner. The cooking lesson at the Villa was charming and enjoyed by all (even, it seems, the chef and Marta, who translated). Everyone participated in preparing the dinner that we would be eating that evening. Many thought it was the best meal of the trip (pride of ownership?); we felt that most of the restaurants selected for our group were considerably better than those on other tours we have taken in Europe. The dinners were always more than plentiful (antipasto or salad, pasta, main course -- meat or fish -- wine, coffee and dessert). The food was invariably fresh and well prepared, though in some instances not quite as well spiced as we would have expected in a Tuscan meal. It appears as though some coordination had been done since there was quite a variety in the kinds of pasta and meat or fowl served; notably, however, there was no fish the entire week, which we missed.  The planning of the day trips was excellent with the glaring exception that the visit to Florence had been arranged for a Monday, when major museums are closed; however, Alessandro, the manager, kindly arranged for us to travel to Florence on an additional day (in lieu of the visit to a vineyard, many of which we have already seen); he booked the museum tickets for us and arranged for us to travel to Florence with another group staying at the Villa.  Special kudos are due to Alessandro, a gracious and accommodating host. He or his assistant Marta were always available to deal with our needs. They saw us off on our trips every day with bottled water and were waiting for us on our return with complementary soft drinks (or hot drinks always available from a machine near the office) and cookies or other treats. The drivers, Francesco and Daniele, were expert and friendly.  Tuscany is a wonderful location and with the excellent accommodations, the professional and thoughtful staff and the wonderful food and wine, we could not have been happier.", "Date": "Oct 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR894906730", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "adanacsim"}, {"Content": "Tuscan Good Life       The view from our terrace", "Date": "Sep 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR299133410", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Marian Sroge"}, {"Content": "Il Borgo is Awesome!

Date: November 2, 2007Reviewer: TripAdvisor member, CaliforniaIl Borgo has a Lessons of Tuscany program that exceeded all our expectations. We signed up for the program and an additional 3 days bed  breakfast. It was a great idea. On the Lessons program we went to a different Tuscan location each day, transportation included, and were provided with a guide for a walking tour. After the tour we had several hours on our own to explore in any way we wanted before the driver appeared to take us back to il Borgo. Later in the evening the driver was back to take all the guests to dinner and bring us back afterward. All the people involved - the guides, the drivers, and the restaurants - were selected and well-known by Alessandro Guerrieri, the manager of il Borgo. We had guides who were not only knowledgeable but also spoke English. We had excellent drivers from a small owner-operated transportation company. Our dinners were in family-run restaurants that catered to the locals - we were the only Americans there. It was a slice of Italy that we'd never experienced before, even though we'd been there 5-6 times before. Our apartment was spacious and immaculate, with room for everything. The breakfast was fresh and warm, brought to our apartment every morning. Alessandro was exceptional in attending to the wishes of the guests, and he was always present and available from early morning until he saw us off for dinner. In addition to the Lessons of Tuscany, il Borgo offers classes in a variety of subjects. We took only the wine tasting class, and it was very interesting which was a surprise to us since we're Californians who have been wine tasting many times. We really can't think of a thing to complain about - and we're planning to return again soon.
