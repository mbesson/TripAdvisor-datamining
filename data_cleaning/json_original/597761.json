After the amazing experience of Aston, this place left a little to be desired......Firstly, it is a LONG WAY from anywhere.......It is in a beautiful rural area, and although it can be part of the appeal (nothing to do but lying by the pool reading!), it does have its limits . If you are not content with eating at their restuarant (which is a little lacking.....) then you're in for a twenty minute car trip into Ubud (which if you take the free shuttle, must be stirctly scheduled.) We found it easier to keep the details of a driver based in Ubud and call them when required (this cost about 70000rp per trip)The staff were a little vague (we were introduced to the hotels tours and services on our second last day, and advised of the special crispy duck after it had been on the menu for a week!, but their smiles and genuine innocence seem to make it acceptable. The rooms were quite tired - ours had a badly leaking air conditioner, a very bad ant problem in the toilet. and the other gorup we were travelling with actually changed rooms due to poor condition of various items (air conditioner, doors not locking etc.). All in all, quite a nice resort to finish a holiday, although i'd go for three nights, and spend the rest closer to the centre of Ubud, (and closer to Mozaic Restuarant!!!)", "Date": "Jul 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR906026040", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "delndan"}, {"Content": "amazing enviroment we stayed at the hotel for 3nights. the hotel is located quite far from ubud.

This was sorted out in a few minutes, while having a complementary drink and a cool towel. And yes I have traveled a lot in my life, but I also found this a very beatiful hotel for the price you pay. I found the location excellent in a real tropical valley, so nice and quiet (if you like quiet). We were travelling with four other people on a five day tour and they all liked this hotel the most. The rooms are really nice with confortable beds. We had an indoor bathroom with a sunken bath and a view. I have to admit that getting to the room you had to do several steps up, but for me it was worth it. We ate breakfast and dinner at the restaurant, which was OK, but nothing special. But the setting makes everything so special. I would defenitely recommand this hotel for people who like a nice quiet hide-away during their stay in Bali for a few days.

I was very pleased with the accommodations. We enjoyed a private garden villa that was very well kept. The staff was friendly, always helpful and quick to assist with anything we needed.While it's true that the resort is about a 20 minute drive from Ubud, being in the remote, more local surroundings offers an authentic experience. The hotel shuttle service is reliable, and it's extremely easy to hire a taxi driver in Ubud - and the price is negotiable. Went mountain biking with a hotel guide for a fun journey through local Balinese villages and rice fields. We toured through a traditional Balinese housing compound and visited a beautiful temple. Then enjoyed fresh fruit and tea - well worth the price.It was low season, so we felt like we had the place to ourselves. The included breakfast was good.

The villa was spotless, very romantic and we had a wonderful view, not luxurious but 'special'. The spa treatment we had was bliss. Yes it's more expensive than you would pay in Ubud, but please support whats on offer otherwise the spa may not survive. Please also support Mr. Bhutto who runs the guest activities. We really enjoyed his early morning yoga, as the sun was coming up and the bike ride into the surrounding countryside. The only negative experience was trying to settle our bill with our credit card. Please be warned that certain cards are not accepted around Ubud and we had a frantic time trying to find an ATM that would dispense enough cash. Also we discovered it is better to inform your bank before you go to these offbeat areas. It certainly has not put us off the thought of going back.

At Santi Mandala reality surpasses expectation. The setting in the little valley, with all the greenery, the harmonious architecture, the wonderfully relaxed atmosphere - great, but for me what made the place was the staff. I can still see those wide Balinese smiles now, as I write.I repeat the comments of others re. the distance from Ubud, which was our primary goal, and where we ate every evening. It was not an issue at all. The shuttle service was excellent and the couple of occasions when we missed the shuttle or preferred to stay a while longer, it cost just $5 to get a taxi.

The room and resort were beautiful, Santi Mandala is a real haven.We treated ourselves to a couple of spa packages which were ok value (around \u62e240 for 4 hours of massage/masque/facial etc) and definitely woth doing at least once to enjoy to exceptionally serene spa location.Our only gripe was the food - well below average (and expensive compared to restaurants in Ubud). Breakfast was included in the room rate, but was uninspired and poorly cooked (for example, scrambled egg arrived on slightly hard bread rather than toast). We ate dinner in the restaurant once and my girlfriend's chicken had to be sent back as it was still raw in the centre! My pumpkin soup was so salty in was inedible. The only other time we ate there was lunch on one occasion and the food was similarly poor (prawn salad contained just two prawns and soup tasted like it came out of can).On the brightside the hotel provides a shuttle to Ubud, either for free or around \u62e23 depending on when you want to go. Suffice to say we ate at restaurants there every evening and in every case the food was far superior and more reasonably priced to Santi Mandala.Mantenance could have been better: two lightbulbs were dead throughout our stay, the bathtub plug lever was broken and the sink drain was very slow, but these are minor gripes and on the whole the room was very good value for the price paid (around \u62e265 per night).I would wholly recommend this resort provided you get a decent discount and are prepared to eat out.

Never have I stayed somewhere so reasonable yet so relaxing.The hotel is not in the centre of Ubud, but why would you want to be, this location is perfect: privacy without isolation. There is a shuttle bus to take you to Ubud, and the hotel staff are happy to take you to Ubud outside of the shuttle bus hours for a small fee.

We stayed there 4 nights and booked it through the hotel reservation desk at Denpasar airport at a real bargain price ($65).The hotel covers 3.5 acres at both sides of a small river. We stayed in garden view cottage nr 102 and can highly recommend this. The cottage's private garden overlooking water with oudoors bathroom is breathtaking. The location is just amazing as is the pool at the left bank of the river. Amazing scenery and views on tropical forest as well.Opposite the lobby is a lovely little temple. Coincidently, on June 7th, they held a ceremony with dragon dances (and attendable if dressed appropriately), which added further value.The only drawback is the distance from Ubud centre (20min by car) but fully compensated for by free shuttle buses. Besides, after 21.00h the Ubud's central streets are pretty empty after all. As a compairison, we stayed the following 2 nights in the Ubud Village hotel in the middle of the centre just to try another hotel. Although we paid the same price and were upgraded to superior room, we 'd definitely favour the Santi, just because of its tranquility and serenity.
