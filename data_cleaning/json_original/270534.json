Check-in was smooth, the front desk peeps are very friendly and helpful, especially Aiza (I hope that's the right spelling!). Our room was clean and we didn't have any issues with the A/C unit. Towels were replaced daily as well which was nice. We had room 411 on the 4th floor. The free breakfast was conveniant, they had eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, coffee, juice, oatmeal, cereal, english muffins, etc. We always tried to go for breakfast before 7am to avoid the crowds. There's also a 24hr Walmart across the street that you can walk to which came in handy for buying snacks and cold drinks for our mini fridge. The hotel has a pool too but we didn't get a chance to try it out. My only complaint is the shuttle service to the parks. The one to Disney is fine, it drops you off at Epcot and you can take a Disney bus or monorail from there to the other parks. That shuttle came at 7:50am and 12noon at the hotel. What was annoying with this shuttle was that whenever the bus stops at another hotel for more passengers, they're never standing outside so we're sitting on the bus while the driver has to stop the vehicle, get off and go inside the lobby to get them. Those moments wasted a lot of time for nothing. The shuttle to Universal was so complicated and annoying. It came at 9:50am. We're standing outside and we ask the driver if this is the right bus. He tells us to wait a bit. Another bus comes and tells us he's going to Seaworld and the other guy to Universal when it was the other way around. So we got off the Seaworld one and had to run and signal the other guy to stop to let us on. Then the thing with picking up other people who aren't already outside and confusing them with the Seaworld thing. So we ending up stopping at Seaworld anyway because we had 3 people on our bus assuming we were going there. That ride took an hour to get to Universal Studios.

First impression was that we didn't like the outside colors. But the whole property was clean and did not show any signs of being in need of repairs other than the walls on the 4th floor where a child had scratched a long mark along the walls. They couldn't do much with that since the walls are wallpapered. We were greated very warmly at the front desk. The gentleman was very accommodating and very sincere. He emphasized the hotel was \"no smoking\" which we loved because my son can have reactions to smoke. Our room was #422 which I highly recommend. It is on the end and oversees the pool area. It is a larger room and has two windows. It was not a suite but if you need space to store luggage, strollers, etc this is the room you want. I would assume that rooms #322 and #222 are set up the same way. The room itself was very spacious. The bathroom was large with lots of counter space. I prefer the sink being separate from the shower so two can get ready at the same time. But it wasn't any big deal for us. My daughter enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi. No one really used it much while we were there. Not sure why that was. We had two queen beds. The bed, for me, was too firm. Pillows were nice, TV channels acceptable, we did not use the micro and fridge but they were very clean, the computer desk was bigger than the rest of the furniture and stuck out into the walking area too far. That would be my only complaint about the room. The free breakfast in the morning was wonderful! They have a machine that automatically makes fresh, hot pancakes. Amazing! We had our choice of biscuits, sausage gravy, bacon, scrambled eggs, hot cinnamon buns, yogurt, cereal, toast, bagels, muffins, bananas (wish there was more fruit choices), juices (apple juice was watered down), coffee, instant oatmeal, instant hot chocolate, tea, milk and hard-boiled eggs. Sounds like a feast, right? Breakfast was crowded at 8:30 am so we had to eat in the conference room. Oh well, at least we had a place to sit. I didn't complain about the thin walls (yes, you can hear your neighbor's talk but not what they say) because that was up to the people building the hotel to make sure they did something about it. If you have your TV on or have the A/C running you don't here them but they may hear you if their room is quiet. Just keep that in mind if you book here. I do recommend this place but not for honeymooners (see comment above). This is a family-friendly hotel that is clean, comfortable and definitely worth what you pay.

This hotel is not what I would call as being in Lake Buena Vista, I would say more like Kissimmee, our drive to the 192 was quicker than the drive to Downtown Disney.

The walls are just too thin.You can pretty much hear everything in the neighbouring rooms.

By the third day they were adding $500 charges. Most were removed with lots of complaining. We came home yesterday and 2 still remain.

I love the breakfasts that they provide and booked a room at this hotel expressly because of the value that I felt I was getting with the breakfast included in the price. However, I was very disappointed with our stay. The major concern is the noise level. When I read the reviews here on TripAdvisor, I thought to myself, \"how bad can it really be?\". I thought the other reviewers were just being sensitive, and since I have pretty bad hearing, that I would be fine. This was not the case as the walls really are THAT THIN. We heard our neighbors talking at a normal conversational level- that shouldn't happen in a hotel. I've stayed at quite a few hotels and have never experienced this before. If you don't normally sleep in noisy conditions such as with the TV on- STAY AWAY. And if you decide to stay anyway, please be courteous and mindful that your neighbors can hear everything you do. My next concern was the famous breakfast that I chose this hotel for. My group headed down to the breakfast area at 9:30am, only to find it had already closed- what?? Could they really close it that early? They sure did. I was very unhappy about this. Not only do they heavily and aggressively market their breakfast only to close it in the middle of the morning, but there was no communication from the hotel about this. No flyers, no signs, nothing said about the breakfast at check-in. While we could have gone to the trouble of calling up or stopping by the front desk, I don't think it is something you should have to worry about when you are on vacation. You pick a hotel that includes breakfast because you don't want to have to worry about going out and finding it- which you will if you like to sleep in even a little at this hotel! The location was odd, but not bad. It is nearby a Wal-Mart and is a few minutes by car from Disney, but it is tucked away from the road behind a plaza and is very easy to miss. The rooms were clean and fairly standard. The included fridge and microwave were nice although we did not use them. I really wanted to like this hotel but I really can not recommend it.

Rent a car, it's easier than taking the bus and you have your freedom. For those who care about noise I did have one gripe, as noted in another review -- the walls are pretty thin. I checked in late around 11 pm and was talking with my spouse in the room. We were chatting and laughing about our terrible experience in a hotel down the street that we couldn't bear to stay in (see my other review). Suddenly we heard some loud banging on the wall. We didn't think we were that loud. We assumed they could hear us and wanted us to be quiet, so we did the neighborly thing and quieted down. We stayed in a room on the top floor. Overnight I kept hearing the A/C on the roof go off. It vibrated tremendously and was pretty loud. The vibrations were strong enough to shake the lamp shades on the wall sconces. Maybe I am too light of a sleeper?? I awoke to the sounds of my neighbors on both sides talking and laughing as no doubt they were getting ready to go to Disney World. The walls are pretty thin and you can hear the conversations next door. I had earplugs from my flight, so I didn't mind. My spouse who's a heavy sleeper didn't have any problems with the noises. One other minor gripe. The toilet broke. It wouldn't flush because the handle popped out. With a little ingenuity I saw the problem and fixed it. But I am 100% sure that it will pop out again, hopefully it will not be for your stay. It could've been the room we were in, but don't stay on the top floor.

This time it went downhill from the very beginning. I had reserved a 2 room suite that is at the end of their building. I was informed when I showed up that a guest had stayed over and I was put in one of thier regular rooms. No way to even get the lower rate since I was prepaid. I was told when I checked in that a 2 room suite was available for the rest of my 4 night stay the next night. I stayed in the regular room and experienced the horror of the thin walls. People next door came in around 11 pm and talked and laughed until 2. These walls are truly terrible! No sleep because on both sides as long as your neighbors are awake, so are you. When I went down the next morning there was no record of my reservation for the suite and was informed I would not be able to get to the room that I had reserved for the entire stay. To top the entire stay off, they never got to my room to clean until after 5 pm. Last night my neighbors again were having a good time until well after midnight. Then this morning I had my cell phone alarm set for 5am because I am here on business. They had the nerve to bang on my wall because my cell phone alarm went off. That is right, my cell phone alarm was loud enough to make them mad! This hotel is fairly clean, breakfast is fairly good, location is great, but if you have any expectations of sleep, forget it!
