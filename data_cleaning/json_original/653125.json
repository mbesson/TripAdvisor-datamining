We really just needed somewhere clean to sleep on this trip, and the cheaper the better. We tried Sleep Inn (right next door) and got a great AAA rate. I called Microtel based on their reviews here, and asked them to match, which they did. She told me they'd probably upgrade us to a 2-queen bed room... One thing to note: they have signs out front saying they will \"beat any competitor's price by $10\", which I would recommend taking care of during the reservation process. It didn't work for us, but to be fair, we had a really cheap rate. The rooms were really clean, and not really much smaller than other hotels we were used to. Our room had a fridge and microwave, which is always nice. Good: Beds were comfy enough: plenty of water pressure & hot water: temperature controls with numbers (not just \"high, med, low\"): free easy internet: really friendly staff: and the restaurant next door delivered our dinner with no delivery fee in less than 15 minutes... and it was really good! Interesting: The TV is on a slant above the bed in a really weird location... nothing wrong with that, just never seen it before. The breakfast was strictly what you would expect - the coffee wasn't good, but at least there was a free breakfast (again, a little more than what you might expect for under $60) Overall, we were really happy with this hotel and would stay again!

It was easy to get to downtown from the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. We also had free wireless internet in our room and there were no problems with the connection. However, if we were going to be in Indy for more than one night, I probably wouldn't stay there again. The complimentary breakfast was pretty poor quality with very limited selection. The restaurant that was advertised as being adjacent to the hotel (and owned by the hotel) was a smoking bar / grill. When we walked in, the smoke was so thick that we immediately turned around and left. I also didn't care for the fact that the only ice machine I could find was on the 1st floor in the breakfast area. However, I think it's a good option if you're passing through and need a comfortable room, and I can also see why it would be good if you needed an airport hotel, since it offered a free shuttle to the airport.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat deal, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "ruralchick", "ReviewID": "UR53130293", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this Microtel (based on the good reviews here on TripAdvisor), and used their Park and Fly system.

I searched on the Tripadvisor site and found this hotel listed in TripAdvisor as the # 1 value- I agree with that rating. I had never stayed at a Microtel property before and was somewhat skeptical that the hotel could be good and so inexpensive. I was happily surprised. The room was large with two queen size beds, a seating chair and large bathroom and shower. The hotel is only a couple of years old and looks brand new.It is very well maintained and there was always someone cleaning and polishing. Breakfast comes with your stay and though the choices were limited- eggs, waffles and cereal-it also had biscuts and gravy- the gravy was really good. The staff was very friendly and helpful with directions. The rooms came with extra towels but getting extras was no problem. The hotel is next to a restaurant/bar- though it was not noisy I would suggest asking for a room on the opposite side of the restaurant. The hotel is centrally located- easy to get on Route 70, 465 and Rte 36. My only complaint is the ridiculous position of the giant TV- its positioned on top of a wooden closet at an awkward downward angle so that it can not be turned and viewed if you are staying on the far bed. Best viewing position- standing up next to the window. My wife used the top of the ice tray and wedged it into the stand so you can move the TV (see my pictures) Though the hotel is labeled an airport hotel, it's an extremely long 3 miles from the airport. If you are using a GPS, do not let it direct you to the airport service rd- it will lead you no where- get directions from the car rental place. There are other hotels nearby and a couple places to eat. If you are fast food junkee, just travel west on Rt 36 and within another 2 miles you will see every fast food place you can imagine (Steak & Shake, White Castle, DQ, etc)", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cThere's a reason why they are ranked high!\u201d", "Author": "basketball-traveller", "ReviewID": "UR34885926", "Content": "Travelling with a large group from Canada, when booking hotels I tend to depend on the honesty of trip advisor comments.

Someone called the day after I made the reservations to arrange a time for the shuttle to the airport, and on our return, the shuttle was at the airport within 15 minutes of our call. Although we left before the scheduled start of the breakfast, the staff had set out some muffins and such for us, which was appreciated. The only flaw was the air conditioner. It had been set so the fan would not run continuously to drown out the inevitable hotel noise. Therefore, the A/C would cycle on and off, quite loudly, all night long. I read that this Amana model of A/C can be controlled by the hotel, and it would be nice to allow the guests to run the fan if desired.
