They also had reduced room service and cleaning crew, but were charging normal standard rates. There is no concierge at this place. The reception desk is clueless.

This is my first stay at this hotel. The hotel is in the commercial district with not many tourist attractions around. The check-in was smooth enough although the reception staff needs some training in English. The bell boys were very enthusiastic and really helped me throughout my stay of 1 week. The rooms are very large compared to other more expensive hotels where I have stayed in Istanbul. They were clean and everything worked well. The wifi was excellent and free. The b'fast and Sultan restaurant were good and food taste good enough. The gym was also quite nice. I didn't try the swimming pool, although I am told that it's heated. There were some small irritations such as room keys not working which meant going down 10 floors again and again. The hotel also has a very large convention centre and a couple of nights were noisy in the lobby. Rooms remained quiet and peaceful though. Overall a good experience, especially at the price of Euro 100/night, which our company was able to bargain.

You do need to go through a little airport security checker, but I don't really see the point as even if you beep they don't check you anyway. Staff were helpful. Drinks and food at the hotel is extorsionately expensive - breakfast is about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 per person for just your normal hotel buffet - bread cheeses cereals etc. So would recommend getting food from outside the hotel - and drinks. Don't drink the tap water - or just boil it in the jug in your room. Cab to Taksim Square is about 13TL, and from there you can catch a hop-on hop-off bus around Istanbul. From the hotel, grab a cab to the Grand Cevahir Shoping Mall - costs about 5TL and there is a really big supermarket on the lower level, pharmacy etc. Don't try to walk there as it is not as simple as they tell you it is (it is NOT a 10 min walk like the hotel staff say!!!). If you are leaving from here, the cheapest way to the airport was actually a taxi - I think it cost about 30TL (so if there are two or more of you it is the best price, and easiest), and you can get a taxi outside the hotel at any time of night. Other than that, the room was fine, the aircon was warm, but we just turned it off and opened the window and didnt have any problems.

At one point, the folks at the \"reception desk\" were much more interested in talking with one another than in helping guests who were waiting for assistance. Several other times, the staff behind the lobby \"sweets\" counter were seemingly mystified by guests requesting to buy sweets. One shy fellow didn't know what was in the cakes he was selling, and no labels or prices were visible. On Wednesday morning, one young lady sternly informed me, in very limited English, that if I did buy some baklava, I'd have to eat it at one of her \"tables\" (there was no way I could keep it for later!). So I just bought some baklava elsewhere, to save for dessert. Overall, we've met many kind and helpful Turkish people, many of whom speak very little English... but these few poorly trained and underinformed staff at a purportedly \"International\" Hotel and Conference Center do a disservice to Istanbul hospitality. Hotels exist to serve their guests, who usually pay well for this service... and happy guests are pleasant guests, who then can say nice things on Tripadvisor. Otherwise, this hotel is clean and modern, if a bit shiny and hard... the rooms and beds are comfortable, and the water pressure is great... no iron or ironing board... free high-speed internet... nice conference rooms... and the buffets are interesting and mostly tasty (none of us has tried the \"chicken breast pudding\" dessert yet... but never say never). Istanbul as a whole (and it's a whole lot of city) is certainly a bewitching feast for the eyes and ears and taste buds, with surprisingly compelling shopping opportunities. Purely for pleasure? I'd try another hotel. Conference here? It's convenient, and you'll be comfortable if you stay on-site (Istanbul traffic is tedious and often scary, and taxi drivers are a mixed bag).", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cNot very \"Istanbulish\"\u201d", "Author": "Flipendo", "ReviewID": "UR30543913", "Content": "Stayed at Cehavir for 3 days, at the 2009 UEFA Cup Final.

The location is not spectacular; is nowhere near the picturesque part of town, but does have the benefit of proximity to the main road to the airport. The Grand Cevahir is a huge, rather soulless, convention hotel in blocky unattractive concrete but boasts the largest ballroom in Europe and fabulous conference facilities. The problem I encountered was that there was no convention 'in residence' during my visit and consequently the place was completely empty. Absolutely empty. Perhaps if there had been 7,000 dispensing opticians attending their annual conference I would find myself rueing the lack of quiet corners and complaining of the difficulty in getting a table in the restaurant. All I can report for now is that it feels very strange being the only guest in a hotel designed for mass occupation. The place was like a morgue. In terms of facilities I certainly can't complain. My standard room was huge and clean with speedy, free broadband internet access and the gym/health club was well equipped. I didn't eat in the restaurants for fear of agoraphobia. In terms of recommendations I would suggest that they lighten up the reception area (just turn the lights on) and invest in an iron (for non conference periods) or, say, 70 irons (for those, doubtless, happy convention days) so that guests can press shirts and trousers in the rooms (which lack trouser presses).", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porto, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cTypical 5* arab hotel\u201d", "Author": "Eng_Pepi", "ReviewID": "UR16985759", "Content": "This is a typical 5* arab hotel: in an european standard, this is a normal 4* - rooms are OK, service is bad, food is average...
