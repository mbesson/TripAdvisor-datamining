{"Reviews": [{"Content": "All good What's not to like? Check in was quick and easy (staff spoke english), room had broadband internet access (free) and was clean at a fair price (by Tokyo standards!). OK, the rooms are very small, but that's normal in Japan from my experience (unless you pay good $). It had everything we needed and we didn't mind the 15 min walk to the metro station. There are loads of eateries nearby and the helpful reception staff pointed us in the direction of a laundromat nearby too. Make no mistake, accommodation in Tokyo IS expensive, but this was great for the price and suited our needs perfectly.", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR479636715", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "veedub72"}, {"Content": "Great hotel This hotel was perfect for our needs. Yes, the room was small, but it was clean and comfortable. Asakusa was a great place to stay, not in the heart of the city, but there was plenty to see in the area, There was a massive temple and traditional market about 5 mins walk from the hotel. It felt like a safe area. Train station close by, from there you can get to anywhere in Tokyo you want to go, quite cheaply. Hotel staff were extremley friendly and helpful.", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR199346775", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "LJHMelbourne"}, {"Content": "Cheap, clean and a beautiful breakfast We stayed here during summer vacation with my parents in law. While the rooms were clean, ours smelt like cigarette smoke which seemed to permeate the room. The in-laws were in the smoke free room apparently. The stay here was nice, the beds ok and it was a quiet area. The breakfast was really good. The in laws had just arrived in Japan and had their first real Japanese breakfast even having Natto, a Japanese breakfast staple. The map is very misleading and after a long day of sightseeing it was a fair hike to get there. Carrying suitcases all the way here in summer was not fun. From the station under the dept store it took about 15 minutes walking to get there. It was a nice hotel but too far away for my liking.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR391451250", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "laureninjapan"}, {"Content": "Far from subway, but clean and good value for money We stayed at Skycourt Asakusa in December 2004. From Narita Airport, it is quite difficult to access via train/subway since the hotel is 20+ minutes walk from Asakusa station. If you carry big luggage, a good option is to take a train from Narita to Ueno station and then get a taxi to go to the hotel. (Make sure you have the hotel name and address in both English and Japanese, just in case.) The taxi is generally quite expensive, but this is only a short ride. We took the same transportation for the return trip to the airport.The room is clean and well maintained. The bathroom, though very small, works very well. Water temp and pressure is good. If you need some munchies, there is a Lawson convenient store across the street.If you plan to use the hotel as a base camp for sightseeing in Tokyo, it is better to ask the hotel staff how to take the bus between hotel and Asakusa station. In addition to the bus number, make sure you remember the Japanese character for the bus as well. As we went out to various parts of Tokyo everyday starting from Asakusa station, taking the bus has made our days a lot more convenient because we didn\u9225\u6a9b have to walk that 20+ minutes to/from the station.Overall, it was quite a pleasant stay at Skycourt Asakusa.", "Date": "Mar 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR978445253", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "OregonGoldfish"}, {"Content": "Great Budget Hotel A good spot away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. I had a basic map, and was still able to find the place. Was a bit tricky, but not too bad. Given the prices of Tokyo, this place is a bargain. Clean, comfortable - what more could you ask for.

It is about a 15 minute walk from the Asakusa Stn. Had a little trouble finding the place since the map they provided wasn't that accurate and the English sign is not very large.The rooms are nice and clean- we requested a room on an upper floor and had one with a view of the Sumida river. Double bed, stove top kitchenette, large closet that held 1 large suitcase in it, a desk/bureau, TV, and air conditioning. The bathroom was a bit small but it's standard for Japan- included a tub and shower. Yukata, slippers, hair dryer, and kettle and tea were all provided.The reception staff spoke some English so communication wasn't a problem at all. Breakfast was included in our rate, but it is a traditional Japanese breakfast. If it's not to your liking their is Lawson's convenience store across the street where you can pick stuff up.All in all, a great room for a great price. Close to Senso-ji Temple and restaurants. Am planning to stay there again next month.", "Date": "Jun 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR991271624", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Filmgal"}, {"Content": "cheap but nice tiny rooms but very clean, very good experience in general, but it would have been much better for the staff to speak at least basic english, very difficult to comunicate with them.", "Date": "Feb 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR640986200", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Simple and clean Hotel is located about 20 minutes walk from the subway station and Asakusa Temple area.
