He also helped navigating the bus system and finding memorable local restaurants.Our room was large and spotless and hod a plesant view over a bougenvilla garden. Church bells from nearby church gave a delightful ambiance.Most memorable were the breakfasts that were included with the room. I have never had better capuccino, rich and creamy even though it was from an automatic machine. Fresh croissants, ham, cheese and assorted toppings and cereals were a great way to start our days. We fairly ran down the stairs to such reats.

I knew I would like the neighborhood, since twice before I have stayed in hotels on Via Faenza. The Hotel Monica has an excellent location--it's just a block around the corner to the Palazzo degli Affari conference center (and a laundry), and the main train station in Florence (Santa Maria Novella) is just beyond the conference center. There are many wonderful restaurants in the vicinity. The rooms are basic but adequate. The individually controlled air-conditioning is definitely Italian style--i.e., not very effective.The highlight of the visit, though, was the helpful staff. The hotel is located on the first and second floors (above the ground floor), but Leonardo was quick to help get my luggage to my room. He provided tips for restaurants with local cuisine and was able to efficiently summon taxis when needed. Best of all, when my previous hotel in Switzerland bungled sending a package so that it arrived in Florence more than a week after my departure, Leonardo kept the forwarding information on hand so it could be returned to my home in the US.For those who may have read previous reviews about the breakfast, I can report that they now serve fresh croissants and rolls which are promptly replenished, along with slices of of meat and cheese. And while the coffee is indeed from a machine, the Italians are experts at creating automated espresso and capuccino.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR318850114", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Travel4Science"}, {"Content": "cheap accomodation After having spent 5 excellent nights in the Monica Hotel, Florence, Tuscany, I would like to thank the Monica Hotel by writing a short review. The hotel is very nice and is located only 100 meters from the main railway station. Especially for globetrotters with huge backpacks, but also for people who want to go hiking in the tuscany mountains, the vicinity to the station is ideal. The latter is true especially since urban and SITA bus lines (the latter deserving villages in the surrounding of Florence) depart from the main train station and are thus easy to reach. Nonetheless, the hotel is not far from the city center (about 15 min walking). Several small shops, internet cafes and restaurants are in the direct surrounding of the hotel.The prices for rooms are reasonably to cheap, depending on season and load. We have spent 5 days at Monica hotels and negotiated 45\u9227?per day in a two-bed room with shower and restrooms (breakfast included). I think this was a great deal!!!The people at the hotel are very friendly and helpful. The staff speaks fluently English, however, is very kind if a guest tries to speak italian.....
