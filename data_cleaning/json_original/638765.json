But reasonable prices (a night for $250), sizable and quiet rooms, great views and a superb breakfast are sufficient compensation.

I especially like the welcome and the efficient check-in. Hotel room was okay, not much light in the bathroom and an incredibly noisy air con unit but the bed and pillows were comfortable, the ability to work in the room was okay and the daily service was fine.

They do nearly everything right from opening your door to giving rides in the property limo if it is not in use. It does not have a porte cochere at the entrance. I know this is LA but I found this strange. Only noticed because it was raining when I arrived. Of course they don't need one since the valet immediately came out with umbrella in hand ready to fend off any of the unusual bits of water falling from the sky. I see a few negative comments on the rooms. I must have been given a renovated room as the descriptions don't match what I found. I would never pay five fifty for the room but at one thirty on hotwire, it is a serious bargain. I was a bit uncomfortable mixing with the predominantly vainglorious clientele. I felt like I need to have a jacket just to go to the pool. I am sure I was uncomfortable simply being outclassed. Speaking of the pool. this is a very nice outdoor area with cabanas and a large pool suitable for short laps. You will find everything you need here in the well-appointed/maintained rooms including excellent robes. Because this hotel seemed to serve wealthy clientele you can expect everything to cost a fortune from the internet to the parking. the restaurant and bar menu is good and not too highly priced however the dishes seem to be all tapas; but you can't tell that form the descriptions. You only know that when the miniature portion arrives. Eventually I became so hungry after the third day working from the food deficit that I asked the restaurant waiter if they could serve a larger portion, which he happily did. The bar is hit or miss depending on the bartender on duty. If you see a young guy there, expect to wait a bit and explain simple terms like what \"neat\" means or put up with ice in your whiskey. The business center will do anything form you; again, it will cost you. Property is first class, but you so must you be or you will feel uncomfortable. They can and will do anything to help you, but it will cost you. Do not pay rack rate. You can Hotwire this hotel for one hundred thirty at times. If you don't use Hotwire you should check it out - they give you satisfaction ratings which make it better, (athough a bit higher priced), than priceline.

The gym is pretty nice, but the women's locker room could use an upgrade - I was unable to use the steam room or sauna b/c it didnt get warm enough and the attendant said both rooms were already on thier highest setting.

When the front desk personnel Ms Adrian swiped our card upon checkin \u00c2\u00a0she charged us $1700 instead of $ 700 for 2 nights \u00c2\u00a0. Upon questioning her actions she commented that this is the way we work and \u00c2\u00a0need security from third world country citizens . She also commented that we do not understand the working as it is different from our back word country . The next day housekeeping did not come to the room for the whole day even after being called several times . Upon complaining about the poor service to the manager politely , we were told by Her not stay there if we were unhappy . \u00c2\u00a0We were shocked by the attitude of the manager also and also were not sure of the extra 1000$ charged to our account . The next day we approached the director guest relations , she was very kind and helpful and solved all our problems with housekeeping and refunded our extra charged . Even though everything was ok at the end they she tried her best to make us comfortable at the last day , but the first two days were a nightmare which spoilt the flavour of Los Angeles . Hope it doesn't happen to anyone else .", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai, China", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel and Service\u201d", "Author": "jennylebeouf", "ReviewID": "UR123571635", "Content": "Stayed for a 3 night stay at the end of January 2012.

I never had to wait more than 10 seconds for an elevator to arrive. Its a small matter, but stood out to me, as i hate having to wait minutes for elevators to arrive.

I stayed in one of the Luxury suites, which was very nice, did have a problem with the A/C which I reported 3 times, before a engineer came, just before I was going out for a dinner reservation and decided not much he could do, he said he would report in to Duty Manager, and we went out, when we returned at 11.30pm, in our room, was engineers ladders, and sprawled all round the bedroom, was the panels he had removed and just left, not much we could do at that time, but clear a path to the bed, then at 11.45pm duty manager, called Blanca, rang my room, (who must be one of the rudest arrogant people you will ever meet) telling me I have to move room, not only that, but I have to pack up everything myself, and move myself!, I told her I would not do that at this time of night, and terminated the call, the next morning I went downstairs to speak with duty manager, at 10.00 am because i had heard nothing more, and in fact I was wrong Blanca was not the rudest most arrogant person you would ever meet, this title goes to Tim, who was today's duty manager, but he had no idea, of any problems, and in fact found it quite funny..... I ask him to contact Steve Choe, the GM, which he refused, again I insisted again he refused, eventually I had to return to my room, and EMail the GM for him to contact me. Other incidents occurred in my stay, with the service, every call to valet, room service, laundry, concierge, took 3/4 calls to get anything done. On one occasion, was booked on spa, returned back to my hotel, on day of booking to receive a call 45 minutes before appointment to say, sorry, have no therapist today, Sorry! appointment cancelled. This hotel could really be up there with the best, all the facilities are present, but there is real concerns for me with the staff at direction they are receiving. Was in hotel for 5 days, and to be honest would have left on 2nd day, but being new years Eve, most other hotels were full. but on reflection should have checked out, because even though was promised, things would get better, they never really did. Did get a chance to meet and let the GM know, (after 5 days) all problems I encountered, and he assured me he is striving to bring the standards up. The spa belongs to an outside company, so not under his control< the A/C is an ongoing problem>>>> but to me my time is too precious and I would never stay at this hotel again, and it is all down to the Staff's attitude and lack of direction and training, because as I mentioned everything is in place at this hotel. To me the first place to start, Is the GM or a suitable number 2 should be at this hotel at all times at least until all the issues that they already know about are rectified, but seems it was the holidays and everyone was off !! and the people on duty, just have no idea in running a hotel of this standard, and that is just unacceptable!!!!!!!!", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cA real find in LA...Despite location - well worth it.\u201d", "Author": "gringoAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR122624757", "Content": "We stayed here after looking at many options in LA.

Then another walked past again about 5mins later this time around the bin was covered Please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk past the dinning with a bin covered or uncovered while customers are having their meals.

When we pulled up to the hotel it looked as if it was in the middle of no-where with nothing to do although we had read reviews that it was right next to rodeo drive (not true) and fox studios (true- right next door). The hotel lobby was lovely and the outside areas too and i would give them a 5star rating. However, when we went to check in they said our room wasn't ready and we would need to wait half an hour although half an hour turned into an hour and a half which my friend and i weren't happy with. To make matters worse we were told we would need to pay a deposit? We said we had already paid for everything and the manager then said it's just for them and they'll give us it back when we check out so we thought that's fine until the woman said 500 dollars between us!!! We were shocked as previous to los angeles we had been in Las Vegas and had budgeted our money for both trips as we needed to take into consideration food as well as day trips etc! We sat outside annoyed as we had lost out on 250 dollars each but i asked to speak to the manager and got us 100 dollars each back and the manager explained that it was their hotel policy (something that our travel agent hadn't warned us. about)! The manager also explained that it is usually only 100 dollars but didn't explain why she was charging us 150 more and at first 250 but my friend said because we were 2 young girls and that will probably be the reason why! We are 24 years of age so i would warn people in their mid 20s to budget for this as well if making a trip to La and staying at this hotel. When we got to our hotel room my friend said wasn't a five star room and it was not, i would grade the rooms about a 3 star on decor etc. However the rooms were cleaned and the beds made every day with fresh towels left out. We ate in the hotel quite a lot and i would recommend the spaghetti bolognese. The waiters and waitresses were lovely and catered to your every need. It wasn't expensive either for a hotel that has been awarded 5 stars, we were 70 dollars for 2 spaghetti bolognese and 2 ice-creams plus a coke each. When we ordered 2 spaghetti bolognese without dessert or drinks to the room it was 90 dollars as you need to pay vat, a service charge and something else. We felt as if some of the hotel staff looked down on us probably as they expect famous faces or extremley rich people staying in their hotel although back home we come from privleged backgrounds so it wasn't nice of them to make us feel like that. Not once did the bar staff or restaurant staff make us feel like that though. We had booked to do the grand tour of La with Vip tours which i would totally recommend! They pick you up from your hotel and bring you back at night. The tour consists of visiting the main attractions of Los angeles so get your cameras ready as there are lots of photo opportunities! We done Universal the next day and that was great too! However, we weren't too impressed with Disney as there wasn't much to do. We also went to Santa Monica beach which was great, nice food and shops! The Ferris wheel situated on the beach also provides you with good photo ops!! On our arrival we thought the hotel wasn't near anything, however it is actually only a ten minute walk from a shopping centre called Westfield which has various shops and restuarants plus a cinema. Shops include Macys, Bloomingdales, Zara, H&M, Victorias secret, Juicy...! There is also places to eat that would cater for all budgets. There is a big grocery store on the ground floor as well which is open to 11pm and opens around 10am. There is also a bus stop when you walk out of the hotel and turn onto the main road where entrance to fox studios is and for a dollar bus (big blue bus) takes you to Santa Monica beach. The chauffeur service was good but sometimes there was a queue to use the service but there are taxis outside so if you don't feel like walking to the mall it's only 5 dollars in a taxi which you would give to the chauffeur anyway. The chauffeur service finishes at 9pm weekdays, not sure about a Saturday and the Sunday we were there he finished at 5.30pm. On a whole we felt welcome by some staff, dining in the restaurant was reasonable, the rooms were clean, the hotel was near transport to go to different places and there was a mall 10mins away. I wouldn't rate this to my friends or to families but to older couples or groups of older friends looking to get away for a quiet and relaxing holiday. Next time i would stay in Santa Monica as the location is great and it is so central to everything.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cElegant hotel\u201d", "Author": "81FrequentT81", "ReviewID": "UR120813515", "Content": "I stayed here one night on business.

They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listen, they are not polite, they ignore you and are only concerned with payments. They actually spend more time with one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit card than with the hotel guest him/herself. I was just appalled by their attitude. As far as the hotel is concerned, its location is far from the important tourist attractions, but the hotel offers a free limousine service to/from Rodeo Drive. However, close by, there is a shopping centre and not far from the hotel you have Beverly Hills. The lobby is large and beautifully decorated with fresh flowers. Sometimes it gets busy due to conferences/meetings/events and it may seem that the quietness and privacy of the hotel is gone. There is also a pool and the hotel offers several eating areas. The hotel also has what appears to be a small inner court, which is worth a visit. The concierge desk is very helpful, but be aware of other guests, because some of them have never heard of something called queuing. I opted for a room with sundeck, which left me with a massive bedroom/sitting area, an enormous bathroom, double balcony, a very quiet corner of the hotel and most importantly, I had the best LA view from my 11th floor, overlooking not only Beverly Hills, but also Downtown LA and the famous Hollywood sign.

There are several outdoor seating areas, featuring heat lamps or fire pits - nice for cool CA evenings. Room was nice, with a comfortable bed and linens. Flat screen TV and the outrageously priced mini bar (stay away!) Bathroom was large and well-appointed. Two fluffy robes were provided. I'd say that it is about time for a freshening up, though, for the whole place, as the carpet is looking a bit dated and several areas would have benefitted from a new coat of paint. It is not an inexpensive stay, and anything you order from any of the restaurants or bars will not be, either. It is LA, though, so just be aware. Service: Everyone we encountered was polite, professional, and very helpful. All seemed genuinely interested in making my stay as positive as possible. Parking: $33.00 - ouch - and you need to specify that you want in and out privileges. As there are few places to walk, you'll need a vehicle. Restaurant: We didn't dine or use room service, but there are restaurants on site. Sunday was busy, although there was no one in any of the dining areas on Saturday night. Facilities: There is a well-equipped 24-hour fitness center, which is free to guests, as is the outdoor pool. There is also a spa, with services for purchase.

I advised the Duty Manager that Royal Ambassador members are guaranteed an 8am check in and a 4pm late checkout. If the booked room type is not available then another room type must be made available. This is the Royal Ambassador guarantee. After checking in I printed out the Abmassador Membership terms and conditions and presented it to the Duty Manager. After apologizing for making us wait for over 3 1/2 hours he conceeded that I was correct and included the buffett breakfast for us. I have noted that many hotels in the IC group have this unwritten rule that they will not allow anyone to check in prior to 12noon even if there is a room available. Events as indicated above only happen because of poor staff training. Housekeeping is open from 8am and during our wait for room availability we witnessed over 15 groups checking out and over 8 interviews for job applications! With 10% unemployment in the USA and 45 million people reliant on food stamps I would think that you could have better management suitably employed. There is no check in counter for Priority Club or Ambassador members and there is no mention of these two programmes at the front reception area. SECURITY: Anyone can walk into the hotel lobby and take the lift to any floor without the use of a key card - there is no security. In room safes are free standing and not attached to anything - you could place one in any suitcase and walk out of the building with it. I mentioned this to the front office and they put me through to security and they indicated to me they did not think it was a problem as the hotel was in a safe area. So, the mentality is that you wait for an incident to happen and then you address the problem Like closing the gate after the horse has escaped! CLUB FLOOR: None available which is very disappointing for an IC Hotel. POSITION: Located in a nice area suitable for walking or jogging. RESTAURANTS AND SHOPPING: Westfield Mall is a 15 minute walk from the hotel and Rodeo Drive is about a 30 minute walk from the hotel. Would recommend BJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at Westfield for a nice meal at great prices and a good menu choice. The hotel has a complimentary drop off and pick up service within a 5 mile radius from the hotel. TRANSPORT: Taxi fare from LAX airport to the hotel is approx. US$45. FOOD: Buffett breakfast is Approx US$31 per person inclusive of tax plus an 18% gratuity which is added to the bill. However, the hot section (which has exactly the same choice each day) only includes chip potatoes, bacon and scrambled eggs which are set hard (like concrete) in the heated tray. This would be the worst buffett breakfast I have ever had at any Intercontinental hotel ever. (As indicated above complimentary breakfast was included for us - and I think it should be at US$375 per night). OVERVIEW: Probably the best area to stay in LA would be Santa Monica which is on the beach and has many shops and restaurants in the area. If your first stop is at the Pier area then you will be very disappointed as you must go back along the main restaurant shopping area to appreciate Santa Monica. The Hop on Hop off LA bus stops at the pier so you can use this facility to go to all the main tourist areas in LA. Checked out the Holiday Inn in this area but would not recommend it as it is just like a pimple on a pumpkin and is bounded on three sides by very busy noisy streets. Also has very small rooms. They also never answer any e-mail requests for information. The Hop On Hop Off bus also stops directly outside the Intercontinental Hotel, however, it goes via Sana Monica and takes over an hour to get to the Hollywood Walk of Fame area which is the stop where you need to change buses to go to the other 3 loopes included in the ticket price.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Henderson, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cThe ONLY hotel I would consider staying in LA!\u201d", "Author": "Lucymylove", "ReviewID": "UR117570031", "Content": "I have to say that this is above and beyond the best home away from home for me! The service is impeccable, the staff are very polished. Although, I do have to say the new addition of the very loud dark haired young lady at the front desk is not a plus. This could be the Bianca the previous commenter referred to. She is not the manager, not even close. If she is, she needs to be fired. Susie is the best! Alex is great as well. I did not have any problems, nor did I have to deal with loud mouth, but another guest did and I had the pleasure of hearing loud mouth get snippy. I would not tolerate her at all. Now, on to my feelings about this wonderful hotel. I have stayed here at least 3 dozen times in the last year and I absolutely love it. I have stayed at other very nice hotels in LA, but, the service and the quality here are much better. When my boys come with me, they always make sure I have a large enough room for them. I have never once seen any bugs, not even in the pool area other than a fly by my food, which is to be expected if you eat outside. It's more likely it was left by another guest, thereby causing a huge expense to the hotel to fumigate. Being an Intercontinental Ambassador, I get upgrades and perks that make it even better. But, regardless of that, room service is still great, the gym is very nice, the spa is just wonderful, the pool is every bit as nice as it looks in the pictures, if not nicer. Cabanas are available, food and beverage service at the pool. Everything at this hotel is just the right amount of pampering done with polished precision. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel taken care of. Last time I stayed I went to LA for my birthday, when I got to my room, there was a desert tray with Happy Birthday written in chocolate waiting for me, and a \"Welcome Back\" card from the manager. They really do go out of their way to make you feel \"Welcome\". I would not consider staying any where else in LA. The balconies are great for lounging with a glass of wine and watching the sunset or gazing at the city lights, and the lights of Hollywood hills, absolutely beautiful. There is not one single bad thing I can say about this hotel. I do have to mention the driver, he is an awesome guy. He always remembers me and my boys. All three and me go to the mall every time, and he never forgets us, (not possible)! Ha ha! That is great service!

Indeed, it was this property which set the standard by which I have come to judge other hotels. In 2007, I booked a suite for a business trip because at the time I had Gold status with the Six Continents loyalty program (now it's Priority Club). When I arrived for check in, I requested and was given an upgrade to a large suite for an additional $100 per night. The additional cost was well worth it. Upon arrival, I also took special care to tip the valet and bellman well - which I highly recommend if you ever wish to return to a hotel. They took extra care to learn my name and where I was from. Throughout the entire trip there was not one time I entered the hotel without having someone greet me by name. The 1,200 Sq.ft. Luxury Suite I was given was like an apartment, complete with views of the Hollywood sign. Each time I drove in to valet my car, the attendants literally ran to the vehicle to greet me and open the door. I completed my business and was so impressed with the hotel and service that I decided to return several months later with my wife and our dog (who is a certified therapy dog). My subsequent visits all lived up to my high expectations and my wife loves both the service, the location and the luxuriously spacious rooms. Indeed, as a direct result of my multiple stays at this single property, I reached Platinum status with IHG and later opted in to pay for the Ambassador service (something I highly recommend). We alos frequently order breakfast in the room and the food is fantastic. They have the BEST coffee. I continue to frequent the property and have experienced only one minor hiccup with the Front Desk staff - who surprisingly were less familiar with who I was than the bellmen, valet attendants and room service waiters. I spoke with a manager about it and the problem was immediately rectified by manager dSteve Choe Ever since, I have used this hotel as my de facto West Coast home base for all of my entertainment-related client activities. What makes this hotel great is that it has allowed me to fly my wife out for several weekends so that I can convert a long week business trip into a mini-vacation. Beverly Hills and the Westfield Century City mall are just blocks away and the hotel even offers chauffeur service to the mall and local stores upon request. If you are planning a trip to Los Angeles and are wiling to invest in becoming loyal to a property, then this is the hotel to do it at. There appears to be little turn-over with the key staff and If you take the initiative to get to know and treat them well, they will most certainly reciprocate and provide you with the type of service that only Five Diamond properties are known for offering.

It is about 30-40 minutes driving if there is no traffic jam. The hotel is located on the Avenue of the Stars next to the Westfield shopping mall with a lot of shops and small fast food restaurants. The hotel has a very nice exterior and big lobby. We checked in at around 11AM with Judy, she was friendly and checked us in but our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready so we had to wait 20 minutes next to the reception. It is weird she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell anything about our ambassador privileges, breakfast, our room or internet login. There is also no separate ambassador check in. Our room was on the 9th floor not far from the elevators. We were upgraded to a big suite I guess, it was not modern at all but big. It had a separate seating area with sofa, big TV and a desk. Then there was the sleeping room with a big bed and another TV. The bathroom was very big with 2 doors, one to the bed and the other one to the living room. The bathroom had a big bath, shower, toilet and 2 very nice soft bathrobes. We had also 2 terraces adjacent to our room. The room was overall very clean and in the evening we got one small bottle of water and some fruits. The beds were very good and the next day we had breakfast in the main restaurant. I booked a Red Carpet arrangement which included breakfast. We were surprised that Jairo, our waiter gave us a menu card for breakfast but e couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain us what was and was not included in our room rate with breakfast. We just got the buffet. It is build out of 2 sections. One with hot food and a selection of fruits and salmon, ham , \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The other part are the pastries and breads. Overall it was very small and only 1 kind of egg we could choose. They actually forgot to turn on the heat under the eggs. Every other egg we wanted was paid . The quality was very good but the selection was very small. This was a disappointment. At check out we even had to pay for breakfast taxes even when it was included in our fare !! Big disappointment We want to take a cab to the departure station of the hop on / off bus and a very very kind staff member with short hear ( I am sorry but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the name ) asked if we wanted to use the free house car. Nobody told us there was one but he asked the concierge Stephen but he told : No, to far. So we wasted time but just took a cab. We asked the Concierge Stephen when we had to leave the next day for the Warner Bros studios and he told us 10.20 for tour departure at 11.00 . The head concierge booked it for us but he was nowhere to be seen during our stay. We took a cab and arrived very late at 10.59 and the lady told us we normally had to be there 30 minutes in advance also the concierge booked under my name but it was spelled not correctly. The concierge Stephen was overall not helpful nor friendly. The hotel has a big pool but we did not have time to use it. As we were Ambassador members we got free internet daily ! Otherwise it would be very expensive ! We checked out, again with Judy. Now she was less friendly and at check in I gave my VISA card to guarantee the stay. But on the IC website I booked with my Amex card. Judy forgot to delete one breakfast and even before I could check, she already debited the wrong amount. After asking and arguing she credited the amount ( 56 $ ) back on my American Express card. When I got home I saw on my bank account that Judy debited my Amex for the wrong amount but credited the difference but also charged my VISA card for the wrong amount. She so double charged me !! I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe this ! So I called the hotel and again I had Judy on the phone and she was rude and did not let me speak out? When I started a sentence she over talked me all the time and was not friendly and rude. Eventually yesterday my Visa card is credited again.

From the outside, and parts of the insides, this hotel DOES look like a four star hotel. However, I feel like a lot of hipster douchers hang around just to be seen. There are far \"hipper\" hotels in LA, but at a price. Once you arrive at the airport drop off like valet area (no other parking options), it's busy. A hefty fee per night to park your car (I guess it makes up for the Hotwire discount)...$36. I will say this, every time I called for my car, it was ready for me, and the guys know which car is yours upon exiting the hotel. They have a car service too that will take you to close by areas; the parking fee probably helps pay for that tourist plus. I did not use it as I have before...during peak times, the tourists usually beat you to it. Odd hotel choice for tourists too, nothing's within walking distance (save for the mall); you've seen one mall you've seen them all. My room wasn't ready by check-in time, however, I was nice to the lady at the front desk and she found me a room; room 340...last room on the right. The room smelt of must and figured it was just stuffy; I opened the balcony door and turned on the air. MOLD can be easily seen in the bathroom, especially in the seams and various spots on the ceiling. There is no fan, nor a window; I imagine most people close the door; I left BOTH of the doors open; horrible ventilation. Top it off with carpet that could use a bath or better, ripped up. Whoever had the room before took a bath; some of him (or a European woman's) was left behind in the form of curly hairs. Seriously, a couple pumps on a spray bottle, a clean rag and clean out the bathtub. It really makes you wonder how \"clean\" hotel rooms are. I am not being picky, I stay in hotels a lot (3-5 times a month for work alone), I've never given a bad review. Yes, the old saying is true, people complain when service is bad and rarely when it's good. Not always true with me. Management should try and do something about the \"pros\" working the hotel. By pros I mean, ladies of the night. It's easy to spot them; they usually carry a large make-up bag, are wandering around alone and are dressed for a night out in Las Vegas. The view, if you're above the 4th or 5th floor facing east, MAY be nice, I don't know. My view from the 3rd floor would probably appeal to a tourist; a back ally of the Fox studios. Room service was speedy, but at a price. I asked for my sandwich NOT to be toasted; sure enough, toasted. Ice water (they usually cover the top) had white flakes of something in it; so I opted NOT to drink it or the $6 soda. I asked for a chicken breast on the BLT instead of the usual processed slice turkey; I was told not a problem, but at a price...fine with me. Sliced turkey came. Bummer. The provided glasses in the room were dirty; no coffee cups for coffee. I hung the in-room breakfast card on my door figuring it would be a lot easier to eat in my room before a meeting and saved me time. Breakfast didn't show. Could I have called and complained? Yes. But it was a lot easier and faster to grab something quick on my way to a meeting. Cheaper too. The TV did not work; called, no one came to fix until AFTER I called a second time. Also, I noticed that the mini-bar may have been missing a few things and even the red seal was broken. I am looking forward to any charges for that. In-room check-out did not work and I had not time to stop by the front desk; no receipt was put under the door like most hotels do. Could I have asked for a new room? Yes. Were any available? No. For the tourist who rarely stays in hotels, let alone a \"4-Star\" hotel, this MAY be a nice place to stay while taking in the sites. For someone on business, I don't see why anyone would pay the rate. You can get better service and accommodations at a Holiday Inn. I did not receive my receipt under the door, as most hotels do, and I never go to the front desk to check out because I am usually pressed for time. In-room check-out was not working, so I requested my receipt via email. I received it; I was charged $34 for the mini-bar that I didn't even touch. I asked for proof that I took items and was told that the accounting department would get right back to me; that was Monday.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cgreat access to LA and Walt Disney Concert Hall\u201d", "Author": "rogerbowman", "ReviewID": "UR114852899", "Content": "We've stayed here twice to go to concerts at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, which is about a half hour drive away.

This started with my room not being ready until after 4pm on the day of arrival and the hotel appearing a little dated on first impressions. Once finally in the room (and in fairness a suite upgrade due to my Platinum Priority Club status) this feeling of being underwhelmed continued. The room looked tired and a bit scuffed around the edges. Nothing was complimentary in the room including bottled water. The only thing that took my breath away was the the price of a Snickers ($5!). Service levels followed this pattern of not quite being spot-on e.g the concierge did not seem to be particularly effusive in his assistance and would often disappear from the desk for long periods. This meant I got charged $8 for a local call (to book a restaurant) because I could not locate him by phone or in person! I was also advised I would have to purchase a UK/US power converter rather than borrow one which tends to be the norm in most hotels I visit. Got the feeling the hotel was just a little bit mean. Location is pretty good, about a 10 min walk to the Westfield shopping development and 30 min on foot to Rodeo Drive etc. So in summary nothing really wrong with the hotel, just fails to impress in the way other Intercontinental properties I have visited (Paris, Istanbul, Al Khobar etc) do.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, beautiful hotel!\u201d", "Author": "kfoley", "ReviewID": "UR113212665", "Content": "We were in LA for our niece's graduation from UCLA so we booked this hotel for it's proximity to the campus and decent rate compared to everything else in the area for that weekend. Upon stepping out of our car we felt like royalty. There were staff members everywhere ready and willing to help with whatever we needed. When checking in, the front desk attendant noticed we had our 5 year old daughter with us and upgraded us to a suite for free. She even asked if we wanted somebody to come up and make up the pull out bed for us. Our room was beautiful. A living room with a large flat screen TV, couch, chair, coffee table and desk. There was a balcony with two chairs and a small table. French doors led into the bedroom which included another flat screen TV mounted to the wall and a king bed. The bathroom was spacious with a seperate shower and tub. The room was extremely clean and smelled like a spa! After getting settled we went downstairs to the restaurant for a bite to eat. Everybody was really great with our daughter calling her princess and waiting on her hand and foot. Probably the only down side to our entire stay was the menu. It was extremely expensive and not a lot of choices. We opted for a couple of appetizers to share and our daughter had a kids pizza and our check was over $60 with no alcohol. Everything we had was very good though and the service was great. After dinner we went to the pool. The pool area was very pretty with lots of plam trees and it was very clean. There were cushioned lounge chairs with plenty of towels available. We had to pass by the gym on the way to the pool and we noticed that it looked really big for a hotel gym and it had nice equipment. The pool was heated but still didn't feel very warm on that chilly night. Our daughter didn't mind it, but we ended up sitting in the hot tub instead. A couple of final things, the hotel didn't have any kind of coffee bar or place to grab a quick breakfast or even a place to grab a soda and a snack. I didn't even see any soda machines, not even where the ice was on our floor. It had a gift shop, but everytime we walked past it was closed. There was a Starbucks a couple of blocks down and they did have a courtsey car to take you to places nearby, but that's not too convenient with a 5 year old in tow.

I have stayed in many hotels in many different price points--this exceeded all expectations. I took my 20yr. old daughter for 'mother/daughter' trip to LA. We were lucky enough to upgrade to stay in a suite--better than any suite I've ever stayed in. We had a friend staying at the hotel -she had standard room which was great--I would have been perfectly fine in that room as well. We took advantage of the courtesy house car which will take you within 1 1/2 miles of the hotel--got us to area malls, restaurants and to \"window shop\" in Beverly Hills. I liked that the hotel was in Century City-kind of tucked away from everything-felt more relaxed. We enjoyed the restaurant but the menu was somewhat limited. I must admit, after running around all day we ended up eating at the hotel most nights--due to our own laziness--didn't want to venture out after a long day. If you like sushi--it looked fabulous and was enjoyed by many in the lounge area. Looked like a great place for happy hour after work...and you must try the Parmesan French Fries--to die for! The only major knock against the hotel was that you had to pay for wi-fi --for each device in room-with what we were paying-that seemed somewhat excessive. I know other chains charge for it as well and I put the same complaint on their reviews as well. I also know others had complained about the parking charges if you had a rental; I read that and opted to use the courtesy car-it was perfect for what we needed but realize that may not be the case for everyone. Honestly though, most hotels charge for parking regardless of what city you are in these days.

ON arrival we were greeted by the valet and doorman, and taken to check in, all were extremely friendly and genuine. The check in process was simple and we were shown to our room. The room was a great size and I'm glad we upgraded, it had all the amenities you would expect from a hotel of this standard. I still object to paying for wireless, something which is all to common with ICH group hotels and I really think they need to stop charging for it. Cleanliness and comfort of the room were fantastic, my only criticism and I'm being picky here, is that the decor was well worn in places. Torn wall paper on low corners in the room and slightly dowdy looking curtains did mar the otherwise warm and modern feel of the room. Breakfast was excellent, expensive if you didnt have it included. Staff here were great, one chap was a little bizarre, friendly but over familiar and kept telling us about his other jobs (comedian I think he said) and his travel, and gave us his business card. This I found off putting, but as I say food was great and service matched this. Overall hotel staff were great, the concierge was amazing and helped us with restaurant bookings and activities. Again if I had a criticism it would be that the front desk staff could be a little cold, at one point I felt I had to apologise in asking for their help. The hotel itself is lovely, very nicely designed and we really did enjoy our stay here. The pool and gym area were great. It does feel a bit \"removed\" from LA due to its surroundings and you definitely need a car if you stay here but I would highly recommend this hotel. It was actually quite nice to come back to after a day in crazy LA! The quiet relaxed feel of the place helped to make us feel very comfortable and welcome. They have a car service which was brilliant and we used this to take us into Beverly Hills for dinner a couple of times. Good points, great hotel, lovely mordern decor, overall friendly staff-nothing was too much trouble. Bad points, extra costs like wireless and the extorntionate valet parking charge! BE AWARE ITS $35 A DAY!!!! You cannot park your own car and this wasn't mentioned on the ICH website, if I had known this I may not have booked as I felt paying an extra $140 plus tips everytime you needed the car was a step too far!

In fact, I have not idea what they paid so this is a completely price blind review. I have been in this hotel years ago when my dear friend was married there. (I think it was a Hyatt brand then.) I recently stayed at the Century Plaza (just down the street) and can use this for a local comparison. The good: The service was beyond amazing. Every person in the hotel (the valet, the doorman, the front desk, the servers at the meeting rooms, and the bartenders) made me feel incredibly welcomed. Nothing (NOTHING) was left to chance. I arrived a bit late the first day for my meeting and the valet was extremely sensitive to this. He made sure that I knew exactly where I needed to be in the hotel (and would have walked me there if I needed help). The front desk made sure that my frequent stayer credit got to my account. Normally, this is not big deal, but since I didn't pay for the room, I was particularly impressed that they did this. The servers and bartenders at our meeting were beyond amazing. Without asking, the servers noted what I was drinking and made sure that my glasses were never empty--even making sure that whatever I wanted could be brought in from the outside bar. Small touch, but great service!! The final point was that there was some minor confusion about parking for the meeting. On two days, I asked a hotel employee to clarify small details for me. On both occasions, they immediately found a manager and immediately addressed the issue. I didn't have to ask for for special treatment--they just immediately took care of my concerns. The location of the hotel is great--easy walk to a wide variety of places to eat and drink if you don't have a car...can't imagine that you would be in LA without a car though... The bad... The grounds are not as lovely as the Century Plaza. The pool was ok...not much has changed since my friend got married there a few years ago despite the change in hotel branding. The ugly...

A resounding silence would be more fitting. But if my review helps save someone from the royal pain in the *** of staying at this hotel, it's worth it. The only thing luxurious about this \"luxury hotel\" is the orchid display in the lobby. What a woeful place it is! On the first night, my colleague and I were given a room in which one of the mattresses had a broken spine, and for the second and third, an L-shaped room by a service elevator. Nothing like being woken up at 6 in the morning by staff shouting at one another. To make matters much, much worse, the place is run by a legion of automatons who keep saying to you, If there's anything we can do, let us know -- and yet cannot actually do even the most simple things you might ask of them. My colleague and I started attempting to predict how the hotel was going to screw up on our latest request. One of their true winners: canceling part of our room service order because someone in the kitchen decided that we were ordering too much food for one person. (We were of course trying to order for two!) And then when we checked out we discovered that -- after all of the delights of our stay -- we were not only not going to get a break on the bill, but they were, rather, going to overcharge us -- and by a huge sum. We got that sorted only to discover that they found the idea of splitting a hotel bill in two an impossible proposition! We stood at the front desk for half an hour while they attempted to sort this, and then had to leave for the airport with it still a mess. It took me -- no joke -- three weeks to get the hotel billed sorted out over the phone. It doesn't matter what you're in LA for -- business or pleasure -- you simply cannot afford the headache of staying here (and paying royally for the little that you get).

I did find it quite expensive and everything was charged, tiny bottles of Evian were over $5, glass of wine in the bar almost $20 and room service had lots of extra charges. I must confess I went to Gelson's Supermarket at the Mall and stocked up on water, snacks etc to save some money on extras. Parking is also pretty steep at $35 per night, but the valet park staff were nice and brought the car up very quickly without feeling like they needed constant tipping.

The hotel is a good example of the InterContinental chain. The rooms are spacious and nicely appointed.

The hotel has a shuttle service for the surrounding area that is complimentary and lessens one's need for a car. But if you want to get out of the immediate area, a car is essential. The hotel is not located near anything that most visitors would consider in walking distance. I stayed here primarily because the hotel was very conveniently located for the business I was in town to conduct. The food at the hotel is serviceable but LA has a lot more to offer in that department.

I was thrilled as this hotel has gotten very nice reviews on this website. Unlike Priceline, which only guarantees accommodations for two, Hotwire guarantees accommodations for the number of people you put when making the purchase. In this case I put down four people. Much to my surprise, when I called the hotel to confirm that my room would have two beds, they refused to guarantee this. I called Hotwire, and they told me that I had to go to the hotel, be placed in a room with one bed, and then they would remedy the situation by moving me to another hotel with two beds. Hotwire was unwilling to let me out of my contract, and the hotel was unwilling to fulfill their end of the contract by guaranteeing that I would have enough beds for four people. I had never had this problem with Hotwire before. After hours of haggling and finally reaching the assistant to the Manager of the hotel, I was assured that two beds would be waiting for me upon arrival. Needless to say, this was a less than perfect start. When I arrived around Noon I was told that my room was not ready, but that it would be ready in 30 minutes and I could wait in the lounge if I so desired. I decided to do some sightseeing with my family and returned three hours later. At 3:00PM we returned to learn that our room was still not ready. After several phone calls, they switched us to another room and we were able to unpack our bags. Now I must say that the room was nice and the bathroom was quite large. There were water splashes on the mirror by the tub, which is a little bit gross, but other than that, the bathroom was clean. The concierge was quite helpful throughout our stay, and the valet employees were very nice. The straw that broke this camel's back came upon checking out. The front desk gave me the final invoice with a $40 honor bar tab on it. I insisted that we had not taken anything from the honor bar. The girl at the front desk did absolutely nothing to clear up the matter and told me that I would be charged, but that they would investigate and if I was cleared of the charges they would issue a refund. She humiliated me in front of my children and accused me of being dishonest. I asked to speak to the desk manager and she refused to call him. At that point, I demanded that housekeeping meet me back up at the room so I could clear my name. The first person to show up assured me that she had checked the honor bar herself the morning before and that those items were missing. I directed her to check the previous guest's invoice as perhaps she had made a mistake. Sure enough, the people before us had taken those same exact items, and they had never been restocked before our stay. She pathetically apologized, telling me that she had been away for two days and that it was the restocking person's fault. She immediately called the front desk and the charges were removed. Never once did the girl at the front desk apologize for disbelieving me. She did begrudgingly finally get the desk manager who took my name, address and phone number and said that he would make things right. One month later, and of course, no word from him. To sum up, the front desk staff, management, and housekeeping think that they are beneath their jobs. If you book a room through Hotwire, it will not be worth the money you save.

The location is an odd one. Neither good nor bad really, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central for Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, The Beach, Culver and LAX too. From the airport it was 30mins in a cab. Perfect after a long flight. The mall, which is not 20mins walk away\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6more like 10. Is pretty good if you need to stock up on the usual things. It has Bloomingdales and Macys\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which is a slight overkill. The supermarket under the AMC cinema is great. And there are several places to eat including the trashy Pink Taco. Beyond that you need a car or cab to get to Beverly Hills, which is really only 1 mile away\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but too far to walk. There is nothing else around. And this is the other great thing about this hotel; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so quiet. I mean really peaceful. Just perfect. The pool was heated, but a little cool. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet and barely used. It was kept clean, tidy with loads of loungers and towels. The gym was smart too. The rest of the amenities including the restaurant were very good. Slightly over priced but the food and service were actually exceptional. The one time I had room service, for the first time ever, the fries that arrived were too hot to eat! Amazing. So, the room. I was offered a king or 2 doubles. Took the king\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it had an amazing open balcony with fabulous views up to the Hollywood sign (a long way away) and across the city. The loungers and table were a little tired \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but as you barely ever get balconies in good hotel rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6who cares.

We were close to Beverly Hills and just a short drive to the \"tourist\" areas. First, this hotel is just beautiful. The pics do not do it justice. We checked in on the Amex package with a free upgrade. And it was a true upgrade. A junior suite!! We were traveling with our two boys, on our 6th night, so it made it nice to have our own room. The junior suite they gave us looked brand new as if it had never been used. We had a great view of the old Century City studios (now Fox). It was a nice view from the 15th floor! We had room service for breakfast and it was delicious. The boys ordered off the kids menu and the portions were huge. My husband said his breakfast was the best breakfast he remembered having in a long time. The rooms each have a Kourig coffee maker in them with Emeril's coffee which was especially good. They also had a nice coffee station located in the posh lobby (as early as 4:00am--time we had to leave for our flight) which really made it nice. The staff was very good--my only complaint was that I think that they must let their maid staff go home early because we waited a very long time to get the pull out couch made up for the boys. Bed was very comfortable but boys did not think the pull out was very comfortable at all. We dined for lunch in their hotel restaurant because we had a $100 credit. The waiter was nice and the food was very tasty---however it was overprice. We would not have normally paid $110 for lunch (which is what it came to) but we did have the credit. I do think that this hotel caters to the business man/woman traveler, so on the weekends this hotel is nice and quiet. We got a fantastic rate of only $220 per night, so it was well worth it.

I think they are trying to be something that they are not though. All staff encountered were friendly and appeared to be trying their best. Valet and doormen were superb and I do not mind paying $30.00 per night when the service is as excellent as what they provided. Not just on 1 day-- I was there for 4 days and that area was consistently superior. As others have posted-- housekeeping was inconsistent. There were 2 of us in 1 room. When we checked in, there were 3 sets of towels in the room. On day two, only two sets were left. On day 3- five sets were left. Seemed a little odd. Also, during turndown service-- one attendant would empty garbage, refresh used towels and fill ice bucket. The others we had did not do that and only turned down the bed. Room was very well appointed. New carpet and bedding. If you looked beyond the surface though the baseboards were covered with dust. One lamp had a cigarette burn. On the top of the desk lamp, someone had used the metal plate to put out a cigarette and this was never cleaned by housekeeping on the 4 days I was there. I will say that the room did not smell like smoke at all, so they obviously did a good job getting rid of the smoke smell-- just not cleaning up the ashes. If the room would have smelled of smoke on my arrival, I would have changed rooms. I had requested a synthetic filled pillow because of an alergy to feather pillows. Twice, feather pillows were delivered. The housekeeper who delivered the pillows was very sweet and she really wanted to do the right thing, but said that she did not know the difference in the pillow types. She was able to find the correct pillows. Workout facility and pool were fine. Food and beverage was of high quality and service was okay. One other weird thing did happen during the course of my stay--- the patio chairs were removed after day two and replaced with old ripped ones. I have no idea what this was all about, but I had taken pictures when I arrived, so I know that I was not imagining it. It would take a lot of training and probably a change of leadership to get this hotel near 4 or 5 star level. Price was fair, but I would stay at the Century plaza next time.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "image1", "Title": "\u201cIntercontinental Century City - it's all about the details\u201d", "Author": "image1", "ReviewID": "UR11101535", "Content": "We recently stayed 5 nights at the Century City Intercontinental Hotel in November of 2007. We booked our stay with Hotwire and paid $219/night... it was a little expensive compared to what other reviewers paid, but we basically booked it within a month, so it was the cheapest I could find in the Beverly Hills/Century City area. I was really excited to stay here, but mostly because I haven't been on vacation for a long time. After booking with Hotwire, I called the hotel and put in a request with reservations for a nice room with a king bed and a nice view - plus, we had a flat screen TV, which was a nice touch. Fortunately for us, when we arrived, they had honored our request, which was really nice! We stayed in 1512 and had a great view since it was a corner unit. Overall, I would say that this hotel is very nice - definitely a 3 to 3.5 star hotel. The details are what brought down its rating in my book (see the end of my review for more). It's obviously more suited to the business traveler, but is centrally located near good shopping - you've got Venice Beach to the West and West Hollywood to the East. There is a free concierge car service to Rodeo Drive in the heart of Beverly Hills, which is a nice touch - however, they warn you that they won't go beyond Rodeo Drive and the hours aren't conducive to late nights. The lobby was really nice and the 24 hour exercise facility was excellent. Make sure to go to the spa and ask for a locker and you will have access to the spa's nice shower area. The locker room closes at 11 pm, but the spa closes at 9 pm. If you want to use the locker room from 9-11 pm, make sure to go to concierge and ask for a key there. A lot of reviewers are shocked at the price of room service and the items in the mini fridge, but seriously, you're staying at a 4 star hotel within 2 miles of Beverly Hills, what do you expect? I wouldn't be stupid enough to order room service or grab anything out of the fridge. Instead, head to the Century City Westfield Mall, about a mile away and go to the grocery store, Gelson's, and pick up some snacks there. Although the fridge is sealed, you can also chill your drinks using the ice basket provided. One nice touch is that they provide you with free Fiji water - we got 3 each time they cleaned the room. Note, they do a general cleaning in the morning AND a turn down service at night, so they will knock on your door before noon and probably around 8 or 9 pm. The turndown service is also really nice touch. One thing about the cleaning service: we stayed for 5 nights at the hotel and we noticed a drop off in the quality of the cleaning towards the end of our stay - for instance, not all the towels were replenished and we no longer received 3 bottles of Fiji, but only 2. Again, head to the Century City mall for most of your dining needs as it is not only a gorgeous outdoor mall, but the food is very fresh and there is a LOT of selection at the food court and other dining establishments. DETAILS: Although our guest room (1512) was impressive at first glance, there were some issues I observed that brought down my overall impression at the Intercontinental Century City. First of all, the heating and A/C unit was very loud, but functioned very well. Secondly, the price of wireless internet access was exorbitant (nearly $10/day!). A hotel of this caliber should have free wireless access, especially considering the amount of business clients at the hotel. Note: you can go to the business center (not the greatest at all) and also pay for internet access), but you can also go to a little cubby near the check in desk... there is a tiny claustrophobic space where they have a free internet terminal. Sometimes people stand in a line waiting to use it, so just be aware of that. Thirdly, there were no in-room mirrors (they were only in the bathroom), so it was inconvenient getting dressed before we left our room. Fourthly, the cost of mandatory valet parking was ridiculous. Although I understand that the custom in LA is pay parking (a lot of places, such as the Westfield Mall offer the first 1.5 to 3 hours free), $30 a day is quite high - HOWEVER, the valet service was excellent, so it felt like you were getting what you paid for. Lastly, the bathroom also looked impressive upon first glance... however, upon closer inspection, I was shocked at the lack of attention to detail. For instance, the bathroom countertop was not properly attached to the wall, so where it connected, instead of a waterproof seal, the wallpaper extended onto the countertop to cover up the absence of any waterproof seal. Finally, although the separate shower was a nice touch, the tiling in the shower was a little uneven. Again, these are small details, but in a top tier hotel, it's the details that count. I think overall, I would rate this hotel a 3.5. Had it not been for the details, I would have definitely said a 4, or possibly a 4.25. But due to the lack of attention to details, I would overall rate this as a 3.5.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel stay I've ever had\u201d", "Author": "mas709", "ReviewID": "UR10915152", "Content": "I will keep this short and simple: the best hotel stay I have ever had - anywhere.

The food court there is a possible alternative for food. For everything else, a car is needed. Rodeo drive is just 5-10 mins by car.

My room overlooked the front of the hotel and had a spectacular view of Hollywood and downtown L.A. in the distance.

The bed mattress was somewhat firm, but comfortable, and the bedding was of a high quality. The room's desk was adequate, but the desk chair was a stiff back chair that you might find at a dining table ... not the greatest for serious work. An armchair in the room was quite comfortable. The bathroom was large with, as noted in previous posts, separate shower and tub. A single vanity was sufficient for me as I was traveling alone, but a double vanity might have been more appropriate for a hotel of this class. Public areas at the hotel are first rate.

There are some items that need some attention, though. These are minor issues, but for a hotel to truly be a 4-star property, they are items that I believe should not be overlooked: 1) The TV, bedside radio, and cordless telephones are very dated. They looked out of place and gave the impression of deferred maintenance. 2) There were stains (blood?) on the bedside lamp shade. They were quite apparent and covered the shade, top to bottom, on one portion of it. Something like that probably would go unreplaced in a Best Western or Holiday Inn, but should be removed in an Intercontinental. 3) The sheets were haphazardly applied.

The Intercontinental took over this hotel at the first of the year as it had previously been the Park Hyatt and JW Marriott. It is a lovely property in the heart of Century City. It is more of a business hotel due to its location, however, the hotel has a complimentary car service that will take you to the CC Shopping Center and nearby Rodeo Drive. The concierge staff is so knowledgeable and offered many suggestions. The pool area was well maintained with continual attention by the housekeeping staff.

Neither a jackpot nor a disappointment (particularly when you're not paying anywhere near rack rate). The Pros? Very clean, *huge* bathrooms (separate tub and shower), lovely beds, friendly room service, and excellent facilities (we made great use of both the pool and the gym). The Cons? The location - downtown LA is good in that it's central, but there is *nothing* worthwhile nearby and as you'd expect, takes *forever* to drive anywhere in LA. This spot would be better fit for business travelers than tourists really. Valet parking - you can not park your own car. Annoying. Room service - while it definitely was a super chocolate milkshake - the room service menu is off-the-charts price-wise (and this is coming from a New Yorker, I'm used to big bills). Plus even though a tip is calculated into your bill, the wait staff clearly expects to be tipped in addition to that amount. Sigh. My final entertaining story: we got in late, checked in and wearily headed to our room. Only to open the door and find... someone asleep, who we clearly scared the [--] out of. Had I been a savvier traveler I would have brokered that into an upgrade. However, I was too tired - so I just trudged back down to the lobby to ask for another room.

At 11pm I attempted to get online using MY laptop instead and was prompted to pay again. Assuming this was a technical glitch I called the front desk -- and was informed by a rude and contrite young man - who said he was the manager - that the service the hotel used charged for each IP address... so if you used a different computer you would be charged ANOTHER ten dollars for the SAME 24 hrs of internet access. When I explained that clearly this was a technical glitch- i was informed that there was nothing to be done about it. If you use more than one computer in your room, you will pay $10 for EACH computer. Ridiculous. Never in my life has a purported four star hotel made that kind of \"too bad for you\" statement.
