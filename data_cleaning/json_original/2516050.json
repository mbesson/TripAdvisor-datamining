What we liked from the start was the hospitality. Rasha was the one who received us and she was indeed very funny and welcoming. We had just got off a 23hrs flight and she was definitely a breath of fresh air! The room was comfortable and very very clean which I totally love. The house-keeping team is really sweet and does a very thorough job of it, every single day. The bathroom is small but we didn't mind it as it is extremely clean (I am very fussy with toilet cleanliness especially) Alfonso helped us a lot with the Disneyland tour which we thoroughly enjoy. The place feels very personable, friendly and comfortable. We were there when there was a huge commotion at the inn. (Helicopters buzzing around on top of us + policemen everywhere!) Very terrified!! But Rasha and Cassie made us feel better with their warmth and attentiveness. They are real sweethearts those two! Even the other staff (gosh can't recall his name but he told me he was of Egyptian-descent) was always very helpful when it comes to taxis, sight-seeing tips etc. Breakfast was really basic. Nothing to shout about. The Inn is kitch-y, the TV probably need replacing, as does the furniture but the staff there made the place special. They could do with a refurbishment or two (hopefully they've done so already) It's just next to a great Mexican place (can be noisy during weekends if your room is facing towards the beachside) and just down the road there is a drugstore, so it's really convenient. The only real complaint I have is probably the fact that they don't have a security guard on the premise. There are quite a few drunkards/rowdy people coming into the inn or just hanging about at times and having a security personnel would be a good idea I think!

Weekend rates were slightly higher than weekday rates, as was expected, but the overall price was good. When we checked in we were told that we'd already paid (though the charge hadn't shown up on our credit card statement). Upon checkout, we asked for a receipt and were refused. Specifically we were told that since they'd already charged us (they hadn't), we didn't need to sign off on the charges, so a receipt wouldn't be provided. Uh okay... Then the charge shows up on our card, much higher than the rate we agreed to when making our reservation. After speaking with the manager on the phone, we were told that because the reservation was made with a third party (not an Inn staff member over the phone), the rates could change without notice and a refund would not be issued. We again asked for an itemized receipt and was given the run around. When the manager finally agreed to provide a receipt, he made it difficult. We had to receive a faxed form, fill it out, and fax it back just to have him snail mail a receipt (or so he said...we've yet to receive it). The other issue was that the Inn was under construction. To be fair, we knew this was happening as it was mentioned in our reservation confirmation. However, it was stated on that confirmation (and posted all over the Inn) that the construction would be confined to 9am-5pm Monday through Friday. This was not the case at all! Construction noise could be heard at all hours on all days that we were staying there (Thursday-Sunday). Additionally, the water was turned off not only during the posted construction times, but on Saturday as well. When we mentioned this to the manager while discussing the room rate increase, he stated that he knew for a fact the water was not off on Saturday during our stay. After arguing, he finally said he'd take $30 off the bill after discussing the water situation with his construction crew. All in all, we weren't in the room much during our trip. When we were, it was a constant source of irritation.

We really enjoyed our time here. It is at the southern end of venice beach, and only a block away from the water (a LOT of hotels in the area are several km away from the beach). It is on the same street as venice fishing pier. Just north of the marina, and at the southern end of the canals. The action end of Venice Boulevard is at the northern end- close enough to walk to, but able to escape from by coming back to the nicer southern end. (Venice boulevard is not a place where you want to be staying right in the middle of all the action). There are plenty of places to eat dinner nearby, from Japanese to Italian to Mexican to bars. Prices were pretty good at all of these places. No laundry on site, and no coin laundry nearby, but there is a cleaners a couple of blocks up the road. Parking on site is plentiful, but costs $7 per day (from memory). Breakfast is great with a lot of variety, held in the pretty courtyard on the first floor. Cleaning is good and rooms are very spacious (we had a rollaway bed for the third person and still had a heap of space to move around the room. Rollaway bed was surprisingly sturdy and good quality). Sometimes street noise can carry through the windows if you are on the Washington Blvd side. Wifi is fast and always worked well while we were there. Staff were always very friendly on the front desk. There is a small fitness centre on site which you can use, or you can walk/run along Venice boulevard (better in the mornings before it gets crowded). I would definitely stay here again when we return to LA at the end of our trip. We booked last minute so prices were a little better, but overall the rates are reasonable, especially for LA. In terms of location this is a great area as parking is plentiful and you can walk around easily at night, and a much nicer atmosphere than Hollywood or Beverley Hills. I prefer Santa Monica but as the hotels there are not in my budget, Venice was an excellent alternative; this hotel has the best location in Venice in proximity to the beach, canals, marina and plenty of eating and drinking options.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, uk", "Title": "\u201cBig, spacious rooms, beautiful courtyard\u201d", "Author": "UKX", "ReviewID": "UR122709981", "Content": "Writing this review is making me miss Venice beach ALOT.

Only thing I would say is that they do charge you for parking.

The breakfast area is both indoors and outdoors (on a charming open air courtyard with a fountain and flowers -- its like you are in the New Orleans French Quarter -- REALLY!!!). The room itself was large sized, well laid out; a queen bed with high end linens, great bedpillows -- I was asleep immediately each night). Our room opened into the quiet courtyard and had a small side balcony. The location on Washington Blvd in Venice (charming little City -- canals, beach etc.) is excellent with many restaurants and shops within walking distance of the hotel (don't drive around -- WALK! -- parking is valeted for the street AND beach parking is expensive!!).

A little bit of street noise, but nothing bad enough to interfere with sleep. On the whole, a good value and I would stay there again.

Check-in time is 3 pm , but we surprised them around noon and there were no rooms ready. The nice gentleman behind the desk said he would have something ready before 2 o'clock, if we could wait. We had flown in from Memphis and were tired after our flight, so he offered to lock our luggage inside a utility closet for safe keeping while we went to eat lunch and stroll down the beach. When we returned close to 2 o'clock, he checked us in without a problem. Our room was right beside the lovely outdoor patio area where breakfast is served and we were concerned it might be noisy. But we had no problem with noise whatsoever. Later in the evening, I asked the man behind the desk (sorry but don't know his name) about the Gray Line Tours, and he recommended the VIP Tours. Obviously, the hotel gets a percentage if they book a tour, which is fine with me. My daughter would be busy with friends the next day, so I took the tour alone and had a grand time chatting with other tourists. I was not disappointed. The six-hour tour of the entire Los Angeles area was well worth the $60. The desk clerk arranged for a taxi to the airport on the morning of our departure, which arrived about five to ten minutes early. I appreciate promptness so that wasn't a problem. This particular taxi driver owned his own cab and was extremely helpful and polite. Not at all like the rude driver from somewhere in the Middle East who gave us a ride to the motel upon our arrival. It was obvious that the Inn had a working relationship with this driver, so that was appreciated, too. Oh, I almost forgot about the breakfast. It's simply continental but fresh with plenty of choices. It kept me full until lunch time. All in all, my stay at the Inn was delightful. The desk clerk(s) were all very helpful and eager to hand out advice about the local attractions. The location is top notch, just far enough away from the beach to avoid the noise and the crowds. There are many good choices of restaurants within a one to two block walk and if you want to rent a bicycle, that can be arranged, too. Give this Inn a whirl.

Perhaps they should consider how they could sound proof the rooms because the cars don't stop and we got no sleep. Apparently all the rooms that face the courtyard were full. Although the front desk staff were polite enough, they also have a very relaxed, not bothered, approach to the fact we weren't happy with the room. They certainly didn't seem to mind at all that we were checking out early to move to another hotel. The staff are not rude but service isn't high on their agenda. The courtyard area was fairly pretty but the breakfast that was Free was very disappointing. It was self service with paper plates and plastic knives and forks and a limited range of cheap bagels and muffins and some cereals and some unappealing cold boiled eggs. I understand that they may have a limited budget as it is not a luxury hotel. However perhaps they would be better off serving an even more simple breakfast of a higher quality. It has to be said that the price was cheaper than most of the hotels around, so if budget is your main concern then perhaps this hotel is for you. However if you can afford it I would pick somewhere else. You certainly won't get any sleep if your room faces the street. The hotel is general is basic and a bit tired but it is clean and a 5 minute walk to the beach and near the pretty canals. Venice beach isn't for everyone. I did like the shops and cafe's in Abbott Kinney. It's nice to see original shops which aren't just chains stores that you can get anywhere else and the a stroll along with beachfront with the eclectic bunch of people is interesting.

They put loads of pillows & cushions and lovely crisp, white cotton sheets on the beds, which we really liked. We were given a corner room, and our family of 5 plus 5 large suitcases fitted easily. Venice Beach is an expensive place to stay, so I think that the rates at the Inn were very reasonable. Venice Beach is a quirky area & I really think that the hotel is well suited to the area. If you're looking for a large international, impersonal hotel, then this isn't the one for you. It's small, comfortable and friendly. Our room was at the back of the hotel & we didn't hear any street noise at all in the 3 nights we were there. My husband & daughter used their little gym & liked it. They also included a very good continental breakfast, with various fresh toasts and pastries, cereals, boiled eggs and a variety of juices, teas & coffee. It's just a short stroll to the beach & boardwalk, or you can stroll through the backstreets towards the boardwalk & see all the lovely houses along the canals. Across the road you can wander to Marina del Rey and look at all the poor people's boats! We would both stay there again & also recommend it to friends & family.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterey, California", "Title": "\u201cFour out of five ain't to shabby\u201d", "Author": "Montereyblue2", "ReviewID": "UR58307230", "Content": "Planning a trip to LA for me usually gets me in a cold sweat. There's several reasons for this, trafffic being on the top of the list, choosing an inexpensive, clean and centralized hotel in a large city such as Los Angeles is a close second. I decided to combat the traffic issue by activating my navigation on my Blackberry (Highly recommended and worth the extra bucks). After reseaching a variety of hotels, motels, B & Bs, I settled on the Inns at Venice Beach. My teenage son and I rolled into Venice late on Saturday night and tenitively strolled into the small lobby adjacent to the garage. We received a warm welcome, quick service and directions to a late meal from a pleasent young man at the front desk. As we rode the elevator and walked the mezzanine around the open court yard to our room my son and I to agreed that so far so good, the Inn seemed pleasent enough. While the Inn at Venice is not a four star, four diamond property it is a clean and straight to the point \"funky boutique hotel\" in a great and safe neighborhood. The beach is a block away, restaurants are plenty and acess to all major highways are less then 10 minutes away (very easy with the help of a good map and or navigator, again highly recommended for us out of towners). The Inn offeres a free, fresh and plentiful continental breakfast and pleasent customer service. My only disappointment was the noise, as mentioned earlier we arrived to the hotel late and the hope of sleeping in was diminished with the noise of early raisers and housekeeping as the rooms don't seem well insulated and sound traveled straight through the walls and through the pillow that covered my head forcing me to start my day at the crack of dawn. Because the hotel is in such a great neighborhood my son and I did not hesitate to grab our sneakers and go for a morning run through the eclectic streets of Venice turning my crumpy, early rise into a very pleasent day... Yes I would recommend the Inn at Venice to everyone I know. Infact as this trip was a college tour trip and my son's top choice of school is right in the heart of LA I predict that I'll be visiting the Inn at Venice again, with ear plugs and sneakers in tow.

Parking is quite convenient as the hotel has it's own self parking facility which costs USD 7 a night which is a good price for that area. The room is quite big and so is the bathroom area. The room is not very modern (i.e. no flat screen TV etc.) but everything is clean and the bed is very comfortable.

Breakfast was the typical continental breakfast type with cereals, bagels, hard boiled eggs etc. It was not bad and was served in a small room on the first floor. Check-out was efficient and quick which was appreciated. To sum it up, it's a good hotel and if you can get it for the right price (USD 117 p/night excl tax and parking) it is really good value for money. It is also near LAX and bordering to Santa Monica.

Wow, groups of girls in bikinis on a weekday in March now and then! Great stuff. If you head the other way on Washington Boulevard, then a block away is a selection of cafes and corner stores. As you near the beach on Washington Boulevard there's a small sports store and I bought some Nike sneakers (runners) for US$90 - half the price they are available for in Australia. Last thing - in California there is SALES TAX. And they don't tell you about it, even when they quote prices to you! It's whacked on top. One minute you think you're paying US$2.50 for a hot dog and the next you think they said the total cost wrong (it's sales tax). There's no sales tax refund program when leaving LAX.

The courtyard is as pretty as the picture suggests, and before the rain was a pleasant place to sit and read the paper for a little while. The hotel is located two small blocks from the beach - less than 5 minutes walk (and I'm not big on walking) and you're on the beach without the hassle of taking any transport. There were plenty of really welcoming and afforable places to eat. We made use of the local Big Blue Bus to get to Santa Monica, which meant a bit of walking, and taxis.

If you're on the 3rd St Blvd (a lot of fun on a sunday aft.), this takes you out of the way at both ends of the trip and costs up to $9.00 more (in peak hour).

We recommed the inside courtyard rooms or the rooms facing the back of the hotel because they are quieter than those facing the sidestreet. In the afternoon until early evening, complimentary punch, apples and homemade cookies are offered in the lobby. The included breakfast, while not gourmet, is satisfying. There was always plenty of fresh bread, bagels, cereals, fruit, yogurt, juices and assorted coffees and teas. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and helped us with directions to church and hiking. When they were unsure of a recommendation, they got the information and let us know. You can't beat the location. Within a 2-3 minute walk, you are on the beach. Along the way, you will pass several very good restaurants and a bike rental shop. The C&O Trattoria and The Terrace are our favorite places to dine. There's also a Starbucks and a Cold Stone Creamery across the street. The beach is clean and it's great to walk to the Santa Monica Pier. On the way back we usually walk along the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Its packed with interesting vendors, locals and tourists. Although this may sound like a paid advertisement, it isn't. We have always been super satisfied staying here and I think others should know about this place, especially when accomadations, in and around Santa Monica range from dissapointingly pricey to high-priced luxury. The Inn at Venice Beach is a true value.", "Date": "April 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, Great Value\u201d", "Author": "Tabby1", "ReviewID": "UR4736187", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights in March 2006 and were very happy with our choice.

My room (on the third floor overlooking a small rear parking lot and looking north toward Santa Monica) was very spacious and bright...actually nicer than I had thought it would be from other reviews! The rooms are arranged around a pretty little inner courtyard that serves as outdoor seating for breakfast. While not overlooking the beach or the canals, the hotel IS just a couple of blocks from these two attractions. It is also near a number of restaurants, cafes, bars, and stores, if you don't want to travel to have dinner or lunch. Breakfast at the hotel is fine -- a good selection of breads, pastries, yogurt and fruit. The staff was very friendly and accomodating ...among other things they clued me in on using a shuttle to get back to LAX rather than a cab (as they are usually the last stop for shuttles before the airport, you can save money without sacrificing time). On the whole, a great place to stay if you are looking for something more reasonably priced in the Santa Monica/Venice area", "Date": "October 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, great location - loved it!\u201d", "Author": "Cooksister", "ReviewID": "UR4055552", "Content": "We stayed at the Inn after reading a couple of very positive reviews on this site and we were not disappointed. I had looked for something in the area at my price range and kept finding fleabags so I was really pleased to find the Inn. We had just endured a 12 hour transatlantic flight so we were all a little tired and fed-up. What better way to revive ourselves than with the freshly-baked complimentary cookies on the reception desk?!? On subsequent days there was also a fruit basket and freshly squeezed juice, all compliments of the hotel. The location is another HUGE bonus. It was a quick and easy drive from LAX airport, and we were only 2-3 blocks from the beach. So every morning we could take a walk on the beach before breakfast, and stroll on the beach at sunset. The markets (and the endessley fascinating passing parade) of Venice Beach is about a 5 minute walk and both Santa Monica and Marina del Rey are 5 minutes by car. The rooms are enormous by European standards (although I gather pretty average by American standards!) and nicely furnished. We had a queen-sized bed and a rollaway bed in our room and it never felt too crowded. Our room faced the street, so there was some traffic noise in the morning, but nothing too bad. The room was very well equipped - there were more free toiletries than we had at any other hotel over our 17 day trip and they also provided bathrobes, which is an obsession of mine ;-) If silence is a priority, make sure to ask for a room facing onto the delicious little courtyard in the middle of the building. It's a really lovely little public area that doubles up as an overflow for the breakfast room and looks great with the lush plants and little fountain. The breakfast (served in the room adjacent to the courtyard) was good - dry cereals, instant oats, yoghurt, fruit, a selection of hot drinks, bread, bagels, waffles, Philly cream cheese, syrup, jam/jelly etc etc. And nobody seems to mind if you come downstairs, grab some food and eat in your room. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, and credit has to go to the young lady who on our first night recommended Tony P's (in Marina del Rey) for dinner on our first night. We could not believe the view when we walked in - you are RIGHT on the marina! We ate in the enclosed balcony area and had really delicious food (mmmm, clam chowder!) - and it was really reasonable for what you were getting (and downright cheap if paying in Pounds!) The only negatives were the fact that we could not for love or money get our (non wi-fi) laptop computer to work, despite lots of advice from the staff) and the fact that when you are in the bathroom, you can hear every movement in the adjacent bathroom (the staff did warn us about this and suggested we sleep with the bathroom door closed...). But apart from those two very minor gripes, I absolutely loved the Inn and I would definitely stay there again. Oh, and as somebody else has mentioned, the $4 per night parking is really reasonable!", "Date": "October 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swindon, UK", "Title": "\u201c2nd Visit even better than the 1st!\u201d", "Author": "Heavens", "ReviewID": "UR3985826", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel in Sept 2004 and was exceptinally pleased on the hotels location and the staff's hospitality here.

The room was fantastic and had an upstairs (the bedrtoom) and a sizeable living area downstairs. The standard rooms werre big enough, but the suite was enormous! The stay was fantatsic again, as we knew it would be. There were renovations being carried out at the hotel but the noise was during the day and was minimal. We would not have noticed the rennovations had we not seen the sign in the reception lobby. The hotel is also ideally located as it's about 2 blocks away from the beach and it is such a nice wals to Venice along the boardwalk. The amenities nearby aee great.

I'll get straight to the pet peeve....I hate when I can loudly hear the shower running in the next room, and I was awoke two of the three days by the neighboring tenant. I want a quiet room where I can sleep great. Other than the shower noise it was fairly quiet. But that did bother me. Now to the positives...The staff was very, very friendly. Very nice. The location is great if you want to spend a lot of time on the beach or stroll the boardwalk. And rental bikes and skates are a block away. It is also not too far from the airport on side streets. The free continental breakfast is nice and welcomed and the room was a decent size, though I wish they had king beds in all the rooms. We had to get a queen, which is a little small for my wife and I, and we probably won't do that again. I also wish it was a little closer to the freeway, so if you plan on driving all over L.A. there might be a better location. But if the beach is a primary objective, then this is as good as it gets. I also like that the parking was only $4/day. So many hotels charge almost as much as the room it seems. And it was okay that there wasn't a bellman. The bag trolley is right there to use and you don't have to go far. The hotel is small, which is nice.
