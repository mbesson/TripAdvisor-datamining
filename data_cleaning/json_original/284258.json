From the second we checked in, the Hotel determined to make our stay among the worst we have ever had. On check in we agreed to upgrade our room by 2 levels from the deluxe room we had booked to a suite. I really would have hated to see the base level room. We checked in late and had decided on the way from the airport to have room service and then go to bed ready for the following day. My wife then rang for food and we were told that it would be a minimum of 45 minutes and the excuse quoted was really not satisfactory. ( Based purely around poor management ) I then called reception to speak to the duty manager to find out that I could not understand one word of what he was saying to me as his grasp of the English language and His annunciation was so poor. At this point I handed the phone to my wife hoping that she could understand his English, alas she was also unable to hold a meaningful conversation with the gentleman. The next day things got worse, we decided to try and relax in the morning by going to the Spa for a swim and jacuzzi, wow more stress. It would seem that the maintenance section of the hotel uses the Swimming pool and Jacuzzi area as a thoroughfare to their office/workshop. So for the hour we were there, we had to put up with Maintenance men constantly opening and closing doors and walking though the area leering at my wife in her bikini, as you can imagine my wife felt very uncomfortable. After this, \u00c2\u00a0we contacted the hotel management and the Front Office manager attempted to placate us and offered us a further upgrade to an Executive Suite, another back fire I'm afraid. Although the room was set out well, it was tired and in need of renovation. The worst feature we did not find out until later that night, the bed should have been disposed of years ago, it was so warped and was actually shaped like a banana. Anyway we did not arrive back until very late so we decided not to start things all over again. Imagine our surprise however in the morning as we found out that due to the fact that the room had no black out curtains we were rudely awoken at sunrise. To cap the whole thing off and put the proverbial icing on the Cake, just prior to us going to check out we asked the hotel for their email address so that we could send our aeroplane tickets to them to be printed out. Bad mistake, the first time we asked we were given:- Jareception@sydneyamorahotels.com.au ( given to us by the duty manager ) We sent our tickets and immediately the email bounced back. We then decided to wait until we got downstairs and while checking out, \u00c2\u00a0we checked the address and were told it was actually Jareception@sydneyamorahotels.com (with no .au) So we sat down and proceeded to send again ( a long process as the 3G network was slow and the documents were .pdfs ) well guess what .. they bounced again. This time we were told it was actually: Jareception@sydney.amorahotels.com\u00c2\u00a0 Guess again, it is actually : Jareception@sydney.amorahotels.com.au WHAT A JOKE. And a waste of another hour of our short holiday. Being seasoned international travellers, we were appalled, on each occasion the Hotel attempted to rectify problems they actually made it worse. It is so hard to understand how this hotel can remain in business. What was supposed to be a pleasant weekend away visiting friends, turned out to be a complete nightmare that we paid the privilege for. It just was not worth complaining any further and we checked out and left, both agreeing that we would spread the word as far and as wide as we could.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Erzincan", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "Jardzy Z", "ReviewID": "UR127855104", "Content": "Stayed there for a few days.

I stayed at the Amora Jamison Sydney on 21 January 2012. When we arrived we were greeted by concierge who took our bags. When we finished checking in we looked around for our bags and the concierge. Our bags were still sitting out the front of the hotel with the conceirge chatting away at a desk. (Thanks - I enjoy my luggage being left for anyone to take). We went to our room which was reasonable. After a short time we noticed a beeping. The safe had an error code and would not close, lock or reset (we had not used it). I called the reception and was told someone would come up. Twenty minutes later, I called again. The receptionist made it clear I was pestering her and someone was coming. Ten minutes later, the maintenance man arrived. He was friendly and apologetic and was trying to fix the safe for about fifteen minutes. He then called the duty manager and requested he come up with a device to reset the safe. I could tell from the conversation that the maintenance man was getting frustrated at this persons refusal to attend the room. I was told someone would be coming up shortly. Twenty minutes later, I called to find out what was happening with the safe that was still beeping every minute or so. Once again the receptionist had a poor attitude. About twenty minutes later, (over an hour by now of beeping and waiting to relax) the manager attends. His attitude was poor from the first second and did not improve. He even went to trouble of showing me a list of things he had to do when he dealt with my issue. The manager then told me the maintenance man would only be there for another hour so if there was anything further I needed to call before he left. I questioned him on what would happen if it started to beep again after that time and he said maintenance would not be back till the morning. About one minute after the manager left the safe commenced beeping again. I call reception again and yes got the same poor attitude. I requested a new room or a refund. I was informed conceirge would attend with a new room key. About twenty minutes later, I received a call from the manager who told me to send the conceirge back down when they arrived. He explained to me that he had fixed it and it was not beeping so I did not need a new room. After an argument he basically said whatever and ended the call. About twenty minutes later, (as I was packing my back to check out) conceirge attended with new room keys. The new room was the same style and size. In the morning, I asked for the hotel manager's details to make a complaint. The morning manager took down the details and informed me he would follow this up and call me. So one month on I have not heard anything and can only assume this poor service is the standard. With so many good hotels in Sydney avoid this one.

There is a pharmacy and Woolworths in there too along with a flower vendor and some souvenir and clothing stores. Around the corner is a Vodaphone store with great service personnel who helped get wireless for our iPad/service for our phone. Cons: tired furnishings including beds although mattresses were fine and sheets were crisp. For us, the level of business travelers made it a more transactional visit and more sterile.

I booked it on a whim for myself and my partner as a special \"treat\" last week for the night before Australia Day. I arrived for check in in the middle of a down pour with my hands full of bags and umbrellas, the door man was too busy staring into space to even open the door for me! Check in was reasonably fast and I was sent off to my room (still carrying all my bags with no offer of help). The room was incredibly old and worn. Stained carpet, falling apart furniture and terrible lighting (not from sun as there was none but from the actual lights installed!). The next morning my partner and I both woke up exceptionally early as we were in so much pain from the awfully uncomfortabel bed/pillows. We had ordered pillows from the pillow menu which basically offered 3 types of soft pillows (already found on your bed) or a \"chiropractic pillow\" which I was told was similar to a latex pillow. The only thing chiropractic about it was that I now need to visit the chiropractor after sleeping on it! The reason I know the bed was so bad was that my partner was in pain and unable to sleep from it and he can sleep anywhere usually.Gosh we are 25 not 75, yet that is how I felt all of the next day!

Deluxe Park Suite on the 27th floor. Had a view over the park and could see the harbour at a distance. A good sitting area with stereo and TV, desk area, big bedroom and huge bath and shower. Great bed and plenty of room to put stuff- good when you move in for a while. All very modern and luxurious Gym was also good, but popular, so go at the quiet times. Thanks to all the team!

The rooms are large and modern, but to us didn't feel like a five star hotel. A couple of light bulbs didn't work, and there were a few marks on the bedsheets and on the walls (all easily rectified in 5mins if someone in housekeeping had an eye for detail) A large shower and bath were provided, with decent water flow and hot water. The bed was comfortable, and a 'pillow menu' was available, as is all the rage these days.

Whilst it was only on the 7th Floor it was a corner room with an open view across the city towards the western side of the Bridge. The bathroom was enormous, separate big tub and shower huge picture window for a view from the bath if you were game! Towels big but a little thin and only 2 of them. The room itself wasn't huge but was considerably bigger than the equivalent at the Sofitel Wentworth where we have stayed a couple of times. The standout feature was the bed, incredibly comfortable, I wanted to take it home! There is a pillow menu but no listing for my favourite firm foam pillow so I stuck with what was on offer. The hotel could certainly do with a refresh. There is some wear and tear to carpets and surfaces in the room. The hotel information guide had VERY grubby pages that really should be replaced.

The T.v came out on rolls out of a cupboard, which was pointless if you wanted to watch a movie in bed or anything because the cupboard door completely blocked the view!!

We ordered a bottle of sweet wine.. 20 minutes later the waiter (who seemed to be training) still could not find this wine so he came to tell us he was going to have another look.... finally he came with a bottle which was not at all cold, and did taste like a cheap drop. ($29 in the restaraunt) After watching everyone else get there meals (55minutes later) I hate asking but I asked the waiter if our meals were almost ready as we had been waiting quiet some time.. he goes to the kitchen and comes back and tells us that our order had been lost, for that they gave us complimentary steamed vegetables - they were not in anyway steamed, they were hard as rock. I had the ratatoulle canneloni which was tasteless & watery, my partner had the pork which was enjoyable... On the plus side the bed was so comfy I didn't want to move...

The gym was quite poor for a hotel of that price. Did not try the Spa.

You'd think that for a hotel at this price they would be able to manage that.

Very close to Wynyard Station and cabs always waiting outside as well which was a plus. Very comfortable rooms though the top of the cupboard was dirty, toilet cistern leaked (no noise just seemed like a waste of water despite two attempts by maintenance to repair), the `Pillow Menu` was lovely and the rooms were generally very clean and well designed. One thing would have been nicer is if the desk did not have such a worn look to it. The lift system is really strange (but seems standard at the other hotel I stayed in Australia) where you'd get three people in a lift going to different floors and a card security system that usually meant by the time the first person had entered their floor the other two had missed theirs.

The next morning we indulged in a buffet breakfast with plenty on offer and the promise of freshly cooked eggs any way you like them which arrived hot and delicious to the table. Coffee and Tea is made fresh and delivered to you in large individual pots. Wonderful and no need to flag a passing staff member for refills.

When i was initially looking for hotels Sydney is a really expensive city and i found a lastminute.com.au 5 star mystery hotel deal for $210 a night. I figured i'd risk it hoping it was something other than the Swissotel (See previous review). Once booked When i saw it was the Amora Jamison i had never heard of it and i'll admit i was a little unnerved by the reviews. The day finally arrived and once flying into Sydney i jumped on the Airport Link train and got off at the closest station (Wynyard) it was about a block and a half walk. From the outside the building looks really tall and like it was built in may be the late 70's, early 80's? I proceeded into the lobby, First impressions good and it had a very airy and upmarket look to it, The girl at check in was very bubbly and friendly and i get issued Room 2810. (28th floor) Once in the lift i discover the hotel is actually 34 stories high, and i get excited thinking of my potential view. Once i get off the lift and to my room i open the door and walk in, My room itself....It was clean, a VERY comfortable bed and there is a huge entertainment wall unit with multiple compartments which contains the Tv, Minibar, Storage space, etc Unfortunately the tv can't be manouvered though (At least not from what i could see) so you can't really watch tv from bed unless you crane your neck to the right. The tv had about 20 channels including some cable channels, But who goes to Sydney to watch tv? My room was a little bit worn carpet wise and a couple of wear and tear on the walls, My view is partial and mainly overlooks the office tower opposite (Beware if you have the window open they can see you and vice versa) and also has a partial view of the bridge area and Circular Quay. The curtains fold down to give you enough privacy. In all honesty the room is probably more of a 4 star standard. The bathroom has a seperate Bath and Shower with Hydro tolietries, Housekeeping forgot to restock mine one day but a quick phonecall and they came up to replace them. The bathroom is very nice and spacious. I never used the gym but i used the pool and spa (Open until 10:30pm) a few nights, These areas are definitely what i'd call 5 star, The pool has a roman kind of a feel to it and a neat feature wall with water trickling down it, The Spa is huge and very relaxing and they also have sauna facilities The location is great, An easy 10 minute walk to Darling harbour, The Rocks, Sydney Opera House and all the major tourist attractions. Or for retail therapy Pitt Street and George Street have you covered! On to my tours, I booked through Viator and my first full day tour was Blue Mountains/Jenolan Caves through Australian Pacific Touring. I HIGHLY recommend this tour, The Blue Mountains are extremely pretty and once you get out to Jenolan Caves they are just stunningly beautiful with lots of caverns to explore, My second tour also with Australian Pacific Touring was to the Hunter Valley, After a stop through Woolombi, it was on for wine tasting at Lindemans, followed by the Hunter Valley resort and then McGuigans followed by a trip to a local chocolate shop (yummy!) it was also a great tour, both tours picked up at 7am and dropped me back at the hotel (Pending rush hour in Sydney) at 8pm, so they were both long days but as i said especially for international tourists who may want to see our rural areas it's definitely worth it! Here's a tip: For those who don't want to eat in the city and get a more localised experience jump on the train and travel to an inner city suburb called \"Newtown\" it has some great restaurants, bars and cafe's and will give you a more in depth look into life in Sydney. The whole 5 days in my room i never heard my neighbours and check out was smooth and they were happy to hold my bags whilst i filled in time before i headed off to the airport as my flight wasnt until 2pm. (And i recommend the Airport train link at $15 one way) Like i said it wasn't the most luxurious hotel but for a place to rest your head and explore i'd definitely be happy to stay here again!", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "Ellemic", "ReviewID": "UR118038155", "Content": "I stayed at the Amora Hotel for 3 nights on a short break holiday.

The room was very tired and run down more like a two star hotel and certainly not five stars. In addition, the hot water was at best only lukewarm with very little pressure. Lukewarm water for a disabled room is understandable as a disabled person may have problems regulating the temperature and flow. For an able bodied businessman it is totally unsuitable. Furthermore, I was woken by loud banging on my door at 6:30am in the morning. Room Service was waking me up to try and deliver a breakfast I had not even ordered. I didn't even receive an apology for the early morning interruption. This hotel is lousy and not suited to the business and leisure traveler. Do not stay here! I am passing my comments on to the hotel management. There is much better value to be found elsewhere, again do not stay here.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubbo, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPretty average for 5 star...\u201d", "Author": "Vanessa C", "ReviewID": "UR117477911", "Content": "We stayed here for a few nights recently before a friends wedding.

Fortunately my partner has a sense of humour as this not exacly the greeting you want when you come to a hotel for the first time on a romantic getaway. An eyebrow was raised though..... Then we were given a handicapped room with no bath. Part of the reason for the getaway was due to no bath in our apartment and this was a key reason for the night away (in the city we live in). I went back down to request a room with a bath and whilst a Sat night and the hotel was probably pretty full the concierge was absolutely fantastic, and professional (maybe they still thought I was a regular?!?) - and lets just say we were very happy with the next room (or should I say rooms....) - very nice. Then went down to the seafood buffet which included a free drink. The oceans have a little less life form in them after my efforts. Oysters, Balmain bugs, Prawns, Blue Swimmer Crab, BBQ Octopus - excellent.

It is very unassuming from the street, but when you enter into the hotel it packs quite a punch. We ended up on quite a high floor with absolutely stunning views over the harbour, city and anzac bridge. The views were great during the day and amazing with all the lights at night. The bathroom had a huge window, so you could enjoy the view from the bathtub - the bedroom had the same. The room itself (we were in a standard twin) was huge. It had a large foyer area with separate door which could be closed off at the bedroom. It was one of the quietest large hotels I had stayed in in a long time. This is hugely important as more often than not you are hearing the guests next door or above you and doors slamming/lifts etc. But once you were inside your room here, you didn't hear a peep. The beds were soft and the linen was crisp and clean. We had an issue with our tv (which turned out to be not plugged into the aerial at the back) and this was fixed quickly with no fuss. Check out was too easy also with a well managed and staffed line (which was short). We were served by a trainee who was super friendly and very efficient (making a nice change from when you generally tend to get trainees who take FOREVER...)

Concierge staff were very helpful. Mini bar very expensive so shop outside ; crisps: $6, water $5; internet $9.99 per hour..took the airport transfer for $50...very comfortable.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "gosford", "Title": "\u201cWow, I loved this hotel, beautifullly furnished, fantastic deal with wotif including breakfast and seafood buffet.\u201d", "Author": "reduja", "ReviewID": "UR114724022", "Content": "Well we had a wonderful time here.

The room: spacious room, with a very comfortable bed. no question! they also have a pillow menu that includes a chiropractic pillow, a butterfly pillow, a microfibre and a duck down and others to choose from. The TV was located adjacent to the bed. so if you wanted to watch TV, you needed to turn your head 90 degs (in my case, to the RIGHT). Not so cool. It gets very uncomfortable very quickly. Other highlights: a very spacious bathroom. Almost art deco in style with french doors and a clean black and white tile scheme. well lit too! What wasn't so good: the toilet cistern would hiss for a very long time after flushing. that hissing sound emanates thru the room. slightly annoying.... the blinds on the window also needs replacing. It's a 5 star hotel with very very very badly fraying blinds.... seriously, you can spend a few dollars to change it and make a difference. Bottle 'hotel water' wasn't free either. $6 a bottle from memory. The room was also quite dim. Bed side lights were adequate for spot lighting the area, but not very good overall lighting for the room. A word on the reception, check-in process - rather emotional less and lacking warmth. Don't get me wrong, am not after a hug, but for those that would have travelled long distances to get to Sydney, a smile and friendly disposition wouldn't hurt. Plus, smiling doesn't cost!

Three different people said i needed to fill out of a form and fax it back with credit card information. None of the three ever emailed me the form - so we never were able to get a reservation for dinner (worked out better anyway - had heavy lunch on NYE and went to SeaRock for the party in Circular Quay with AMAZING fireworks views) Upon arrival at noon, our room was not ready (understandable). They said they would call us when ready - never got the call, but came back at 2:30 and room was ready. We had requested and booked a room with a balcony (entire hotel is non-smoking and we smoke). They of course had no balcony rooms left. The windows do not open in the rooms (we had a one bedroom suite). We had to go down 28 floors and outside in driveway to smoke (just a warning for potential smoker guests). I also enjoy a little fresh air in a stuffy hotel room - no go The rooms are showing their age (dirty grout in the tile in the bathroom, worn fixtures/outlets, older furniture, lumpy bed). Lucky for us our suite's bedroom looked directly into the office buildings main windows (about 20 feet away) and the curtains are completely see through. Living room window overlooked the city (nice). Couch in room 2807 had BIOLOGICAL STAIN (white stain) on it - nasty. There were no other rooms left that were suites so we could not move rooms (we arrived 12/29 and stayed till 1/2). There was an Ashes convention coming in, so all the rooms were tied up for them. Air Conditioning in 2807 would not go below 25 Celsius (77 degrees F) which was extremely uncomfortable. Sydney was having a heat wave and temps were in upper 80s - without fresh air in room, this became VERY stuffy and uncomfortable. 2807 is across from supply room for housekeeping - noisy all day long Cannot see writing on different switches to control lighting so it is a shot in the dark as to what lights will come on. Not enough extra outlets in the hotel room for laptop, charging cell phones, etc. had to unplug lamps, etc. to charge common items which is inconvenient. They give you an icebucket, but no where to get ice, have to order from room service which is not very quick. Pool area (3rd floor) is small but adequate - people were topless in hottub and looked a little \"busy\" when we went down to use it - so we went back up to the room Coffee maker in room is inadequate, had to go to corner coffee shop or McDonalds as we were not paying $6 a cup from room service (with extra charge just to GET room service) There is a woolworths in the mall under the hotel, go there to stock up on any snacks, soda, etc. They do not sell alcohol in supermarkets in Sydney, need to go to a bottle store. Beer and wine are expensive near the hotel - if you see something reasonably priced, grab it and bring it back. Beer and wine IN hotel are way over priced. Concierge (belldesk) would open doors for us to go outside and smoke, and completely forget that we had just walked by them 10 minutes ago and act like they had never seen us - sometimes they would only open doors for people arriving by car, not walk up. Concierge - not very handy for local recommendations, how to get somewhere, etc. Better to find out on your own. Overall - would only stay in this hotel again if it was only place available.

Having said this, however, the Amora turned out to be a real surprise. Tucked away in Jamison Street (in the downtown business district), its away from the noise and bustle of the shopping and entertainment precincts but only a short walk to them if you need that buzz. Its also located within walking distance of the Rocks (my fave haunt when doing my home town). The room, whilst small, was elegant and clean. The bathroom one of the best I've encountered. I was also impressed by the heavy duty blackout blinds which almost completely blocked out the morning sun. The real standout, however, was the service from front desk, Concierge (Troy?) and room service. The breakfast (which we chose to have in the room) was THE best hotel breakfast I've ever had in twenty years of corporate and leisure hotel stays - hot, perfectly cooked eggs, Bircher muesli, yoghurt, juice, bakery preserves - the whole deal. It arrived bang on time, service was friendly and discreet. The breakfast, along with most in-room dining options, were reasonably priced. Breakfast in bed is important to me. With two kids, a lie in is usually impossible, let alone breakfast in bed. I loved this experience. I loved the Amora. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I will definately be going back.

I used to stay in the Jamison hotel back in 2003-2005, stayed there about 6 or 7 times back then for business. It was one of the best value for money luxury hotels in Sydney CBD back then so I thought it still had to be good today. Having not stayed in the hotel for 5 years, I read the comments on TripAdvisor when I booked in March 2010 and became extremely nervous that maybe the quality had slipped. I need not have been worried. The hotel (in my partner and my experience) was top quality. We flew in from the UK (Where we live) at 6am and the staff were extremely flexible and friendly helping us check in early, use all the facilities in the hotel and help settle us in after a 30hour journey from London. When I first walked into reception and spoke to the staff, I have to say that the hotel has lost NOTHING in the way of service, its still very lovely as you walk in. The room itself again I was VERY nervous it wouldn't be clean or maybe those amazing luxury bathrooms 7 years ago hadn't been maintained. I shouldn't have been worried, it still looked pretty much brand new including the carpets, walls, bedding, furniture, bathroom etc. It was all high quality, all clean and spacious just as I remembered it. The pool/health spa was also very nice, we stayed mid week so it was fairly quiet during the day and although not staffed very well it suited us just fine as we want to chill out in peace. Food in our opinion (We had breakfast and one dinner there) again was just as good as I remember it. Good quality and nice service. I once again feel bad for everyone on TripAdvisor who had a less than perfect experience at Jamison Hotel. OK - Its not a 5 star hotel.... but its very high quality, I like the taste of the decor - Its modern and the service and cleanliness is always top rate and in my opinion you pay alot more for a similar standard in other hotels in Sydney. And before you may think that our standards perhaps aren't very high and we are easy to please..... Think not ..... My partner and I often stay in \"Leading hotels of the world\" affiliated hotels all over the world....... Places that cost 2-3 times per night than the Jamison charges and fundamentally it is a GREAT hotel. I have to say that apart from small details on service that a 5 star hotel offers, its just as good as a base in Sydney. We've stayed in places that cost $800/ night where we've still had to complain about sheets not being clean, bathrooms having mould, service being poor and rude, food having to be sent back, reservations being messed up etc........ So whilst I also feel bad for guests who've had a less than perfect stay, I also would question and take with a grain of salt what their expectations were to begin with.

Eventually I left without paying the $16 or so charge for the alleged adult movie viewing. Some eight hours later I received a most apologetic call from the manager, who explained that the hotel had no control over the movie supply as these were beamed into the hotel's entertainment system by a specialist company. The manager explained that there had been a 'tachnical hitch' and profusely apologised. So while I do not blame the hotel for this error, it could have been handled better by the initial staff member I encountered particularly since I had to stare into his eyes and inform him that I most certainly did not hire the said video.

And the bathrooms are large with a huge separate bath (though the grout could use some Ajax). The room was clean but a few little signs of wear-and-tear - chipped paint and dirty mark on the front door. But nothing major. The phone service was a bit disappointing. Their into is too long, they directed me to the wrong person, and then there was some modem-like high pitched sounds so I had to hang up and call back.

It is very conveniently located about 10 minutes walk north to reach the Opera House and Gardens and 20 minutes walk south-west to reach Darling Harbour (the two main tourist areas). The hotel is in the middle of the CBD and surrounded by tall buildings. Unless you ask for a room above the 20th floor, the only view will be looking into office buildings. Towards the top (it's 33 levels) the views improve. However, don't expect sweeping views of the harbour. At best you'll get water glimpses through other buildings. If the view is the most important feature, hotels like the ANA will serve you better but at a much higher price. We asked for a King Corner upgrade. This gives a much lighter room and was worth the $25 cost. Staff were very helpful. Due to some minor miscommunication we were not given the room we asked. However, the problem was fixed quickly with a smile. The rooms are a good size and quite light (especially the corner rooms with an extra window). The bathrooms were modern and well-appointed. From the bathtub, you can relax and look out on the city (which means that if you don't drop the blind the office workers can also relax and look in on you . . . but a small price to pay). It was lovely at night to enjoy the city lights. The breakfast was top-notch. It was the usual buffet spread with everything presented beautifully. There were plenty of staff on duty so coffee was quick and hot. Food was excellent and a great variety. Make sure that you have breakfast included in your tarrif. Despite it being fantastic, I noticed that they were charging $38 extra, which is very high for Sydney. Parking is $35 extra for self-parking but as the car park attendant said they were full and to come back after 5pm, we were forced to use valet parking for $45. I think this is a bit of a scam on the part of the privately owned car park to ensure they collect the most from city commuters which they charge by the hour (compared to hotel guests who get charged a flat rate). I would gladly return to the hotel.

A very convenient location. The Amora has a lovely lobby / reception area. We had difficulty with parking - when we drove in and checked about parking - we were told by a staff member we could park our car ourselves for $35 per night or valet parking $45 per night. As the parking station was just next door, my husband decided this would be an easy option. However 30 minutes later he was back at the hotel advising there was no where in the station to park at 12noon Friday. He was then advised that the parking was full for self park. After all this time of messing around he then ended up going with the valet parking. The complications of getting in and out of a parking area, one way streets a week before Christmas was quite stressful. Apart from this waste of time all was very good. All other staff of the hotel were very well informed and attentive. We enjoyed the Bar for drinks during the Happy Hour on Friday afternoon and had a wonderful day. We had a rude awakening Saturday morning at about 7.15am to the loud speaker above our bed with an announement that there had been a blackout and that it could be for some time and to use the firestairs. After this scarey jolt from my slumber, I decided I might as well go back to sleep. Only to be jolted awake again approximately 10 minutes later to the same message (I am guessing) in Japanese. A short time after this another update on the black out in English. I know this is beyond management's control however I am not sure if there is a less intrusive way of getting the message across - perhaps not. After several flights of stairs to the lobby, and finding out as much as we could it appeared that it was going to be power out for some time. We took ourselves off for the day (we had planned on spending the day by the pool on level 3 but were not about to do the stair flight climb a few times). We caught up on a movie, did lots of shopping and got back about 3.30pm to the hotel to get ready for our function out that evening. However, on returning, the power was still out. After sitting around for about 30 minutes deliberating on climbing the flights of stairs, the lights were back on! The staff seemed to handle the contingency plan quite well - I was then informed that this was not the first time they had such a situation. As we headed out for the evening, housekeeping were arriving to make up our room. All staff were excellent in such a difficult situation. We decided, along with quite a few others, to head to the lower floor bar for the Happy Hour only to find it was closed - I guess the black out caused a few complications. We had a good evening out and another restful night - this time no intercom waking us. The Hotel was lovely and staff excellent and I understand this situation was beyond anyone's control, however I do think Management could have acknowledge either a note about the situation under the door or an email to follow up or even a free night's parking as it was an even more expensive weekend than we had planned!!.

Unfortunately, our experience was less than '5 star' and we didn't even make it through one night before we checked out. The room itself was fairly sizeable but felt tired and lacked any real 'wow factor'. However, the bathroom was decent enough with an impressively deep bath. As we explored the rest of the room, we discovered a small, dated tv hidden inside a bulky wardrobe unit to the side of the bed. This meant if we wanted to watch it, we'd have to crook our necks to the side. As we were there for the whole weekend, it wasn't something we wanted to put up with. For a 5 star hotel, we expected a modern tv to be sensibly positioned toward the front of the bed! Not too much to ask really? We went to reception and raised the issue with one of the staff who informed us that all of the rooms were set up this way and the only alternative was a disabled room. We checked this out but it was hardly an improvement plus it felt too clinical and very cold. Subsequently the staff offered us a 1 bed suite but were told that we could only have it if we paid an upgrade fee of an extra $70 per night - on top of what we were paying already! An extra $70 just to have a decent tv in front of a bed????? We didn't think we were asking too much but they would not waive the upgrade fee and only offered to decrease the fee to $50 per night. We certainly didn't think it was worth the hassle and the extra fee. That was the best they can do apparently......... As this was a special weekend for us both and we had high expectations for this '5-star- hotel we decided to check out and check into the Hilton which was down the road. If you can, do go to the Hilton as the service was amazing there! We got a free upgrade to a deluxe room as soon as we walked in and not to mention they have an LCD tv positioned in front of the bed.

The bedroom is showing major signs of wear and tear. The carpet is pretty dirty and stained, the coffee/tea waredrobe too big for the room and it was dirty with sugar split from the previous guest (and whatever else was on there), and the duvet was so smelly and stained I had to leave a note for the maid to change it immediately (something I've never done before but couldn't think of sleeping another night with that sorry excuse for a duvet). The staff however have been incredibly nice about making the changes in bedding, etc so I didn't rate this lower than 3 stars but I do hope the hotel does undergo some sort of renovation to get rid of that big bulky waredrobe and put in a flat screen TV, rip out of the carpets, and change all the bedding. I suggest to have the general manager stay at the Interncontinental San Francisco and sleep on that bed - that will show you 5-star comfort at it's finest.", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cJ.A.N's not Happy!\u201d", "Author": "Marcothepolopony", "ReviewID": "UR48804598", "Content": "Travelled to Sydney for the weekend from the country.

I chose the Amora Jamison based on Tripadvisor reviews and wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Located an easy 10 minute walk from Circular Quay, just off George Street (one of the main thoroughfares through the city centre), the Amora Jamison is a high-rise hotel with great views across the city (though not quite any of the classic Sydney vistas). When I arrived, it was clear that the hotel is used as a stop off for cruise ship passengers before or after a trip - there were piles of suitcases near reception and an itinerary board detailed a schedule of mealtimes and departure shuttles to the airport/quayside. But the door was opened by a smart doorman, and check-in was swift and there were no queues for the lift at any time, so the hotel is obviously well able to handle big tour groups. I had asked for a quiet room and was assigned a lovely, spacious corner room on one of the top floors, with breathtaking views, even from the bathtub (see photo) - though I expect you'd give some of the people in neighbouring highrises a bit of a view if you kept the blinds open! The room was comfortably furnished, with plenty of natural light and a perfect ambient temperature (which was handy, because Sydney was otherwise incredibly hot and humid, gearing up for one of those amazing thunderstorms). The bathroom was big and had a separate tub and shower cubicle. After a night out with friends in Manly, I walked back to the hotel and then slept like a baby - no noise at all from other guests or rooms or traffic (and I'm quite sensitive to noise, so this is important to me). I'd paid for late checkout, which is completely worth it if, like me, you have a late afternoon flight to catch. So I went out for breakfast in the city (my room rate didn't include breakfast, so can't comment on the food there), then had a last wander around before checking out and asking the doorman to hail a cab.

I was a little dubious about the idea of a \"secret\" hotel as I figured that a good hotel would have high enough occupancy not to need to sell their rooms at such reduced rates. All I can say is that I jumped to the wrong assumption! Ok, we were located on the 4th floor with a view overlooking the admin offices of the building next door- but for what we paid, we could not have expected harbour views. The downside of being on the 4th floor was that we did seem to do a great deal of lift riding that we didn't need to. You see, if someone staying on the 27th floor got to the control for the lift before you, then you had already missed the 4th floor stop. It became the joking point for our visit.... We were told by other guests that the views from higher floors were delightful. As far as service went, we found all of the staff exceptionally helpful. Having stayed at other 5 Star Sydney hotels before including the Hilton, I could not fault the staff at the Amora when it came to service. If anything, the service at the Amora was more welcoming than at other hotels!!! The room was well appointed, with a large king bed and a huge bathroom with seperate bath and shower. For those who are particular about their bedding, the Amora offered a \"Pillow Menu\" to ensure that a good nights sleep is provided. Being a Sydney resident myself I was REALLY shocked that I had not heard about the Amora earlier. It is in a great location, with nightclubs close by for those who are looking to party for the weekend, George Street is only a minutes walk away, really the location is very central.

When I realised we'd got the Amora I was intrigued as I'd been here for conferences and business meetings previously. Check in was smooth and quick. However on getting to our room we realised on seeing the bathroom that they'd put us in a room equipped for a disabled customer i.e no bath, large open shower with a bench in it and a specially adapted toilet. I knew my wife was particularly keen on enjoying a relaxing bath before dinner and with this in mind I called down to see if it was possible to change to a room with a bath. I spoke to Natalie (don't know what her position is at the hotel, but assume she was a manager of some description) - she was brusque to say the least. When I enquired if it was standard practice to put people who had not requested a specially adapted room in one, her response was \" well you booked on a Secret Hotel deal\" as if to say because you got a good deal you have to take whatever we dish out! After a bit of umming and Ahhing on her part she said she'd see what she could do - when I asked what that meant she said roughly \"I'm looking, I'm looking!\" She made it seem as if this was a big chore, anyway she found us an alternative room \"It'll be on the 4th Floor though\" she said, obviously expecting us to object, but we're from Sydney and work in the city so the fact that we had no view didn't really bother us - If we'd been from out of town or overseas it may have been a different matter though as the room she found for us (401) was pretty dark as most natural light was shut out by the building opposite. But it was only 1 night and we got the bath we wanted. The Room was nice and spacious but as I say in the title, to be truly 5 star you have to take care of the little details, so the fact that there was only 1 bathrobe in a room for 2 was odd and the bath towels were neither large nor fluffy enough to be called luxurious, plus the position of the tv is weird for viewing. We had a dinner reservation outside the hotel - but had room service breakfast the next morning which again missed the 5 star mark. Bad coffee - I've stayed in plenty of Hotels where they've mastered the art of getting coffee to you hot and fresh. Why not just give you a cafetiere with ground coffee so you can make it yourself - there's a kettle in every room? Also $72 for a very average continental breakfast for two is way too expensive, if we were staying for longer we'd eat at one of the nearby cafe's - but we wanted a treat of breakfast in bed so were happy to wear the cost. I'm not sure if I'd be in a hurry to stay here again, when I book 5 star I expect a bit more even if I've got a good deal on the price.

This felt like more of a good business hotel than a vacation hotel and was located in the heart of the central business district, accordingly. However we felt comfortable there, it was in a good location for us as first time Sydney visitors, and we got a good deal on it through a credit card points program. We were high up, on the 34th floor, looking directly across the street at some office building. At a 45 degree angle we could then see the harbor in both directions, so theoretically we had a harbor view and could see sunrise and sundown but it was tempered by the fact that it also seemed like the people at the office building late could also look into our room so we really had to close our blind rather than leaving it open to view the city at night. If a view over Sydney is important, then take care which direction you'll be facing (not sure if the other directions didn't look into office buildings) or try a different hotel. The room wasn't overly spacious so if you bring lots of luggage you might have to step over it more than you'd prefer. The room has all the needed amenities including real coffee and a French press coffee pot rather than instant coffee. The bed was quite comfortable, and they had a \"pillow menu\" and we got some great down pillows which was nice. We paid extra to have the higher floor and get membership in the club on the 31st floor which included drinks and hors doeurves each evening and breakfast each morning. The breakfast was standard continental fare and not great - we ate it only once and went out the other days. We partook of drinks 3 evenings so we got some value out of it, but I wouldn't buy it again from this hotel.

Well, they are direct flushing toilets and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swirl in either direction. Now on to the review. I had a long stay (12 nights) for business. I got to the hotel room at 10:00 a.m. from the airport. They get me a room even though check-in time is not until 1:00 p.m. My bags, which were taken for me from my cab by the bellhop, arrive five minutes later. Everybody is very nice. My room has a wired internet connection, but the Ethernet cable is missing. I call to get one and somebody was there within five minutes. Other reviews mentioned problems with getting their bags and timely service. I did not have this problem at all during my stay. After my long flight from America, I wanted to clean up, so I went into the shower. A few minutes later, while I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still in the shower, the power goes off. An announcement over the emergency intercom system indicates the power is off in the entire building (aparently they have a back up power system for this). I finished getting ready and walk down 13 flights of stairs. Everybody was very nice about it and they handed out free bottles of water at the bottom of the stairs. While this was not much of an inconvenience for me, I hope it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too much of a problem for a couple walking up the staircase as I walked down who were carrying bags and wedding flowers. Once I got to the street, I saw the power is out everywhere (no traffic signals are working and stores have no power), so you can't really blame the hotel. By the time I got back to the hotel a few hours later the power is back on. Interestingly, one of the reviews I read before I booked this hotel indicated they had the same problem. Some reviews mention the hill on the street the hotel is located. Unless you are in a wheelchair or have severe mobility problems, the hill is not that long and does not pose a problem. The hotel is a short walk (5-10 minutes) from the Opera House area. However, considering how much less expensive this hotel is compared to those closer to the Opera House, it is well worth it. The hotel service continued to be above par throughout my stay. The Concierge takes a lot of time helping me get Sydney Swans (Australian Rules Football) tickets. He is extremely helpful and courteous. The front doors were almost always held open when entering and exiting. Overall, I had no problems with service. This is a VERY nice hotel. I would definitely recommend. However, I think rating it a five star hotel is a bit of a stretch. The rooms are nice but a little bit dated with some wear. The TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are not high definition and are small (not that I spend much time watching TV). While I would still recommend this hotel because I rather enjoyed my stay, I would think this is more a four and a half star hotel and not a full five stars. The price I paid for the room, however, was equivalent to paying for a three star hotel. Thus, the value is definitely there. I did not try the restaurants. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not that much into fancy food, and the reviews from others of the restaurants were not that outstanding. Still, there are plenty of other places to eat in this town. Small drawbacks: only wired internet in my room (although I believe the executive suites had wireless internet); while there are a lot of cabinets, they are very small. I could not find places to store all my clothes. Also, HDTV would be a nice extra, making this closer to a five star hotel. I saw one review complain of the small pool. It was plenty large enough for my enjoyment and I saw plenty of people having a wonderful time. My biggest disappointment was the workout facility. It has two treadmills, an eliptical and a bike machine. It also had a four-way Universal type machine. I know it is not a priority for many travelers, but I think they need to find a way to expand the workout facility to get a five star rating from me. Hint for American travelers using cardio machines: there are 2.2 pounds to a kilogram. You have to input your weight into the cardio machines in kilos. :) Some prior reviews complained about the noise from nightclubs/bars/street.

Plus we got upgraded for free to a King size room with a great view. They are always willing to help with any questions or info you need- I wanted to use the internet for 15 minutes only and they didn't have cards for that short of time, so instead of making me pay extra for time I didn't need, he gave me a code for complimentary internet time.

In the past we typically take such clients to the Intercontinental or Marriot, both near Circular Quay, and on this occasion decided to try the Amora, being a 5 star rated hotel in a similar vicinity. Arriving at the hotel in our car, the Valet service was prompt, friendly and efficient. Check in was also quick, as we had to check in both for our room and for a conference room (Jamieson Club Boardroom) that we had booked for the afternoon, which was on the 31st floor. Room: The room was very comfortable, the bathroom including both a bath and a shower. The room was very clean, no signs of dust. As mentioned in previous reviews, the television was in a very strange location (in a cupboard at 90 degrees to the bed), and was and old CRT style unit. Conference Room: The conference room for 8 people (AU$550 for 6 hours) was a letdown. On the 31st floor, it had views of the adjacent buildings and a few glimpses of the water. The decor was dated, as was the furniture, which was looking tired. During the afternoon a number of flies were buzzing around the room, and I called reception to get them to send up some fly spray. I was advised that an engineer would be sent up immediately. 3 hours later when we left the boardroom for the day, nothing had been sent up. I complained to the reception staff who apoligised, I know this is not their fault however it represented a poor system for dealing with small issues at the hotel. Location: The location is good, but not 'prime' like many of the other hotels in the area. Several of the taxi drivers we used during the stay did not know where it was located, and we had to give directions. The walk to Circular Quay is short, but the hotel does not stand out as a 'landmark' like several of the others in the area. Dining: We dined out both nights, at Doyles at Circular Quay on Sat night and at Sydney Tower on Sunday night. We ordered lunch through room service to the board room during our meeting and it was prompt and delicious. Concierge: The booking at Doyles and a booking for a harbour cruise were handled efficiently through the concierge. On the last day I left my luggage with the concierge and it was also managed efficiently. Price: We paid AU$230 for the Saturday night and AU$205 for the Sunday night, so both nights represented a saving of between AU$60 and AU$100 compared to several nearby 5 star hotels. Valet parking at AU$45 per night was steep compared to others we have stayed at. Lobby / Lifts etc: The lobby was beautifully presented. To use the lifts, each person has to use their key to activate their floor. When the lifts are busy this is an unwanted imposition, as there is only one card reader in each lift, and they did not operate repeatably (with 10 people in the lift all trying 2-3 times to swipe their cards, this is a long process). We stayed in room 911, and when the lifts were busy often I had passed this floor before being able to access the reader and get it to work, which was an inconvenience. I have stayed in other hotels with similar systems but there have always been multiple readers and they have worked flawlessly. Overall impression: The hotel tries hard to be 5 star but seemed a bit rough around the edges compared to the Intercontinental and the Marriot, but then again comes at a lower price. For important overseas clients, I would book them in at these other hotels in future before the Amora. I felt it was good value, and if it was just my wife and I travelling, I would stay here again.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cTop Location\u201d", "Author": "AucklandTorro", "ReviewID": "UR11716208", "Content": "The Jamison is in a wonderful location and we were able to easily walk to shops, Rocks and Darling Harbour including at night to dinner!

The plus points were its location, being only 5 minutes walk from Circular Quay and the main shopping centres, being adjacent to Winyard Station, thereby providing easy access to the airport and that it was clean and well furnished. However it does not have any views of the Opera House or Harbour Bridge, being a few blocks back behind equally tall buildings. However if you are on the higher floors you do get other views of the waterfront. We stayed in a Club Room which was clean, tidy and well-furnished. We also had use of the Club Lounge, which included continental breakfast and complimentary canap\u00c3\u00a9s and drinks in the early evening. If you intend eating breakfast and being around for the early evening snacks, then in our view the additional cost is well worth it. We cannot agree about the comments from a previous contributor about the Club staff. All the staff we met in the Club Lounge were polite, helpful but discrete. They were happy to converse with the customers, but only if you wanted to talk with them. Otherwise in our view they just went about there business. However we did chat to them at some length, which proved to be invaluable through them providing help and advice which meant we got the maximum benefit out of our stay in Sydney. The major criticism I have with the hotel was the attitude of the receptionist on our arrival. We had travelled on the overnight train from Melbourne, arriving at the hotel at around 8:30 a.m. We did not expect our room to be ready so early, but did expect on the basis that we would be spending in excess of AS$1600 with the hotel, that we would be able to make use of the Club Room facilities, including breakfast, before hitting Sydney. However the receptionist was adamant that whilst we could go to the Club Room, we would have to pay extra for breakfast. He could offer no other alternative. Consequently we simply left our luggage with the Concierge and eat outside of the hotel. On the basis that initial impressions matter most, the hotel started off very poorly, particularly when compared with the attitude shown to us by our previous hotel. In our view, Club guests should have a separate check-in, either at reception or in the lounge itself and your use of the facilities should commence from the moment you arrive, irrespective of when during the day that actually occurs.

We did have to wait 1/2 and hour for our room because we checked in early. No worries there. Also when booking, I requested a room as far up as possible because I'm a light sleeper. We were on the 29th floor which was perfect! We even had a little bit of a view over to the harbour. Our room was spotlessly clean, and the bed was super soft. Just lovely to spend a long weekend in! The best bit about the room though was the bathroom. I wanted to take the big, deep bath home with me. It also had a huge separate shower too which was nice. Breakfast was your usual hotel fare with the exception of the orange juice. The have a big machine there that freshly squeezes juice as required - delicious! All in all, I think the Amora is where we will be staying from now on.

All right, sure the hotel has a pretty convenient location, but it is no 4 or 5 star hotel and should not advertise as such. I'd say it's a strong 3 1/2 star, but that's about as generous as I'm willing to be. Since we paid 5 star rates for NYE, I felt we should have experienced at least a 4 star hotel. We stayed on one of the Club Floors and had access to the club lounge, which did offer a pretty good continental breakfast and evening cocktails. I would recommend staying on the Club Floors if you choose this hotel. Buster at the concierge desk also did a great job for us with our NYE reservations. However, like other reviews have mentioned, the furnishings and linens were a little worn, and there's no dedicated bellman outside. Also disappointing was that the supposedly cool bar and restaurant were closed during our 3 day stay, which was pretty inconvenient on new year's day when most of the city was closed down. I'd say that if you can get a good deal on this hotel, it's probably just fine.

At check out I informed the staff that I had tried lots but had not been able to get the mini bar refilled and had used approx $45. They told me it didn't matter and I wouldn't be charged. Because of this I didn't complain about the breakfast (which cost approx $75). I paid for my phone calls (I had a faulty phone or something went wrong disconnecting a call at reception so lost 40mins on an international phone card), and left.

The room had great views (32nd floor), and the view from the bath was a highlight. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've had in a top end hotel, and although the room was small, it was reasonably well apointed. However, there was a problem with cleanliness. There were smudges on the wardrobe and the room was dusty (including the bathroom - not very nice to think that some of the bathroom surfaces hadn't been cleaned in a while). The club lounge was ok, although extremely lacking in atmosphere, even for a hotel lounge. Canapes included a good spread of sushi, dips, cheeses, quiches/dumplings etc. Breakfast was good most days, with a comprehensive range of continental breakfast items, but on Sunday (when the hotel was busy) it was a bit of a disaster - nothing was being refilled so there was hardly anything to eat (this is a good hour and a half before breakfast ended), dish clearing was happening very slowly and there were no tea/coffee cups etc. The club lounge, located away from the rest of the catering facilities, looked like it was basically understaffed at breakfast. The pool, spa, sauna and steam room were nice (not as nice as some others in a similar class in Syndey), but again the cleanliness was iffy. The area looked a little neglected. The staff were generally disinterested, though not rude, and it seemed to take hours to get the room cleaned (we ended up only getting service 2 out of 4 days, even though we left the room for hours from late morning to mid-afternoon every day). My basic impression is that this hotel is understaffed, and also that many staff members are inexperienced - there should NEVER be smudges or dust in a \"5 star\" hotel room.

The room and bathroom were of a high standard and the service was of high quality throughout. Unknown to ourselves, some friends had arranged a suprise bottle of champagne and some other gifts with the hotel staff prior to our arrival and no-one let on, a great acting job by the bellboy who told us later he had been the one to set up the whole thing. Very nice suprise on entering the room and all just added to the friendly feeling we got from the hotel staff. The restaurant was very nice and had a stunning waterfall feature. Breakfast was enjoyed there throughout our 9 day stay. Couldn't fault the hotel, one of the best we stayed in thoughout our world tour. Have to say though that Sydney was a big disappointment, could have seen it in 3 or 4 days not 9.

My husband and I arrived at the hotel around 8 am and they immediately checked us in! We then went to the pool, jacuzzi, steam and dry saunas! The indoor pool has a gorgeous floor to ceiling fountain...it made my jetlag seem to disappear it was so comforting! The hotel is only blocks from the Harbour, Rocks area, and shopping is everywhere. You do not need a car in this city...everyone walks and massive transit is available. Rydges offers a breakfast package and this buffet was exceptionally terrific...homemade yogurt, fresh squeezed juice (the juicer was a large free standing stainless steel one), western and asian options. The room was very contemporary with builtin closets/drawers. Perhaps a bit small but nicely done! The Matilda Cruise came with the package and was absolutely the best way to see Sydney Harbor! I also had a massage at the spa. I favor a traditional Thai massage so I selected an Asian vairety that included several Thai elements. There is also an open food court just downstairs outside the hotel which is great! My husband did the 4:30 am skywalk and absolutely loved it! We also took a Bondi Beach tour which takes you all around the coast line. It is a great way to see all the little towns around Sydney right on the water! We got off at the Bondi Beach stop to have lunch at the Iceberg cafe. This is a member's only club/restaurant for the locals to see and be seen. However if you are just visiting, they will let you into the waterfront restaurant. To become an \"Iceberg member\" you must swim in the huge pool(and I mean HUGE) 75 consecutive Sundays. The service at this hotel was just incredible. The staff was so very nice and accomodating.

I stayed 8 days there. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were very nice (boutique like but not too sterile), and the location was perfect. An easy walk to Circular Quay and the Rocks, easy access to trains, and close to a lot of good restaurants and shops. I stayed on the 21st floor and it was one of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed in. I was there during the week before Easter, so it may have been slow. Cons: Don't expect much of a view. The elevator card system is finicky. On the other hand the elevators were fast and very available. The in-room television internet never worked (there is an ethernet port if you bring a laptop). Pros: The staff is young but extremely helpful. Local papers are a nice touch. The business center is small but rarely crowded. The baths are absolute heaven--deep, quiet to fill (for those late night tubs), and separate from the shower. The amenites are all nice and the minibar is not too overpriced. I normally don't write reviews because I'm always afraid the places I like will become too popular and expensive. Since it may be some time before I get back to Sydney, I felt I had to give the Rydges a big thumbs up. I'd actually like to give Sydney a huge thumbs-up. What a fantastic city. I went there because I'm visiting all of the continents before I get too old to travel (Australia was number 5). Now I'm afraid Antarctica will have to wait because I only want to go back to the land Down Under.", "Date": "May 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "rosky", "ReviewID": "UR5037830", "Content": "I thought this was a great hotel...and in a great location.

My low rating stems from fundamental systematic errors in this hotel including: * Appalling in room television/radio/technology. There was an old, small, black, CRT television. The channel selection was minimal, picture quality average, and inroom movie options unimpressive. It was the position of the television which was the most disappointing. A hotel room (distinguished from a suite or apartment) should have the television placed in the corner of the room or immediately in front of the bed - not in a wardrobe, on a high shelf, to the left of the bed. * Bed and pillows uncomfortable. These are not small problems because they both combine to consume more than 80% of one's time in the hotel. Yes the hotel was clean, yes the service was good, yes the bathroom was fantastic. But all of that is insignificant when compared to bed and television facilities.

We used the taxi service from the airport to the hotel which cost $30, returned via the train, which cost $24.( 2 adults, 1 child- free) We booked a Park Suite for the three nights we were in Sydney....we wanted a seperate lounge area so we could put our daughter to bed without disturbing her. The cost per night was $330.00 which included their buffet breakfast. Our daughter stayed free. Portacot provided free. The room was picture perfect, the king size bed being so comfortable. My daughter and I enjoyed the seperate bath, especially me after a long day sight seeing.There were tv's in both rooms and plenty of space in the bedroom wardrobe to hang all our clothes. While this hotel may be only 4 stars it was excellent indeed. Staff were very friendly, no request was a hassle. They even prepared our daughter a meal to our requirements, that wasn't on their childrens room service menu. We only checked in on the pool and gym area, we had hoped to return but Sydney sights took over most of our days...there is so much to see and do. Housekeeping was regular and polite. Location as I said was great, we attended a comedy show in Newtown and being able to use the train service was cheap and easy. We walked everywhere and with a stroller getting to circular quay, opera house, and the rocks was easy. The bus stop for the Sydney Explorer was across the street and up about 200m, McDonalds across on the opposite corner from Jamison St. and the 7eleven 200m down from there. We found Rydges to be all we needed.I would stay here again and recommend it to those who don't require harbour/opera house views. Our bedroom window looked into offices but the blind was there for privacy and at night the drapes were pulled, our lounge window looked down onto Wynard Park...being on the 13th floor was quiet, I did hear the sound of sirens one night, but they probably could be heard from a lot of rooms. As we had breakfast included we used this service....very nice but pricey if you were paying. Under the hotel, mon - sat is many places to grab a meal..I think its called the metcentre and it is amazing...everything you can imagine, bakerys, fresh seafood, roasts, fruit, takeaways....so there are other choices. Sunday we did circular quay, its a buzz with cafes. We dined one night at Rydges Charr restaurant and the meal was divine. Hubby had the wagyu beef while I had King Island...both cooked to perfection, very trendy place to eat....nice and cosy.
