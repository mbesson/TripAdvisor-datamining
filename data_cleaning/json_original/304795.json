Very friendly and helpful staff. Great views from the terrace where you have breakfast in the morning - also open for guests to relax in and have a drink in the evening. Breakfast, which is buffet style, is very good and substantial. Some rooms a little small, but clean and comfortable and absolutely fine for our needs. At the time of our stay (summer 2011) they were renovating the first two floors (the upper floors in which we stayed were already renovated) and the reception lounge - should have finished by now and will be very nice I'm sure. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but who wants to eat in a hotel when there are so many wonderful restaurants all over Istanbul serving some of the best food we have tasted? If you want a lot of space and a swimming pool, this hotel isn't for you, but if you want a comfortable, friendly, clean, convenient base for exploring both the modern and historical aspects of the city, the Galata Antique is perfect.

The hotel is in an absolutely perfect location, right around the corner from the Tunel Sq. funicular stop and also the modern metro. It is very easy to get into the Sultanahmet/Old City area via public transport. We actually found ourselves primarily walking to the old city by way of the Galata Bridge which made for an interesting way to explore the neighborhood. It is about a 30 minute (very scenic) walk to the Blue Mosque/Aya Sofya/etc. The reason why we stayed in this area as opposed to Sultanahmet is because we were looking for a good place with lots of nightlife and we sure picked the right spot. The hotel is about a 2 minute walk from Istiklal St. with innumerable bars, restaurants and shops. This is definitely a less touristy area than the old city and seemed to be much more lively at night with plenty of live music and comfortable places to have some drinks and meet the friendly locals. So, aside from the location, the actual hotel was a very pleasant place to stay. Our room was a bit small but it was very clean and cozy. It definitely made a good home base for sleeping and taking a break after a long day of sightseeing, which is exactly what we wanted. The staff was very nice and accommodating and made us feel at home from the moment we arrived. There is a free breakfast every morning on the rooftop with a great view; the breakfast itself is okay, nothing spectacular but plenty of coffee, tea, fruits, jams, bread and usually sausage or eggs. I only have one minor complaint about our stay at the Galata Antique. The hotel has free wireless access however the reception is quite bad. We had no access from our room and had to use wireless from the lobby, where the reception was also poor. This was definitely not a big deal but it was a minor annoyance. All in all, this is a great little place with friendly staff, clean rooms and a wonderful location. I would strongly recommend considering this hotel if you are planning on staying in Istanbul.

Galata Antique Hotel was an obvious choice, with its close proximity to the Galata Tower and we weren't disappointed, particularly in view of the very reasonable price we paid for a delux twin room for three nights. The actual room was spotlessly clean, with a very elegant marble bathroom which still provided all the essentials. The hotel also has a period charm, having been built as a private home in the 1880s, so it has its occasional quirks and oddities. One floor was being modernised during our stay, but this didn't really affect our visit - there was no noise or dust evident. The top floor breakfast room offers very pleasant views and the buffet breakfast was pretty decent too. The staff were very helpful and the front desk guys were especially willing to provide local information, maps and advice.

The amenities are not A-1 and the rooms might be considered small-ish if you've never been to a European style boutique hotel. We stayed in two different rooms - one was quite comfortable and the other was a little tighter, but both were clean. But, IMHO, you are in Istanbul to see the sights, not to hang out in a hotel. The ease of getting to any historic/tourist areas is unsurpassed. You can walk or take public transportation everywhere very easily and cheaply.

The room was so tiny that we've had difficulties on moving in it. There wasn't any closet but only a really small metallic horizontal hanger for our clothes and 3 tiny drawers. There wasn't any hairdryer (which is unadmittable for a boutique hotel) and when we asked the receptionist to provide us with one, he kept on saying \"yes, don't worry, I will give you one\" but never did, saying to us the last day that he couldn't find any. Our room (we were 2 in it) was provided only with 1 small bottle of bath soap and 1 of shampoo, which have NEVER (!!!) been replaced despite the fact that we've sleeped there 3 nights. We've had to ask them to provide us with new ones. Inside the shower a block of tiles was missing and you could see the building's tube.

The breakfast buffet was okay. My only minor criticism was that although the staff truly wanted to be helpful, they were just not that well informed about the locations, hours, giving directions, etc. about things we wanted to know and do.

As others have said, the location is perfect. I do strongly recommend staying in the Beyoglu (north of the Golden Horn)part of town. There are lots of restaurants -- chic, traditional, cheap and everything in between -- and the area at night is filled with people so it feels quite safe. Public transportation is very convenient and you can easily get to the more touristy part of town during the day. The breakfast at the hotel was fine, a standard Turkish breakfast (cheese, olives, bread, jam), and the breakfast room had a wonderful view. I liked the ambience, which was more old/traditional than most of the other mid-priced hotels in the Taksim/Beyoglu neighborhood. DRAWBACKS: the rooms are tiny and it is difficult to maneuver around the bed/furniture. Most bothersome was a smell in the room: it was more than musty -- almost like a broken toilet. And it wasn't just our room. The first room we were shown had that smell but because it had twin beds we asked to be changed to a room with a double bed. Even though the second room was on another floor it also had the smell. My 3 stars are based on the price (good for the neighborhood but more expensive than comparable hotels in the Sultahnamet district), location, and charming ambience. I'm not sure I would stay here again, however.", "Date": "May 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stroud, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe best thing is the location\u201d", "Author": "Kasim", "ReviewID": "UR21678366", "Content": "We chose the hotel because of it's location. In this respect it was excellent. Room and bathroom were small but perfectly adequate and I got a very good deal on the price anyway, so can't really grumble. There is a roof terrace which gives great views across to the old city and the Galata Tower. The staff are friendly and the rooms are clean. The noise of the city starts quite early in the morning which could be considered a drawback by some.
