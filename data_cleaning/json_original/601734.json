The breakfast was fantastic when we stayed there. The pool was also nice, and it's a very short and safe walk to all the good restaurants of Seminyak.The spa treatments were good, but you can hear all of the noise from the pool, so that was a bit annoying.All in all, would definitely recommend this place.", "Date": "Oct 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR371717524", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "meaty729"}, {"Content": "Mutiara a very great stay       inside the room", "Date": "Aug 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR600046117", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pytheos90"}, {"Content": "Great for the price Overall I had a very satisfactory stay at the hotel. It was very, VERY QUIET. However I did encounter a few problems. The first problem I had w/the hotel (it is not a resort in my opinion -- more like an inn) is that I booked a room with king/queen bed, but when I checked in they informed me that I had to pay extra for it. I didn't want to argue and I didn't want to pay the extra charge, so I got a room w/2 singles in it. I believe that this is a standard ploy that the hotel does a lot because I did read a similar complaint in another review.Rooms are just as pictured. Keep in mind that in the bathroom there is no separation between the shower, toilet  sink. It is just one room that contains it all -- so you can choose to sit on the toilet and have a shower if you like.The Mutiara is very close to Seminyak's restaurant district -- a few minutes walk. And the staff at the inn is very accomodating; they drove me to most places I needed to go. Another plus is the pool -- it's a bit small but BEAUTIFUL. You may have to rearrange the lounge chairs if you want to sun bathe though. I didn't try the 'spa' because Seminyak is known for their spas so I went to off-site spas.The in-house restaurant is okay. I just ate there for the complimentary breakfast which is okay. I recommend the Balinese breakfast.Would I stay there again? Maybe. There are LOTS of 'resort' hotels in the area; but as I said earlier, it is a good inn for its price.", "Date": "Jul 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR420871779", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mdizon"}, {"Content": "Excellent value At US$40 / nite (Superior room) including breakfast, Mutiara was really great value. Smart, well kept, sizeable rooms. Pool that's large enough for laps. Huge cosy lounging area next to the reception with free wifi access. Tucked away in a peaceful lane away from the bustle of the main roads, yet walking distance to the beach (10 min) and eateries on Jalan Oberoi (5 min). The only arguable drawback about Mutiara (by which I'm referring to the hotel, not the adjacent villas which I didn't inspect) is its design and furnishing. It looks and feels like any generic modern beach resort, with bare traces of traditional Balinese architecture or furnishing. If you want to feel like you're in Bali, this is not the place for you. But if you're just looking a convenient comfy peaceful accommodation, you probably can't do better than Mutiara. It was fine for me since I stayed there at the end of my trip, when I had sufficiently experienced Bali and just wanted somewhere decent to stay.", "Date": "Jun 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR673962820", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "gloop"}, {"Content": "Spacious Villas We started in the villa part of the property.We rocked up at reception with no booking and the property manager gave us an excellent rate.
