It's a five-minute walk to the Blue Mosque and Haghia Sofia and everything within the old city is in easy walking distance for a reasonably fit adult. There are loads of restaurants, cafes and shops in the area. For those who like to have alcohol then it's worth checking that your restaurant does serve alcohol because many restaurants won't, particularly in sight of mosques. It's not a luxury hotel but it's clean and has everything that you need. The staff were amazingly kind and helpful. The breakfast buffet is a bit of a bun-fight but that's not the fault of the hotel but more an observation on the combination of people and buffets. The buffet is predominantly continental with a leaning towards Turkish produce which given that you're in Istanbul is pretty much what you'd expect. Fresh bread, cheeses, eggs, olives, yoghurt salad etc. Someone mentioned the hard beds which really worked for me because that's what I prefer. I slept really well apart from during the enthusiastic call to prayer early in the morning. But you're in Istanbul and never too far from a Mosque so it's an added bonus to your trip.

The ceiling in the room had a very large water stain. The furnishings were very very old and dated. The biggest issue I had however, is how misleading the website is. I booked a triple. The picture was of three single beds. When I made the reservation, I was assured that is what I would get. What we got, however, were two single beds and a roll away bed. The roll away bed had a mattress that had absolutely no life to it. You sunk down to the bed frame. Just awful! They claimed they were full and couldn't accommodate a move. The terrace is not at all what they lead you to believe on their website either. It barely holds a table and a few chairs.

A cute little park is located right down the street too which you can walk through to get to the water. Very close to the Grand Bazaar and Spice market. Also easy trip to the Asia side, just a 30 Lira cab ride. We were placed in the premier part of the hotel for one night which was great, but asked to move for the remaining three nights which was a hassle. When we asked why we were put into this position, the 'concierge' if you could even call him that was extremely rude and unhelpful. He told us that the reason we had to switch because in the room we previously book a women had been sick with a stomach bug. I told the man that this was poor service and a. he should not tell paying guests this about a room they are about to move to and b. that we would appreciate it if he could either let us stay in the first room or put is in a room where someone wasn't sick the day before. He was extremely rude to us and told us basically there was nothing he could do as well as failing to make us feel comfortable for our stay. The rest of the weekend we felt awkward walking into the hotel lobby while he and his staffed starred at us without uttering a word.

The location is absolutely perfect and within a very pleasurable walk to most sites in the historical centre of Istanbul.

The staff was very professional and forthcoming, going out of their way to accommodate even the smallest requests. By way of example, they negotiated a more convenient arrangement with the airport pick-up service and managed to sort out a rather inconvenient misunderstanding. The staff also even mailed me some forgotten items all the way to London, free of charge (thank you, Mehmet!). This attention to detail really goes a long way and it's actually the main factor in my decision to return to this hotel the next time I am in Istanbul. The rooms are not very big, but they are extremely comfortable. The beds have high-quality mattresses with Egyptian cotton sheets, which makes for a very restful sleep. The heating/air conditioning system is highly efficient, which is a great plus in the smouldering summers or freezing winters of Istanbul. The bathrooms facilities are basic, but clean, reliable and well-maintained, while the toiletry basket is always amply replenished. The only thing I would mention is to avoid the last room on the first floor, as it is next to the service door (which gets slammed quite a bit in the morning), as well as to the maids' room (who occasionally smoke there).

The air conditioning was broken - although no mention of this was made at the time of booking the room and, in fact, the air conditioing unit had prolapsed through the ceiling panelling slightly.

I lucked out with the weather (usually snowing and freezing) and had some mid 50's temperatures and mild days. The city was fantastic and Sarnic Hotel was a great bargain in a great area. I went with a friend from Ireland who travels frequently as well. We didn't want to spend a lot and my general rule is boutique hotels for 90 or less per night. I first researched the area of Sultanehmet(sp?) and saw that it was the place to be to see a majority of sights that Istanbul has to offer in a short amount of time. The Sarnic hotel was in a great location, literally a block away from the Blue Mosque, complete with the call to prayer about 5 times a day (sometimes at 6:30 AM) which was fine with me because I thought it was lovely. We had the windows shut because it was cool out so it didn't wake my companion up, but I can imagine in the summer it may be louder. However, that was the only loud sounds, the area was quiet at night with some restaurants and bars, but nothing too touristy that create a raucous. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the owner and given a much need complimentary Efes beer ( I like to think of it as the bud light of Turkey, but a lot better). He immediately got our bags to the room and pulled out several maps and tourist brochures. I was at first apprehensive, thinking \"We just got here, and hes already trying to sell us something\". However that was not the case. He opened up a map of the area and showed us where we were, and where all the sights were and gave us a good idea of walking distance and times to go. He then showed us all the brochures of things to do such as different tours, the Turkish baths, the dinner/dancing shows and explained the differences between all of them. There was no pressure at all and after strolling around the city with people left right and sideways trying to sell you things, it was a nice change. We ended up booking a tour from the Hotel and he arranged the pickup and everything, we literally just pointed to the one we wanted. Our room was on the smallish side, but that was due to an error I made when I was booking ( I only put one person in the room!) It was clean, the sheets were changed everyday and the bathroom was completely refurnished. I managed to peek into some of the bigger rooms and they were even more plush and newer then the one I had. Because of the timing of our trip we weren't able to go on to the roofdeck but I can imagine it boasts amazing views of the Blue Mosque and Sultanehmet at night. Also, there is a restaurant bar in the basement which is great and quiet. There were always a few older men lounging around and the staff there were very friendly and eager to help. It was nice to be able and unwind with a drink after walking the city all day or before heading out to dinner. All in all a great experience. If you are on limited time and budget I would completely suggest Sarnic. The hospitality cannot be beat. Also, there wasn't an elevator.

Taxis are not that expensive. Sometimes I ask the hotel to get me a tame taxi and go for about 1.5 hours to the Black Sea beach.

A big issue for us was our luggage - we wanted an airport shuttle that could accommodate our 6 pieces of luggage. I contacted the hotel ahead of time about it - they said that they would not be able to give us free airport transport because we were not booking through their website. This was fine, I e-mailed the manager back saying that we would pay the 20 euros, and asked what other information was needed for our pick up. He replied saying someone would meet me at the exit door in the airport. After our 12h flight, we arrived in Istanbul around 6am. We came out of baggage claim and there was no person waiting for us. We waited for 30 mins, then asked information. They said they had no record of anyone coming for us. I called the hotel on a pay phone and the receptionist said that they had no record of our hotel pickup. At first he didn't seem to believe that I had reserved it, then I pulled up the email that the manager had sent me and read it word-for-word to him over the phone. He then said that we could come on another taxi service because their car was unavailable. The taxi that he suggested said that it would cost 70TL (32 euros). I complained to the receptionist about the price pointing out that it was their fault that no one was there to pick us up. The receptionist then talked to the taxi guy down to 50TL (23euros). I complained again saying this was still more than what we were supposed to pay and it seemed unfair for us to have to pay more when it wasn't our fault in the first place. He then told me that they would reimburse us the difference. I told him that I felt that if this had been any other hotel, the would offer to bring us for free to compensate for our inconvenience, he said we could talk to the manager. After arriving at the hotel, we were told that our room was not ready yet and we could go eat breakfast while we waited for our room to be ready. After waiting an hour, the manager finally finished eating breakfast and was ready to speak with us. He said that they would not be able to reimburse us for the transportation and that we had booked a single room and since we are two people, we would have to pay 20euros more per night. I pointed out that the reservation said that we would get a king size bed which was fine for the two of us; he said this was not possible and we would have to pay the extra 60euros for 3 nights. Defeated, we went to our room. After an hour in the room, it was so hot that I was sweating. We couldn't figure out how to turn down the temperature, it seemed to be centrally controlled instead of by the device in teh room. We called reception who said that they would send someone to look at it. An hour went by, no one came. I called again, different person picked up, and said they would send someone. Stlil no one. Finally, we flagged down a maid and gestured that it was too hot and she brought us a fan. It was still too hot. On our way out of the hotel, I told the reception again to please take a look at our thermostat. When we came back that night, I asked on our way up if they had looked at it; they said yes, to go up and check. It was still way too hot, but we gave up on telling them and just made do with the fan. Throughout our hotel stay, I felt rather uncomfortable whenever I was in the lobby of the hotel. I felt like the receptionists kept giving me sidelong glances, as if they needed to keep an eye on me or something. I'm not sure why this is; maybe they just don't see that many people of South Asian descent around Istanbul. I've traveled pretty extensively and have never encountered this overt type of behavior before. This part may be in my head, I just wanted to mention it in case you are not of Caucasian descent. The last incident I want to mention was the morning of our departure. I asked the receptionist (a new one that I had not seen before) if we could check out and wnated to confirm that our car would be arriving on time. He totaled the transportation cost + the cost of an extra person staying. Then, I told him that we had been told that the difference in transportation from our arrival was supposed to be reimbursed. He did not even let me finish my sentence and said \"NO, this is not possible.\" I insisted that this agreement had already been made, and to ask the guy that had made the agreement who I saw at breakfast that morning. After he denied my claim several times, he finally called the guy and then after speaking to him said that the difference was \"only 5 TL.\" I told him that I knew it wasn't much but it was the principle and my hard-earned money is valuable to me no matter how little it is. For the rest of the transaction, he was rather rude to me; I didn't feel like a customer at all, I felt more like he was doing me a favor by letting me stay at the hotel. He asked me 3 times if I had used the minibar, and after i said no literally 3 times, he sent the bellhop up to ask me again and to check the minibar. This receptionist then drove us to the airport himself in a van. At first I was thinking that maybe they didn't want to reimburse the money for the cab because they hired another company, but then when I realized that it was jus ttheir own van and they could have easily driven us for free as an apology for our inconveniences, this made me more upset. In conclusion, I am sad to say that I would not recommend this hotel to a friend (especialy if they are not Caucasian). I saw how the people at this hotel treated other tenants and I truly felt like there was a difference. I am not the type of person that is hypersensitive to this type of thing (as I mentioned, I have never experienced this before) so I don't think that it was in my head. I am especially inclined to think this after reading all the wonderful reviews in comparison to my disappointing experience. I just felt they didn't care about making my stay good; maybe they don't want me to recommend them to my brown friends. As far as cleanliness, location, and breakfast; these were all excellent. The issues mentioned are the only negative things I have to say.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MAINE", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Staff at Average Hotel\u201d", "Author": "withliberty", "ReviewID": "UR100336726", "Content": "This is essentially a 3-star hotel with 4-star staff. I booked through Orbitz at an unbelievable rate during off-season ($85/night in a perfect location including breakfast). I'll start with the \"needs improvement\" parts, but conclude that - overall - I was very pleased with the value for the price I paid. Note that if you book through Orbitz, complimentary shuttle is not included, but is still well worth the 20 Euro. My driver was supposed to greet me holding a sign with my name. He was late by 20 minutes. I went to Turkish Airlines and they phoned the hotel, but a less seasoned traveler might be a bit more distrubed. I arrived near midnight and there was no welcome drink at this time of the night. King room has a king-sized bed, but with two twin mattresses put together. It was \"extra firm.\" There was construction going on every morning outside my window at 8 am (no problem for me; I'm an early riser on vacation, but forget about an afternoon nap). The rooftop bar was not open during my stay even though it was the beginning of spring and I thought temperatures were perfect. Again, no fault of hotel - there isn't enough traffic to support serving a single guest. Also, I ordered something at the restaurant and was told I could not charge a beverage to my room. That seems like it would be the easiest thing in the world to coordinate. Finally, the cleaning crew left my trash there for the entire stay. Good thing I didn't order fish sandwich to go... Now for the good news - the staff is truly excellent and will ensure your stay is pleasant. Continental breakfast was satisfying, free wi-fi, location could not be beat, hot shower every morning with all the necessary toiletries, and - while I've mentioned the worst parts - none of these had any major impact on my vacation.

We used the van service the hotel offered to go back to the airport. It was inexpensive, and Ozcan was a great tour guide during the ride.

We've just flown home and while the experience is fresh in my memory here are my comments: Good aspects - Great location: we were 5 minutes' walk from the Blue Mosque. Also the barman was friendly and even though the roof bar was shut, he would open it for us and serve drinks there - and it's an excellent view. Bad aspects - (a) The taxi from the airport was arranged for us specially by the hotel. It was a private booking but they then tried to include other people who were going to multiple city locations. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what we had paid for and it would have added a lot more time to our journey. We protested and they eventually relented but it was very unprofessional and somewhat embarrassing. Then the second taxi from the airport (some of us flew in a day later) was driven by a driver on crutches using a specially adapted vehicle and although we were obviously sympathetic, it was worrying especially when he spent time on the phone while driving. Then on the return trip to the airport, the driver didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know where the new airport (Sabiha Gokcen) was located - he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the motorway despite us pointing this out to him (presumably to save the toll) and we ended up overshooting it and returning towards Istanbul. It looks to me that the hotel simply called up some low-budget drivers for this booking but for 174 euros I feel we were entitled to a much more professional taxi service. (b) We had been promised nice rooms with a view from the window but instead one of our three rooms was Room 305 at the back - very hot and looking out onto a building site and waste ground. Worse still, the heating/aircon units and the backup generator were right below the window so when the power failed (every day or so during our trip) there was an enormous noise and also diesel fumes and smoke that came in through the window. If you tried to minimise this by shutting the window the room then became very hot. It was a real Catch-22 and this sounds like the same area of the hotel as for the earlier review dated 2 Dec 2009. (c) When we got back to the hotel about midnight one night the power failed just as we walked in so the receptionist found an unreliable torch and walked out to the construction site to switch on the generator. We then heard a crash and a scream so we ran through to find this poor man had fallen 6 feet down into a hole in the ground left by the workmen. No other hotel staff were present so we had to stand by and help him dial for ambulance and firemen and we hung on there for about an hour till they arrived and took over. We also had to clamber over a very narrow plank to turn on the generator ourselves, following his instructions. It turned out he broke his leg in the fall and he was probably lucky that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t killed by hitting his head on the concrete and glass slabs of junk out there. This construction site is absolutely lethal, the most dangerous location of its type I have ever seen. (d) We insisted that the hotel move three of our group out of Room 305 but they said that the only options would involve two smaller rooms for which they wanted to charge us several hundred more euros. There was no apology for the sub-standard room (the manager said he thought the room was just fine) and no gesture of gratitude for our help with the accident. Only by calling the Istanbul Tourist Police ([--] in case you need it) and threatening the hotel with a report to them and the Ministry of Tourism did we finally get a reduction in their proposed surcharge. To summarise: the people who run this hotel come across as friendly but they are actually only interested in making as much money from you as possible. Also their attitude to basic safety standards is simply unimaginable by any normal standards. For these reasons I would never ever return there. PS. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read the hotel management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reply to the 2 Dec 2009 complaint and I expect a similar \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reality denial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will appear here in due course.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cWell located, comfortable, safe.

The Sarnic got positive reviews on Trip Advisor, and I'm pleased to say that for the most part the stay was very good. The location cant be beat. You are about 5-10 minutes from all the big sites, and a main tram station to go anywhere beyond that. There's heaps to do and lots of spots for a coffee, tea, or a meal. There's even a Starbucks within walking distance, great for all of you coffee drinkers. The rooms are small and simple, but comfortable. There's a flat screen TV (slim pickings on stations though), a minibar, air conditioner, etc. The bathroom had a great shower with amazing water pressure, however it did leak and make the floor wet. Just a minor gripe however; I'm sure if we mentioned it to the staff they would have taken care of it. But we returned so exhausted each day we didn't want to deal with a repair guy or potential room switch, The staff is very nice, and quite helpful. The ride to and from the airport is a great convenience, even for 20 euros. If you book via their site they will pick you up for free. They also have perks like a free breakfast and wifi with great speeds (8 megs). In the end, I would definitely stay here again if I went back to Istanbul. Recommended. Pros - Locations, cleanliness, helpful staff, free breakfast, airport transportation, rooftop bar with a nice view, free wifi.

Fortunately, I decided at the last minute to move to another hotel for the last two nights in case I didn't like this one...which I didn't. It is a very small, family run place so if you're looking for a place that excels in customer service or top notch hotel service, don't stay here. This place is tiny! The lobby could hold maybe 6-8 people at any one time but nobody was ever in there. My room was a single, as I traveled alone, and it was really small. Not a big deal necessarily, except the bathroom was so small you couldn't even dry off after showering. I had to take the towel and dry off in the room. The showere door wouldn't open all the way without hitting the sink. The room was hot!! The guy who brought up my bags told me to just change the thermostat to cool and it would be fine...it wasn't. I woke up sweating throughout the night. I asked the front desk person why it was so hot and he said they had just switched the day before from cool air to hot air in all the rooms. So basically, each room does not have it's own temperature setting. I had to manage to jam a wooden clothes hanger in the window to keep it propped open so I wouldn't overheat. I also had a TV which was a cheap, old, 20 inch set which would not turn on even though I checked to make sure it was plugged in. Then there's the view. My window overlooked the back of the building which consisted of a maintenance yard surrounded by a wooden fence. I couldn't believe the view was as repulsive as it was and there was no warning by the front desk people to try and at least temper my expectations. I had seen pictures of a nice rooftop bar and restaurant but it was closed during the evenings since it was getting a little cool. However, even if it was open, there were only about 4 or 5 tables up there. They did some nice camera work on making it seem like it was a nice, open dining experience. Overall, this hotel experience for me was pretty lousy and with so many hotels to choose from in Istanbul why choose this one. Location was good but I stayed at the Pierre Loti for my final 2 days which had a very similar location and it was a lot nicer. Do not stay here. Use a travel agent if you are traveling internationally and don't have a lot of experience (like me). Oh, one last thing...I am an American who lives in an Islamic country so I'm used to hearing the loud calls to prayer 5 times a day from the minarets attached to the mosques. There are over 2,000 mosques in Istanbul and some are very, very loud especially if you're not used to it. However, in spite of this hotel I really enjoyed Istanbul. I just think it's very important that at the end of a long day of walking, shopping, and sightseeing that you should have a decent room to go back to and relax.

The hotel was not a large one, which gave us the feeling of cosyness. The rooms were clean and Ok in size. The staff of the hotel were extermely helpful in getting us oriented in the city. Since we wanted to travel further in Turkey, they were kind to help us research how we can get to our further destination and made needed reservations. This was great since none of us spoke Turkish. Another pleasant thing was the hotel offered us a free pick at the airport and that was pretty cool. When we arrived in Istanbul, we could see the guy standing with the sign with our names at the exit from the luggage area. Breakfast was quite nice: mostly European continental breakfast , but also with some Turkish touch to it: feta cheese, olives and tomatoes. One night we managed to go to the bar at the top of the hotel - it's worth while going up - the view over the water is great from there. The only negative thing that I can think of is that there is no elevator in the hotel and it might be a little bit challenging for someone to go up or down with the luggage. Since we were travelling together with my 75-year old father in law, it was important for us that things were within the walking distance, and they surely were. The hotel is situated right in the middle of the historic district of Istanbul - Sultan Ahmet. It is very close to the Blue (Sultan Ahmet) Mosque and Agiya Sofiya Mosque. There is a smaller bazar, which was about 5 minutes away from the hotel, where we could shop for some carpets and beautiful turquoise jewelry. So, if I go back to Istanbul, I would defintely stay at this hotel once again.

I walked back and forth at the arrivals lounge,and never saw him. Finally,another van driver was looking for a passenger,so I accepted his offer of 25 Lira to the hotel. When I went into the lobby,I told the manager no one was waiting for me and he proceeded to contradict me. The other driver,who had brought in bags, confirmed this. I asked for a refund for my ride,no answer. Then,the room I requested on the first floor was NOT ready,at 12:00 noon. So I sat on the sofa in the lobby until it was. It was small,and the view was over a construction area,noisy from 8-6.

The magnificent view,promised in the website info did not make up for the pain in my knees. The food was ok,nothing to get excited about. same menu all ten days,tomatoes,cucumbers,pastries,tea and coffee. The restaurant was closed for renovations. The good part of the stay was that all the main tourist attractions were a ten minute walk up the hill and around the corner. I could see the Blue Mosque from the terrace. The constant stream of traffic though,tour buses,cars and trucks,from morning til night,was annoying,as it is the only entrance to Sultan Ahmet square from that approach. I expected some traffic problems,but this was awful. The wonderful array of shops and restaurants made up for it though.I found a wonderful little \"meyhane\" where roasted meat and fish were on the menu,very good prices and service. Just across from the hotel on the other side of the street.I also found a delightful gift shop next to the restaurant,and was able to buy a lot of beautiful original art works and ceramics,and lucky enough to meet two of artists,who gave me two of their pen and ink drawings as a thank you for buying other pieces.Even though the hotel had some problems,for value and location,this place is a good choice for staying in Istanbul,a city where rooms can go for $300-400 a night in some big,impersonal hotel.", "Date": "October 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cOur Home in Istanbul - The Sarnic Hotel, Sultanahmet\u201d", "Author": "Tinathetraveller", "ReviewID": "UR20919400", "Content": "My first stay at the Sarnic was in 2001 for five nights when I was on a study tour. The hotel was so lovely I had no hesitation in booking for my husband and I to stay five nights in 2008. The hotel not only lived up to my past expectations of 2001 but exceeded them. My husband was equally as happy with the Sarnic. Where should I start to provide fellow travellers with detail? In the words of real estate agents \"location, location, location.\" From the comfortable rooftop bar you can see the busy Sea of Marmara in one direction and the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia in the other direction which are in walking distance. Also in walking distance are the Basilica Cistern, Topkapi Palace, the Archeological Museum, Grand Bazaar, The Arts and Crafts Centre, Arasta Bazaar and Cemberlitas Bath. The street Sarnic is located in has turkish carpet shops, craft shops, number of restaurants, including a wonderful Pizza and Pie Restaurant across the road. The surrounding streets are full of lovely shops and restaurants. The Sarnic is a charming hotel. It has a lovely lobby with a bookcase with travel guide books not only on Turkey and Istanbul but on neighbouring countries. Most rooms are upstairs accessed by a spiral staircase which adds to the character of the hotel. For guests who are not so nimble there are rooms behind the lobby and breakfast can be served in their room if they wish. Breakfasts are served in the rooftop restaurant and are a mix of traditional Turkish and Continental. I loved the dried Turkish figs and apricots with yoghurt, then cheese, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, eggs and bread. The bread was beautiful and fresh from the bakery. For those who prefer cereal that is also available. The cherry juice was delicious and a wonderful kick start to the day. Beautiful fresh pastries with cheese were also served (I loved these with the sweetest tomatoes you will ever eat). Our room was very comfortable, clean and roomy. The airconditioning and the mini bar both worked, an important detail for us. The bed and bath linen were fresh and of a high standard. I add these comments because when you have stayed where the bed and bath linen are shabby this becomes important. Finally, I leave the best to last - the wonderful, helpful and friendly staff of the Sarnic. Nothing was too much trouble for them. They helped us with booking our tours which were good quality tours at reasonable prices. We were so glad we booked through them our Gallipoli Tour. They were attentive and friendly all the time. When we had to leave both my husband and I were very melancholy. We wanted to return to our home and family in Australia but we had made new friends who we would miss. We now consider the Sarnic our home in Istanbul and would have no hesitation in recommending it to our family, friends and fellow travellers. We look forward to visiting our home in Istanbul sometime in the future.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cDecent price, plain rooms, good service\u201d", "Author": "OffTheBeatenPath", "ReviewID": "UR20885670", "Content": "The Sarni\u00c3\u00a7 Hotel is a good, basic hotel if you want to stay near the Sultanahmet Mosque and Hagia Sophia but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rent on a few nights at the Four Seasons. For your \u00e2\u201a\u00ac90, you get about what you'd expect for that in Western Europe. Time Out Istanbul made much of the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former affiliation with the Four Seasons, but don't be misled: it has rubbed off in terms of service but not in terms of the physical accommodations. The best part of the hotel is the accommodating service. They arranged for airport pickup with our reservation (free), and helped with restaurant reservations and the return trip to the airport (a reasonable \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20). The manager gave a long list of restaurant and tour recommendations when we arrived, although he assumed we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done no research on Istanbul before arrival and his suggestions were skewed towards very touristy options. The other outstanding feature of the hotel is the view of the Sultanahmet Mosque from the breakfast room on the fourth floor. Breakfast itself was adequate, although a bit scaled back on Sunday. The rooms themselves are clean and have basic furnishings. (The room photos on the website are accurate.) In our room, we had really odd, small windows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one at floor level and one at ceiling level. The duvet, bed, desk, and table / chairs were fine although not plush. The TV in our room appeared to be a decoy. It did not work and was never fixed while we were there (but we didn't raise a big fuss about it, either). The bathroom had all the necessities but the layout was again odd. Although it wasn't necessary to do so, they chose to put the toilet directly in front of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c blocking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the door to the tiny shower, requiring contortions to get in and out of the shower. Overall the bathroom was clean and the tile looked relatively new although there was some mildew in the grout in the shower. In general this is not a hotel for handicapped patrons -- the bathroom would be impossible to navigate. There is no elevator and there are steps up from the street, steps from the lobby to the rooms, and the breakfast room is on the fourth floor. Avoid the rooms ending in \u00e2\u20ac\u015301\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they are directly on the stairwell, so you hear the lobby, everyone coming and going, and all the breakfast preparations. Rooms that face on the street (like the 01 rooms) will have a fair amount of noise, as the street looks small but has trucks going by most of the night. \"Wireless network\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sounds good on the website, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work so well in practice. In theory it exists. You may be lucky enough to connect for two whole minutes at a time before it drops you, but it's so slow that you won't be able to download a single webpage in those two minutes. Staying in Sultanahmet is great for access to Hagia Sophia, Sultanahmet Mosque, and the Grand Bazaar. But we found we had a long ride home from dinner in Beyo\u00c4\u0178lu, where we ended up most nights to avoid the mediocre, overpriced tourist places which are the only option in Sultanahmet. Some of the cab rides were an adventure, though, so we didn't mind too much.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brazil", "Title": "\u201cThe best staff!!!\u201d", "Author": "AndradeBrazil", "ReviewID": "UR20823178", "Content": "The staff from sarnic Hotel is wonderful, we felt like we were at home!

Most descriptions published at Tripadvisor before were matching the reality. Hotel is nice, clean and in a perfect spot for all major sightseeing highlights of Istanbul. There are plenty of restaurants with roof-top terraces around (e.g. Doy-Doy around the corner -nice view) where you can get a good dinner for 15 Lira per head. We got a pick-up from the airport for free (due to the length of our stay) that worked well even though our flight was delayed by over an hour - going back we went also with them (20 Euro). The disadvantages are the size of the room (it is impossible to unpack the suitcase as the wardrobe has only a view hangers and no shelfes), where it is difficult to place the suitcase - but it is perfect if you are looking only for a bed to sleep-in and not a room to stay-in. The breakfast is autenthic, but after 3 nights we would have appreciated a little more variety. Also currently is a construction right next to the hotel and also opposite the hotel. It didn't affect us as we got up always around 9, but be aware that you might have some noise starting around at this time in the morning. Also a nap in the afternoon might be impacted by construction noise. We also got recommendations for tours and restaurants from the hotel. They are all very touristic and high priced and can be done by yourself - e.g. went to a recommended fish restaurant were we paid 40 Euro per head - food and service was really excellent, but compared to other good food for 7-10 Euro per Head a little too much.
