A must go!!! We just got back from a awesome time at The Royal Suites Turquesa. This adults only resort is one of the best going right now in our opinion. Its it own resort with restaurants,pools, private beach and etc.... ans you get to use all other Palladium Resorts and they cant use yours. We stayed in a honeymoon suite and we were treated fantastic. You have your own personal butler that's makes sure your stay is fantastic right down from your own request on what you want in your fridge to them making of your restaurant reservations. The beach i would rate one of the best i have seen. We have been to a lot of adults only resorts and this place is by far the best we have been too. We will definitely be back!!!", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR707430551", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "gerryb12"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Place to Stay!

The airport in Punta Cana is a wonderful, traditional open air airport. From the start you are put into the tropical mood by getting off the plane by walking down the steps onto the tarmac. The open air airport really gives you a feel of going back in time. Domincan clad ladies greet you and take a picture as you arrive which you can purchase on your departure for 8.00 US. We were then off to our van to be on our way to the resort, this drive was about 20 minutes or so. We were early but were given our room about an hour after we arrived so we went to have lunch at the El Behique beach buffett. Upon arrival the resort is breathtakingingly beautiful. After lunch we were assigned our rooms. Our freinds and us both got ground floor rooms which was dissapointing at first but we came to love not having to trek up the marble steps every day after a long day at the beach. They put us down the hall from each other which was very convienient. We had several issues with our room, it was musty and I always read this on your site and think the people are just being picky since it is a beach resort that you should expect it but this place really was musty. We found that our air conditioning did not cool to a proper tempurature and my Husband addressed this with the front desk 6 times and it was never resolved but we made do. We left our key card in the slot so that it would run all the time and it made it bearable. Our freinds room was fine and there air kept there room very cool. Our lighting was weird, you had to have the lights on at the sink to work the light in the bathroom area which was alright except for in the middle of the night when you would get up to go to the bathroom. Other than these issues everything was great and we could have changed rooms the next day but I did not want to bother with packing up everything again just to move. Our only negative issue was the food. We have been to many resorts all over the Carribean and this by far was the worst food I have ever had at any. I can not pin point if it was the style of the food or just the food itself. There were not many American's there. Most of the people were from Europe so maybe they were catering to the tastes of them but we really did not enjoy it at all. We basically only liked the Italian restaraunt, we went there 4 times and hit the pasta bar at the buffetts also. The guys would only eat pizza and french fries closer to the end of our two weeks because they had major bathroom issues. Nobody got actually sick in our party but it did go straight through so take your pepto and immodium. Breakfast was pretty good since you could get pancakes and waffles and french toast. We hated the coffee, it was way tooooo strong for us and like I said before this was just our preferance, the Europeans loved it. My freind and I took advantage of the spa on one day and were dissapointed, it was more like a gym inside a spa. You had to share the two large jacuzzies with other people although they will include them in your spa package like your getting a private jacuzzi soak and the massage was good but other than that it was not really worth taking time out of your vacation for it. I would opt for a massage on the beach instead of using the spa itself. Nobody speaks English at this resort so most of our issues may have spanned from not being able to get across what we needed or wanted but you really cannot complain about that since we were the minority and there are so many languges these people would have to learn to please everyone there. I would say the majority would be Spanish and French. There were some German but not many. All in all it was a nice stay, the jacuzzie's in the rooms were nice. The beach was just heavenly and this saved the whole vacation for us. We have never seen a more beautiful sky or beach or large palm trees. The grounds are gorgeous and everything is very pretty. The good thing is none of us gained any weight on our vacation so this actually worked in our favor. The sports bar is really nice and we also took the Saona Island tour which was awsome and we highly recommend it. Go and have a great time!!! Book the Suites though if you want more romance and quiet since it is an all adult beach/pool. Our pool bar was the best! It was well worth the upgrade.", "Date": "Jun 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR304233236", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "AllieR"}, {"Content": "Had a wonderful time My husband and I just returned from our trip to Punta Cana. We stayed at the Royal Suites portion of the Grand Palladium and were very pleased. Here are our thoughts....feel free to email if you have questions about any of the palladium sections. we did a lot of walking around and comparing. FYI-DON'T PUT ANYTHING EXPENSIVE IN YOUR CHECKED BAGGAGE - yes, it seems obvious but we did and unfortunately, by the time we made it back to texas, we realized our camcorder was stolen. the airline has been really nice working with us, but it still stinks.Biggest perks about royal suites compared to other parts of the grand palladium: no kids, guaranteed direct access to the beach/pool and view of the pool, free internet and premium liquor, access to royal gourmet restaurant...overall, generally less crowded with a more mature group of people staying thereBiggest negatives (compared to other parts of the Palladium): the location. most of the a la cartes and the theatres are in the bavaro section...all the way on the other side of the complex. though you could walk it, it might take a good 30 min or more to get over there. there is a tram that stops by the rooms, but it's often full and even then, it takes a long time to get to where you want to go. ______________________________________For those who want more specifics.....Beaches: Fabulous! Probably some of the best we've ever visited. Weather was great and the water was really clear. Yes, you have to play the 'towel game' and reserve a spot at the pool or the beach, but we never had a problem with this. There was always some place on the beach open (and there aren't really any bad spots) or at the pool. Food: we thought it was really good, but we also had realistic expectations. it's similar to what you would find on a cruise. We thought there were plenty of options, and for the most part, we could always find something we liked to eat. We ate at the Royal gourmet, japenese, spanish, and seafood places. They only one we would not give a positive review was the seafood. the service was lacking and slow, not enough menus, the food was way over salted, etc. Plus, even though the lobster was considered 'all-inclusive' at the royal gourmet, it was $33 here. Rooms: We were in the royal jr suite and felt it suited us perfectly. i don't have any complaints. The minifridge was restocked every day, the rooms cleaned every day, we were on the first floor with a balcony facing the pool, we had a jacuzzi tub, a sitting area, nice tv, safe, etc. Activities: we chose to mostly sit on the beach...beautiful and quiet. we went to the shows every night, and though often very cheesy (uh - can we say michael jackson show)...we were really entertained. we went to the spa one day. that was great and the staff was very professional. we went parasailing...way overpriced. wouldn't do it again. we paid $30 to take a boat taxi around the ship wreck, we thought that was pretty cool. we went deep sea fishing with mike's marina. though it was fun, turned out to just be an expensive boat ride because we didn't catch anything. One thing to note....the place shuts down pretty much around 11 unless you want to go to the disco (which was lacking).Tipping: couldn't quite figure this out. we tried to throw down a couple of bucks when we could (like at the restaurants, bars, and spa). It seemed like the only people that expected it were the people we were doing the 'activities' with (e.g. the parasailing and deep sea fishing).Hope this was helpful!", "Date": "May 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR656911927", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mo1279"}, {"Content": "Nothing \"Royal\" about it After reading many positive reviews for the Royal Suites, we were very excited to book our 7 night vacation. We were not impressed! The beaches in Punta Cana are about the best you will find! That is about the only positive I can say about this trip.This Grand Palladium complex is enormous, and is geared for a european crowd. At the gift shop/supermarket you cannot find a single publication in English. Not a newspaper, not a magazine! I would say there was approximately 95% German travelers. No more than 2% were english speaking. The food is, at best, mediocre. The one meal that was excellent was the grilled lobster Sunday evening in the Royal Gourmet. We also tried the Asian and Mexican. We did not enjoy either. Buffets were not very good either. Both variety and selection were lacking. The Royal Junior Suite we had was really nothing special. Room was kept acceptably clean. We tipped the maid several times throughout the week. Nothing special was noticed, not even a simple towel animal The bed was terrible, and the pillows worse! We had to ask three times over the course of a day for extra pillows before any were brought to the room. Furniture was old and in need of replacement. Mini-bar was serviced only after requesting at the front desk. It was then stocked with warm beverages. We had to then travel back to the lobby to find cold beverages, which we did for most of the week as the mini bar rarely had anything in it! We thought the way the toilet and shower were laid out was very odd. They were simply like two closets with glass swinging doors on them, with open space on top and bottom. The toilet provided little privacy. The pool area was very nice, but the pool was always in need of a cleaning, and was also in some disrepair. Wood foot bridges over the pool were in need of paint.Loungers were nearly impossible to be had in either the pool or beach areas unless you played the 'towel game'. Even then, we had loungers taken on two occasions when we had towels on them. We heard about a fight on the beach over this. Ridiculous!! We also found some of the loungers to be broken.We found the service to be hit or miss. Mostly miss! Along with the pillow and mini-bar issues mentioned earlier, restaurant service was no better. Table set-ups were many times missing silverware. Asking for coffee several times, being repeatedly told it was on the way, and then never getting it. Having to go to the bar to get your own drinks during dinner because your waiter never comes back to check on you. I could go on.Punta Cana has become an extremely popular vacation destination. The amount of people traveling there has increased greatly in the last few years. The Punta Cana Airport is already undersized, and very inefficient. Lines were incredibly long and disorganized, with no one to offer direction. Out of six or eight security stations available, two were open. They just haven't figured out how to deal with large crowds. I just can't understand how so many reviewers can say this is a great resort. Were we just there on a bad week? I don't think so.We have traveled extensively in the Riviera Maya of Mexico, as well as several other Caribbean destinations. There are much better resorts to be found.But, as they say-To each his own.This was our third trip to the DR. Once to Puerta Plata, twice to Punta Cana.

In general I would say simply: when you take the same target another or more times, you know how to have your enjoyment there.In our case the answer to many times question is very easy, because we`ve been and seen to some other resorts also in Punta Cana Playa Bavaro area.1) Grand Palladium Resort is large enough for 1-2 weeks vacations (4 hotels, about 12 restaurants, lots of bars), works well and is a well-maintained nature beach paradise. 2) Royal Suites Turquesa is just for us: - peaceful relaxation, - good food and drinks, - spacious beautiful seaview rooms with jazucci in/outdoor, - own pool with swim-up bar (thanks to Danny, Santo) - personal contact with the kind personnel- good service with nice humor3) We especially liked the Royal Gourmet Restaurant, which was new to us. Thanks to Juan, Ana, and many others for taking care of our needs.4) Royal Suites Turquesa recepcion and lobby is a nice place for spending your leisure time with newpapers, internet access and good drinks. Thanks to Edward, Daniela, waiters and all others for good services. 5) Newly opened Renova Spa is just in front of Royal Suites. 6) One of the best things in my mind is that the hotel management is all the time doing a good job to keep the wheels rolling.7) Finally, as I have heard the resort is continuously developing for our next trip, and so we have started to plan our next trip to Royal Suites.Have a good vacation wherever you travel, but be aware where you are going to!Frequent travelers from FInland Europe", "Date": "Apr 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR885761571", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kukkoka"}, {"Content": "Royal Suites - der absolute Kracher !!!       weiser sandstarnd des hotels", "Date": "Dec 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR477352333", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "arthur24"}, {"Content": "Excellent   showReview(22212717, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR907205102", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vacdereves"}, {"Content": "insuperable   showReview(21946587, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR202010085", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "loapuntas"}, {"Content": "10 Tage im Paradies   showReview(20531633, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR695770665", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "petersbest"}, {"Content": "Nos defraud\u8d38   showReview(20396762, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR427879285", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "NOA9"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147293-d1005302-r22698004-The_Royal_Suites_Turquesa_by_Palladium-Punta_Cana_Dominican_Republic.html", "HotelID": "1005302", "Price": "$338"}}
