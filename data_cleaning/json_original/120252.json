We reserved 3 nights and checked out by the 2nd night. I rated it a 1 but it is definately a ZERO star. Why? 1. Bad smell in room 2. TV didn't work 3. Towels were dirty 4. Bed was dirty (We had to go to walmart and buy a blanket because it was too gross to sleep on) 5. Floors were filty (I had to wear shoes because it was so sticky) 6. Pool was green 7. Walls were dirty 8. The smell of the room made my clothes smell bad 9. Hardly any water came out of the faucets 10. Did not feel safe 11. Worst hotel I have ever heard about or stayed in 12. No hairdryer, phone, alarm clock, iron 13. The description says it has a fridge and a microwave....IT DOES NOT. 14. All of the furniture was ruined and/or chipped Unless you don't mind all of this, stay here. We transferred to Springhill by Marriott and it was $30 more a night...WELL worth the extra money. The Marriott made us feel like royalty compared to Gold Star.

Compared to Hyatt or Marriott it might be decent but it's a good place to stay at night nonetheless. I got a double bed room, the room was very clean, beds were made, bathroom was clean. I love how spacious the room is compared to a lot of other better names hotel. The towels are clean, the bathroom counter is long, great for women since we have so much stuffs. There's a table and a chair in the room which is perfect if you have business to do. The A/C unit is fine, no loud noises. There's a microwave and fridge included which is one of the reasons I chose this hotel. Other hotels would have charge a $10 fee a day to have just either the fridge or microwave and $20 for both. It's a bargain. I got the room for $25 a night, couldn't ask for more.

We stayed there for 5 nights and the only problem we had was maid did not show up to clean. On our third day, on our way out to go eat dinner I had to go to the front desk and ask for clean towels and toilet paper. Receptionist at the desk was surprised the maid hadn't been to our room. By the time we got back to our room the towels and toilet paper were in our rooms. Also the next to the last day we were there my daughter had to be rushed to the hospital, she pulled a sciatic nerve in her back in the shower and could bearly walk. I went to the front desk to ask where the nearest hospital was and the manager was so helpful he went on his computer and printed out directions for me to the nearest hospital. I was extremely greatful for this as I was a nervous reck as it was. Next time I saw the manager he asked me how my daughter was. I thought that was very nice of him.

For one thing I have to say that even though it is located right in 192 (Irlo Bronson), you have to be sure to ask for a room located in the left side of the property (facing lobby) because on the right there is literally nothing (just forest). This made it really creepy and give a feeling of unsafety. First room we got was on right side and key chain was broken (creepy). On the other hand staff is the best (specially Daphne and manager). We asked for another room (to the right side) and they had no problem. They even treated me vey nice the next morning when my wife asked me to go to another hotel (wife rules my home).
