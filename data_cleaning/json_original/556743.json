{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Hotel, good location Great 'Small' hotel, located within easy reach of Kuta main shops etc (5-10 mins walk) but in a more peaceful area. The hotel will also offer to give you lifts up to the main shopping area if you don't fancy the walk.Hotel staff were all amazing, couldn't do enough for you and offered advice about the area and things to do when asked. Rooms were large and fitted with everything you needed and cleaned well. I would highly recomend this hotel to anyone wishing the nightlife of kuta but also the peace and quiet of being just outside the main centre.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR734177015", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "masg"}, {"Content": "Loved it !!       large bath", "Date": "Jun 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR663835470", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "patsou"}, {"Content": "Insecure In-room Safe My husband and I had an otherwise wonderful stay in Bali, but we were sad to discover that a thief had broken into the in-room safe (at either this location or the affiliated hotel Kupu Kupu Barong) and stolen over 10% of our cash in various denominations in various currencies. So: Travelers Beware!! Don't keep cash in the in-room safe. If you must leave cash there, count it before and after you come back. As far as the usual things people write reviews about: our stay was otherwise excellent. Wonderful rooms, wonderful service -- far better than we'd ever before enjoyed. The beach part was under construction, but was otherwise nice to look at. We took advantage of the ride they provided to an alternate beach; it was quite disappointing -- the beach had a lot of shells on it and the water wasn't clear. The food at the restaurant Ma Joly was consistently good or great, especially the fish. We had the gindara (butter fish) twice. We were especially impressed by the fact that they spontaneously hosted a mini-birthday celebration for my husband. Since we hadn't informed them of the fact, they must have noticed the date on the passport.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR302445876", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AutumnR_NY"}, {"Content": "Wonderful experience       Great view from relaxation area", "Date": "Sep 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR388552712", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RMDJakarta"}, {"Content": "Not our Scene       Mini Suite Room", "Date": "Sep 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR371771105", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Laguna-7"}, {"Content": "Drop of Heaven...

The Sandi Phala is a very good deluxe hotel with great rooms and amazing bathrooms with huge bathtubs (very romantic for couples...). It's extremly comfortable and the design which blends traditional asian decoration with a modern touch is absolutely superb. Moreover, rooms are incredibly spacious and it's an advantage for extended holidays.This hotel is great for the benefits offered to the guests: a very good breakfast included in the rate (in room service as well), an afternoon tea with succulent pastries, L'Occitane amenities and a high quality personnal assistant service.The staff is really nice and each employee will try his best to make your stay memorable. Cleanliness of the room is remarquable and it's unfortunately not the case for the towels (I prefer not comment what's happened with one of the towel in my bathroom but it was quite dirty...).

From the moment we encounter this place, we were swept off our feet. From the staff to the accommodations, to special honeymoon treats, we were so well taken care of. We had planned to stay for only 2 days and then move to another part of the island, but we just kept extending our stay, because we couldn't bare to leave. The Guest Personal Assistants made sure that all our needs were met, regardless of the hour. I loved it so much I'm planning to return in January. We had moved from a posh hotel in Nusa Dua to Kuta looking for something a little different, and if you are in the mood to be pampered, come to Sandi Phala. We were never treated like just another guest, like we were in the other hotel. All the front office staff knew us by name. In the end it was very hard to leave the Sandi Phala to return home.", "Date": "Aug 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR230047184", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Vanessa18"}, {"Content": "Quiet Piece of Paradise in Bali We decided to give the Sandi Phala a try despite the lack of any reviews because the description sounded great with a very small number of rooms and a quiet setting.

The hotel is wonderful, very secluded layout and you almost can imagine you are there by yourself at times. The room we stayed in was spacious, relaxing and very well appointed.
