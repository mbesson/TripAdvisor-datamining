When we returned that evening, we found three dead cockroaches in the livingroom area. This problem should have been addressed before we occupied the room!

I was worried about using the jacuzzi tub because I didn't know how well it had been cleaned. I bought bleach at Target and cleaned it myself. On a positive note, the pools were very clean and great for the kids. The rest of the grounds seemed very well landscaped. I would probably stay here again, but in a different area.

For us, since we were not staying at a Disney property, the location of this Resort was a huge plus. We stayed in the North Village and it was a very quiet area. By contrast, the West Village area seemed quite busy when we were checking in. The two bedroom condo was comfortable and clean. The screened-in porch with screen door access outside was nice, though there was a pile of cigarette butts just outside the door, which should be cleaned-up in my opinion. The \"backyard\" of the condo we were in was part of one of the golf courses. The golf course was lighted for night play, which I thought might be annoying if you were trying to go to bed, but it really did not cause any trouble. I'm not even sure when the lights go off - we were all so tired after spending every day in the parks we didn't really care. It also made the stay unique. I mean, how often do you see a lighted golf course? The course was not busy and my youngest son and I had some space to throw the football around. We did not use any of the pools while we were there, but did have some food and drinks in a couple of the pool areas. The pool areas seemed nice and the food and drinks were tasty. Check-in was easy, though once we checked in they did hit you up for the timeshare sales, which we declined and were never bothered again. The resort was clean and well maintained. There was no maid service for the week (although I believe you can request room cleaning for a fee), but it did have a washer and drier, which allowed us to pack far less for the week. The condo kitchen was very minimally stocked (nothing at all in the pantry or fridge so they probablty clean out anything that is left by prior vacationers). Fortunately, Target and Walmart are close (Target was right across from the resort) and there is a Publix (grocery store) that is right at the entrance to the resort, so there is no problem getting what you need to stock your condo. We did not take advantage of many of the resort's amenities and used the place as a convenient and cost effective place to stay off Disney property. It was perfect for that purpose. From what I could tell, I imagine that you could have a wonderful stay here if you wanted to use it as a \"destination resort\" with golf, swimming pools, food, activities, etc. It certainly appeared to have everything you would need for that purpose too.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ballito, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cTime to renovate\u201d", "Author": "Claudio F", "ReviewID": "UR128155968", "Content": "Stayed at this highly recommended resort for the first time - in a time share unit.

(Tip to avoid 192 traffic use 429 $1 toll but cuts out any delays) The resort is groomed to perfection with constant manicuring of lawns, golf courses etc........ The East village was perhaps a little quieter than some of the other areas but that suited our needs. We had a beautiful view over the golfing tees and decorative fountains.

Still a beautiful place with excellent check-in staff who want to please. We checked in a half hour before assigned time, got our key, went to our room only to find the room a nasty disaster from previous occupants. After driving 16 hours, we were grossed out and stunned thinking once this room was cleaned, it would be ours for the week. The front desk gave us a new room only to say many visitors check out late and according to her computer, that room had been cleaned (?). She graciously found us a new room in West Village near tennis courts. The room was welcoming with most lights turned on and a/c at a comfortable temperature. The room had an odor i was able to bear being as exhausted as i was but the 2bedroom was very spacious for the four of us. First stop, the bathroom. On the floor were hairs and not just long black ones but the other type too. I cleaned it but the floor looked like it hadn't been mopped. Neither did the kitchen floor. Im not even sure the carpeting throughout was vacuumed. Walking around the building while the cleaning staff were in the rooms, not once did i hear a vacuum running. The sales tour/meeting lasted 3 hours for us and we kept saying no thanks. To check in, you need to present your license. I have been to so many timeshare presentations and this was the first. We only went to the presentation for the 2 passes they give for unlimited use of the bungy jump/slide/floats for lazy river/mini golf. I felt I needed to get them. My girls are 13 and 14 and went down slide once and the bungy jumping seat hurt. Floats are abundant, you can find them on side of pool once in awhile if you really want one. They played mini golf once. Not worth the three hours for us. Finding a lounge chair was a nightmare at the lazy river. Signs say \"no reserving with towels\" but ppl do it. We would get there right at opening and towels were on every chair. Not the resorts fault.. not sure how else they can handle that. There are other pools on the resort but most families with kids want to be here especially with the free unlimited passes being given out for attending a presentation. Daily activities are listed throughout the resort but the staff should do more to get kids involved in doing them. Several times, my girls would show up to do an activity and nothing came of it (teen beach volleyball game/teen night/soccer kick to name a few).

Our son travels with us, he is 6 now but we have been bringing him since he was 1. For the most part we stay on the resort for our entire stay as there is plenty to do here. Usually do just 1 park a year. Expect the pools to be busy and although the rules state you cannot reserve chairs it happens ALWAYS. Be prepared to get up to the pools by early-mid morning if you are looking for a particular spot. It is stated that coolers are not permitted but we always carry in a soft cooler with drinks and snacks and never have a problem. i have read reviews and would have to say that the negatives are few and far between. We travel with other couples who agree this is the place for a family vacation. Traffic on 192 can get busy but it only took us 10 minutes to get to Animal Kingdom this past week. Its like anywhere else the traffic can change due to holiday and such. If you are not interested in buying a timeshare do not go on the tour. you will be there up to 2 hours and they do not give up.

We also found that some of the bedding was missing, so I called up front desk, flagging both my disappointment with the room and also asking for replacement bedding. I was given short shrift - there were no other rooms available \u2013 yes, Holiday Inn Vacations at Orange Lake had allocated a Platinum guest paying the top rate the worst room on the property. They did however manage to deliver the replacement sheets in about 10 minutes, but even so this should never have had to be raised as a problem. The following call saw a volley of calls between myself and resort services, with the excuses as to why I had that room allocation getting more comical by the minute. \u201cYou should have requested a pool view/high floor when you booked\u201d. \u201cYou should have asked at check in whether it was an accessible room\u201d. \u201cYou checked in on a Thursday \u2013 Friday, Saturday or Sunday gives you more choice.\u201d To make the parking lot view better, they don\u2019t have curtains/drapes at the windows (they have some non-functioning ones in the lounge). So at night as guests come back from a long day at the theme parks, you get a steady stream of headlights sweeping through your bedroom. And one kind soul decided to park up outside the unit and leave the headlights on for a good 90 minutes just after midnight too. Getting nowhere (all they would offer me was a round of minigolf, which finally got moved up to $40 credit to spend in resort) I elected to refer the matter to Priority Club as this is the crux of the issue \u2013 they allocate the most loyal guests the worst room. This in turn elicited a call from the Resort Manager himself but despite promises that someone would get back to me, I\u2019ve heard nothing. I also tried to spend the $20 voucher I\u2019d been given on arrival as a thank you for my loyalty \u2013 my young son wanted to play golf so this seemed a sensible solution. Driving the not inconsiderable distance to the West side of the property, I was aghast (although perhaps shouldn\u2019t have been) to find out that my voucher was only valid as part credit for either a 1 week pass for various activities on the resort or a discount off some theme park tickets \u2013 none of which we intended to visit on our stay. The property is awash with nuances that may be perfectly well known to frequent guests and owners, but left me repeatedly puzzled. They have happy hour at the bar but the first I knew about it was when I went to buy a drink (no signage). 5 years and under don\u2019t pay for the activities like golf and the river tubes \u2013 didn\u2019t see this anywhere. There\u2019s also a great habit of not enforcing rules that the resort make up, especially regarding the use of the pool (bringing own alcohol onto the deck, inflatables and reserving lounge chairs). Oh, and despite my request in advance to not get timeshare sales pitches (we already \u2018won\u2019 in the area, I received three. This place could be truly great \u2013 the grounds are lovely, the rooms are by and large well set up and perhaps if you\u2019re an owner the experience is altogether different but if you\u2019re a paying guest, I\u2019d suggest giving this place a wide berth.

(We previously stayed a half-week in March 2011.) The traveling party was my wife and I and our 6 year old son, who loves to swim. River Island was the ideal place for us, with two pools connected by the Lazy River. Being spring break week, the pool area was crowded and it was difficult to find a chair at times. However the experience is great and we could see that it was being enjoyed by folks of all ages. My son's favorites are the two \"squirt gun houses\" along the Lazy River that shoot approximately every 20 seconds. On the last day we tried out the pool at the North Village, which had an in-pool basketball hoop, volleyball net, and a small water slide. That was also a hit, especially the water slide. (We picked up a waterproof case for our digital camera prior to this trip, and that was a great investment!) Amenities include the wi-fi internet which is included, a flatscreen HDTV in the living area, and an extensive selection of cable/satellite channels. The kitchens had the necessities, and the appliances, dishes, and cookware were in good condition. The units were also cleaned well and the common areas were also clean and well maintained. Being a timeshare/resort, there are the typical annoyances that folks have come to expect and tolerate. We did get \"the call\" - the dreaded invitation to the sales pitch - and unfortunately it woke us all up at 9:00 AM after having arrived late the night before on a delayed flight. Once we said no, they did stop calling though. There are some nickel-and-dime charges, such as tubes for the lazy river -- although I think it was taking it too far when an overzealous staff member decided to proactively take away previously-abandoned from children (of all ages) who had found them and naturally started playing with them. Perhaps they're within their rights to do this, but bringing my son and others to tears by practically yelling at them not to touch abandoned tubes just was not cool at all. (Fortunately this only happened one day, and the other workers we encountered were pleasant and helpful.) As for the location it's right on US-192 so you're going to be instantly sitting in traffic no matter where you're trying to go. We do not visit The Mouse but Orange Lake seems very close and convenient if you're going there... however, if you spend time in his Kingdom you're missing out on the pools and the many other things to do at Orange Lake!!

First the positives...lots to do onsite for kids. Pools seemed clean and common areas were also well tended to. The units in the East Village were big enough for four adults and gave us plenty of space to spread out. The pool in the East Village was nice and quiet for the adults and was well taken care of. The check in process was a lot easier once you ask them not to call your room for any reason and avoid the timeshare pitch by just telling them you are not interested and be stern about it. We had no problems but we were on the offensive about it after reading all of the other reviews and having stayed there before. Now the negatives. On check in the safe was locked and we had to wait to get it opened before we could leave the room. We also had a room that smelled badly of smoke. AND Yes they have BUGS and they don't seem too concerned about it. I called and informed the front desk that we had roaches in our bedroom and they offered to send someone in the next day to spray. They were so big I took pictures. We have someone with asthma who had already had to go through having our room sprayed because of the smell of smoke so we asked to be moved. They said they couldn't do that. It was late at night so we went to bed with the lights on. The next day we realized the dishwasher wasn't working. By the end of our stay the toaster didn't work either. It is an ok place for kids because it is close to the parks and the restaurants very close to the resort. The worst part of the whole resort is the crazy prices they charge. $9.00 for a tube and you can't share it with anyone. They have you put a wristband on and if you give your tube to a friend they will take it from them. Doesn't seem logical that they say they make you use their tubes for safety purposes and then don't let you share it??? They also charge you about $9.00 to play miniature golf...the $25.00 arcade card we had lasted about an hour with two people playing on it. EVERYTHING COSTS EXTRA. If you truly want a great experience try the Wyndham Bonnet Creek resort. It was right on the Disney property, had shuttle service that ran consistently, the units were spotless and well stocked, and they didn't charge for all the extras. I hate rating this place so poorly because we own there but they really have to stop ripping people off. It is much cheaper at Bonnet Creek and they tend to maintain their property much more diligently. I see lots of follow up on other poor reports from the Orange Lake Management team saying that you should report the issues...we did. They didn't care. I understand it is Florida but I stayed at Bonnet Creek and didn't see a bug inside my unit the entire time I was there.

The reservations person at the toll free number was exceptional in the way she explained all of the different options -- the pros and cons of each village etc. We arrived at 11 a.m. and checked in -- but weren't permitted to go to our room as it wasn't ready. That was okay -- we left to go to a baseball game then came back at 4 and the room was ready. My only complaint was that when we checked in, they said they would call us and tell us our room number when it was ready. That call never came. I ended up calling them and they told us it was ready and gave us the room number. (Not sure why they didn't do as they said they would and call me). Anyways, as someone else has said, it's quite a drive to get in the resort area to your room. It is really a huge place. We never really left the River Island area, but just looking at the map, I can see how huge the place is. In all other respects, I found check in to be relatively efficient. It wasn't really explained to us that our \"villa\" was just an apartment. That's what it looks like -- a 4 storey apartment building. It's not a \"villa\" at all. We were a little disappointed at that. Don't use the word \"villa\"; it is deceptive. Once we got inside (up the elevator and down the hall) to our room, we were pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious (we were told it was 1280 square feet -- it didn't feel quite that big) and the furniture was decent. The appliances in the kitchen were functional, somewhat dated, but I wouldn't expect stainless steel top of the line appliances in a place like that. The fridge had an automatic ice maker, which was wonderful -- it would have been nice if it had been switched on for our arrival. The kitchen had lots of dishes, pots, pans, utensils etc. Very well stocked. We only ate breakfast and the occasional sandwich in our room. We didn't cook in it. The decor was inviting and pleasant. Nice artwork. There was a breakfast bar area, with stools, in addition to a fairly large kitchen table with a bench and chairs. The living room had a large sectional couch, which had a sofa bed and occasional chair. The living room tv was a flat screen. The lighting was excellent. I hate dark hotel rooms. The deck, off the living room was large, had a light and ceiling fan and furniture. It was covered so you couldn't sit out there and tan. Also it was enclosed by a screen, as all of the decks were. Not sure why. Obviously some resort decision. At the entrance way was a large closet with a washer and dryer, plus a few packets of laundry soap (no fabric softener). They were great. We used them a few times. Very nice to have them in your room. To the right of the entrance was a bath -- which you can get to through the hallway or the second bedroom. Both bathrooms had a great lay out. They were large and had lots of places for storage. Lots of shelves. Also, both baths had a separate room for the toilet, which is also great and makes it more functional. The second bedroom had two queen beds (or maybe doubles - I 'm not sure), a tv (not a flat screen), a closet, a few lamps as well as overhead lighting and a ceiling fan, a dresser and a table between the beds. There were hangers in the closet. I appreciated this. Across the suite,on the opposite side of the living room was the Master Bedroom and bath. This bedroom was slightly smaller than the other. It had a king bed, dresser and TV, closet with hangers, chair and ottoman, desk and chair and two bedside tables and lamps. The Master Bath again was well organized. The only difference between this one and the other one was that in addition to there being a nice glass shower, the Master Bath had a jacuzzi tub (which we never used -- we hardly use the one we have at home). Outstanding parts of the suite: the lighting, the windows, the window coverings, the bathrooms and the air conditioning (it was very hot out but the A/C worked great!) Unimpressive - that there was no housekeeping and I wasn't told this when I booked in. I don't think I was even told this when I checked in. The time share push -- I was literally accosted by one of the employees as I left the check in desk. They ask if you have a few minutes and don't tell you what it's for. I am usually a sucker and am usually pleasant to these people, but we were getting late for a baseball game, and we literally had no time at all. So I walked away. She ripped off some part of my check in package -- something to do with the $20 incentive. Let me tell you this -- if you want me to take time out of my day to go on a time share tour, you are going to have to give me more than a $20 incentive. In fact, I would need probably at least $500 to make it worthwhile, so leave me alone!! I was not told this was a time share place and that we would be bothered like this when I booked in. There should be full disclosure when you are booking in that you may be asked to consider the time share option. They did call our suite later in our stay, which upset me. We had already said NO to the time share tour. My husband told them No and at least they did not call again. I now turn to the grounds and facilities. The grounds, generally speaking were nice. We didn't golf but the golf course looked great. The parking lot was satisfactory. The pool area was dirty. I don't know if there were just a lot of dirty people or what? I did see workers cleaning and picking up trash, but it was more than the trash. There were lots of leaves, berries, and parts of bushes on the terrace. Also, the smell was horrid. it smelled like a flower had bloomed but had now over bloomed, like lilacs sometimes get. Or maybe it was the water in the river/creek or whatever it was. It was horrid. It made sitting out by the pool less pleasant. There are nice shops etc. at River Island -- you can buy souvenirs, clothes, some groceries -- there is actually a great selection there. Plus a fast food place for burgers and fries etc. And a healthier fast food place where you can get overpriced carrots and celery and salads. Drive down the street to the Publix and buy that stuff for a reasonable price. The River Island fitness centre is great. Loved all of the machines. What I really didn't like about the pool and recreational activities was that everything cost more money. When we booked in, the person on the phone told me all about the lazy river and the rock climbing and the hippo water slide -- she did not mention that there is an extra fee for all of that. I think I heard that the tubes to go in the lazy river were $9 per day!! WOW! Cabanas were $169 per day. I would think this would be very expensive with young children. Massages were overpriced as well and I would never get a massage in a public place where the masseuse has had his/her hands on many other strangers. But they often seemed busy. The resort was definitely an industry in itself. We took advantage of the express checkout feature. You phone a number, tell them when you will be leaving and your room number. Then you simply leave your keys with the security. We still haven't received our bill but it's only been a week. I hope I will receive a copy of our bill in the mail.

I was a little skeptical about staying somewhere that was 40 miles from the ocean and also about all of the stuff I had read regarding the high pressure timeshare pitch, but had an overall great experience. Our room: POSITIVE: I booked our room through booking.com and received a significant price discount for paying in advance. We had a studio (2 queens, pullout couch and efficiency kitchen with table). It was a perfect set-up for our family. The beds were comfy, we had plenty of linens to get us thru the 4 days and the room was clean. We were centrally located and could easily access our car or the pool or the front desk from our room. Our room: NEGATIVE: Although I had requested that we be placed at River Island, our room was actually at the West Village - directly behind the check-in area. Thru booking.com, I was not made aware that the room type we requested was not available at River Island. Also, I had been lead to believe each room room a washer & dryer but in our building, they were actually down the hall - we were given enough laundry soap for 4 or 5 loads and we did not need coins to operate the machines. Time Share Experience: Upon check in, I firmly declined the $20 free gift to the woman who approached me. Additionally, we unplugged the phone in the hotel room and were not asked again to attend any timeshare presentations. My advice is to be polite but firm with your \"no\"...and trash the $20 certificate...FREE is a 4 letter word. Pool & Surroundings: The pool at the West Village was super nice. There were plenty of towels and chairs. At River Island, our friends got up early to break the rules and reserve chairs. There were signs that stated that reserving chairs was not permitted but there was nobody enforcing it. In fact, the only thing that was strictly enforced were the $9 per day lazy river blue tubes! Everyone had their own cooler packed with food & drink & cocktails and after 5 days the only person I saw get in trouble were people without armbands that were riding on tubes in the lazy river...they literally have a hook that they grab them from people with in 2 different stops around the river. We took advantage of the 2 for $4 domestic draft beers for happy hour and our friends took advantage of the $14.95 refillable soft drink container. Our kids liked the virgin daquiris with the $3 refills. Dining: We ate a Breezes one night and Pisan's pizza place. They were both average...the kids meals are all under $5.99 and I found the adult items to be reasonably priced. We went to Publix and got yummy Boars Head sandwiches a couple of times and we also kept breakfast & lunch stuff in our room. Other: None of us were a big fan of people smoking at the pool. It seemed like there were people smoking everywhere. Additionally, at the end of our hotel hall was an exit to outside and people stood outside that door and smoked so we had to walk thru it on our way to the pool. I even saw an employee standing there...we stayed at the Renaissance @ Sea World earlier in the week and they had a no-smoking policy in the pool area...that was super. My only other complaint was that the hotel rooms were super nice, but the hallway still had dingy ceiling tiles and the stairwells (by ashtray) and area by the stairwell entrances at West Village were dirty...they needed to be swept & painted.

The 2 bedroom condo we booked was beautiful. Ive stayed at classier places, but this was no 3 star either and it was nicely decorated as well. I will not take trip advisor reviews as the gospel any more. while the overall rating by tripadvisor is good, alot of the reviews had us worried until we arrived. Its easy to give a great review when you dont have any problems during your stay, but the true test of any service provider is the ability to solve problems and make the customer happy. Orange Lake did this for us. We had traded a RCI for a week stay here to do disney and cruise to Daytona beach to catch the tail end of Bike Week. When we checked in we asked that they see what kind of rate they could offer us for an additional two nights at the end as we were planning on going somewhere else for cheaper for the last two nights in Orlando. The man we dealt with was not exactly on the ball, but he was nice none the less. We asked him to get back to us with some prices and he never did. We forgot about it and got caught up in the disney marathon and it wasnt untill the last few days we decided we better follow up with him and see what was going on. Turns out he forgot?...He was a bit laid back about it, but sincere enough and after wasting some more time on the phone with him on hold he came up with a really cheap rate for a smaller condo which was fine by us. We left it at that and went back to our vacation. Called back before our week ended and were told there was nothing booked for us so of course we were back on hold for a long time and frustrated we were spending too much time sorting out what we were told by this employee and telling it to someone new, now worrying we have no accomadation. The lady we dealt with eventually called back and got it straightened out. (the reservation had been made, but lost in the \"system\") so we accepted that and she garunteed our rate. when we got the new room key we were pretty happy and surprised to walk into another 2 bedroom villa after booking a studio. This one was as nice as the original place we had. Thats what I call making it right for the customer after the fact. The only complaint I had was the toaster was kaput and looked like it was not recent and the dishwasher soap dispensor would not close so we could not do the dishes we dirtied. The TV in living room had a channel changer that would not work. I left a note for the house keeping staff and other than that our experiance was great. Also, my daughter lost her I-phone and it was found by the Publix grocery store that is on the Orange lake property and one of the staff members called the \"home\" number stored in phone and my daughter got her phone back within 24 hrs of loosing it. This Resort is huge and I think it needs more support staff at front check in/customer service counter as you do spend a few minutes on hold for anything other than a wake up call, but overall I thought we were treated great by all. As far as the whole time share sales pitch, I eat those guys for breakfast due to previous encounters at other resorts so was prepared to dispatch the first one that approached us this time. I did not happen. No one bothered us at all, so that was really nice as well. I even went to the timeshare customer care office to ask were we might find a certain seafood and the guys inside were super and the one gentlemen went out of his way to help and give me some good \"local\" advice. All this and Im someone who usually runs from large resorts as I dont like the amount of people and all the price gouging for amenities such as food and extras. We tried to have a few decent meals in our condo and ate offsite for the rest. Also I read reviews about smells coming from Animal Kingdom and after being at the resort Its seems to me that they are confusing the smell of fertilizer used in the beds around the resort. Animal Kingdom is so huge and the animals so spread out it would seem odd to have that concentration of odor. Not to mention I watched the Disney staff cleaning it up as we toured the Africa section.

The pool was a walk-in as well, which was very convenient. We were 4 intentionally, so that we could play bridge. We loved playing in the screened room where we could watch golfers and one day watched a family of cranes walking their babies. Every morning Mom and I walked down a golfcart pathway to a small body of water where turkey vultures gathered, and we also saw woodpeckers and a heron. No alligators. There are shuttles that run 7am -12am with knowledgeable and friendly drivers. Necessary to do steps. We didn't have to use the car onsite at all. We attended comedy night and found it hilarious. The meal was excellent as well- a caesar salad bar and a variety of pastas. The drink menu was extensive and creative, but expensive.

We had requested a ground floor villa as we did not fancy stairs with children/grandparents and suitcase/shopping etc, so were a little disappointed to find our villa was actually a 4th floor apartment.

The resort was attractive and well maintained, the lazy river pool was fun, but can't believe the resort pay for staff to rent out the rubber rings for the river. THESE SHOULD BE FREE as most people only want 1 go round, so $9 was expensive. We did not use any onsite activities such as mini golf as you could not pay for a single game, only a day pass. One other aspect that slightly spoiled the stay was the golf course lawnmowers cutting the grass at 5am outside the apartment blocks!

Fortunately my parents did the \"sales pitch\" tour so my husband and I were able to skip it, although they did take the toddler with them which gave them an out when she got bored. I had read that the resort can be very pushy but after the one tour (in which my parents managed to not spend any money) we didn't hear from them again. I think you just have to be firm in the first meeting. The resort is huge, lots of pool and children's entertainment options. The one thing I didnt realize is that the lazy river/waterslides are not free, although you can still use the pool area around it. There were lots of families there as well which helped to entertain my daughter (she made friends at every pool we went to). There is also a toddler friendly playground in the River Island area, which we didnt find until the end of the week. Wish we had found it sooner! We had a two bedroom condo in the west village and a one room/kitchenette in the hotel area of the west village. The one room was okay (sort of like an older hotel room) but the condo was amazing. The place was huge with a nice kitchen, eating area and balcony (which is screened off to protect you from bugs). The restaurants on the resort are actually very well priced as well and my husband and father tried the two golf courses (both very nice). The service was good throughout - although can be a bit slow in some of the stores. The resort is also very well located - only a few minutes from Disney and there are some groccery store and shopping options very close by.

We started with 3 days at Universal & the Hard Rock Hotel, then moved to Orange Lake for 4 nights. This was our first time at Orange Lake; we were cautiously optimistic after reading the reviews here and became even more hopeful when I met some people that had stayed here before. We arrived early on Monday about 11:30, although our unit wasn't ready we were able to check in and were told housekeeping would call my cell phone when it was ready. After lunch at the Miler Ale House and grocery shopping at Publix (just outside the front gate) my phone rang and we were ready. We were in 2282; an excellent location on the # 8 tee box of the Legends course (there's not any better entertainment than sitting on the patio with a cold beverage watching people hit ball after ball into the pond) and a short walk to the West Village pool. Our unit was recently remodeled with granite counter tops, tile, carpet, new appliances and paint. Unfortunately we had to call maintenance for a broken door knob, a clogged disposal, torn refrigerator gasket, and a bad smoke detector. This was not necessarily Orange Lakes fault, in fact the maintenance staff was excellent and prompt. Apparently we had some partiers in the unit before us but the two maintenance men that visited us had everything fixed within minutes, not hours. Orange Lake handled our issues promptly and efficiently. They get high marks for customers service and professionalism form the maintenance staff. We loved our unit. It was an excellent location. The master with king bed for my wife and I and the bedroom with twin beds were perfect for us. It was tastefully decorated and came with more than I expected; dish washing detergent, clothes detergent, and even some coffee. We took the shuttle (which had a stop just a couple hundred feet away) to River Island on the other side of the resort. River Island is a collection of small pools intertwined by a lazy river. There's a number of bars, restaurants, and shopping. It's a great place to spend the day. Unfortunately it was packed (spring break) and there were no chairs to be found so we didn't stay long. We took the shuttle back after only an hour or so and our driver dropped us off right at our door vs the bus stop. Now that's service! After lunch we walked over to the West Village pool, easily found lounge chairs, and enjoyed the rest of the afternoon. We enjoyed the pool at West Village ( I think it's called Water\u2019s Edge Beach Club) so much that we reserved a cabana for the following day. The cabana was well worth the $99 to have a couple of couches, shade, our own fridge, and we had a great waiter (I think his name was Dominick) that took care of us all day with drinks and lunch. The Waters Edge Beach Club has a couple of pools, a restaurant and bar, a game room, putt putt, and is next to to the lake where boats can be rented by the hour. Finally, a few bullet points: - Don't bother checking your messages if your in room phone is flashing, it's just advertisements - The time share people are a little pushy but that's what they do, I thought I was done after checking in but I ran out to Target for 20min one morning and when I returned they had gotten my wife on the phone and she agreed to an appointment, they must have seen me leave :-) Really it's not that big of a deal but know going in it is a time share place and they are gonna try to get you into one of their sales pitches. Listen in if you want or politely say no. I didn't have any problems but keep in mind they are persistent. We had excellent wifi connection from our unit and at the pool Service was excellent, every phone call we made for reservations, tee times, maintenance, bus drivers, were all warm and friendly, knowledgeable and efficient Prices for drinks and food on the resort are fair. Certainly not restaurant prices from home but nowhere near on-property Disney and Universal prices. My son and I golfed at the 9 hole executive course (Legends) and had a great time. We used rented clubs and once again had excellent service and the price was fair. When you check in they will hold $250 on your credit card for charges at the resort. You can't use cash anywhere, just your room key. Some people may not like this but I'm fine with it. When I'm on vacation I want no worries, ease of use and relaxation. It's nice not having to carry much around. We had a great stay and will plan to come back, probably a full week next time. Orange Lake is a great value for the room and onsite restaurants and amenities are excellent as well. You're just a few miles from Disney and with a Publix, a Target, and several restaurants just outside the front gate, you've got everything you need. Don't be concerned with renting a place in West Village because it's \"older,\" I think that's where you want to be.

We backed up to one of the golf greens and were on the main path for golf carts. I liked that we could take the golf path to get to the Breezes pool in about 7 minutes.

We spent 4 days at Disney and honestly, I wish we spent more time at Orange Lake. Pros: River Island and the North Village pool were both wonderful for our kids. River Island was a perfect place for our family to relax and float around, and when the kids got bored they went to the fun zone--which was an amusement park in itself. Rock climbing wall, 3 story inflatable water slide, and a trampoline area. This area is not complimentary, but for $50 a person you can get unlimited trips to the fun zone as well as unlimited mini golf and unlimited tube rentals. We got $20 off for listening to the time share appointment presentation (just 5 minutes of my time). I felt this was a good value even though we only spent two days at the pool. Honestly, I don't know how the rooms are so quiet. I have stayed at many resorts/hotels and none have been a quiet as Orage Lake Pros: Check in was much quicker and the appointment scheduling for the timeshare presentation has been separated from check in, and they give you the $20 coupon I mentioned just for talking to the people that schedule the appointments. The person who checked us in (Pablo) was fantastic and went above and beyond. We had 2 units in the East village that I loved. We had views of the Magic Kingdom fireworks from our screened in porch. The units were clean and in good repair, Master Bath has a large whirlpool tub that was nice after long days at the amusement park. Kitchen had all you need to cook meals, working dishwasher, full sized washer and dryer. Enough paper towels, toilet paper, laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, and dish detergent to last a week (this was a nice change from our last visit 2 years ago). The golf courses look nice, but I can't comment because I don't play. We did eat lunch one day at the pool, and honestly I was surpised at the prices, they weren't bad and the food was quite good. Super target across the highway from the entrance which has affordable groceries and everything else you may need. Many restaurants within and right outside the resort. We ate at Bahama Breeze and Houlihans which were both excellent. The Disney parks were a very short 15 minutes (maybe less) especially if you know the short cut. Cons: TVs were still tube TVs, and quite old. There wasn't even a input for a DVD player. The flatware was a bit cheap, but there was plenty of it.

We stayed with a total of 9 people including my parents and inlaws. Check In - We checked in at 11am and they had our room ready hours before the normal check in of 4pm. (I did call a week early and have put a request in. They couldn't make any promises but it seemed like several ppl were doing the same thing). Check in was quick and easy. They did give you a voucher that they wanted you to redeem which of course is the time share pitch. We simply handed it to them and said no thanks. No pressure, just was told I wouldn't get the water park discounts. We weren't having any parts of the timeshare. East Village Rooms - our 3 bedroom villa in the East Village was in a high rise on the 4th floor. We walked in and the room was immaculate. Yes the tvs aren't flat screens but the room was very large with the rooms each separate so everyone in my large family had their own space. I am used to staying in 5 stars, very modern rooms whenever I travel but couldn't afford that for a family of 9 this trip and was still quite happy with the accomodations. There was one bug we saw the entire week by our front door in our room and let me tell you, it is Florida and homeowners see atleast one a day. This isn't uncommon. They do provide dishes, toilet paper, paper towels etc. However we stayed a week and with a large family by mid week we were glad we picked up additional papertowel etc bc we ran out. No maid service. You can choose to pay $30 a day for them to simply come in and change trash and replenish towels or you can wash the towels yourself with the washer and dryer which was easy enough for us. Also, from our balcony we had a view of disney fireworks each night. They were a distance of course but you could see them. Oh and beds were fine with the exception of the pull out couch. I am pregnant so I bought a cheap $30 memory foam to bring and leave when done just to be safe but i really didn't need in our room. Smell - so I was afraid of the reviews on this especially near East village. 2 out of the 7 days of our visit we knew what they were talking about but it is not nearly as bad as what ppl say. It was so mild that you maybe noticed it for a second when you walked out of your room and forgot about a minute later. Almost like a hint of that new mulch smell we hate. We laughed about it since I was most worried about that. Pools - River Island is where you will want to spend most your time and its so big you can locate on a quiter side of the massive pool or lazy river or the busier side. Some tips - don't pay the $9 fee for a bracelet for tubes. They don't let you put them next to the pool when done since you can get another one with your bracelet so there are always some laying around. We pd the first day and regreted it. Plus if you have a child they get one free so we kept taking my daughter to get free ones for the family. They also have a policy you can't use your own tubes which infuriated me bc the childs tube was too large for my toddler. She used her own tube the first day at the pool and then a girl with a power trip prevented her from using the 2nd day. River Island Charges - yes everything is a charge. To go down inflatable water slide is $3 per time. My kids took advantage of the tired worker not collecting tickets and went down a few times. The food is really cheap and good by the pool and the waitresses were great with drink and food orders. (about $5 for a burger, wrap etc) which you will pay every where. We expected to pay for food etc so none of this bothered us. Drive time to River Island - it is less than a mile and walkable but it is a lengthy walk or two minute drive from River Island to East Village. Disney - all of the parks were a very quick distance from the hotel. We brought our gps from home and used in our rental which was perfect and got us everywhere in minutes. Restaurants - staying in the East Village there is a back entrance leading right to Millers Ale House, Target, Publix, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze etc. Everything around you to access. Even a TD Bank. Timeshare Calls - yes they will call everyday. However, the second or third day they woke up my father in law and he sternly told them no we weren't interested and not to call back and our phone never rung again! Easy enough. Overall Orange Lake is a really nice, clean resort that has something for everyone! Having the resort amenities to enjoy while not visiting the parks made this vacation so much more enjoyable. Recommendation - we did Disney twice last year and once this March. We finally tried Discovery Cove and this place is recommended to all! Yes it is a little more expensive but it includes unlimited access to Sea World while on vacation and includes swimming with dolphins, They also have a huge lagoon where you swim with sting rays that were bigger than my dad. (Sounds soooo scary but it was the coolest thing we have ever done lol. I started out on my husbands back and ended up under water with them in an hour). Plus unlimited food all day and unlimited drinks - yep all you can drink beer! We would have spent the difference in one meal elsewhere. We did this on our last day which worked out perfect because they have the best showers with every single thing you need to get showered and dressed before the airport.

My only advice is, if you are looking for a quiet stay, request this area. Hwy. 192W, outside the west entrance is lined with familiar restaurants if you want to eat out.

They sent a van to help us since it was almost ten o'clock at night. We stayed 5 nights six days in a two bedroom villa in the West Village and loved every minute of it! Villa was very spacious for My husband and I plus my sister and our two year old. Two bedrooms and two full huge baths. Kitchen was outfitted nicely with washer and dryer large pantry, dishwasher and everything you need to cook all your meals there. It really was a home away from home. They provided dishwasher detergent (3 loads) clothes detergent 3 loads (so nice not to have to do a weeks worth of washes at home!) Also there was toilet paper and tissues as well as dishtowels stocked in each bathroom and kitchen. Beds were very comfortable as well as furnishings, must say again the furnishings in this unit were a little nicer in quality and age. Bathrooms and closets were more than adequate. Resort was spectacular the River Island area was gorgeous and lots to do for the whole family. Fees were not outrageous and I could see staying on resort the whole time however the Disney parks are no more than 20 minutes away. We did Hollywood studios (15 minutes) and Magic Kingdom (20 minutes with parking and all). We dined at the River Island Grilling Company and had a great meal great service and the food was reasonable. Also did the sunset celebration at the West Village Clubhouse restaurant more casual and also very good. No problems with any smell other than smoke in the first room, no issues with their sales pitch for the vacation club, I declined they still gave me my $20 resort coupon (which we didn't use), no issues with the cleanliness or comfort of the room.

I started staying at Orange Lake about 12 years ago. Besides Orange Lake, I have also had the opportunity to stay at several other resorts in the area and compare the location, features, unit size and overall experience. First thing to say about Orange lake is that it is HUGE and has so much to offer! There are several pools, golf courses and restaurants. Three of the pools have some very unique features. Water\u2019s Edge Beach Club, is next to restaurant/bar which often has live music. The pool right next to that, offers \u201cdive-In\u201d movies. Heck the kids were even getting into playing shuffleboard, which was just a few steps from the restaurant. Splash Lagoon is a very relaxing, well landscaped twisting and turning pool with a waterfall. It feels very \u201cback to nature.\u201d Don\u2019t worry still stuff for the kiddies to do. There is a water slide and fountains to run through. Now we come to the latest pool\u2026 River Island! This pool is pretty much a water park. It is huge with a large slide and a lazy river. Tube rental is extra, but not overly expensive. I recommend a car if you stay here. There is a bus system which will get you around the resort and I have used it. It is certainly the safest way to get back to your unit if you have had some of the drink specials at Water\u2019s Edge Beach Club. The resort is not super close to Magic Kingdom, but less than 10 minutes from Animal Kingdom. There is a special \u201cshort-cut\u201d to avoid the traffic on 192. Ask the folks are the resort, for the back way to get to AK. The resort is divided into villages: West Village- oldest with mostly two story buildings which you can park right in front of, North Village which was the second phase, still with mostly two story buildings, East Village and River Island which are the newest sections and offer more of the \u201cHigh Rise\u201d Experience. To each his own, but I like kicking it old school in West Village, though I do request a remodeled unit. The units are huge compared to most other resorts. Our stay this time was in the West Village very close to the 192 Entrance. We could walk across the parking lot to a pool, but it was not one of the featured pools I mentioned above. Pretty much, everything was great. The Unit was roomy, well appointed and clean. We were able to make it to most the featured pools, take advantage of the drink specials at the pool bar and catch a dive-in movie with the kids.

I have read reviews that this resort doesn't offer housekeeping, so I went to the door to see who it is. I see a man in uniform standing at the door, so I walked over to the living room to tell the half naked to cover up. On the short walk to the living room, I hear the door open. I quickly turned around and see that the man let himself in the room. He was shocked to see me standing there. I asked him why he was there and his answer was that we made a call last night for a broken window shade. I advised him that we made no such call and instead of leaving, he walks into the villa more. He precedes to the window and plays with the shade for a little and left. I found his behavior very suspicious and called the front desk.

Hope you enjoy it! First let me tell you the good points about this resort. We had a 2 bd condo on the golf course. It was huge, clean, plenty of linens and towels for our 4 day trek. Fully stocked Kitchen, Washer and Dryer and very quiet. Each room had a t.v. there was a Jacuzzi tub in the master bath. Next, they have an actual Disney employee onsite to answer all your park and ticket questions. Great Disney service. The front desk Staff was pleasant and accommodating. Good or bad, this is a cash-less resort, so you can use your room key for charging anything to your room. Now let me tell you about a few (bad) things that stand out, in order that they happened. 1. arrived on Thursday once we had our keys we were immediately whisked away to the Vacation desk they tried to get me to sign up for a timeshare presentation and they told me how much I would save on my park admission. After listening to their 10 min pitch they seemed pissed off when I told them I didn\u2019t have time to listen to a presentation. This was the FIRST 10 min of my arrival. It certainly didn\u2019t set the stage for a pleasant relaxing trip. 2. (by the way, I called the resort on Wednesday (the day before our arrival to ask about transportation and had to leave a voicemail and never got a call back) customer service wasn\u2019t very good. 3. After arriving at our room, we immediately got a cab to take our family to the parks. We found a great cab service that charges $45 round trip to any Disney park. IF you are going, (and not renting a car) DO NOT USE the transportation company the Resort recommends. They are TOO EXPENSIVE (16-18 per person) and you need to give them 2 hours notice and they don\u2019t take you directly to the Parks, they make multiple stops and charge per person. Our \u201ctaxi\u201d service just asked for 30 min notice and did pick up and drop off at our room. The best service\u2026\u2026\u2026call [--]. Ask for Carrie. Her and her husband Jeff run the Taxi service. 4. After 3 days of the Disney Parks we were wiped out and tried to get a good nights rest on Saturday night for our departure on Sunday. Note that Check out time was 10 AM. (I asked for a later checkout and was denied since it was a busy weekend). We are from the West coast so we were still sleeping when housekeeping rang our doorbell (twice) at 8:30 AM and when we didn\u2019t answer (since we were still sleeping) they tried to come into our room. Thankfully our door was locked with the chain and they couldn\u2019t get in. when we finally made it to the door we found a large black plastic bag full of clean linens and someone from housekeeping walking away with no explanation or apology. I immediately called housekeeping who apologized and connected to Guest services. After complaining about being woken up and the intrusion they offered me a round of Golf (I was leaving that day so it wouldn\u2019t matter) or inner tube rentals at their onsite waterpark. I then asked for them to take of any incidental room charges and they agreed. $42. Overall I wouldn\u2019t stay there for the negative reasons mentioned above. They are a Holiday Inn Resort (RCI for timeshare). You get what you pay for. This is NOT a Four Seasons or Fairmont (or even Disney) The resort is SO HUGE they have shuttle stops at various points throughout the resort, unfortunately when we needed to get on one, they were not around. The resort itself is about 15-20 min from the WDW Parks. If you can afford it and want a true Disney experience, stay at a property on site, The Polynesian, Grand Floridian or one of the resorts close. You can take the Monorail right from the Hotels and get you right into the Magic Kingdom or Epcot. By the way, if you have been to Disneyland in California, don\u2019t bother going to the Magic Kingdom. It nearly identical except for 3 times the size (no Matterhorn ride). Disneyland is much more intimate (read: Smaller). Spend your time at Epcot or Animal Kingdom. We didn\u2019t get to Experience the Hollywood Studios Park. All the parks have a 1 day entry fee of $85 + tax If you are going to be there multi days, get a 2 or 3 day pass. Its VERY difficult to try and see more than 1 park per day due to the distance and how much there is to see at each park, especially Epcot. Don\u2019t bother getting the Park Hopper Option. Save your money and just get the multi day pass.

I find the master bath in the North Village are larger. These also have patios that are screened in and are on the 9 hole walking golf course. We golfed this course during the night under the lights and had a fabulous time The only issue we had this year was the shuttle service. On Saturday night, we had to wait 45 minutes to get picked up at River Island. After 25 minutes of waiting, another group came out of the restaurant to wait with us.

We like to stay at condo rentals more than hotels for the space and convenience they offer. Two adults and three young kids in a hotel room is never much fun! For the price we paid ( about 120.00 per night) it was acceptable. We stayed in a two bedroom with a king and two queens, non-smoking, in one of the East Village 5 story buildings. If you're looking for posh accommodations you will not be satisfied here. We had a couple of minor issues like a kitchen drawer face falling off and the master sink drain lever not working, but for a place to crash with enough space to stretch out after a long day at the parks, it's acceptable. I should add that I did not notify the front desk about any problem so I can not comment on service. I noticed that There were plenty of service people around, so I'm sure they would have responded to a request for repair had I cared. There were televisions in every room and, while they were from the last century, they were quite sufficient for our needs. They could use a couple more kids channels in their cable package. Free wi-fi was an appreciated amenity. I will say this, the place was CLEAN! The room doesn't come with daily housekeeping service but my wife mentioned that you could call them if you needed something like towels. As I said, we were looking for convenience. This location IS that; there's a Publix supermarket at the front entrance with most of the major restaurants, and several good locals, within a mile or two. The entrance to the Disney resorts is about four miles down the highway (Rt 192) with Universal and SeaWorld about ten miles. At the price we paid this is a bargain compared to Disney property rates. We live in Tampa and have stayed at all the \"luxury\" Disney properties\". This place is better than any of them and you don't have to spend a small fortune dining out! We were here to do our youngest daughter's 5th birthday at Disney World ( her wish) There are MANY other amenities in the resort and they seem to charge for all of them but we didn't use any. The golf courses looked pretty nice but I don't play golf. I read a couple of reviews here complaining about the timeshare sales pitch. There's an easy solution to that, when they offer you money to sit through \"a short presentation\", decline the offer. Personally, I appreciated the great effort my \"greeter\" put into to trying to get me to \"add fries to my order\". It's his job and I was happy that he was trying to do it well! If saying \"no thanks\" makes you uncomfortable, practice a few times before checking in and you'll enjoy the experience too!

We found it interesting from the start that they tried to separate the resort from the Holiday Inn Priority Club program when \"convenient\"; but when advertising or referring to it, always came back to it and the Holiday Inns system of motels. Regardless, the two bedroom suite (they call them villas) was on the 6th floor of a building in the East Village on hole four I believe of the Legends course. It was entertaining just to have hot tea in the mornings and watch the golfers come down the fairway through to the green. Since we are golfers, we had a lot of empathy for them!! Interesting to see though how much etiquette golfers have forgotten over the years, especially regarding golfers being on the course with people behind them waiting to hit. The tour was interesting and although my wife and I already own a timeshare program, we just weren't interested in this one. We did however refer them to a family with two boys that would love this property, but they didn't want to listen to that nor take their names or references and add them to their \"visitors list\". It was kind of sad. Our guide, Laura, talked quickly and I think knew she needed to get her spiel in quickly within the two hours as we were walking at the end. As do all timeshare tours, we were approached by three people \"after\" Laura to make sure there wasn't anything they could sell us. The property itself is very well maintained. Beautiful golf courses that I would come back and play and the rooms were very roomy, and well maintained, well equipped, and well adorned with all of the conveniences of home including ample silverware, and supplies, as well as TV's in each room and a DVD player in the family area.

We can usually leave my dad on his owns to explore and get a meal, etc. We did not this time because he would have been stranded. Almost everything is too far to walk too. I have stayed at dozens of resorts over the years and never experienced such inconvenience. We could not take the car and go too far because we needed it to get around the resort. I cannot figure out why the shuttle stops are so far and few in the East Village!! This is something Orange Lake needs to rectify!! I have been an owner at Westgate Resorts (Interval International) and Summerbay Resorts (RCI) 13 years. I would never trade my weeks to go to Orange Lake again. I prefer convenience and free activities when I can get it. You really felt that being a non-owner there was a serious disadvantage. You also have to pay for all of the activities. I called for a bicycle rental and found out they had none. But you can rent a bike from an outside contractor for $70 for three days (owners and non owners). The pontoon boats cost $110 an hour for owners and $120 for non owners. They nickel and dime you to death for everything then slap you in the face with inconvenient shuttle service. If you love golf and are on owner here you will have a magnificent time. They only allow owners or friends of owners to stay in River island the nicest newest section of the resort where everything is convenient.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flanders, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time, Nice Place\u201d", "Author": "Janius E", "ReviewID": "UR124455466", "Content": "Just spent a week at the beginning of February Enjoyed every day.

I counldn't stand the thought of sitting on the sofa so we covered it with a blanket we found in the closet. The carpets are so shabby and dirty that I would not go barefoot in the room. I did go to guest relations and tell them that I am very disappointed with the room and its shabby condition. It is really not better than an extreme budget motel. Guest relations offered to have someone come in and shampoo the sofa but other than that they said there is nothing they can do. Also, the bedroom in the 1-bedroom units is right beside the door to the hallway. You can hear everyone walking, talking and shutting their doors in the hallway. It is also quite easy to hear your neighbors in the rooms nearby. Bring earplugs or you'll never get any sleep! We had been looking forward to this vacation for a long time. Our trip has been good - everything aside from this 'resort'. I recommend that you stay away from this \"resort\" if you want something better than a budget hotel. It is marketed as a resort but it does not live up to the marketing hype. Also, when you check in there is a lot of pressure to attend a timeshare sales presentation. We did not attend but had to go through 10 mins of high pressure at the check in area before we could actually get on with our vacation. They gave us a coupon for $20 to use at the resort as a 'thank you', but we found out the coupon is useless.

A fridge that would be found in a college dorm with really no freezer space. There was a two burner stove no oven but a microwave and toaster oven. One four cup coffee maker. There was dining ware service for four and a dishwasher. The bedroom had a kingsize bed. The bathroom had the shower/tub and sink vanity in one room and toilet in a small other room.

At about $120/night for the unit - figured it would be a nice and affordable way to finish our vacation. First impressions - amazed at how big this place is! We pulled into the first entrance (wrong), and drove all the way around the resort to the registration center. Wow! Hundreds of units, spread around golf courses and ponds. Very attractive. Found the registration office, and was helped by an extremely friendly employee. Was able to check in at 10 am (normal check in at 3pm!). Was directed over to the (time-share) desk, and after a very brief discussion, exited without getting roped into a tour. Simply tell them you do not want to do the tour.... Arrived at our unit - a 2 bedroom villa in the West Village. The villa was spacious, with entry into the kitchen area, that connected to the dining room and family room as part of an open floor plan with high/peaked ceiling. Kitchen was nice - full sized fridge/freezer, newer microwave and stove, dishwasher. Kitchen was even stocked with dishwasher powder, dish soap, a couple coffee pouches, several coffee filters, etc. Washer and dryer in closet in kitchen with a couple detergent boxes. Nice dining room table as well as breakfast counter provided plenty space for our group of 7 to spread out and eat. (We grocery shopped at the Publix just off the property.) Family room had a ~40\" flatscreen samsung with cable, a couch, loveseat and chair surrounding a large coffee table. Worked well for the kids to spread out and do homework. Master bedroom with very comfortable king bed and pillows, second bedroom with 2 queen beds, each room with a bathroom attached. Each also had a tv. The bathrooms were the only area of the villa where the unit wasn't outstanding. Just not perfectly clean and showed a little more age than was noticeable elsewhere in the unit. Perhaps the newer units are better? The master bedroom and family room each have sliding doors out to a large patio facing the golf course. Patio table and chairs made for nice lunch outdoors. Up close and personal visits from 8 sandhill cranes and a few egrets was cool! And the pool areas....! First, there are several different pool areas, situated in the various \"villages\". We spent time at both the Water's Edge and River Island pools. Water's Edge has two pools and a large hot tub, many lounge chairs, and is surrounded by other activities (arcade, mini-golf, restaurant/bar, etc) - very nice. The River Island area is huge! Lazy river is very cool - with or without tubes (for rent). Water slides and large pools attach to the lazy river. Restraunt/bar, shopping, minigolf, rockwall, trampoline/bungee jumper.....lots to do. Oh, and the water at all the pools is maintained at 80 degrees - very nice. We have stayed in Orlando many times, typically renting a private house for a week, with our own private pool/hot tub, bedrooms, kitchen, washer/dryer, etc. The Orange Lake Resort rivals renting a house, providing many of these benefits. Obviously not private...but the multitude of other activities on site and affordable price make it a nice alternative to a house. Again, our only suggestion for improvement is cleanliness of the villa's bathrooms.

After reading some of the reviews, i was worried that it was going to be dissapointing, but instead, we have been really, really, really pleased. Check in was very easy. We were quickly greeted by many employees. Will at the front desk checked us in and was able to give us a 2-bedroom in the West Village. The West Village is their older resort, but our appartment was renovated. We found newer appliances: stove/oven, microwave, dishwasher,refridgerator, washer/dryer and all the dishware/cookware needed. Nice beige granite counter top. Our appartment was able to accommodate up to 8 people: one bedroom had a King bed, the other was a 2-queen size beds and the living room had a pull out bed. We especially loved the fact that our rental car was parked right outside the appartment... litterally 20 steps away. This made loading/unloading very easy. It also guaranteed a close parking spot to our appartment. This resort is enormous and it required us to drive if we wanted to go to the pools. Orange Lake has 7 pools (I think) which are all very beautiful. There is free shuttle service that will take you from one location to another. Be aware that the resort itself is 1400 acres of land but only approximately 30% of it is currently being used. You will find the best pool at River Island which is another another section of this HUGE resort. River Island has 2 pools and a lazy river connects the 2 pools. You are welcome to swim in any of ther pools in this resort, but if you want to use a floating tube for the lazy river at River Island, you will have to pay for the floating tubes. The resort will not allow you to bring your own floating devices. The pool is nicely heated to a comfortable 80 degrees and there are lots of places to sit. If you want, you have the option to rent out cabanas for $125. I think in the cabanas you will find comfortable sitting and a refridgerator. The resort has many restaurants for families to dine, a great agenda of activities for adults and kids, and a few little shop. There are tennis courts, racket courts, gyms, basketball courts..and more that we probably did not see. The location of the resort is great, it is surrounded with familiar stores like Target, Walgreens, and Publix (just a few blocks down). There are also many places to dine outside of the resort that are minutes away: Applebees, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, Orlando Ale House, and Chick-Fil-A to name a few. ..... Finally, you are probably wondering about the TIMESHARE presentation that was given. Yes, my husband and I attended it. We were told that the presentation could last \"60-minutes or more,\" and I can guarantee you that it will probably take A LOT longer than 60 minutes. You have the option to say no to this presentation at the front desk, but we could not pass the 7-day unlimited hopper pass to Universal Studios and Islands of Advanture for only $109 per tickets. The sellers at the Timeshare presentation are not aggressive but they will go through the loops of bringing multiple sales person to the table. We were passed down to 3 different sales person, each one giving us a better deal. If you are no interested in buying their timeshare and wish to not waste anymore of your time... just be firm and say no. We actually enjoyed it because these presentation provides more information to be better timeshare owners. Well, hopefully you found this review helpful. I would recommend it to anyone including my close friends and family. I know that we will come back to this resort again and again to enjoy all the activities and the theme parks.

The resort is huge with three areas West, North and east villages. We stayed in the west village on the top floor of a 2 story 2 bedroom bungalo. The north village appeared to be getting re-vamped when we went through there.The east village is where the photos are of the lazy river and waterfalls. The eastvillage semed more condoish and the other villages more one or two story bungalos. Each village has pools and kids areas with the east village having the newest looking and most kids stuff. Our room was great, slept my wife and I and 4 kids aged 12-15 just fine. There was a back balcony that looked at nothing, but trees and swamp. The room was not perfect and had some wear and tear, but was clean and certainly large enough for us. Our room dryer broke down while we were there and it was replaced the next day when the repair man could not fix it. You do need to rent a car while your there if you are there for Disney and Universal studios. The shuttles to the parks are about $18 per person. They are not worth it. We took a cab twice (my wife had the rental car on bussiness) and it was under $20 (total) from the animal kingdom and $23 to Epcot including a decent tip.There were cabs right there leaving the parks, but we waited about 50 minutes to get picked up from the resort. With a car there is everything nearby. many restaraunts, publix, walgreens ect. all the Disney parks are nearby, and Universal is about 1/2 hour away. Do not bother with the park hopper ticket, you can spend a full day in each Disney park. Do get a 2 day (both parks ticket for universal) you will need two days to see it all. Note get a plastic parka outside the park for the Universal water rides and take them with you, you will be glad you did. On other peoples comments: The beds were just comfy. There is a charge for almost anything extra at the resort, We we did not use or do anything at the resort because we were getting home late every day. The kids did go swimming at both East and West rsorts and actually liked the west one better although the east resort certainly looked much nicer. the water was warm and towels were provided at the pool, no need to bring room towels. we could not smell the animal park,but could hear and see the fireworks. There were messages on our machine everyday for the timeshare presentation among other things, but it was not hard sell. we declined and that was that. The staff was very good and proffesional The pizza on the resort was 2 larges for $20, good-deal good pizza. Never made it on the golf courses as this was a kid/family vacation, but the courses looked great and I sure wanted to. Unsure of the green fees, Bring your clubs if you can. T.V.'s are older tube type, did not care, we were gone all day. Kids watched a bit of t.v. before bed. Never saw any bugs (January though) bad things, Dishwasher was absolutely terrible and the shower water pressure was very poor as well. some wear and tear, baseboard bashed up.

Yes the 'sales' staff are 'pushy' and can be obnoxious but they are no different to sales staff the world over. They have to live. As for the rest of the staff I cannot speak highly enough of them. I actually suffered a stroke whilst on holiday in March 2005. My family and I were booked in just for 1 week, but the staff immediately arranged for my wife to extend her stay whilst I was in hospital. Indeed, when my hospital stay extended to a third week, even though they had no vacancies the staff spent their time after work trying to find alternative accomodation for her. In the end they had a cancellation and reassured my wife that whilst I was in hospital they would ensure she had somewhere to stay. Also whilst I was in hospital they ensured that taxis were always available to run her to and fro, and they even negotiated a substantially reduced rate with Mears on her behalf. When I came out of hospital the taxi dropped me off at reception as apparently the staff there wanted to ensure that my wife and I received such assitance as we required. They were absolutely lovely and there were a few tears shed. To cap it all they never 'charged' me for the extra weeks reassuring us they were more concerned that I got better and my wife's stress levels were kept to a minimum. In October, 2011 my partner and I took several members of her family with us. All they now talk about is 'when are they coming again'. And this is not the first time. we brought out family members in April, 2009 and 2011 as well as friends in September, 2010 and they ALL adored it I have stayed in all 'levels' of accommodation from the 2 bedroomed villas to the 3 bedroom 'Signature' collection apartments. My only complaint is that I leave it too late to book, and due to the popularity of the resort cannot always get the accommodation I want, but have always been happy with the standards of the accommodation. If you want a 'busy/active' holiday there is plenty to do both on and off the resort. if you want peace and quiet it's there as well. I have actually arranged for my daughter and her fiancee to stay there as part of their wedding present and my daughter, who has stayed there many times, cannot wait. There will always be faults if we look for them, but Orange Lake, I have found. will always try and sort out any problems. Indeed, when my partner and I visit in two weeks I intend to sit down with a vacation counsellor to arrange our future stays here and at the other resorts in the 'Orange Lake family'.

Gated entrances and security is better than a hotel. Lots of grocery, dining, and big box stores close by. Close to Disney. Here are the bad things: It seems as like overall quality is slipping. Maintenance of the units has been spotty. We have not been in a unit that has not required various fixes. The appliances in the units we have been in are over 12 years old and were very bottom of the line when they were purchased. The formica countertops and plastic coated cupboard doors are delaminating and just falling apart. Our units have been very dirty, the carpets are filthy with many stains. Tops of cabinet doors in kitchen are covered in grease and dust. Blinds, curtains, and furniture are extremely dusty. All of the units that we have been in need a deep cleaning. The full dishwasher cycle runs for more than 2 hours and does not clean the dishes. The smell in the air emanating from the animal waste at Animal Kingdom was overpowering and not tolerable during most of our 10 day stay. We drive our Suburban to the resort and bring a large Rubbermaid tub of cleaning supplies to sanitize the unit before we unpack. Our family also wears socks the whole unit, With regard to the timeshare sales pressure and survey requests, walk straight out of reception after you check in and the minute you arrive to your unit, unplug all of the phones. The staff goes out of their way to be polite, but when it comes to addressing a complaint or fixing a problem....good luck. Receiving department and front desk lost an overnight package that was sent to me and found it 10 hours after it was delivered to the resort. We have been repeat customers of the resort because the units we have been in are better than a 10 X 20 foot hotel room that has not been really taken care of either. The units do have full and usable appliances if you can tolerate the age and condition of them. The weekly price has been fair, not cheap by any means, but not affordable. The resort recently added a \u201cresort fee\u201d for $7.95 per day which is just cash in their pockets because didn\u2019t pay this fee prior to our most recent stay.

We were told it was an hour long meeting, but having sat through these before we understood that most likely it would go longer. The salesman who came over to help us was named Randall. He explained that he was not an employee of Orange Lake but instead contracted out to talk to individuals like us, who had a timeshare that was paid for in full but had not yet moved their week to points. He assured us that we would not have anyone else come over to talk to us because we were \"veterans\" of this process and therefore he would be taking care of everything. It is amazing how kind the sales team are as they are attempting to sell to you, and how quickly it changes once they realize you are not going to purchase anything. After his pitch, my husband and I said that we weren't interested in purchasing anything. Randall then had to take a call from his wife, and sent in someone else to offer us a new deal. It was such a scam! I told the next person that we were not interested in changing anything right now, once again this person became rude to us. I told him that one reason we will not put in anymore money to Orange Lake was because how rude they became during the presentation. Yesterday as we were packing up ready to go, my brother could not find his camera, we lifted the mattress up to look for it and saw this HUGE wad of dark black body hair lying on the box spring. I can't even begin to say how disgusting that was, to know that it had been there the whole week. My husband mentioned it to someone as he checked out and they said \"oh ok\", no one seemed to care.

The 2 Bedroom 2 Bathroom villa assigned to us, as this is the type of unit they were trying o sell us, was definitely not what we were shown back in 2008. This villa was old with some very old amenities, in the East Village which felt like the very back of the property. I promise you that if this is what was shown to us in 2008, we would not have wasted our time to extend, as we simply were not impressed by it. We did not even unpack our clothes, and insisted to be moved. They reassigned us to the 81000 building at River Island. This room still was not what we were expecting, however, we decided to stay in it. I believe they treat prospective owners and owners different from regular paying guest. We had absolutely no housekeeping service for the entire time we were there. If we wanted the service, we would have to pay additional for it.....WOW!!! I do not believe the room was properly cleaned and checked before we went in. The curtain rod in the living room was broken off, thus not allowing us to pull the curtain. Neither did the venition curtain rolled up. So we left both curtains closed all the time. I spilled some drink in the kitchen, but could not find a mop in the villa to clean it up. I had to use some paper towels to do the job. Also, the resort in all of the numerous communication I had with them prior to us arriving, did not mentioned to us that the entire property was a \"cashless\" property. So if you do not walk with enough credit on your credit cards, you will have some real challenges, even if you have more than enough cash. Unbelievable!!!!! They refuse to allow us to pay with cash during our stay. However, I can setting my bill with cash at checkout.....WOW!!!! One thing I thought was funny, was that the television screens in the main lobby, were all nice flat screens, however, the bedrooms we were in had small regular tv sets. The staff is courteous and helpful to some extent. You can see some of them trying, but I believe they can do much, much better. I would encourage anyone going to this resort, to ensure you ask many pertinent questions before you get there, and ensure you get the responses in writing, so you can show them what you booked.

Yeah, they try to sell you on the resort, which is absolutely lovely, by the way and they do offer discounted park tickets and credits to use around the resort for going on their \"Tour\"...and although we declined at check-in, they did call the room quite often...easy fix is just turn your ringer off!

We walked into our two bedroom unit and encountered an overwhelming smell of clorox. Since my sister has a lung condition, we called to complain. She was told there was nothing the management could do but send someone over to spray another chemical. The housekeeper who arrived stated it was evident that too much clorox had been used. She said the only thing she could do would be spray another scent that might prove more annoying than the original. She advised my sister to air out the room and sleep on the pullout sleeper in the living room. When we opened the window, there was no screen. This morning we were going to fry a couple of eggs for breakfast, but there was no frying pan. There was also no broiler pan, and the toaster was broken. I called housekeeping and was told they had no idea when someone would respond as they just entered the info in their system. When I asked if we should go out for breakfast, housekeeping responded that we did not have to be in the room for them to come in. The frying pan showed up after our breakfast of soft-boiled eggs. The man who brought it explained broiler pans are scarce and there are none in stock as they are not buying any. He did replace the toaster. We had booked in for the timeshare sales presentation which was listed as only lasting 60 minutes so we left around noon. As we left the unit we noticed weatherstripping hanging off the top of the doorframe. The sales presentation lasted three hours and consisted of visits by four different people, the first three of whom were entertaining and the last, someone named \"Mike\" who was simply annoying. Although I explained we were not going to purchase and my sister was a 77 year old diabetic who needed to eat something (The \"light refreshments\" listed for the presentation turned out to be coffee) Mike said, \"Will that be MasterCard, Visa, or American Express?\" apparently thinking he was quite the card. Finally, he directed us to the exit, pointing out that we needed to stand outside and wait for the shuttle to take us back to our car as the first salesperson had brought us to another building.

Super close to Disney - about 15 min or less, though being January it wasn't high season.

The grounds are very clean, and there is a small market that sells some groceries and supplies at slightly higher prices right on site. The pool is beautiful and heated. We never made it to the lazy river. My one HUGE gripe though about this trip however was filling up gas for the rental car near the airport. The price was nearly DOUBLE the normal cost - nearly $6/gallon. The rental company wants a receipt saying you filled up within a certain radius of the airport - which is total price gouging. DO NOT fill up near the airport. Fill up by the hotel, then top off at the gas stations by the airport. This is completely ridiculous in my mind, that a gas station can charge that much more than the norm purely based on location.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint John, New Brunswick", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable stench from Animal Kingdom\u201d", "Author": "GISguy", "ReviewID": "UR122919601", "Content": "We stayed at Orange Lake Resort from Januray 1st to 6th, 2012.

The front desk staff were helpful and pleasant. Our kids were getting hungry so we were anxious to get something to eat at one of the restaurants but were advised that all the restaurants closed at 10pm so we were going to miss out. We should have packed some food or snacks to get us through til morning but poor planning on our part. Thankfully the front desk gave us some pizza places off site to order in from to which we did. We had a large pizza delivered right to our unit door at about 10:45. After checking in we were directed to the \"sales\" desk where we had the option of signing up for the sales presentation the following day. We did sign up with the intention of not buying anything but wanted the \"rewards\" for sitting in on the pitch. The rewards included buying 2 days at Disney at a slightly reduced rate which included a 3rd day at one of Disney's water parks. We also received free play passes for the week (hippo waterslide, trampoline and one of the many mini putt golf courses) They add $30 to your account but it is given back to you after you finish the sales presentation. The sales presentation is your typical time share/ vacation ownership lecture that you receive anywhere else. They advise it's 1 hour but it's closer to 2. Your rep drives you around the resort showing you this and that quoting numbers and figures that you don't really understand but you continually nod your head like you're approving what they are saying. I'm sure if you were genuinely interested in purchasing, you would make it a point to gather as much informatin as you could and know what they are talking about but...we did not. We went back to a meeting room where they go in for the final kill. After you akwardly advise them that you're not interested, another team member comes out to sweeten the pot. Again, we advise them we're not biting so sales guy # 3 comes out and does his best. After we shut it down for the last time, they get the point and usher you to the rewards desk. Like I mentioned, I think this is the standard procedure in time share sales anywhere else. We always feel so guilty at these presentations because your sales rep is trying to sell you something that you know your not going to buy and we feel like we're wasting their time. Regardless, we were glad it was over. You will not find anywhere on the resort that takes cash (other than the front desk). They will take credit cards or you can charge things to your room with your room key. We elected to deposit money periodically at the front desk towards our account and used our room key to charge things. That way we were paying up front and just deducting from our account when we buy anything so we wouldn't be hit with a huge bill upon checkout. We stayed in the West village. Bungalow type building with a 2 car driveway. The unit was clean, roomy and comfortable. All condo amenities and appliances worked as they should. Our backyard backed on the 17th fairway of the Reserve golf course. We had a family of crane type birds visit our patio looking for habdouts each morning. You'll be mildly annoyed by having a flashing message on your phone everyday advising you of the resorts specials for the day. We ran out of soap and toilet paper which was quaickly remedied with a phone call to housekeeping. You are close to a Walgreens and a Publix off site for additional supplies and groceries. Some of these items can be bought on site a a slightly elevated price. Houlahan's restaurant across the street was also a great night. Transportation throughout the village is top notch. Designated \"bus stops\" are everywhere and the frequency of the shuttles are 10 minutes or less. They run from 7am til 11pm if I remember correctly Just advise where you want to go and the driver will let you know when you arrive at your destination. The resort has many pools. The most frequented area in my opinion is River Island. The pool and river are heated which comes in handy sometimes during an Orlando winter. Pool bars are abundant so are tubes but will cost you. Tip: for beer drinkers, purchase and hang on to the cheesy Orange Lake plastic beer glass for $8 and every other beer after that is $4. Remember, no cash. We liked the North village poolas well. It has a small waterslide for the kids. We were satisfied with our stay at Orange Lake. A great place for kids and you're a 15 min drive to Walt Disney World.

There are many amenities (too many too list) with plenty of pools (7) and activities for all ages (including golf). Our unit was a 2br/2ba that overlooked the Golf Course.

We had a 2 bedroom unit in the west village, which was extremely clean and spacious. Two adults and 3 children (2 teens and a 'tween) comfortably shared the space, though one child chose to sleep on the sofa in the living room. The kitchen was very well-equipped with all the implements you could want for basic cooking, and had granite counters. The washer-dryer was useful and worked well. Bathrooms were spacious and clean, including the jacuzzi-style tub in the master bath. The complex seems to be in good repair. We were in Orlando for a soccer tournament, so we wanted space to relax between games, and got that. If I were there for a vacation, though, I would be disappointed with the amenities. Swimming pools seemed small, and even in December the miniature golf courses were crowded. Restaurants and the Marketplace mini-mart were expensive for what they offered. The River complex pool looked fun but too small for the vast size of the resort overall. Security at the gate was rather over-zealous, but it's easy to get in if you tell them you are checking in. The architecture is extremely monotonous, but not hideous. Friends who were also staying said the golf was pleasant but not memorable. As a place to stay, a larger-than-average hotel, it was fine. If I went there with the idea that it would provide entertainment for several days, I'd be disappointed. One nice touch was the array of starter goodies provided in the unit: dish soap, paper towels, laundry detergent, coffee. It was pricey but I'm sure a better deal could be had if you could be more flexible with your dates. Beware - they will try to get you into a sales session for the timeshare. And when you say no,they will call your unit to invite you yet again (to be fair, they offered $100 to come to the session). We were honest and said the only reason we were there was for a soccer tournament, and wouldn't want to vacation in Orlando otherwise, and they respected that and left us alone. Maybe those are the magic words? (Never a mention of a charge not to attend the sales pitch, btw.) Service was friendly and prompt - we were missing a couple small items from our unit and they delivered them promptly, and phone inquiries to various departments were answered quickly and accurately.

Another member landed on a separate flight and checked in alone ahead of myself, and I am the RCI exchange member. Understandably, she was upset and flustered at check in awaiting news from us at the hospital. As she was checking in, she gave her credit card for the security deposit and was quickly booked into a timeshare tour. She would be charged $30 if she did NOT show up for the tour. When we arrived later that evening, I was going through the check in paperowork and came across the timeshare papers. I had rented a car to drive from the Jacksonville airport to our resort and I needed to drop it off at the Hertz desk at OL front desk, so I thought I would cancel this while I did this. I also wanted to put my credit card down for the deposit and take my cousin's card off their records. The salesperson told me that she could not cancel the tour until she had a 'code' from our paperwork that I had left in our room. I went back to the room and called the sales staff, gave them the code and they told me it was cancelled and I would not be charged. The next morning, we got a 'friendly reminder' phone call about our tour that day. I informed them that we had cancelled the night before. The tone of our 'friendly reminder' immediately changed. She told me she had no record of that and I would be charged the fee if I did not show up. I told her again, we had cancelled and we would not be there nor would we want to see a charge for it. Afterall, is it not our vacation? She told me that she would call us back if she needed more information. We did not hear from her. Upon arrival back home, my visa showed a charge of $30USD posted December 13 2011; two days after we arrived home. I immediately called OL and spoke to the accounts department and they assured me that a refund had been issued and it could be just delayed in appearing on my card. I check again December 30 2011 and there is STILL NO REFUND! I called OL again and was told there was 'no manager on duty' and they would call me back. 36 hours later I am still awaiting that phone call. I sent an email to the Holiday Inn website to lodge a complaint and I am still trying to settle this. The issue is not the $30, it is the lack of service in dealing with a situation that was simple to fix. I will not recommend OL to anyone who is looking for a relaxing vacation with exceptional customer service.

I booked the rooms through world resorts international\u2019s Buy with Me deal, and got 7 nights for a great price. After reading the reviews, I didn\u2019t know what to expect when we checked in, however, we were pleasantly surprised! Recommend this place for families looking for vacation rental amenities and not hotel amenities. Check-in/Check-Out No wait and courteous staff. The only criticism is the time-share tactics. The receptionist gave me the room key and $20 voucher. My family was waiting in the car, so I walked out to meet them. On my way out, the timeshare rep pounced! And when I told her that I had to meet my family, she said that I had to give her the $20 voucher back. It was the strangest thing. I knew that the voucher was a timeshare ploy, but if I knew they would demand it back if not used immediately, I would have declined to take it in the first place. But that was not a big deal because overall the staff was very courteous. After getting to our room, my husband called the front desk and asked if we could be moved off of ground level. They gave us several options and were very accommodating so overall I would rate the reception staff as excellent and the timeshare group as rough around the edges (we had to unplug our phones because they literally called us non-stop even after we picked up and said we weren\u2019t interested.). Property We stayed on the 5th floor of the East Village. It looked like this was a recently renovated/built section because the rooms were clean with modern d\u00e9cor. The receptionist said that all rooms in the East Village are similar. The entire property is huge! It took about 5 minutes to drive from the reception to the East Village because of the winding roads, golf carts, pedestrians, etc. Driving through, it looks like the West Village and possibly North Village as well, are the older, one level rooms. They actually look like little houses. I\u2019m not sure how they look on the inside, but I don\u2019t think I would want to stay there. I like the more modern look and feel of the East village. I loved that there was a pool in the East Village and a restaurant as well. There are like 8-10 places to eat on the resort and at least 4-5 deliver until 10pm. We ate at The Legends once and the food was OK. We did not really use the amenities on the resort. We went to the pool once in the East Village. It was very quiet and cold during our stay. There is a lazy river in River Island, but we never checked it out. The property has a great location, with a Publix, Walgreens, Target right next door. Very convenient! Also, this place so close to Disney. We went to Magic Kingdom and after the hustle and bustle of getting into and out of the park, it was nice that our ride home was less than 10-15 minutes. Room We had a 2 bedroom condo. It was clean, spacious and very comfortable. The kitchen was equipped with cooking essentials, although a few pots and pans needed replacing and one burner was broken. The TVs are dated, but the living room has a DVD player which was nice. The bedroom TVs had bad reception. They have extra sheets and blankets for the sofa bed. We found one blanket had food stains on it, but thankfully the place was equipped with a washer/dryer and detergent. Overall the imperfections did not stress me because of the deal I received, but it would bother me more if I would have paid full price.

For our last stay, we were in the one-story units in West Village. This is the oldest part of property, but the units have been updated. The only item that needs to be replaced are some of the beds. The one my husband and I were on had a noticeable sage on one side, but the kids bed seemed fine. My parents said their bed was a bit saggy in spots. The plus with this location was easy unloading/loading and an easy walk to many resort amenities. The possible negatives are a smaller master bath with a regular tub-sized jacuzzi and a bit less square footage than the high rise units. Most the time we have been in the East Village. The units are large, nicely decorated, and well-maintained. The only down-sides with East Village are that it is remote from many resort services and there are a number of buzzards that tend to hang out at the edge of Animal Kingdom witch backs this part of the resort. I would stay in West or East Village again. The grounds are very peaty and well-maintained. They had many decorations out for Christmas, and the fountains, golf courses, etc. all combine for a nice resort feel. My kids love going to the River Grill for breakfast with \"Swampy,\" the alligator mascot for the resort. We generally travel in December or March, and at those times the breakfast has never been overly busy. The characters have always been great with my kids and they always spend a lot of time interacting with the kids. The food has been a good quality buffet-style affair with custom omelets. Very tasty and an outstanding value at just under $10 for adults and $4 for kids. The pools are very nice. My kids love the fountains at North Village and the kids pool there is a good quite option (far fewer guests than River Island). River Island is basically an attraction. We were shoe-stringing it this time, so we did not rent floats for the lazy river. We discovered that is was quite relaxing and enjoyable to float along the lazy river even without a float. What fun! We always take the kids mini golfing and the courses are well-lit and attractive. The price went up since our last visit, but the approximately $9 for each person covers two rounds. The staff will give you a rain check if you are unable to play both rounds at the same time, so we get two days of fun. The only recreation disappointment was we rented a paddle boat to take out on the lake. It was a quite windy, and we could not get the four-person unit (just two were able to peddle) out. It kept blowing back into the shore. We were just out for about 3 minutes of our 30 minute rental and asked if we could trade to a 2 person boat for the remainder of our time in the hopes that less wight and a higher ratio of peddlers would allow us to get out in the lake a bit. The staff member told us we would need to go to the front office and get approval from an administrator to change boats. He offered to charge us for another half hour if we wanted to give another boat a try. We were, to the best of my knowledge, the only people renting at the time, so it seems like it would have been easy to let us switch. Our kids were very disappointed that it did not work, and my husband and I felt just a bit disgusted with inflexibility.

We did not know what portion of the resort we would be staying until we arrived. After reading some of the reviews on Trip Advisor we made a point of requesting the River Island, which was near the big pool with the lazy river. The girl at the front desk was very nice and did an excellent job of helping us. The only shock was that it cost us an extra $300+ dollars for the \"upgrade\" despite the fact that we did not increase the size of our room. We were warned about this charge though and chose to spend the extra money to make the most of our vacation. The room was clean and well planned, however the quality of the appliances was incredibly poor. It was impossible to get the dishes clean in the dishwasher, so plan on handwashing. Honestly though, this is not something I would consider a major problem. The major problem that we found was when we first arrived in our room, we all noticed that you could here every word that anyone outside the building was saying, even in a normal tone of voice. It was so bad that I was convinced that someone had left a window open, but after inspecting all the windows, I found that this was not the case. Again, I thought that this would not be a huge problem because the pool hours ended at 10:00 pm. I failed to consider that this poor sound quality of the walls. On one night in particular we came back to our room at about 4:00pm and noticed noise coming from the room above us. It was a rythmic thumping sound which we assumed was someone playing music, so we decided not to concern ourselves with it, hoping that it would soon end. By 11:00pm the noise was louder than ever, and I decided that it was time to call customer service. They said that this was the third complaint that they had about this and the manager had been called to talk to the people involved. Another hour passed. Still the noise remained and I called again. I talked to a new person that seemed uninformed of the problem so I explained again. They said that security would check into it. By 1:30pm the noise was still there and our telephone in our room rang. It was from security letting me know they were still looking into it. I informed them as politely as I could that I would not like to be called anymore at this hour to avoid waking my young children. Some time later I fell asleep dispite the noise, and woke at around 7:30 and the noise was still there. There was never any attempt to follow up or make things right from anyone on the staff. I now suspect that the noise was something mechanical in the building itself, because it was a consistant thumping sound that persisted for almost a full day. When we returned to our room later that evening the sound was finally gone. The rest of our stay was fairly uneventful. I can not speak for the quality of the restaurants or other facilities. After ordering two tiny mixed drinks at one of the poolside bars and being charged over $18 (the tip was automatically added) I was in no hurry to see what everything else would cost. I try not to be cheap on my vacations, but I don't like being taken advantage of. All in all, I have be far more impressed by other places I have stayed. However, this was not the worst place I have been. I don't think that I would bother going back, but if you are a sound sleeper, and don't drink (or are used to paying top dollar for tiny dixie cups full of mostly ice) then this place is not too bad.

We were able to check into our room at 1pm. I was told about my gift, but again we were on a tight schedule and made it clear that we did not have any time to view the property. Offered $75.00 credit to a location resturant or credit could be used within Disney. Again, we could not spare the time. They understood and pretty much left us alone.

Our screened in balcony overlooked the golf range. We took advantage of the pool and lazy river. Glad to read the reviews so I was prepared to pay for our floats. Water was a little chilly (we did get to the pool late afternoon), but still enjoyable. Did not have the opportunity to eat on premise, but plenty of resturants to choose from on route to Orange Lake. We did do a little grocery shopping at the Publix and cooked breakfast every morning. Plenty of supplies for a longer stay including laundry detergent, dish washing liquid, bath soap and lotion. Plenty of towels. After a long day at Magic Kingdom (the park closed at 1:30AM) , it was a pleasure to spend my last morning relaxing in the jacuzzi in the master bedroom. Got my aching legs and feet feeling back to normal. Security was wonderful. We realized that we LEFT OUR DOOR OPEN, when leaving the room.

As it all turned out, we were provided with a great Customer Service agent who happily refunded a large part of our weekly bill for the problems we had with the water and the lack of service. It did take some arm-twisting to get someone to review the issue, even after 'Rose' departed after seeing the issue. I think in some ways, Rose was just a measure to make us think it was being looked after, but maybe not. Rating the Lagoon area: The huge lazy river was pretty cool, gave us some exercise while relaxing. At any one time, i never saw both slides open and had issues with keeping track of my 5 y/o and 7 y/o boys as the slide where we entered was never open, the slide near the residents of the Poolside Rooms seemed to be opened all the time. Not a big deal, but something to note. The fact that we were not allowed to bring in any floating device for our kids was a bit questionable but can be understood for safety issues, however, nothing was said about our special needs childs life-vest and we were happy about that. Would have loved to have had a tube at a reasonable rate so I could have floated but I am not going to pay the prices they were asking. As an Owner, should have a bit of leeway for my investment. We were given the opportunity to eat breakfast one day at the restaurant and found ti to be equitable and bit more personal than Golden Corral, and nice to have someone there know us too.

We don't like when somebody puts a sale pressure on us, it's just ruined our day, we spent there almost 2 hours for nothing, our time was wasted!!!! and the sales person said we had to or the will charge us additional $400 for the stay, why? We paid a lot already! Plus at the very end of the sales even, when we made it very clear, that we won't buy any time share there, 3 people saw us!!! And the last manager even asked if we won't buy at least something. WHY DO WE HAVE TO BUY, WHY? The money we paid for this vacation was a mistake, will never use Holiday Inn hotels, just because of this unpleasant stay. Also the resort is very old, it's not worth what they are asking for the stay. The rooms are 20 at least years old. All electronics are very old, furniture is old, everything is old! If you're looking for a place to stay close to Disney, you have a lot of other options! My verdict, will never stay at Holiday Inn!", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cNice Property, Bad Timeshare Experience\u201d", "Author": "family4florida", "ReviewID": "UR121067686", "Content": "Property Pros: Large size two bedroom villa, in North Village, older unit but clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Lots of things to do. Wonderful family comedy show on Wed evening in property restaurant. Resort restaurants reasonably priced and food tasty. Fun family atmosphere. Property Cons: Room smelled of mildew on the first day, odor less after that day. Lazy river, putt putt golf, etc, all cost extra. Now for our timeshare experience . . . We were greeted by a pleasant lady who was very obviously \"schooled\" in what to say. She quickly took us away from the initial meeting place, where our car was, and continued her presentation to us while shuttling us on a golf cart to another area of the resort. After a quick tour of the resort and showing us the models, she took us to a conference room and continued to present pricing to us. After we told her that we would think about what she presented to us, because this was our first experience hearing about a timeshare, she thanked us for listening to her presentation and said that she had to get her manager to \"stamp\" us out so we could leave. Her manager, after I saw him speaking angrily to someone in the back, I couldn't see who it was, but it was probably our salesperson, came over to our table. He acted like he was having us evaluate our salesperson and was rather patronizing to her, in front of her, but quickly began offering even lower pricing that she had offered, if we bought the timeshare that day. After we made it clear again that we are not the type of people to buy something this large so quickly, he excused himself saying that someone else would be coming to \"stamp\" us out so we could leave. The next salesperson came to our table and presented even less pricey options available if purchasing that day, but after we once again declined to buy, he asked us if we got our gift. He excused himself saying that someone else would be by to give us a gift. By this point, we were more than ready to pick up our children from the arcade where we left them more than 2 hours ago, so we left the building. Unfortunately, we didn't know how we would return to the first parking lot where our car was because we were quite a distance away. We reentered the building and ran into the last two salespersons who we had seen, one of which shouted to the other, \"They don't get a gift. They are not buying. Show them out to the shuttle.\" This was all said in a rather angry voice. Well, if there was any chance that we would consider buying a timeshare from Holiday Inn Resort, that chance went out the window. Our initial saleswoman acted clueless as far as what was happening with the managers and how they were treating us,and I say \"acted,\" because she certainly knew what was happening. She also had the nerve to tell us several times during the presentation that she was a top salesperson, \"high on the food chain\" at the resort. Well, none of the salespersons at this resort are doing anything worthwhile by treating people without respect. Sales hit a new low here.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maesteg, Wales", "Title": "\u201cExcellent resort, wonderful people\u201d", "Author": "Anorak Ray", "ReviewID": "UR121024244", "Content": "This was our first visit to the USA and we were not sure what to expect but the excitement and expectation levels were very high. We arrived at the resort quite late on the Saturday evening after a round-the-houses trip dropping others off at various resorts around the area. Check-in was a breeze and the lady on reception soon had someone organised to take us to our accommodation in the East Village. We were expecting a villa or condo so were a bit taken aback to be dropped off at an apartment block. On entering the apartment, however, we were somewhat stunned at the size of it. This is a very big resort, over 1200 acres I was told, and we had not hired a car, relying instead on external shuttles to get us to the parks (more later). Within the resort, there is an excellent free shuttle bus service and we never waited more than a few minutes for one to arrive. The drivers are friendly and chatty and will usually stop when going in the opposite direction to make sure that you are waiting on the right side of the road. They will also make detours to take you where you are heading for rather than just dropping you at the nearest stop. I am probably getting them into trouble for writing that but it is just another example of the excellent service which they provide. Coming back to the apartment, apart from the standard items provided, e.g. crockery, linen, towels, etc, you will also find packs of coffee, tea, sugar, creamer, salt and pepper, dish washing liquid, dishwasher powder, washing powder and toiletries. We had a 2 bedroom \u2018villa\u2019 which had an open plan kitchen, lounge and dining area. The kitchen had a decent sized fridge/freezer as well as a dish washer and electric stove. The balcony was enclosed in netting to keep out the insects which, I imagine, would be very good in the hot season. The main bedroom had a king-sized bed in it and the en-suite bathroom had a spa bath, shower, basin and a private toilet \u2013 i.e. its own door to ensure privacy if it was being used while someone was in the bath. The other bedroom had two queen sized beds plus the usual plentiful storage space. The inner hallway had a washing machine and dryer hidden behind folding doors. Needless to say, it was air conditioned. There is a small outlet on the resort where you can pick up bread and milk and a limited quantity of groceries if you are doing your own catering. I would recommend, however, that you rather get the shuttle down to the main gate and then cross the I192 (carefully) and go to Walgreens where there is a much bigger selection at a much, much lower price. Alternatively, get the shuttle to the East Gate and then continue down the access road (about 10 minutes) to Publix (I think that is how it is spelt) where, again, prices are much lower. In the restaurants and bars, I thought prices were high but they seemed to be much the same elsewhere so I guess it is just a very expensive area. (As an aside, at the airport, for a glass of wine and a \u2018premium\u2019 beer, we were charged over $23 which is ridiculous. If the menu had shown the prices, we would have had something else!) The facilities in the resort are excellent and plentiful. Three very good golf courses and plenty of swimming pools, slides, etc all around. The tennis courts appeared to be well utilised and I saw plenty of people using the gym so I imagine it is also up to scratch. There are also 2 putt-putt courses. There are facilities in the main reception area to access the internet (25c per minute/75c per printed page), and to purchase tickets to the parks and transport. We used Mears Shuttles to get from the resort to the parks. The price was usually $19 per person plus the ubiquitous tip at the end of each journey. To Epcot, it was slightly cheaper at $16 per person. This does not sound much but it adds up when you are using them every day, especially if you are there for a couple of weeks. It was nice to relax and let someone else do the driving, though. Don\u2019t believe any of the prices on the resort web-site for transport as they are terribly out of date. An unexpected bonus was being able to sit on the large balcony every evening and watch the 8pm firework display from one of the Disney parks. The later ones could be heard but not seen as they were taking place behind other apartment blocks in the village. I guess it all hinges on which block you are in as to which one you will be able to watch. We were a bit apprehensive about being subject to the time share hard sell but it was not raised once during our stay. All in all, it is a fantastic resort and I could write loads more. The people working on site are very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. I would recommend this resort to anyone. The only reason why I have not given the resort 5 stars is that I felt that prices in the market place and for some of the amenities were near rip-off level.

Promises of massive reductions on tube hire for the pools and access to the slides if we attended. $30 fee if you agree to meeting but don't turn up. We were told it would be 90 minutes but on arrival at the meeting were told we could expect at least 2 1/2 hours!! Managed to get out of it and not charged $30 fee because they kept us waiting for over 30 minutes for salesman. We did use the pools but there were plenty of loose tubes anyway and the slides were not worth the fee! Only advice (if you do not want a timeshare) would be do not agree to the sales pitch as the rewards, for us, would not have been worth it anyway and we wasted 1/2 a day of our holiday.

Everyone was delighted with all the opportunities for fun, relaxation, and family time. Our 2 BR unit is North Village was newly, attractively decorated and pristine. Kitchen was well equipped for the casual meals we prepared. I did bring, as always, an electric griddle with me and find it so useful. We were on the lighted golf course and enjoyed our screened patio for drinks nightly, plus the little girls could run off steam if no golfers were present. We enjoyed the views of sandhill cranes and got no odors from the Animal Kingdom. The multiple pools were a huge success for our girls, except for the six year old who was not allowed on the tubular slide at the Lazy River pool; she was a half inch shorter than her eight year old sister. We thought this policy was too restrictive since she is an excellent swimmer and has been on far more challenging water slides. But..she enjoyed tubing the Lazy River. The huge slip and slide and trampoline bungee were also a daily must. We bought the weekly package for that and got our money's worth. We suggest the resort add another, larger covered area since the sun was beating down on us and the one covered area only held six people. If the kids had to wait in line, they were standing in hot sun. Re: Beds. My daughter did find the bed very hard. I was not bothered by it. I have no idea how to resolve the personal preferences for mattresses and pillows. I bring my own pillow. We did not do any dining, but had casual pool food and drinks. The resort grounds appear meticulously maintained and landscaped. Deer and interesting birds appear everywhere. The location is very convenient to all the theme parks and shopping. I have only two minor negative remarks: On arrival at the villa, there were ants by the hundreds streaming under the patio door and up the walls inside the villa. We immediately reported it to housekeeping but no one responded. We brushed the ants outside as best we could and stuffed towels under the door. When no one came by dinnertime, we went to the store and bought ant spray. We sprayed every day and that solved the problem. However, over the course of the week, I was bitten three times by a stray ant who was hiding in the carpet. I could have been more demanding with Housekeeping but just let it go. Our smoke alarm went off and maintenance was as our door in a flash to fix that. Re: sales pitch. At check in, we were handed two coupons and told they were a discount for tubing and the slip and slide since we were RCI. We were then guided by a smiling agent over to the \"cashier\", we thought. But a young man launched into a sales pitch for the tour. Honestly, we didn't see it coming. So we politely said, \"no thanks\" but we'll just buy the tubing pass at the regular price. He immediately dropped the friendly banter and just turned away rudely. Not necessary. We were not even looking for a freebie. This was a minor unpleasantness in an otherwise pleasant arrival. We did not receive robo calls all week. I would return here quite happily. Your kids will love it.

It is convenient to Disney, Universal, and Sea World parks, among others. There are plentiful activities onsite, including golf, minigolf, pools, lazy river, and many more. The units are regularly updated, large and comfortable. Staff are friendly and helpful. At checkin, particularly if you are not an owner, there is a semi-high pressure push to take the tour - aka, to suffer the sales pitch... but that's pretty routine at these places. Just say no - and persist - unless you are, in fact, considering buying. So, what's the gorilla, you ask? The facility absolutely MUST improve room cleaning staff. Cleanliness of units has taken a major step backwards over the last half-dozen years. Hotel staff must check and recheck in out-of-site areas, which is clearly not being done anymore. Rooms are always updated and pleasant to walk into - but under the surface... well, take my word for it, and stop here, or read on for details. In my last 3 visits, two have had unacceptable 'findings.' 3 years ago, the 'finding' involved my nephews finding what I'll term 'adult paraphernilia' under a bed. In a location easy enough for anyone - including cleaning staff - to find by simply lifting a bed skirt. This same year, we had issues with mildew/growth accumulating around jets in the jacuzzi tub. This is a tough issue, granted, but that is not an acceptable excuse. This must be regularly cleaned. Our next visit was much better, without any incidents. Pleasant and comfortable, as had our previous half dozen years (prior to the above-mentioned experience) been. This year, however, we were greeted by an amphibian under our bed. When I grabbed him to free him outside, he literally dissintegrated in my hand. He must have been there for weeks, if not longer... So, the issue persists. I have, and will continue, to encourage Orange Lake to improve cleanliness. It is a wonderful facility, which is above such issues. I would never accept these problems at a hotel - and they should not even be a possibility at a luxury resort. Once this issue is addressed - and I believe it will be - I will once again give Orange Lake the 5 stars that it used to be. One more thing, added by my wife: the interest in staying in touch is thoughtful, but unnecessary. We come back to our room everyday to a message.

The easy ones to spot and dodge were the 3-foot tall black birds stacked up as many as 60 deep on the roof peak on the unit...they were just annoying and like having a \"Tower of Terror\" experience without going to Disney. But the more distressing were the vultures in the form of \"tele-marketers\" calling our unit to pressure us into a sales presentation. We are regular timeshare travelers with enough weeks and points to have plenty of experience of being treated in all kinds of different ways in a wide variety of settings. The Holiday Inn Vacation Staff takes the cake in terms of shameless pressure. Having scanned a few reviews from others on Trip Advisor, I can assure you the experiences they mention were shared by us as well (front desk shuffle, the \"$20 gift\" usable only off-property with a 3 or 4-day pass to a park, and the cold shoulder once you politely explain, \"we're here on vacation and aren't interested in a sales presentation\"). The \"new technique\" we faced at this timeshare is having a computerized robo-phone call to the unit about 4 times per hour. Starting on day two, the phone rings four times--no message--and these calls continued from 8:30 am through the afternoon. For a day or two we just ignored the phone ringing, knowing it was more sales calls. Finally, once we answered the phone it turned into an argument about how this was a \"welcome call\" and \"we can make it worth your while\" if you come to a sales presentation. Going to the front desk on the way out later that day to discuss this only met with more exotic explanations....\"how do you know all those hang-up calls were not housekeeping asking if you wanted more towels?\" Oh yeah, and the odors...the shuttle bus driver warned us that the \"aroma\" was from Animal Kingdom. It was a nightly reminder of nature, but not of the animal variety. Check out Google Maps and you will find a very large human sewage treatment plant just behind the tree line behind the East Village at Orange Lake. I think we understand now what attracts the 100 or so vultures to the back of the property. Overall, the resort is very attractive and the units are above average.

This primary purpose of this trip was to attend the wedding of a niece whose family lives in the area. We stayed in a 3-bedroom villa in The North Village. It is the same type of unit we own, and cost less in points than our yearly allotment. We had 6 adults in our party (7 for 2 nights) and everyone had ample space and privacy. We ate most of our meals there, and it was a perfect home base for all activities leading up to the wedding on 11/11/11. The unit was right on the Legends Walk course. I was the only golfer in the group and I\u2019ll detail my golf experiences at Orange Lake Resort and surrounding area later in this review. Before coming this time, I decided to look for some recent reviews, and was pleased to see most still thought the place fantastic but there was 1 resounding negative theme: the hard sell, high pressure tactics to attend a sales meeting or owner update meeting. I have found this to be true in the past as well. So I went in with the mind set that at check-in, the person checking us in would know that for this trip we did NOT want to attend any \u201cowners updates\u201d. We upgraded from a 2-bedroom villa to a 3-bedroom villa on our last visit and saw no need to be bothered with any of that stuff this time. Much to my amazement she said, \u201cI just learned how to do that today, so you won\u2019t receive any sales calls to your villa\u201d. She was very cordial and the check-in was quick and painless. At the end she stapled some kind of a $20 voucher on the check-in folder. I said we\u2019re not interested again and left the counter and walked straight out of the door to my car. People insisting that I needed to \u201credeem\u201d my voucher as I had read about in a review on this site did not accost me. We did not receive any sales calls per se, but we did receive a phone call from someone who said they were our point of contact if we decided that we would like to attend an owner update or needed anything else while at OLR. My wife took that call and told her thanks but no thanks. That was after the phone had rung twice before and upon my answering a recording said, \u201cplease hold for a Orange Lake representative\u201d I waited about 10 seconds and then hung up. Same thing 20 minutes later, this time I hung up right away. If you want to call me, be on the other end of the line. I am not going to talk to you at your convenience. I am on VACATION. I think it is rude and disrespectful to make calls in this manner to your guests. My Customer Service Rating: Excellent Check-in experience Check-in time 5:30pm on Sunday The 3-bedroom villas in The North Village are very nice. They are a bit older and in need of some minor repairs and upgrades. There are TV\u2019s in every room, but they are the ancient CRT type. OLR needs to upgrade to flat screens TVs and HD programming. I believe people are beginning to expect that type of TV unit in accommodations above Motel 6 level. There is high speed Internet wifi in the units. I was able to connect my android phone and my ipod touch to the wifi without issue. I did, however, have trouble navigating past the terms and conditions page with my laptop. A nephew staying with us had no problems with his. I called Resort Services and was transferred to their IT department. The tech I was connected with actually in PA. He was very professional and knowledgeable, but was unable to solve my problem that evening and would have to submit a ticket. He said someone would contact me the next day. I did not hear from IT again. I didn\u2019t pursue the issue because we did have access via various devices and having MY laptop operational wasn\u2019t critical. Still, no one called. I did not have any issues using this same laptop on my previous stay in the west village. Another really nice thing about these units is that the 3rd bedroom is down a long hall away from the living room area and other bedrooms. We call it the \u201cin-law suite\u201d. The bedrooms are large and have great closet and drawer space. The master bedroom has a King size bed and a spacious bathroom with a walk in shower and also a Jacuzzi type tub. The 2nd bedroom has 2 double beds and is right next to another bathroom. The washer and dryer are in that area as well. The in-law suite has 1 double bed and a pull-out sofa bed, along with its own bathroom, which is kind of smallish but adequate. The beds were firm but not uncomfortable. My biggest complaint is with the pillows. Everyone in our group agreed that the pillows were too thick and hard. There were no other choices. I stayed at several Holiday Inn Express hotels this past summer and they have choices of pillows. They even have fancy sashes around them saying Soft or Firm. I think Holiday Inn Vacation Club should adopt the same type of thing at their resorts. The kitchen has just about everything you need to prepare a full home cooked meal. The appliances in our unit were older. The toaster was in need of replacement and was only a 2 slice type. I think the 3-bedroom units should have 4 slice toasters. It just makes more sense. The icemaker worked great and the counter space is good with numerous electrical outlets so you can plug in all of the devices of today\u2019s life. There are stores and restaurants very near by. The nearest useful Starbucks is in the Super Target just south of the east entrance. The Starbucks in The Market on the resort is limited in their drink options. We only used Paisan Pizzeria on the resort for pizza one night. We used a coupon given to us in the check-in folder. 2 xl pizzas for $25. I remember the pizza being better from this place before they moved it out of the main west village building to the Market, but it\u2019s still OK. It was a good value with the coupon. Customer Service Rating: Very Good Pick \u2013up quick, ready in 15 minutes. I didn\u2019t check the pizzas before leaving, discovered mistake on 1 pizza, not a big enough mistake to complain about. The units have a covered patio that is nice. They have a table and chairs so you can enjoy the beautiful weather while dining. The units are non-smoking and this patio is just fine if you do. There are no ashtrays in the units, so you\u2019ll have to make do with what is available or bring your own. Another big concern we have is that there is no apparent recycling effort ongoing at the resort. We generated a lot of bottles and cans of various beverage types during our week stay. We took them to Super-Target, which has some small bins for recycling. OLR could start a recycling program and then tout itself as a \u201cGreen\u201d resort. Also very disappointed that activity pass that used to be offered is no longer available. The mini-golf activities on the resort are now very over priced. Checkout is 10am on the final day of your stay that could be made a little more generous. Housekeeping crews didn\u2019t rush us as I saw mentioned in reviews. Checkout was quick and efficient. Customer Service Rating: Excellent No waiting in line. I asked to put the stuff I had charged using the room key on to a different card. That was handled efficiently and quickly. I was on my way in no time. All in all if you are going to Orlando and not staying at Disney, but still want to go there and/or other attractions, Orange Lake Resort is a fantastic place to stay. It is a quiet, restful environment away from the hustle and bustle of the parks and has its own qualities. Just remember it is a time-share Resort and they want to sell people on the benefits of ownership. You will need a car to get around if you have big off resort plans. I think the Orlando area is pretty easy to get around in if you take the trouble to familiarize yourself with a map of the major roads. This rest of this review is about my golf experience at Orange Lake Resort this trip. We have been owners at OLR&CC since April of 2002 and 1 of the main reasons I bought into this was the golf courses here at Orange Lake. I thought since we would probably come and visit relatives here from time to time, why not have a great place to stay and squeeze in some golf around other family activities over the years. I had the pleasure of playing the courses before the Crane\u2019s Bend course was built out of the original Resort course. I think it was 27 holes then. The new configuration of the Resort and Crane\u2019s Bend is very nice. Overall the golf at Orange Lake is great. This trip I played The Legends on Monday afternoon. Legends Walk on Tuesday night and Friday morning, The Resort course early Weds. On Thursday I ventured over to Orange County National and played the Panther Lake course. OCN is a golfer\u2019s die and go to heaven kind of place. Look it up. I wish I had had more time to be able to use the facility more. It is only 15-20 minutes and $2.50 in round-trip toll away using SR417, which is very accessible from OLR. It was well worth the seasonal rate of just under $80 with tax. It is has also been the site of the PGA Q-School finals, most recently in 2010. Back to golf at Orange Lake Resort, The Legends is a very nice course, kind of tight, but playable if you keep it straight. Greens were smooth and not lighting fast but still have to pay attention. I got my tee-time off of golfnow.com for $31 plus tax. I had always just paid the owner\u2019s rate and not checked for deals before. It is well worth that kind of a deal if you can get it. I have never had trouble getting a time to play here as a single. Nice driving range, GPS on the carts. Pro shop had the kind of soft spikes I needed. I played with some very nice folks from Scotland, who weren\u2019t staying at the resort, but liked the course from a previous visit and stay at ORL and found the golfnow deal online as well. Saw an alligator along the lake on 16. Biggest one I\u2019ve seen yet on that course. Customer Service Rating: Just OK Upon arriving, greeted at bag drop, clubs taken and put on a cart. I told them my tee time was in 45 minutes. Pro shop guy was great, let me borrow spike wrench to put in my new spikes. Hit some range balls. Arrived at #1 tee, 5 minutes before scheduled tee time, there was a group hitting off tee. NO STARTER in the area, so I didn\u2019t know if that was my group or not. Turned out it was and when the starter did show up, he didn\u2019t seem very concerned or know what was going on with the people now lining their carts up. He just, at one point, threw his hands up and said I quit, then got on the radio to try to figure out what was going on. Eventually I tee off and catch my group on the first green. It took 4:15 to play the 18. That was one of the faster rounds I\u2019ve played there. That includes ordering a cheeseburger on the 9th tee via the GPS system and stopping to pick that up at the grill. Service there was quick, not very friendly, but quick. Only saw the cart girl once on the 4th hole. She told us it would be are only chance that day. The Legend\u2019s Walk course is a great lighted Par3 course. From \u201cthe tips\u201d it plays long enough. It is very easy to walk and is great for kids. I played by myself one night and it is pretty cool. Played though a couple of groups with small kids along, Perfect place for a very leisurely 9 holes. Played in 1:05. First one out on Friday morning at 8:50 finished in 1:15 playing as a twosome with my nephew who arrived for the wedding later that day after his own little golf excursion in the space coast area. Each round cost just over $15 with tax. Customer Service Rating: Excellent This was as no hassle as it gets. Walked in, said I wanted to play 9. They ask \u201cneed clubs\u201d, I say no, pay them and tee off within 5 minutes. Staff very pleasant during both visits. The Resort Course is my favorite course at OLR. It is a little more playable than the Legends course for the average golfer, but is a nice test of golf. Greens and fairways are great. They used to have a drainage problem over on the southeast side of the course and I think that is why Crane\u2019s Bend was built and the Resort course modified. The practice facility is great, didn\u2019t utilize it this trip but have in the past. Customer Service Rating: Excellent Greeted upon arrival, no starter problems here. Staff friendly and attentive before and after round. I didn\u2019t play Crane\u2019s Bend this trip but it is also a really nice par 30 9-hole course.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time!\u201d", "Author": "Scottsally", "ReviewID": "UR120584356", "Content": "Just returned from a 2 week stay at River Island, part of Orange Lake resort.

I used my Priority Club points for this stay. We chose this site to take our sons to celebrate their birthdays as well as attend Universal Studios. When we arrived at the resort, we were greeted warmly and well. When we got to our room, we found that there were some toiletries and soap supplies missing. We did contact Resort Services the materials were delivered as promised. We were not prepared for the rest of the evening. We were very uncomfortable with the beds this time. We have never had this trouble before, but the beds in the room, both the master and 2nd bedroom were very uncomfortable. We did not have enough blankets to soften the bed. Our son was so uncomfortable that he spent the night on the couch. When we spoke with first the desk clerk and then the resort services representative, they thanked us for the information that would help them make their place better. I could tell very quickly that they were in neither the position nor authority to help us other than to take down our concerns. They asked us if we had spoken to anyone at the time we discovered issues with the beds. But at 2 in the morning, what can be done? Do we gather all our stuff up and move to another room in the middle of the night? We did the best we could. It would have been nicer to have had the comfort with which we have become accustomed in our previous stays at Orange Lake. We were also told we would get a survey which we could fill out that would help the resort improve their service. At no time did they offer to find a manger to help us with our issue. It was unfortunate that we could help the resort improve its service in the future, but they missed the chance at that moment to improve their service to us. Later in the afternoon after checkout, I called the Resort Services office to find someone with whom I could address my concerns. I did speak with a lady who took down my comments. She was gracious and understanding. She did promise that a manager would contact me, but I have yet to hear from the manager. We have always enjoyed our experiences at Orange Lake, often using my Priority Club points for the stays. I am also a property holder at Orange Lake. Sadly, this did not help me find anyone at the site to help resolve my concern. I have always been proud of my association with Priority Club and the properties of the Intercontinental Hotel Group. However, this was a very sad experience not only for the lack of comfort in the accommodations, but more so in the severe lack of personal customer service at the conclusion of our stay. I honestly feel that I wasted my Priority Club points this past weekend at the Orange Lake Resort, Orlando. I am still looking for someone in authority with whom I can express my concern. I would appreciate speaking to someone as soon as possible. I will send this same letter to the management at Orange Lake, hoping that there will be someone who can get back to me.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cGreat getaway vacation!\u201d", "Author": "foxjcw", "ReviewID": "UR120504872", "Content": "Our friends invited us to join them for a week at their timeshare. We stayed in a two bedroom condo on the sixth floor in the River Island section of the resort. The master bedroom had a private bath and the second bedroom had a bathroom with two entrances - one from the bedroom and a pocket door into the laundry nook (that leads to the entrance/kitchen area). The condo had a deck overlooking the pool area with a table and four chairs. The deck had a half wall and was screened in above that so you had to stand up to get a good view. We played regular golf, miniature golf, swam, tubed in the \"river\", sat in the hot tub and used the exercise room. All were in excellent shape and everything was in working order. The resort was clean and well cared for. The shuttle drivers were friendly and the entire staff went out of their way to be helpful. We made a few breakfast meals using the kitchen, made sandwiches for lunch and had appetizers and cocktails before heading out to dinner each evening. The appliances were inexpensive apartment quality but did the job for the few times we used them. We had a slight service problem with the dishwasher, but when we called to report the issue they had someone at our door within 15 minutes and it was fixed and ready to go in another 15 minutes. Supplies that were running low were quickly and politely replenished. The pool area is large and there are great places for kids and adults to sun and play. The public restrooms were clean and bright and there were plenty of options for shopping, buying a snack or ordering a drink. All charged to your room or a credit card - no cash accepted. We played the Legends golf course and it was beautiful with GPS carts. The Reserve is an older course and more central in the resort (i.e. shots off the mark can end up in people's yards). No GPS carts at Reserve. The miniature golf is basic but well maintained. Each side of the resort has two 18 hole courses so there are 72 different holes of miniature golf you can play.

The booking process was easy using my points but the website was not very good at explaining the differences from west/east village, or lazy river and so on. Each area of the resort has different items to offer. We simply wanted to be near a pool and took the two bedroom west village villa. Arrival was easy and our villa was ready. There was the usual hassle of booking a \"time share tour\" for which the resort held a $30 deposit that would be charged if we didn't show up. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. There were some issues on arrival at our villa. The thermostat was broken making it difficult to hold a reasonable temperature and the shower head in the master bath had virtually no pressure. Both issues were reported to maintenance but were never fixed during the 10 day stay. Otherwise, the room was stocked with plenty of towels, extra linen, dishwasher detergent, laundry soap, and everything else you could need while on vacation. Having a patio that looked out onto the large pond was awesome! There was plenty of wildlife to see for a non Florida native including birds, turtles, deer, and even a baby alligator. The time share tour/sales pitch was the usual. When we told our guide that we simply were not interested in buying another unit he was friendly and understanding. The staff provided us with four $10 certificates for use at any store or activity at the resort for our time. The remainder of the week was spent relaxing by the west village pool and hot tub. A bar is located in the gate making exotic drinks easily accessible. The drink prices are in line with a casual style restaurant and there were many \"special of the day\" opportunities to try exotic mixtures. Average drink prices were $4-8 for mixed cocktails and the service was very good. If there has to be two items that make Orange Lake stand out it would have to be the cleanliness and service. Everyplace on the resort is kept very clean by what looks like a large staff of grounds keepers and cleaning crew. Every staff member was very helpful and polite. I wish that Holiday Inn hotels had staff as friendly and well trained as the people at Orange Lake. Check out was as easy as any hotel.

The stench from Animal Kingdom late afternoon/evening is horrendous and we could not sit on the porch to eat or drink as my children were wretching. Positives: Accommodation is clean, spacious and enough room for everyone if travelling with family. Some blocks in East Vilage where away from the stench of Animal Kingdom and located closer to River Island. East Village pool was nice to have a few hours relaxing around and to relax in the Hot tub. River Island was great for families but too far away to walk(15to 20 mins walk) If you can guarantee that you can stay on River Island(where the main pool is) or in a better Villa in the West Village where all the amenities are, then you should be ok.

I had read about the timeshare sales team before leaving the uk but having encountered this at other resorts didnt really see it as a problem. We arrived at the resort at 7pm, after a long time travelling from the uk and still on uk time we were very tired. I went in alone to check in..two check in desks and the signs at both didnt apply to me..i had to ask someone where to check in. Quickly checked in I was handed a voucher for $20 and told i had to get it verified at another desk..i knew this was part of the time share sales and said i wasnt interested. Walking away from the desk i was stopped from exiting by a guy who told me my check in was not complete..i had to get my voucher verified..i said i wasnt interested but was told that i was not checked in until this proceedure was completed. He took me to a desk and handed me a leflet about the fun passes available on the resort and offering me a discount price of four passes for $20 instead of $50 each.. I respectfully declined and said i did not have the finances to invest in time share..to which came the reply it was not a time share sales talk but an information meeting to show me around the resort..i again said i was not interested and he again said it was not timeshare sales..so i pointed out that the leaflet he gave me quite clearly stated \"time share sales\". at this point he handed me a $20 voucher and told me to enjoy my holiday....how ever this was not the end! I was rung everyday 2 or 3 times a day..sometimes as early as 8am! at first i ignored them but answered it once on my last full day at the resort and was again being encouraged to attend..they would give me a room credit for the fun passes that i had already purchased if i attended..after saying no three times I just said goodbye and hung up the phone. Further calls went unanswered. Apart from that we had a good time. We had a villa overlooking the golf course..so close that quite a few times we had golf balls land extremely close to us. We visited all three sets of fun pools and brought the 3day fun passes for $35 each. This enabled us to use the tyres in the lazy river, the hippo slide, rock climbing wall and the golf without additional charge for any three days. It was worth it although i wouldnt have paid for all these things seperately. The kids loved it. We made good use of the pools and the kids loved the slides. Was not keen on the pool by reception but the river island and the other pool was great. Accomodation was very similar to other accomodation we have stayed in in florida, clean and spacious..the curtains were a bit confusing..there is a white net curtain but you have to go behind this to find a white blackout curtain which is what you close at bedtime. Lighting in the bedroom could have been better, you only have bedside lamps which you can turn on by the switch by the door but then if you switch them off from the bed you have to switch them back on from the bed or the light switch will not work. Shuttle service is good and the cashless pay system seemed quite secure..i felt comfortable using it. On the last day...check out was at 10am but as early as 8am housekeeping staff were hovering about. everybody in the blocks around us seemed to be checking out and the staff seemed to be waiting for people to leave..at 8.30 i was phoned by housekeeping asking me what time i would be leaving, 5 minutes later a man came and peered through the windows to see if we were still there and then a black bag or cleaning supplies was left on the doorstep which we had to move out of the way to get out the door. I loved this resort, it was great for relaxing and spending some fun time together but the experience with the time share sales and the house keeping on the last day did spoil the stay and because of this im not sure if i would return again.

The groom recommended that instead of staying at one of the Disney resorts, we should try the Orange Lake Resort in Kissimmee. Straight away I checked on Tripadvisor to see what was the general consensus regarding this facility. For the most part it was pretty positive so we went ahead and booked a 2 bedroom Villa in the water park section of the resort. I did make note that there were a few postings on Tripadvisor mentioning the people around the main lobby trying to sign up guests for time share meetings with the lure of a free gift. We arrived at the hotel late in the afternoon and my wife went into the lobby to register. Armed with the information regarding the free gift, she was ready. When the person at the check-in desk said that she had attached a coupon for a free gift and to go to the counters on the other side of the lobby to collect it, she knew she wasn\u2019t interested. However, on her way to the doors, someone stopped her and told her she needed to get her free gift. When she said she wasn\u2019t interested, they said her check-in was not complete until she got her gift. She just told them that she had checked-in, had her keys and was on her way to her room, and was not staying for a gift she did not want. The resort is absolutely huge, so be sure to get a map or detailed instructions of where everything is especially your accommodations. We arrived at our part of the resort and were disappointed that we did not have a view of the pool; apparently you have to very specific when you book. As it was, our suite was on the ground floor on the parking lot side of the complex, but it did mean we could unload our copious amounts of luggage and take it straight into the room through our own screened porch area. We can only describe the 2 bedroom villa as stunning. It was more than we could imagine. The suite has a fully equipped kitchen with a built-in breakfast bar, a full size washer and dryer, a bedroom with 2 double beds with an ensuite bathroom with shower, a master bedroom with a king-size bed complete with an ensuite bathroom with a shower and whirlpool bathtub. There was a dining area and comfortable living room with a couch, some armchairs and a large flat screen T.V. There were also flat screens in both the bedrooms. Both of our daughters told us they want our next house to be as well thought out as this suite. The water park area was superb to put it mildly. The lazy river that meandered its way around to different pool areas was great. There was lots of seating room around the pools, and there are several restaurants/cafes when you have a thirst for a much needed drink. The only part of the pool area that seemed strange to us was the towel pick up area. It was a long way away depending at which pool you were seated. There may have been more than one pick up point, but if so, we never found it nor was it signposted. We had lunch at one of the poolside restaurants and found the food to be pretty good. It wasn\u2019t the cheapest meal we had in Florida but it wasn\u2019t too bad, especially when compared to eating anywhere at Disney. One thing you may want to careful about is answering the phone in your room. Chances are it\u2019s the time share team trying to arrange your tour of the facility. I made this mistake once; I never answered the room phone again. If it\u2019s something important, they can leave a message. Down the hallway from our room, there was a desk set up that I was sure had something to do with the time shares. Every time we walked past them I was just waiting for them to start. As it was, they always gave us a cheery good morning etc., and that was it. No need to worry after all. The location of the complex is minutes away from grocery stores, restaurants and more gift shops than you can shake a stick at. It is a 10-15 minute drive to most of the Disney parks, but the drive back can be considerably longer depending on the park closing times. On Friday evening it took us over 40 minutes to get back to the complex. Negatives? Only 2 -the \u201cfree gift\u201d issue at check-in and on our last day, with check out at 10:00am, we got a knock on our door at 8:15 \u2013 it was housekeeping wanting to clean the room. When I told them we weren\u2019t ready yet, she demanded to know when we would be ready. I said by 10:00... I did read a report stating that the reviewer\u2019s room had a bug infestation. We checked the room thoroughly and it was absolutely spotless. The only time we did see a bug was when we initially got to the room and I spotted a 1 \u00bd\u201d cockroach walking in from the screened porch area. This was because we had the outside door left open to bring in the cases. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t make it through to see the next day. Would I stay at this resort again? You\u2019d better believe it!

The 1st time was 2008 when Holiday Inn did not own OLRCC. There is a notable difference, some good, some bad. Over all I was again impressed with the resort and what it has to offer it's guests. The grounds are always clean and well cared for, I would say the outside stair wells in the main Clubhouse on the West Side do need to be painted and cleaned. That being said it was very picturesque overall. We had a king-bed room in the clubhouse facing the the interior of the bldg, I believe the same room as 2008. My only complaint with this is that you kinda get cabin fever without being able to see the sun or sky, but it's Florida so most likely you're gonna be outside. The room itself was great, clean spacious and comes with all the amenities that you need. Large mini-fridge, dish washer, toaster oven, kitchen utensils. My complaint would be that the resort has gone cash-less which is to say that you can only pay for things with a Visa or Master card or what ever credit card you use, or you can just put it on the room key and pay at the end of the stay. They do give you the option to pay in cash at the end as well. I just think it's easy to charge stuff and lose track of what you've spent or tallied up. My other complaint would be the lack of house-keeping services in the west club house. We had to request towels everyday due to the fact that they only clean once a week for the rooms in the club house. I'm not sure about the rest of the resort. Breezes bar was good by the pool, they always have something on the go everynight. The drinks are reasonably priced as is the food. The River Island Exchange however I found a little over-priced, my meal was excellent but my girl friend's meal was something to be desired. Kinda dry and cold, I thought pasta was supposed to be served hot or at least warm. The security is great as well, 24hrs a day some one can be found at all the entrances and exits. Some have complained in the past about the time share pitch, I only received one phone call from a lady wondering if I was interested, I politely declined, she persisted going on about all the benefits of being an owner. I told her she would have a better chance of me staying at Orange Lake again and again in the future if she would just understand that I was not interested in becoming an owner and less of a chance of me continuing to stay in the future and as well as possibly checking out early on this trip if she did not respect my privacy and request to not be contacted anymore about a time share, she got the message clearly and I never heard from them again. My other concern is the amount of desk staff they have working at times upon check-in and check-out. Some times there seemed to be plenty of staff but other times only 2 people behind the desk with a lobby full of families waiting for their rooms. Overall the stay was great, the weather could have been better during our time there but we take our chances when we travel. Orange Lake has something to offer for all ages and and sizes of families. I would say that it is a little out of the way for those of you who plan on doing the attractions and shopping close to Universal Studios and the North end of International Drive. Disney is very close, 10 mins away via car. If we head to Orlando next year ( most likely, who am I kidding?

Both times, my stays have been just fine and what I expected. In Oct 2009, I stayed in a two-bedroom villa in the tennis court area.

We spent a lot of time at the resort, using the pools, arcade, dining, etc. and everything was great. I just returned from a week-long stay in a one-bedroom unit in the West Village Clubhouse. Unit was clean and updated with flat-screen TV's. My only complaint about the one-bedroom unit is that we did not have any private outdoor space and the kitchen was more of a kitchenette, with small fridge and toaster oven in lieu of a full sized oven. But for my boyfriend and I, the kitchenette was sufficient for us to make breakfasts and dinners \"at home\". I did get aggravated upon check-in when I was hounded to attend an owners update meeting.

I told him repeatedly that I would not attend this meeting and he still kept badgering me. I'm way too polite to just walk away, which in retrospect, I should have done, so instead I just kept giving a firm no. Nearly ten minutes later, I finally was able to walk away.

I took my daughter, son in law and 4 yr. old granddaughter to Florida for our first time Disney experience. We had a 2 bed, 2 bath unit with kitchen which was well equiped and spotless. It looked like new. I can't say enough about how clean it was. The safe in our room wouldn't lock so I called resort services, a security man was there within 15 minutes. The problem was dead batteries and he assured me it would be fixed by the time we returned from our Disney excursion. It wasn't, so I called the next morning. The same security man showed up and I could tell that he was NOT happy that the batteries hadn't been replaced. He made a call and within a few minutes 2 men showed up and had the batteries replaced in no time. That is as close as I can come to a complaint, and it's really not. Other than that, the complex is huge and extremely well kept. We only had one day to enjoy the pools, of which I think there are 7. I guess one complaint I might have is that they charged to use inner tubes to float on the Lazy River. That seemed a little cheezy for a nice place like this, but didn't cause any real problems as we just enjoyed the pool. There are two entrances to the complex. Right outside the entrance we used was a supermarket and about any type of eating place you could want, as well as shopping of all types and a Super Target. At check in we were offered a $20 voucher for discount tourist places to listen to a sales pitch to get us to take a tour. We were also tempted with discount Disney tickets. I already had a place to buy discount tickets and the prices were close enough that I decided I didn't want to spend my vacation time taking a tour and had a bit of a hard time getting away from the guy. However, we didn't receive any calls as I have read some people complaining about. The $20 voucher wasn't worth the time we spent talking to the salesman. It's only about a 10 minute drive to the Disney parks, which is convenient. I would have no problem recommending this place to friends and family, which, in fact, I have already done.

When you get your first phone call (and they will call) let them know politely but seriously that you're not interetsed in their $25 \"gift\" to spend three hours touring the entire property to buy into a timeshare.They won't call again. We went to Kenndey space center and universal studios. If we didn't have so much to do right on the property, we would have spent a lot more money at disney. This is a great place for families because you feel like it's a vacation home, not a hotel. I'm a jaded New Yorker who's not easily impressed but I can't wait to go with my guys again.

Beyond that, it is clear that the units are very poorly maintained. The balcony had old cigarettes on the ground and the floor had not been vacuumed or swept since the last guests departed.

I\u2019m not a bug expert so I can\u2019t tell you all the different species of bugs we saw, but we saw roaches, spiders, ants, and what appeared to be termites (or some other type of winged insect).

We only go on vacation about every 5 years so I wanted it to be perfect. I almost canceled Orange Lake but then found a fabulous price on Orbit and just had to go with it. We were there for two weeks and it was just the best vacation I can ever remember. We bought the Orlando flex pass which gave us tickets to Universal, Islands of Adventure, Wet n Wild, Sea World and Aquatica. There was sooooo much to do at the hotel that we only spent about half the time at the parks and the rest at the hotel. I love all the pools and different entertainment they offer. Prices are about what you expect for a \"resort\" so kind of expensive but no worse than eating at alot of the tourist traps. We got the 7 day pass for the hippo slide, etc... not worth it for my family. We only used 3 days and ended up giving the passes to another family on our last day. The kids liked the slide but could care less about mini golf so we spent most of our time at the West Village pool (Waters edge). We had a two bedroom which was absolutely perfect. I couldn't believe how big and clean it was. The patio out back was great...wish ours was screened in but other than that it was a great place to hang out at night when it was cooler. No complaints from me what-so-ever and I will definitely go back the next time we get to go to Florida. They could use more shuttles to the parks. We ended up driving every time so we could leave when we wanted rather than get stuck there all day. Which was perfect so we could get back in time for Bingo and Happy Hour ;) We did the timeshare \"speech\" to get 4 free 7-day passes which I think was worth it. So I wasted about 60-90 minutes talking to this wonderful saleswoman who was great to talk to and didn't try to strong arm us into anything.

The first time was ok not perfect but ok enough for a good deal to stay again. The first time we stayed in the newer (MUCH NICER) building s and this time were not so lucky\u2026 When we arrived to check in, there were hardly any people working to check anyone in BUT there were TONS of employees waiting to do the time share scam. So after 25 minutes of waiting in line (only 2 people ahead of me when I arrived), I was helped by a very friendly girl. She was so nice. I politely told her I was not going to stop at the scam desk because now my child was crying in the car. When I turned around, I got jumped by one of the time share people. I nicely explained my situation. She wouldn\u2019t stop and was blocking my exit path. After the 4th plead, I told her no and moved around the other side of her. She ripped off the $20 certificate thing, rolled her eyes, and shoved my room packet at me. We let that go since we knew about it from before. The room was ok but then we walked near the dining room table only to step on dirt and crumbs. So we let that go and cleaned it up. We left and went out. When we came back, I noticed a large roach on the curtain in the master bedroom. Neither of us like roaches and we never had any in our home so we looked for bug spray. Since there wasn\u2019t much to kill it with and it looked like it may fly on a failed attempt, we called \u201cResort Services\u201d. I spoke to the RUDEST customer service person ever. She never one time apologized and simply said they could send pest control in the morning or we could move rooms. Since it was 10:30 at night and the kids were asleep, that didn\u2019t seem like much of an option. So we finally had a plan and killed it. Stupidly, we figured that was the end of it. Next day, we went to the park and then came back to relax. We noticed the pest control company came (what a joke that ended up being). We were watching tv in the master bedroom when my child screamed, \u201cThere\u2019s a huge bug on the bottom of the bed\u201d. I looked and sure enough a different kind of bug. So I got it and thought to myself, \u201cOK, it\u2019s Florida, give it the benefit of the doubt.\u201d We went to the Lazy River only to find out that the stream ends at 6:00 PM. That is insane since most people like to come back from the park and enjoy the lazy river. The last resort we stayed in kept the stream on until the pool closed at 11:00 PM. Warning \u2013 there was a hotel worker taking away all of the tubes that had been paid for and rented at 6:00 PM also. We heard and talked to several guests who were mad about this policy. Much later that night (between 12:00 PM - 2:00 AM), the kids were asleep in the smaller room. We had already decided everyone would sleep in there. To our disgust, we saw a total of 6 more cockroaches! We were able to kill 2 but 4 ran and hid. At that point, we knew it wasn\u2019t safe to be on the road at that time so we sat on the bed watching our kids to make sure no roaches climbed on them. Neither of us slept. We all felt disgusting! I should also add that my brother was staying 2 rooms over and had a spider infestation in his room. I saw that the resort reply indicates all of the roach reviews are \u201cisolated\u201d. Wow \u2013 so is everyone in the same room over and over again??? As soon as the kids woke up, we dressed them and made sure their shoes were on before they got off bed. We had already loaded the car and we all left. We went to the front desk where we were sent to \u201cResort Services\u201d. A friendly lady at the desk was sympathetic but said that she could only give us $50. We told her that was unacceptable. She left to go talk to a man in a red shirt sitting across the way from us. He could hear us and see us. He kept staring at his computer screen acting like he couldn\u2019t possibly hear us. She whispered with him, but we could hear the conversation. She came back and forth 3 times. Not once during this exchange did this man who had to have been a higher level employee come over to apologize. He just kept staring at his screen. I should have recorded him so he can see how fake it looked. She finally said all they could do was refund one night and at first she wouldn\u2019t refund the resort fees for that night. We don\u2019t feel that covers it especially throwing in how horribly unconcerned the Supervisor was. I told her I was going to contact Holiday Inn corporate when she then informed me that Holiday Inn doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the resort that they merely partner with them.

We had been wanting to take the kids back to Disney World and decided to use this opportunity as a perfect excuse. We were placed in the River Island Village, and from what I understand, these are the NEWEST buildings on the property. We had a first floor unit and that allows you a screened patio with direct access to the parking lot (great bonus)!!! This also puts the lazy river and best pools directly behind your building, so you don't have to walk very far or drive. This is a HUGE property, but River Island is probably the best location of all and close to the rear entrance that conveniently leads out to a Publix grocery store and restaurants. Check-in was quick, the unit was large & clean with flat screen TV's in every bedroom, and the lazy river and pool were fantastic!!! They even have a man made beach area with sand and hammocks tied to palm trees. My only complaint is a few fees that I think should be included. There is a blow-up slide area for children that will cost you extra and you have to rent the lazy river tubes. Access to computers in their \"Business Center\" can be costly and print charges per sheet are ridiculous!!!

On the whole I would say its a great place, although we did have a couple of problems. The resort itself is huge and has two main parts, one with a large pool complex with a lazy river and the other with a couple of pools and the lake beach. There is a shuttle service between the two but driving is probably the easiest way. The rooms were large (4 of us stayed in a studio with 2 queens and a sofabed) and had a small kitchen. The resort is ideally located for Disney, and there are plenty of restaurants, gift shops, minigolf etc places on the 192 Highway that the resort is on. Equally, it is about a 30 min drive to Universal, Seaworld (a bit longer to the airport). The staff were extremely friendly and gave recommendations and directions to a list of places. My only grumble is that we were told we would get our room cleaned in the middle of our stay, however, this did not happen and we had to go and ask for towles, toilet paper etc to keep the room going. As for the time share part of the deal: On check in we were charged an additional 7USD per day for the resort fee, this was not mentioned in my booking (through last minute) but I didnt complain as it was late and I wanted to get to bed. We were then given a 20USD \"voucher\" for the resort (this is only valid if you dont sign up for the tour). However, we were barely given our keys before we were pounced on by the Tour Representatives. These guys sort out the Time Share part of the deal. We were given so much information and prices on theme park tickets, discounted rates on local attractions that I felt extremely overwhelmed, especially after a 9 hour flight. For the tickets we had to attend a 1.5hr presentation. As the rates we were given for the tickets were pretty good we agreed. The presentation was in fact 3 hours long, and whilst the first person who gave us a tour was lovely, we were passed on to a further 3 people (all, we were told, would give us our tickets- this wasn't the case) before eventually getting our tickets- which were not tickets but vouchers for tickets we had to change up at the resort desk- we were explicitly promised actual tickets. The only thing I can recommend here is to be prepared. Just an FYI on this but the Disney tickets we were promised were Hopper tickets and those were not the ones given to us. We only discovered this when trying to get into another Disney park after already using the ticket once that day. We had to come back to the resort and explain our case to 3 different people before it was eventually sorted out. However, all were very helpful and apologetic.

About 30 minutes from the airport. The condo was a little far from the entrance of the resort, but we heard that usually the newer units are usually not close to the front. There's a guard at the gates who checks for your parking sign in the car so it was nice to have that added security.

We have always shopped in Publix when here before, but we ventured across the main road to Super Target this time and found the food much cheaper and better quality. Would recommend this for any Brits. The Bahama Breeze across the road is also excellent (best meal we had). All the staff in our building were fabulously friendly and welcoming.

Our villa had granite countertops, modern decor, a flat screen TV in the living room. I read other reviews and saw posted pics on tripadvisor of outdated rooms that I would have been very disappointed to have been checked into!! I was so pleased with the overall look and comfort of our villa. We spent mornings sipping coffee on the rear patio, which backed up to the golf course and was so private and serene. Make no mistake...this place is quite family oriented, but our group of 4 adults had a blast! There's a nice golf course, but we spent most of our time on the property at the lazy river. This is such a nice feature, though it did tend to get pretty crowded at times, and snapping up enough lounge chairs (and/or table w/ umbrella if you're lucky enough!) was a challenge on most days. At the pool area, there was a very attentive wait staff each day that would make the rounds and take drink & snack orders. They were all incredibly polite and courteous and the drinks were always ice cold & delicious! There are 2 walk-up bars as well. Tradewinds had some great entertainment one evening- a sort of comedic musician that really got the crowd involved in the fun. We came to Orlando mainly to stay at the resort and visited just one theme park on 2 separate days during the whole week. The 5 days that we spent exclusively at the resort were fantastic. Having a rental car was absolutely essential. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, but nothing outside the resort is within walking distance, with the exception of a Walgreens that we seemed to visit regularly to stock up on necessities like bottled water and sunscreen. However, it is situated across a very busy highway from the resort, so extra precaution should be exercised if you decide to trek it over there instead of driving. We did not go to any Disney Parks, which were a bit far from the resort. Even further away was Universal Studios, where we spent 2 days. Traffic can be a bear in the area, particularly I-4! You have to time your trips accordingly. We did receive a couple calls about timeshare opportunities, which we declined to entertain, and that seemed to work. We did not attend any of the sales pitches and were not bothered at all to do so. Overall, we have nothing but good things to say about this resort. We would return in a heartbeat and will probably book something for next year! I think we may have an annual tradition in the works! Thanks for a wonderful vacation, Holiday Inn Club Vacations!!

I researched OL before hand so I knew what to expect in terms of fees and pushy sales people. I declined the 20 dollar coupon and ignored the numerous phone calls through the week trying to get you to buy a week at the resort. We stayed in the River Village area which is the fairly newer area and it was spectacular. The room even though it seems you are renting a house, is a room in a 4 story building. The room was spacious , two bedrooms, 1 king bed, 2 double beds, and in living room a pull out queen sofa. It easily sleeps 6. The room was well decorated and it came with 3 TVs and a screened in porch and Jacuzzi in master bath, which there were two bathrooms. The Pool area in River Village was well done. A lazy river that winds throughout the whole complex does not get any higher than 4 feet, so you can feel safe with little ones in it. The tube rentals are 9 dollars a day or you can buy a 3-5-7 day pass which includes mini golf, rock wall climbing, water slides, and trampoline jumping as well as the tubes for prices starting at 35.00 per person for a 3 day pass. The pool complex has 2 bars which serve any drink and it is cashless. You must have your room key to charge, and the drinks are a little steep, but coming from NY, it is the norm.($10 for a 32 oz drink with 3 oz of alcohol and the rest fruit juices, and $8.00 refills) Music is piped in giving that tropical feeling and live music is sometimes at the complex. The eats on River Island is the norm. Seafood, steak, nothing out of the ordinary. A Starbucks and Eddy\u2019s Ice Cream can be found on site as well. A Publix supermarket is right outside the resort for all your shopping needs. The Golf at night is great for little ones as they golf for free and fo them club rentals are free. It is also a lighted course. The Lake at the West Village provides water sports such as jet ski and tubing, which we tied and loved and there is another pool there and restaurant to eat at. The resort is about 5 miles from all Disney Parks and minutes from the chain restaurants if you don\u2019t want to eat on site.

What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! My husband and I along with our two daughters, ages 18 and 21, arrived at the resort around 7:00 p.m. and registered for our room without any delays. There was an additional user fee of I believe $58 when we checked in that I was aware of because of previous reviews. They did offer a $20 coupon to be cashed in and used however we wished at the resort, which when greeted by a representative to cash in we declined per previous user reviews on the site. The coupon is used as a way for them to set up a timeshare appointment. They were very polite about our declining it and told us to enjoy our stay. It was a bit of a drive (very large resort - although there are shuttles a car is definitely recommended) to the East Village from the registration area. While at the resort we received one phone call asking us to sign up for a timeshare tour and I declined. That was the only call we received about timeshares. Everyday a message was left about the daily resort activities. We had a villa in the East Village on 4th floor. It contained a foyer, two nice size bedrooms, bathrooms, living room with a pullout couch, kitchen, dining area, washer, dryer and a screened outdoor patio. Everything was very clean, the beds were made and the rooms were stocked with plenty of kitchen and bath towels, all eating and cooking utensils/ dinnerware, blender, toaster, coffee maker, coffee filters, paper toweling, dish, laundry and dishwasher detergents. The bathrooms each contained a small lotion, shampoo and conditioner. Everyone was very happy with the villa. Restaurants: We ate at both Breezes and The Legacy. Both were good with prices similar with what you would find at Applebee's and supper clubs. Our girls thought the menu items were similar at both places but they had a nice variety of entree's so I didn't see that as a problem. Pools and Villages: We were on a relaxing vacation so the pools was where we spent a lot of our time. Waters Edge at the West Village turned out to be our family favorite and go to pool. There were two separate pool areas, Putt Putt golf, and a beach with sand volleyball. Breezes restaurant and bar was on site so we could grab lunch and drinks at our leisure. The Market Place was also in walking distance of the pool and contained pizza (which you could have delivered poolside) drinks, icecream, sandwiches and small grocery items. If we were to stay here again with teenagers or even just my husband and I this is the village we would stay in. The North Village contained Splash Lagoon which was a beautiful area with small water slides, kiddie pool, water basketball and poolside cafe. This would be a perfect place to stay if you have toddlers through 8 year old's. The East Village was more secluded and contained The Legacy restaurant, two small pools and a very small work out area. A nice place to stay if you want to be away from the action. River Island is beautiful! It contains two pools connected by a lazy river, a couple of water slides, a fun area with volleyball, bungee jumpling and putt putt golf. It also contains a poolside restaurant and bar with live music in the evenings. This area would be perfect for all ages, especially the 7 - preteen years. We are not golfers so we can not comment on that but the golf area's were beautiful. There was a Publix grocery at the entrance of the resort and a Walgreens right across the street. Disney was about 10 minutes away and Universal was about a 20 - 25 minute drive. All in all a great place to stay and we will definitely be returning in the future. Hopefully this review helps!

My best friend and I are 17, and let me tell you that there is SO much to do at this resort, day and night! After returning from the parks, we would go get dinner (either at one of the great on property restaurants or just a few minutes outside the resort) and then go swimming at the west village pool! The reason that this resort is so great for teens is because of the activities and recreation. When we checked in last Saturday, the front desk gave us a copy of the activities. The teen beach bash was that night, and we had a blast. We met kids our age who we ended up hanging out with almost every night. The \"FUN\" activity counselors did a great job in making sure that everybody had fun, and swampy's club was cool too. The area from the lobby to the arcade and pool area is very well decorated. The arcade is so much fun if there is ever a rainy day on your trip! The rooms were amazing...Very clean and spacious. Our room made it very easy for us to get back and forth to the pool and restaurants. Breezes pool bar was great, they had great virgin frozen drinks for kids and live music almost every night. The musician even got us teens to dance! Although we did not have a chance to eat poolside at Breezes Bar and Grille, the food looked pretty good, we'll be sure to try it next time! The resort shuttle was very convenient, since I m not yet old enough to drive the rental car, it made it easier for my friend and I to travel between pools and restaurants (North village, East village, & river island.) After a week of enjoying the parks (which are easy to get to from orange lake,) we decided to spend our last day at river island and then head to downtown disney in the evening. Swampy's character breakfast was good, although it was clearly aimed at children under 12, little kids seemed to enjoy the characters and balloon animals. The hippo slide was awesome, the lazy river was relaxing and great for getting a tan! Also, the massage therapist by the pool was fantastic, and well worth the $15. My only small complaint is the pushy timeshare people. Upon checking in, we were escorted over to the disney ticket area which also had the \"7-day play passes\" stand. We ended up purchasing the 7 day pass which included unlimited mini golf, tubes for the lazy river, the hippo slide, rock climbing, and bungee jumping. Originally upon purchasing these passes, it was only $100 or all 6 of us... which is a great deal for 7 days! The only thing we had to do to receive that deal is attend the RCI meeting... which we did not want to go to. The salesman was very pushy, and when he finally backed off the passes went up to over $300 because we wouldn't attend the meeting. We paid the $300. I do think we got our money's worth, although our parents didn't use anything at river island except the lazy river. So I'd say only buy the 3 day play pass, or only buy the passes for your kids, unless you plan on using everything at river island. Because realistically, you wont use the play pass everyday of your trip. -- But this is my ONLY complaint of the whole vacation. I had a great time, this is a great pick for a resort near the parks. It's super close to disney and seaworld, and not too far from universal either. I cannot wait to return!!!! I can't say enough good things about orange lake.

They gave me until 12, but they told me all keys automatically stop working at 10, so I'd have to go back to the registration desk again. The lazy river pool was a first for me and very cool, but there are no rules posted, and there were a few babies in diapers. I love babies, but since they don't have control of their fecal excretions, they normally aren't allowed in full size pools. Also, you cannot just pick up a tube and use it: The workers will ask to check your wristband.

My husband is a HI Priority Club member and a few months ago when he was booking a business trip, the HI rep asked him if he'd like to take a three-night trip for $200 to one of the HI Vacation Club properties. The deal was we'd get back the $200 (making the stay free) if we sat through the \"two-hour sales presentation.\" We've been intrigued by different vacation options over the years and wondered what the different pitches would be, so we said yes. We decided to leave our 7 and our 3 year old boys at home with the grandparents, skip the parks, and basically go to relax, swim, and explore. I read a lot of reviews on this site and others before we left. As a point of reference for those of you who are trying to learn something about Orange Lake, we've been traveling to different destinations on a variety of types of vacations for many years. We've done a five-night stay at Disney to take the kids to the parks (stayed at Animal Kingdom Lodge), we've been to Atlantis twice (stayed at the Cove), we've been to Antigua three times (Curtain Bluff, St. James Bay, and Galley Bay), we've stayed in a condo in downtown San Francisco with day trips to wine country, we've done B and Bs in the British Isles, and we've done countless Jersey shore beach trips at small and large hotels and condos. We've been very lucky to get away as much as we have, and it's made me love travel and become very observant in lots of areas. We decided not to rent a car since we'd planned to leave the property only once or twice. We took a taxi from Orlando Int'l airport to Orange Lake ($60) and got dropped off at West Village registration. I had tried to call in advance to ask what section we'd be assigned and if we'd be able to walk to a pool, since I'd read up on the size of the place and the shuttle service. I never did get through on the phone regarding the room request -- waited through 15-20 min. hold music both times -- but luckily the nice gentleman who checked us in was able to show me on the map that we'd been assigned to East Village to a villa about a five minute walk from River Island. We waited for about 15 min to check in, but our villa was already ready at 11:00 a.m., so again, we were lucky that we could go straight to the room and get in. A driver took us in a mini van to the villa and I mistakenly figured that this was the resort shuttle. The driver was very nice and even gave us his number in case we needed another ride. The 2-room villa was huge and very clean, well-kept and on the ground floor. It butted up against one of the golf courses. The inside looked just like you see in the pictures on the website. It would indeed have been big enough for two families of three or four, or us, the kids, and our parents, or whomever. We had a screened in patio and a view of a small lake. The master bath had a whirlpool tub. No stains or smells or mold, a few teeny spiders that didn't even bother me, the spider-phobe. Keys worked great. Walked to River Island right away, an easy stroll even in the humidity of August, but I was thankful we'd gotten building 86000 -- others in East Village would have been too far, ditto other resort villages. River Island was clean, nice, good service, good lunch brought over to the Leeward bar for us by a pool server from Tradewinds, yummy drinks... fruity rum punches and such were 6.99. Lunch salads and sandwiches were five or six to eight bucks. Not bad, we thought. River Island was super crowded, hard to find a private spot let alone an umbrella, but it was very clean and inviting and the people (guests and workers) were all extremely, genuinely friendly. I found it hard to relax and read from the crowds and the noise (though it might have also been the heat, obviously nothing to do with Orange Lake!) but I had a nice afternoon and after hanging out till five I stopped at the shop, got wine, beer, milk, some toiletries to take back to the room. I walked back. We tried the River Island Grille for dinner ($70.00) and it was okay. Super nice server. Seafood chowder was awesome. Walked back and enjoyed listening to the bullfrogs on the swamp. Went walking the next morning. Found another pool in East Village and the Splash Lagoon complex of North Village but we were surprised to see how small they were. Decided to go back to River Island. Got an umbrella and and walked/swam the Lazy River. Splurged on a cabana ($90.00) and really enjoyed that -- lunch served, sodas in fridge, fruit on table, TV, seating for four. Everyone got kicked out of the pool/cabanas when a storm blew through but it was a great, relaxing day till then. We left the property for an evening at Downtown Disney, and that was tricky. We waited at the shuttle stop for at least 20 minutes. A shuttle went right by on the other side of the road, and didn't even stop to say Hey, be right back, or Another one will be right by... We kept waiting. Finally we called the switchboard number and asked for a shuttle pickup. Eventually one came. It sat maybe 25 to 30 people and was smelly, stinking of chlorine and sweaty swimmers. My seat was damp. The shuttle took a long route to the ticketing and transportation desk where we asked for a taxi. They called for one and it got there in another ten minutes. By this time, the hour and twenty minutes we'd allotted for shopping at Downtown Disney was disappearing fast. The taxi ride ($30.00) took another twenty minutes and we were lucky to walk in right on time for our reservation at Raglan Road (fabulous meal and entertainment there!) When we taxied back to Orange Lake at the end of the night, we asked the driver to take us the whole way to the villa, which we were allowed to do by the guard at the main gate. The three of us had a little trouble finding it in the dark, but we managed. Okay, so the next morning we get up and head to the sales presentation. It was supposed to be two hours -- it was four and a half. Like several reviewers stated here, no less than four gentlemen came out to hard-sell a condo at Orange Lake to us. I stated flat out that we would never use an Orange Lake condo, and they quickly said what we would really be buying would be points that replenish annually that we could use for any HI property anywhere and/or RCI properties all over. I admit I was highly interested when the presenter said we could use the points to stay at \"any\" of the Disney resorts, and that we could even use them to stay at Atlantis in the Bahamas! We started asking questions after allowing ourselves to be whisked from building to building, golf cart ride to golf cart ride, shown a movie about the HI founder and his inspirational family vacations, and taken to a large cafeteria-style room filled with tables, chairs, and other presenters and potential buyers. I'm talking dozens and dozens of other potential buyers. We didn't expect the cattle call feel to the whole thing. Even when the presenter assured us that only a teensy-tiny percentage of owners could use points to use the fantabulous penthouse suite at the top of River Island, we got up there and the penthouse was crammed with other potential buyers. Here was the total turning point for us: in the elevator on the way down, the presenter said \"It's a test, really. Some days you're offered a test.\" We looked puzzled. He went on, \"Buying property here is a test of how much you love your family. What are willing to do for your kids, and the time you spend with them?\" Seriously? Once he said that we were so offended we quit considering even a maybe. Turned out that you can use RCI points to stay at Disney -- but only at the villas some resorts have, which was NOT what the guy said. And we eventually got them to admit that you can only \"use\" points at Atlantis and privately owned hotels (like my favorite places in South Jersey) by converting the bought points to an American Express gift card. We asked for details on that over and over, and finally they said it would take tens of thousands of points to \"buy\" a gift card of $250.00. In other words, a waste. When finally, four hours in, prices were presented, they and the interest rate were laughably high, of course. But we were surprised how rapidly cheaper options were suddenly \"found,\" and how shockingly fast the interest rate disappeared altogether. We said no, they brought someone to change our mind, we said no again, etc. etc. I felt snubbed one other time too -- when I said I would need about a month with a calculator and the RCI catalog to sit and research whether or not this would be a good way for us to vacation, the presenter scoffed, made a nasty face, and said, \"A month? You've got to be kidding. If you can't see how good a deal this is right now...\" Eventually, they let us go, gave us our $200 back. They even offered to call the shuttle to come pick us up. Needless to say, we walked.... spent another great afternoon at River Island, ordered Papa John's that night when the on-resort pizza delivery said they'd need an hour and 45 minutes to get a pizza to us, and got a good night's sleep on the decision we'd made not to make a decision. I guess the nutshell version is -- lovely, clean, fun, if a bit crowded; average food; keep your head about you in the sales presentation, if you go, and take a calculator. And ask to sit and read the RCI catalog if you know you won't be returning to Orange Lake very often.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barton, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cReunion with college roommates\u201d", "Author": "RetVtLib", "ReviewID": "UR117096479", "Content": "I am an owner since a few years ago when my granddaughter and I were staying in an inexpensive hotel with a microwave and mini-refrigerator.

Well I arrived on July 29 and was immediately pleased with my surrondings, when I got to the front desk I was also impressed. I got checked in by Tony and was pleased with how fast check in was. A little too fast I thougt at first but at that time I was bothered. I was informed about the coupon deal they try to sell you so you could go on the one day presentation. That came off as a bit pressuring. The gentleman who was informing my family and I about the presentation facial expression quickly changed when I stated I was unable to go to the presentation.

Luckily I spoke to Olivia and she showed she was truly concerned and she changed our villa. We later ended up in the Tennis Villas which Olivia stated were newly renovated. The rooms are really beautiful the decor can be modernised but the room was nice. The surrondings were also ALOT better however, the elevators were still very dated and abused. Another thing I didn't like was that I stayed at the resort for 7 days and not once did a housekeeper come in to bring fresh linens and towels. I have stayed at other timeshare resorts and atleast one day out of a week someone comes and brings new linens. Besides the fact that they never brought any linens housekeeping had the nerve to call me an hour before check out time to rush my family and I out of the room.

We decided to spend the last three nights of our vacation at the Orange Lake Resort on the Timeshare presentation to save some money and because we heard how nice the resort was. It was a nightmare from the time we entered our quarters. They put us in one of their older rooms which had a funny stinch to it and old furniture. It was a HUGE downgrade from The Regal Palms Resort as far as cleanliness and comfort. The carpet appeared old and nasty, so much so that we refused to walk on it with our bare feet. I could not get comfortable anywhere but in the room. My three year old complained the entire time we were in the room that she wanted to go back to the other vacation house. On top of the room feeling like a motel, our timeshare associate was very pleasant in the beginning. That was until we decided that we would not purchase the timeshare. He became rude and insulting and tried to belittle us with nasty comments.

Current rating subject to change as our vacation wears on. A few months ago we were sent an invite by Holiday Inn Vacations to take advantage of a 3 or 4 'day/night' stay at the Orange Lake Resort in a single room or a 2 room villa for what appeared to be a pretty good price, if we attended a 2-hour 'Time-Share' \"TOUR\". I did my due diligence, being a skeptic and a Marriott Platinum status traveler, I had heard my share of bad information about these types of 'offers', but this one appeared to be worthwhile to really see how the property worked. I did price out the stay cost and it was $800 for a week stay in a 2BR villa, that had a full kitchen and a W/D as well. So i made reservations and informed the appointment taker several time during the reservation process, that we would be traveling with a special needs child in wheel-chair, my 70 year old Mother and 75 year old Father-in-Law, and would be needing an appropriate dwelling for them to not have to use stairs. Upon arrival I found the registration clerk to be very helpful and she had to go to great lengths to find us an appropriate dwelling as described when i made the reservation, but we were provided with a ground floor dwelling that was appropriate for the needs of our family. The drive to the unit was pleasant and reminded me of the base housing when I was in the military; the interior was very similar to that as well! Upon arrival at 630pm, we found dirty linens and trash in bags laying on the walkway and other areas. We tested every knob, switch, device that we could think of as many previous reviewers reported non-operational dishwashers, dryers, sinks etc, but it all appeared to work as it should. It was my understanding that we would receive the same house-keeping treatment that I am used to with Marriott properties, which is daily service for trash and towels if needed. This is not the case, as I was informed that if towels were needed, there would be an extra charge per service request. In the main bath, there is a wheel chair accessible shower, which works well for our family needs, however, the shower curtain was installed about 6-inches too high and when the shower would run, water would go all over the floor. We tried several field-expedient solutions, but none worked effectively. Upon contact with the property management staff, i was informed that we should have been provided with 8 sets of towels and if we needed more, there would be a charge to our room. I informed the staff of the shower issue and was told that they would send someone to address the shower curtain height, but they were 2-hours behind schedule and they would also be bringing us 16 sets of towels to help us out, but any further requests would be met with a chage to our bill. When Rose (shortened name of a most friendly male Staffer) arrived about 3 hours later at 1am, he came bearing an arm-load of towels and a new shower curtain that was the same height as the current one. He confirmed that there is a charge placed for towel requests, but he saw out issue and cheerfully provided us with many sets of towels as he stated, \"This is a mess and needs to be addressed as soon as possible\". So we had enough towels to last us for the next day or two. But the problem still remained for the remainder of the vacation (5-days more). I was please with Roses' comments and appreciate the backlog of open projects, but this issue will be one folks should address to stop any damage from happening to this dwelling.

Stayed with 2 other families in a 3 bedroom unit in the East Village. First, I want to say this place is huge. Check in was not until 4:00, we were there early and the place was a madhouse. You don't know where to go at first. There are signs, but they don't make any sence. I read reviews on Trip Advisor prior to arrival, so I knew about timeshare pitches. We told them upon check in we were on a very tight basketball schedule and were not interested. There were some surprises at check-in, so be careful. They placed a $250 \"hold\" on our credit card, for incidentals I guess, so pay attention to what the clerk tells you because if you used a debit card you may be screwed if that's all the money you have. This is a cash free resort, so I STRONGLY suggest you use your credit card or debit card and pay as you go instead of using your room key. Be careful because as soon as you are done at the desk because they have clerks (in blue jackets) that \"escort\" you over to the other counter that tries to hook you by telling you that you get $250 just for attending their meeting. We told them, no thanks. They only called once and that was it. Our unit was very very nice. We all decided that we would have no problem living in it because it was like a large apartment. We were in the East Village and on the 6th floor end unit and right on two golf courses. We don't golf, but it was really pretty to see. It comes fully stocked. Pots, pans, glass baking dishes, plates, bowls, mugs, glasses, silverware, steak knives, cooking utensils. Toaster, blender, tea kettle, coffee maker. Hint # 1... turn on the ice maker right away!!! There is a super Target and a Publix right outside the entrance. The Super Walmart is in B.F.N., so don't bother going there, stick with the Target & Publix. Just one thing, we didn't know what we were supposed to do with our trash. While waiting for the rest of our party, we hung out at Breezes by the pool. We were there at Happy Hour, so the beer, rack drinks and nachos were all half price. The table had 4 beers, 2 rack drinks, 2 sprites, nachos and fries and it was $28.00 including tip. They had a DJ setting up in the pool area playing great music and everyone there at the pool seemed to be having a good time. This was the pool at Water's Edge in the West Village. The water sports are crazy expensive. $100.00 an hour for jetskis. $25.00 for paddleboats...yikes. No thanks! Because of our schedule, we were only able to take advantage of some of the amenities. Once we were done, we went to River Island and floated in the lazy river. This was a Tuesday. It was nice at first, but as the day went on more and more little kids showed up. The river was nice an clean until all the little kids started climbing in from where ever and tracked pine needles and all kinds of junk in on their feet. We did not use the tubes because the deepest part is only 4 ft. There is a hot tub and lots to do at River Island. We stayed until the storm came along. . All in all... we had a pleasant stay. Would I go there on purpose for vacation?? Probably not because I like doing things on vacation. I have a pool at home, so I don't need to sit around a pool. We don't golf and I have family that lives on the water and has boats & jetskis. I grew-up on the Chesapeake, so the water stuff is no big deal to me and my family. This resort is really close to Disney, but why stay here if you are going to Disney? There is so much to do here and if you have little kids, they will wear you out. Save your money and stay at a less expensive hotel if you are going to Disney.

I did my homework from different sites to find out what the cheapest room rate was for the accommodations in which we were seeking. It was very important for me to try and find a nice place to stay with a full kitchen. When I called Holiday Inn they were about $30.00 higher per night until I told them that I had found the same accommodations through another website. The young lady that I spoke to immediately honored that rate and even asked me if I was a Priority Club Member. I told her no and she directed to me join. She also told me to go on two other websites and join because IHG had a promotion where if you stay 2 consecutive weekend nights they will rebate you $75.00. We arrived July 9th around 4:00pm which is check-in time to find the lobby area very full. We all cringed because we were in for a long wait especially after driving for 12+ hours, but to our surprise my daughter noticed my name on a board and a totally separate line - which was called the Priority Club Members. Our check in was so smooth. They do have a policy where they hold $300.00 on your card as a security deposit but after check-out that is released. That was no problem for us however, I can see where that would be a problem for some on a very limited budget. It would be nice if that was told to you during the reservation process. We checked in to our condo to find a very nice looking condo. A would say housekeeping could be better. Very nice accommodations. Condo was large especially for 4 people. Immaculate property. Very impressive. We signed up for what they said would be a 90 minute timeshare presentation which turned into 4 hours! What a wasted day. Added advantage for your wasted time is taking advantage of getting discounted tickets at the end. They will save you money. PROS: No bedbugs like I had read on the reviews. Very nice accommodations. Lots of activities for children onsite. Beautiful Property. CONS: Parking - We got home from Magic Kingdom around 1:30 am to find that we had no parking near our condo. You would think that if you pay $179.00 night you would have one allocated parking place. I went to the front desk where the representative told me I would have to speak with security in which I did via phone to find out from him that he was useless. He informed me that I would have to park over by the lobby and walk to my condo. I explained to him that it was just me being a female and my two girls. That was ridiculous as well as being very unsafe that time of the night. King Bed could use a new mattress. Needs to be a little plusher. Very hard. No ceiling fan in master bedroom. Could not sleep at night with door shut in the master because it would get so stuffy and hot.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cpretty good home base\u201d", "Author": "Momwith5kids", "ReviewID": "UR115993928", "Content": "First of all, I need to explain that I am a 'neat freak' and I do not stay in hotels that have less than 3 stars, although I usually don't splurge for 5 stars. However, I do like to keep away from the type of people who: scold their misbehaved children loudly, cut into lines, wear \"wife beater\" tank tops, and who show gluttony by overeating in buffet lines...ok now that you know I'm picky, it will give context to my opinion of the Holiday Inn Resort at Orange Lake: just like others have posted, yes, when you check in they try to direct you to the side counter where they attempt to sign you up for a 3-hour tour of the place so that you will hopefully purchase a time-share, and it is easy enough to avoid no problem. Our apartment was pretty nice, and clean and passes the smell test for me, which is a high rating. However, there is good and bad about this place: First the good: very secure place with a gated entrance; lots of things to do; still new enough to be very clean and not look 'used up'; quiet part of town; great price for a clean condo with a full kitchen. Now the not so good: Hard to get out of the property (high traffic); not very close to Disney; shows some signs of rough treatment (for example, our bathroom sink had some stains on the counter that were ground in, and the plug in the sink was missing, and the clothes dryer was linty from the last people, and there were a few crickets in the bathroom, and the window near our front door was dented, and the front door had some deep gashes in it where someone hit it with something hard and didn't touch it up again), but mainly, there are MANY people walking around as described in the first paragraph that act less than appropriate in my opinion. I think the reason we saw so many of that type of people is because the rate for the room is SO LOW for a full-sized clean apartment on a nice property....there are lots of condo type resorts in the area, but most of them are much more expensive so we didn't see many people 'like us' in this place. Still, we were not bothered by it too much because we kept to ourselves. We did rent jet skis on the little muddy lake, and kayaked too which was pretty good but it was extra. Every little thing at this place is extra $$...they have an inflatable slide that costs extra just to go down, the lazy river looked fine but closes up at 6pm! You can't go in the lazy river without a tube. The tube costs $9 to use. silly! So in summary, we would maybe stay here again if we just wanted a home base and couldn't find anything else a little more suited to our type of people that we'd like to be around. Sorry I sound like a snob, I'm really not, but I don't like to be around yelling, angry people hollering at their kids while I'm on vacation who cut in lines and sag their britches. It was very inexpensive which was nice, but the other parts were just not worth the trouble.

We Checked into a Beautiful 2 Bedroom villa at the East Village(our view was the Golf Course, Which was beautiful, However we are not golfers) Our Villa could sleep up to 8 people, There were a few things that I can point out that I did not like, First of all the kitchen lacked some items that I needed while I was there. I was going to make Kool-Aid for the children but there was not a Pitcher for me to do so, I had to find something to use, also, there was several items in the kitchen that was broken and not working. Our Bed was not the best, but nothing is like your own. The pool at the East village was very nice and quiet. We liked it because it was not overcrowded like the pools at River Island and West Village. The stay was nice, but the only thing we hated about our stay was having to sit through the timeshare presentation. It was suppose to be a 120 minute presentation but we finally got out of there after telling them 100 NO's and 3 hours later. We were greeted by a salesman on a Golf Cart but when we left after saying No, they sent us back to our car by a shuttle bus. Those 3 hours we were at the Presentation, We could have been making memories with our family. The Club Vacations Program/Timeshare which they would not call it a timeshare, was highly priced and not fit for our budget.

There is a shop at the West Entrance Reception but it did not seem to do basic foodstuff (milk, bread) or I just missed it.

We went there as our honeymoon because our first vacation together was in Orlando and we wanted to \"recreate\" some of the magic that happened there. We stayed in river Island, which is the newest part of the resort. The room was wonderful. It was spacious, had a full kitchen, flat screen TV in the living area, and a nice bathroom. My husband loved the Jacuzzi tub to just lay there.As far as excursions the best experiences were lazying about on the Lazy River, karaoke, and going to Universal Studios. The resort itself is very beautiful and inviting. The people that work there seem genuine and ready to help you out. The poolside massage is a very nice treat and the Leeward bar staff, the poolside bar, are so very friendly and will easily start a full blown conversation with you. The resort shuttle staff are also very friendly. Rosa and Emmanuel were my favorite resort shuttle drivers. My only complaints are that we are Orange Lake owners and we still had to pay so much for certain amenities. The lazy river tubes are $9 per day which is ridiculous. I understand that any company has to make money but according to the sales rep who tried to upgrade our timeshare, the \"vacation business is booming.\" I just think that if you are basically paying a mortgage very month, then for the week that you are there with your loved ones, you should at least be able to get a free tube to float in the lazy river. I am sure that there are plenty of guests to pay $9 for a $4 tube. I am sure that a member of the team would retort with we could have purchased the Fun pass or whatever it was called for $49.95 but if I don't want to buy a $9 tube, why would I buy a $49.95 package? Also we opted out of renting a car, big mistake. You spend about the same or more on taxi and shuttle service to the parks.We ate at the Riverside Grilling company for breakfast, which was great. It was an all you can eat buffet for $8.99 and for children it's only $3.99. But I would not recommend going there for dinner. It's overpriced and there are small portions.

Overall, this was a great trip for our family. The resort was really nice with abundant amenities for both kids and adults. We stayed in a 2/2 villa in the West Village and it was spacious and newly remodeled. I would say the villa was at least 1000+ sq. feet and was nicely decorated with flat panel TVs in the living room and both bedrooms. I have to say the beds were VERY comfortable, the master had a king bed and the kids had 2 queen sized beds. We all slept very well and the sheets were nice and soft. The kitchen was granite countertops and had a dishwasher, microwave, oven/stove combo, blender, well-equipped kitchen with pots, pans, baking dishes, plates, etc. Also, in unit washer-dryers which were very clean and almost new. It was nice to be able to do laundry in the comfort of your villa and not haul clothing to a Laundromat. The Orange Lake staff was nice and accommodating, no problems with asking for things for the unit like paper towels or toilet paper. The lazy river is huge and very popular. Sometimes it was too crowded with so many people and kids it reeked of chlorine and was understandable but it did not make me want to go in and swim. Fortunately there are several other pools, I think they have 13 total pools on the property, so you just have to find one that is less crowded and it\u2019s fine. The pools were all pretty clean and well maintained and the snack bars were okay food if you get hungry. There is a great steakhouse right outside the property called Longhorn's and we had dinner there...check it out! Great steaks, full bar, good prices! If you like barbeque, take a 30 minute drive to Winter Garden, Fl or Winter Park, FL and check out 4 Rivers Barbeque...true Texas bbq! Too die for and everything is delicious.

Being regular visitors to Orlando we thought it couldn't hurt to see what it had to offered, and not being completely naive we figured there would be some kind of sales pitch involved during the course of our visit, but we went with the simple intention of seeing what else was available at these resorts. What we found was a horrific experience, amounting to a us feeling like prisoners for 4 hours. We arrived only to be allocated our own \"rep\", who pretended to be interested in us and our holiday experience so far. This being our first day there was little to discuss. He marched us into what reminded me of a high school dining room full of smarmy salesmen with too much hair gel, all talking AT people like us, families, couples, the noise was deafening. To cut a long story short the tour was supposed to last 90 minutes max, and our \"rep\" dragged it out to 3 hours. We listened patiently to the figures and the offers they had and politely refused. What followed was a line of 4 different salesmen. Each one leaving the room, only for the next to come in, repeating the same \"the sales force has been called off now, so you can relax\" before then proceeding to try and sell us another lesser value package. After another hour it became laughable that each person through the door was yet another salesman hoping they could \"break us\". By this time we found ourselves in an office with a closed door feeling decidedly uncomfortable and having to ask them to let us leave. Once they realised we were not going to buy anything they \"set us free\" leaving us in the middle of the resort, miles away from the carpark where we needed to be. They had chauffeured us out here with posh golf buggies, but now we were left to our own devices and had to catch a lift back from an unsuspecting member of the resort staff. I feel angry that we were made to feel like this, and I can only think that we were not stern enough with our refusals, but as it's my nature to be polite, perhaps I was caught out and should have been rude to this kind of people. In summary, the resort did not look anything special, the pools looked overcrowded, and the resort was miles away from where I would want to stay.

We where a little worried as there was 8 of us in a 2 bed room condo but had no problems at all we could have fit at least another family of 4 and had enough room. I did get a great tip for a large family, ask the resort to bring cots. There is a screened in porch and the kids can sleep in the cots on the porch. They will love it like camping and you will free up a bed. The condo we stayed in had a nice tropical feel it was clean and quiet. The best part laundry and kitchen. We did not get pressured to do any tour and you do not have to do any tour. Orange Lakes policy is that you can only be asked once. If you say no they will not or should not ask you again. If you beat around the bush with your answer of course their going to push it, that is what their there for. My friends did do the tour just for the free kids stuff they offer. They said it was annoying of course but hey free is free. The resort is cash free (resort card attached to your credit) and of course each little thing cost a little bit extra to do, its no different then anywhere else. The pools and lazy river are awesome.

He was sad to learn that so much had changed since the last time he was there. Pretty much nothing was the same as it used to be. We had a room inside the main building in the west village. Nice, well decorated, but to be honest, too much furniture for the room. We had to cram things up against a wall to be able to walk and use the pull out couch bed, which resulted in banging our heads into the light fixture in the middle of the night when having to go to the bathroom. We planned on buying food for our stay and cooking most of our meals in the room to save a little cash for our Disney trip. Seemed like a good plan, until we were met with a fridge too small even for a college student. The \"freezer\" section didn't keep anything frozen, and it took 3 hours to cool drinks off in the fridge part. There wasn't a lot of storage space for our food items as most of the cabinets were taken up with the resort owned stuff. We had 4 people in our room, and only two full sized towels, and after asking for more for three days, finally received them. The same with extra trash bags. The pools were nice, we stuck mostly to the one at our part of the resort, as you have to either drive or take a shuttle to the rest. River Island, which I assume is the newest part of the resort boasted water slides and a lazy river and the best pools. What we got was a lazy river you had to pay 9 bucks to rent a tube for that had more plant life floating in it than water that barely moved you along, we had to swim most of it, and water slides that my son couldn't even go down, even though I KNOW he meets the height requirements. River Island was crowded and not worth the 5 minute drive over there. You can only go 23 mph in the place, so traveling takes a few minutes. We ate lunch two times while staying there at the resort restaurants. FYI - save your money and go to McDonald's. Food was overpriced and horrible. The perks of the place were the fan we had in our room, best fan I've ever seen, the comfortable beds, the amount of pools to utilize, and the proximity to the parks. Took us about 15 minutes to get to Disney World. We unplugged our phone the first day there, and when finally plugging it back in yesterday, we were greeted with a gazillion messages from resort staff for this or that. We had to buy milk at the Marketplace and pad almost $5 for a half gallon of milk. Everything is expensive, so come prepared!

Overall the resort was a great base for us, spent half a day at theme parks and afternoon at river island. Free wi fi in villa was great too. We had a great time and also got to watch Discovery space shuttle take off from Coco Beach. If I went again I would be happy to stay here again.

Lots of positives about this resort: \"dive-in\" movies for kids of all ages, a variety of pools, each with unique features, watersports, playgrounds with bungee-jumping and inflatable slides, indoor activities such as bingo and movies, multiple arcades, and beautifully manicured grounds. It's proximity to Orlando theme parks is nice, too. There's more positives....the 2BR/2BA villa is more than enough room for 5-8 travelers. We comfortably accommodated two grandparents, parents, and three kids. All dinnerware, cookware, and incidentals (laundry, dish, and dishwasher soap, for instance) are included. Sorry, folks...this is not a standard hotel. It's a timeshare property, so the occupant is responsible for daily housekeeping in their home away from home. Customer service was top-notch, delivering extra laundry and dish detergent as requested. Negatives: a ceiling fan in bedrooms would be nice and we were not provided a spatula. I struggled to find anything negative. After reading previous review, it's apparent that seasoned, informed travelers appreciate this property for its amenities, activities, and customer service. Complaints about timeshare presentations are unwarranted. Incentives are offered for participation in a 90-minute presentation. Folks...if you don't like what you're hearing after 90 minutes, demand a ride back to your vehicle, get your free voucher, and don't do it again. Or...pay the reservation charge and enjoy your stay- skip the presentation and remember that you don't get something for nothing. Or stay somewhere else. Problem solved. There is so much to do here.

I love a Lazy River, but this one is not regulated very well - we purchased $9 wristbands to get the tubes... but didn't really see any other wristbands on the Lazy River. Everyone was apparently free to grab a tube, and swim or walk in the River. At most times, reaching my arms back to \"paddle\" I would touch another person - that's how close they were.

Our room in the North Village was roomy , a little outdated and a little dirty .Our large family loved the roominess of the villas. Halfway through our trip in the morning when we woke up to get ready for breakfast at Chef MIckeys and a day at the Magic Kingdom we had no water at all. Husband called front desk to see what the problem was. Took half hour before someone called back to tell us there was a water main break in our building. We asked to be moved to another room so we could get ready and be on time for our reservation. Their only option for us was to let us shower in another unit. They also said the water might be working again shortly so we opted to wait it out. Well it wasn't working shortly. Husband tried to find out what was going on from the maintenance men that were working on the leak at our building and got a rude \"were working on it \" for the answer. We also saw men which looked like management walking around out side our unit but no on bothered to tell us what was going on and when the water was going to be on. Several hours later it came on. Needless to say we missed our reservation for Chef Mickeys and our kids were very upset as were we. The next day guess what? No water again. By this time we were furious. Husband called front desk, told them we had no water again and that we missed a reservation the day before because of it and demanded to be moved to another building so it would not happen again. This time however , the girl said they could move us to another building. A man came to our room , threw us the room keys and left, not offering to help us move or even bothering to tell us what section or where we were moving to. Had to drive around trying to find our new unit. We were placed in the tennis village condos this time. Beautiful accomodations here. New furniture, very tastefully decorated, till you looked closely. The bathroom floor had so much hair and dirt on it that it was disgusting. Shower in master bath had so much mildew in the grout and mold along the shower door that we didnt feel clean even after showering. Carpets were not swept and kitchen floor had food stuck all over it . I cleaned the floors with a wash cloth and it turned it black. What is the point of renovating a room if the cleaning staff are not doing their job and the rooms are filthy? Carpets were new but in terrible need of scrubbing. Its a shame because the rooms have potential if someone would overlook the cleaning crew and make sure they are doing their job. Other than that , the resort is very family friendly , lovely grounds, beautiful pools ,nice location to disney.

I had been forewarned about the sales pitch when checking in & about the $20 voucher so we did not try to redeem it. (This was a helpful hint from another Tripadvisor member). We just wanted to stay for a couple of days, not buy anything. We had no phone calls for a presentation as others stated. We stayed in the high rise (2 bedroom) on River Island. The rooms were very clean, very nice & spacious. For the price you couldn't beat it. Since they have full kitchens, a washer & dryer etc. you really have all the comforts of home. After traveling for 4 days when we got there it was nice to do a couple of loads of laundry. Some of the negatives I found was just trying to call this place. I wanted to make sure I was on River Island, however it took at least 4 transfers to finally get the reservation desk & every time I'd ask for a direct line phone number, no one could give it to me. I had also asked for a view of the pool. We got a view of the street. I did call to complain & was told there were no guarantees when you book as to which area (River Island, etc) you get or which view. We had a great screened in porch but looking out at the parking lot didn't excite me. i felt a bit closed in since we kept the curtains pulled for privacy. In order to get the feel of the resort we had to walk down our hall & down 3 flights of steps to even see the pool area. We noticed the restaurant info given to us at check in must have been the lunch prices, since we stopped by one restaurant for dinner & prices were double. We tried to call for Pizza Delivery from the resort pizza restaurant, but delivery time was 1 1/2 hrs.. Only 1/2 hr. if you could pick up yourself. Stores located on the property were pricey. We found going to the Publix close by was a better deal. Something I hadn't heard from other Tripadvisor member reviews was this resort uses your room key card for on-site purchases. No cash is used here. Since this really wasn't a hotel, daily cleaning wasn't the normal & you did have to pay for those services. We were only there for a couple of days so that didn't really matter. It would have been nice to get have extra shampoo & coffee, but we were forced to buy the extra's we needed since we never saw any maid service while we were there (not sure we would have gotten it anyway).. As always with the phone service it was hard to find someone to answer a question. I tried the morning we left to find out where the trash containers were but could never get anyone to answer the phone at 6:00 am. Yes, they ask you to take out your own trash & put it in the proper place - but they never said where it is. I looked at the end of the hallways but never found it until we were walking out the door. It was located next to the elevators. We did not use the lazy river so we didn't need to rent a tube for $9, however by mid to late afternoon, I noticed a number of tubes laying around that people had left. Others were just picking them up & using them to save on rental fee. Overall this resort had some small negatives to it but again our villa was very nice, clean and reasonably priced. If you want someone to wait on you then this resort probably isn't for you since there is no front desk attendant in your building (check in is in another area of the resort) & no maid service unless you pay extra.

We were able to use a different pool each day we were there and had fun at all of them. But that is where the good ends. The bad: The staff is terrible. As soon as you arrive you are hammered into taking the tour of the facility as they attempt to sell you the experience. I was here for a vacation not a god for saken sales pitch. Once we got to the room it got even better... You had to walk thru a wall of spider webs just to get to the door as no one wiped them from around the door. The room was dirty. When we turned on the lights they were covered with cob webs. Extremely easy to see considering someone had supposedly just cleaned the room. The shower liner in one bathroom was completly covered with mold and mildew. It was white at one time but not with that much coverage. The second bathroom was missing a liner. Some of the towels had stains and I wondered if they had even been washed. I attempted to contact the front desk only to be booted around over and over again. Once I finally got tired of this I drove down to the lobby to discuss with a supervisor in person only to be told they were all out or on lunch. I was ok with that as the person at the desk said they would address the issues and have a manager contact me as soon as possible. Lets just say no one ever came to the room with the new liners or towels. I ended up doing the towels myself and cleaning all the fixtures and using some of the cleaning supplies they left on my first night as they didn't believe I was important enough to come down and address these issues. I find this funny as they believe I have to be right on time for the sales tour or they keep my deposit. Are they held accountable for anything? Nope... So I would say the facility is ok and was fun for my family but the Management is some of the worst I have ever dealt with, the staff is incompitent and could really care less about you as the customer. Example (while waiting for our kids to use the bungie the guys running it were discussing the girls they were dating and what they were doing with them. Lets just say the rating should have been G but jumped to R rather quickly. Also while they were talking they paid no attention to the time each child was on the unit. Some would actually jump for 15 minutes or more and some 3 minutes or less. At one point 2 parents nearly got into a fist fight as they had waited for 45 minutes to go on the bungie ride only to get about 4 bounces and then watch another go for 15 as they talked about who they were dating this weekend. This is a fine example of the type of staff working here. Overall it would have been a great experience had the staff actually cared about what they did but in the end the pools were the only reason we stayed for the full 3 days. Hope the final day as we leave on the 10th helps make up for the poor stay and maybe that Manager will actually realize I am still here waiting for someone to contact me. Should be fun tomorrow as we have the sales pitch first thing in the morning. Looking forward to tell them I would never buy into something this poorly run.

The room itself was big nice bed nice kitchen tv everything up to par. The pools and the landscape looked nice and was well maintained (didnt play golf).... So what you might ask is the reasons I'm never going back. There are several. FIRST is the timeshare presentation as soon as you check in you are presented a \"voucher\" for 20 dollars. Then a worker who will be overly enthusiastic will bring you over to a second desk where you are ask several questions and enticed with coupons and possibly even money for a \"90 mintue\" presentation. This presentation is where they try to sell you a time share and it takes close to 3 hours!!! and thats if you say no!! (which we did). But it is not just saying no ... it is saying no to 4 different people for 5 times each. For example I was told since I am a physician that \"Thats a stressful line of work if you don't take some vacations you'll probably wind up with a heart attack\" SECOND PROBLEM we were told that there \"were no discount tickets to the amusment parks (disney/ universal) until after we already purchased the full price tickets at the check in desk... apparently you have to go to a side desk to get them and the check in desk apparently doesnt have this knowledge so there goes 50 dollars. THIRD lazy river sounds great but unfortunately you have to pay $9 per tube for the day.

I am an owner here now for the past 7 years. My first trip was a rental off eBay and after visiting many other so called \"resorts\" in the area which were barely more than apartments with a jacuzzi we decided this was where we wanted to be. This place has too many ammenities to list, go to their web site to see them. If you can, arrive before 3pm to check in or you will be waiting a while. They are going to tell you ways to get extra discounts on Golf and attractions by attending their sales promotion. First they do work hard at trying to sell you one of these units for $35K which you can buy on the resale market for pennies on the dollar like I did so unless you understand \"The Game\" just say no to their offers or you will find yourself wasting 2-3 hours (most likely 3 hours) listening to them ramble on and on and on about the value of timeshare ownership. (The Suites on top of River Island are something to see though but you will probably never get to stay there unless you plan on bringing 23 of your closest friends with you.) So if you want to toss away half a day of your vacation then have at it. You can't say I didn't warn you! They have 1 and 2 story villa's in the west village which are very nice and I think bigger than the hi-rise units. Most Villa's overlook the golf courses. There are a few with jungle views so you may want to avoid those. There are 4 courses on the property. 2 x 9 and 2 x 18 hole. Most Hi-rise units have screened porches and 1 elevator per building 5 stories or less. So if it is out of service there is no backup. I kind of felt Isolated up in the upper floors but the view is nice. Some Hi-rise units that face Disney in the north village can see the fireworks at night. The resort is kid friendly, there is only 1 adult only pool near the front entrance in the west village. They have 11 pools and a lazy river. They do not have bike paths and most riding on the resort is on a busy main road so you may want to leave them home. They have nice exercise equipment though so go explore them if you feel the need. The putt-putt offers a week pass for everyone in your room for a set price, play as much as you want all week. It's a good deal if you like putt-putt. I have had some minor maintenance issues and they have always come to deal with them quickly or bring me something I needed. Usually within 10 to 20 minutes. I have never been disapointed with the accomodations. Most all units in the older west and east villages have been updated within the past 5 years. If you stay at river island request a pool view or you could be overlooking the parking lot and the badly maintained orange groves. Those tall buildings have rooms on both sides. There are alot of things close by but you will need a car if you want to leave the property. There is a drug store and McDonalds near the front gate. The Target and Supermarket is quite a long walk and the shuttles that go around the property every 20 minutes do not leave the property. Ask the driver if any of the runs go to Publix. There are several restaurants on the property serving a wide variety of different foods. All rooms I have been in have free wi-fi internet access if you have a laptop. They also have several business cafe's where they rent time on their machines. They do have bugs, everyone in Florida has bugs so be prepared for an occasional roach about an inch and a half long, they like to call them \"Palmetto Bugs\" but they are still really BIG roaches. Do not leave any food out at night and keep everything sealed in containers. This is Florida people, it dosent freeze here long enough to kill them. They have ants too so it would be good to have some bug spray handy. Bug Spray and Sun Screen, don't leave home without them!!! As far as resorts go, if your looking for posh upscale and you need extra pampering then this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a clean comfortable spacious place to relax and sit by the pool, order a drink at the pool bar, watch the wild birds, play some tennis or putt-putt, rent a jet-ski or play a few rounds of relaxing golf, then this is heaven.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNice Place, but has its flaws\u201d", "Author": "Angie1044", "ReviewID": "UR111509080", "Content": "Our check in process was somewhat quick and easy.

You could tell it had not been updated in a while, but still clean and comfortable. It backed up to a hole on the night golf course and was pretty to look at all lit up from the screen porch. Also, the north village pool was very nice and accomodates young children well. It was nice to occaisionally take a quick swim there instead of dealing with the croud at River Island.

We could see Epcot's fireworks from our screened-in balcony. Our daughters are older teens and had no trouble taking the shuttle wherever they wanted to go on the property. The only little complaint we had is that ceiling fans in the bedrooms would have been nice. The best thing about Orange Lake is the location, it's perfect for avoiding the crowds. We took the little-used West entrance into Disney property and had no trouble at all. We also saved money by buying breakfast and some lunch food at Publix at the resort entrance. Make sure you pick up a roll of quarters for the occasional toll roads. One day we went to Fort DeSoto State Park for the beach, and really enjoyed the family-friendly atmosphere. Ate at Bubba Gump's at Madeira Beach while in Tampa Bay. Overall, a very nice family vacation.

There were two people handling check in while 10-12 guests waited, yet the counter had space for at least 8-10 associates. Meanwhile, over at the concierge and sales desks , 6 employees twiddled their thumbs, trying to look busy and avoid eye contact with paying customers waiting in the other line. High pressure sales pitch for a coupon book or discount on amenities like tube rental for lazy river. They refused to give me a written copy of what the offer was, but as a new guest I was given a $25 voucher and told it was for use to get food on the premises, but not for tube rental etc. It should not have taken 50 minutes to check in, but it did, and I needed to get to the room to unpack to get medication. I explained that I wanted to review their offer packages, and could I look at them after I had dinner and my medication, and then discuss in the morning. They said sorry. Since I refuse to agree to high pressure sales, I left. I still don't know about the new customer offers that allegedly included area restaurant discounts that could have saved us $$ on dinners, and perhaps would have made my impression of the resort more favorable. We used the card to get ice creams by the pool, then at checkout I was told that the voucher was for restaurants or area attraction tickets, not the food I was told earlier. So they charged my visa with the room. The room was nice, a little dated, but nice. Things like the washer/dryer making a lot of noise, and doors sticking because there were too many layers of paint on them. I wishe I had been warned about thousands of ants in the kitchen all over the trash can the morning after we had cooked our dinner in, but have since been told this is common anywhere in FL. If I had taken the trash out immediately after dinner, instead of first thing in the morning, it probably wouldn't have been bad, but it would have helped if they warned us. There were no sheets/blankets for the pullout sofabed. We called and it took 2 hours for them to bring them to us. That's a long wait when you're ready to go to bed. The pool was nice - I thought it was not family friendly to blast music that loudly near the hammocks as I tried to nap, and I am surprised they allow smoking through the entire pool and hammock area. Yes, it is outdoors, but the smoke still stinks. I wished they had lifeguards, not just to stop the smokers in the pool, but for safety of the kids running around wild. They had plenty of people selling tubes, but nobody to keep an eye on safety. I hope nobody ever gets hurt there, as crowded as it gets, but we got the impression they were far more concerned about squeezing additional $$$ out of their guests. I mean, they charged me to print airline boarding passes - what hotel does that and expects customers to want to return? It is of course their right to do so, I just question that decision. When I checked out, I expressed my minor disappointments and asked them to have a manager call me at home the following day or week to discuss my concerns. I never heard anything back, now 2 weeks later. I don't want to make this sound terrible - it is a very nice place, just they could do a few things a little better. Little things like these can make a big difference on memories of a vacation. The earlier part of our vacation was also at a Holiday Inn, and it was terrific. I've been a priority club member for over 20 years and I guess I just expected a little bit more from this one. I hope this review is helpful to other guests, as well as management.

We originally booked a room at the Wyndham Bonnet Creek, but they messed up our reservation so we had to find a place at the last minute! Best thing that happened to us! We had a late late arrival so missed the push for a timeshare presentation although they did call us and we told them we weren't interested and told them our income which quickly cut them off. We checked in and arrived to our villa in the West Village. It was so nice to pull up right to the driveway and walk right in without lugging our stuff up stairs/elevators. I was a little worried to open the door, but much to my surprise and delight we had a newly renovated villa. It was so spacious and beautiful! My family was so happy and pleased with the comfy big beds (king in master and 2 queens) and the bathrooms. We went right to sleep and actually SLEPT...heard not one noise or peep. With the amenities of the kitchen we drove to Super Target and stocked up on food/snacks and saved some $ by cooking. The dining room is so nice and roomy! We also had a washer/dryer so we were able to wash some clothes and not have to worry about that when we got home. The pool in the West Village is the only pool we visited, but we did drive by the other pools. It was a nice heated pool and there was plenty of privacy and not over crowded! My kids LOVED it and wanted to stay longer then we did. We also got updated messages on what was going on in the resort so that was nice. Convenient location to Disney, Seaworld, etc. There are some nice chain restaurants down the road and super target that is really nice! I suppose the only downside was the A/C was off! When we arrived it was set at 68 and was really about 50 degrees. But, it was so nice to set it at 75 and arrive back to a comfy cool villa. I would have also liked an additional pan to cook over the stove, but they do provide a whole bunch of other dishes, so it wasn't too bad. There is plenty of room for a lot of people. We did use the sleeper sofa and called up housekeeping late (10pm) and they promptly arrived with bedding. All in all, we have decided we will NEVER stay in another hotel room again. 2 bedroom suites/villas, etc are the way to travel with our family.

We felt rather fortunate that we were able to stay in a building with a pool, since we knew that we wouldn't be in close proximity to the River Island area. The check-in process was tedious and time-consuming. My husband and I learned something the hard way. When they ask you at check-in if you would like to learn about earning incentives, SAY NO! Not knowing any better, we figured, why not? They quickly whisked my husband away to a second counter where they required a $30 deposit. If you show up to their timeshare presentation, you get your money back plus an extra $30-$100 in cash or in vouchers. Checking in was annoying enough. The room was mostly clean. It is nice that they have everything that you need in the kitchen: blender, utensils, oven, pots, pans, coffee maker, etc. I do not recommend using the jacuzzi jets in the master bath, however. I filled it up so my daughter could take a bath. We turned on the jets. She decided she didn't like them so we turned them off. When the water settled, we noticed black mold-type stuff floating on the water. DISGUSTING! On the third day of our trip we had to go to the timeshare presentation to get our $30 back plus our cash incentive. We were told it would be an hour and a half. It turned out to be a three hour nightmare. Never doing anything like this before, we thought it would be a nice tour of the resort, a way to check out all of the cool stuff they have. We expected a sales pitch like that of a used car dealer. No way. First, we parked our car at the sales office. When inside, we were greeted by \"Andrea\" from \"upstate New York\". She showed off her family photo album with pictures of her \"husband\" and \"son\". Then she loaded us onto a golf cart, and drove us to a building in front of the River Island area. (Note the removal of us from our mode of escape) We sat through this irrelevant movie about the founder of Holiday Inn and the history of the hotel chain. We were lectured on how we are throwing our money away every time we go on vacation - it's makes more sense to buy a timeshare and \"invest\" that money. HA! Fifteen minutes after our promised hour and a half, I stopped \"Andrea\" and asked her how much longer it would take. She said 15-20 more minutes. However, she kept going on and on. We told her we had to get back to the rest of our family and that we didn't have much time. She turned the tables on us saying that it was because we were \"asking so many questions\" and that she wanted to address them all. Umm, we weren't asking her anything. We were far from curious about buying a timeshare. This went on for an extra hour and 20 minutes. Finally, I met my boiling point and told her to stop with the presentation. She left and brought out the manager. Then he started with a new sales pitch. I told him that we wanted to go back to our car. Then he brought out yet ANOTHER salesman. Then that guy brought out a customer service rep. Finally, they allowed us to get our $30 back plus our incentive cash. Instead of taking us back to our car in the aforementioned golf cart, they told us to wait outside for a shuttle bus. Needless to say, three hours of my life have been taken from me. I feel somewhat bullied and traumatized by the salespitch. They are never getting our money again. FYI - The timeshare we were offered was $37,000 PLUS 16.9% interest.

We had all the comforts of home. We stayed in the River Island complex, which I would highly recommend. From what I've heard from family that stayed in other areas of the resort, some rooms can tend to be a bit dated, but River Island is the newest section. We had a great view, clean room and tons of space. -All cooking utensils were provided, along with starter kits for the washer/dryer, shower, coffee maker, etc. -A trip to Publix or Target SuperCenter to fill the kitchen with groceries, and you're good to go. Stores are really nice too. Probably the nicest Target I've ever seen. -River Island Pool complex is great, we had a fantastic time hanging out on our days off from the parks. -Given our schedule for the week, we didn't really have any time to explore the rest of the resort, but all in all, grounds were very nice all around. Seems like you could spend an entire week there and not leave. *One thing to note is that if you're traveling with an infant/toddler, ask for an upper floor room. We were originally given a ground level unit, but my 2 year old very easily unlocked the door, went onto the screened porch, and walked right out onto the public path. There's no easy way to prevent the little ones from opening the doors, so if your have a higher room, it would be much safer. After a few phone calls, we were moved to the 5th floor. The CONS: -Orange Lake is very big on promoting their time shares. I saw this warning on TripAdvisor before we left, so I was prepared. We spent regular price for our room (i.e. no freebie vacation) and we were still bombarded with morning phone calls. We simply didn't pickup after our first encounter. They try to get you from the beginning. At check-in you're offered a $20 voucher for the resort. However, there are several steps to redeem it. I pretty much threw it away, but other family members reported that it leads you to a sales person who tries to get you to sit through a presentation. Our method was to ignore the calls and eventually they stopped. -Another negative is the check-in process. We got there around 2:30 and were told that as soon as the room was ready they'd call. So we had some lunch at the resort, and were relaxing in the restaurant when we got the call at 4pm. We made our way to the room about 15 minutes later, and the cleaning staff had just begun cleaning the room. So instead of relaxing at the restaurant, we were sitting in the hallway. Not the best way to start off after a day of air travel. -There was some work going on, mostly switching out the rugs in near the elevator. We were informed that this prohibit us from elevator use for 30 minutes. 30 minutes turned into 5 hours. Furthermore, this work was going on a few days later and we were hearing constant banging in our room. We had to leave the room because of the noise (on a day we planned to relax inside out of the sun). I called about this, spoke to 3 different people, was asked for my cell phone # and was promised a call back. That call never came. -Room was very clean other than the floor. Floor was pretty filthy, but from what I gather, most hotel rooms are. Overall, Orange Lake was a nice place to stay, and chances are, I wouldn't rule out the option of staying there again. It seems that if you can take care of yourself, and dont require much in the way of customer service, you'll be pleased.

I did find the place quite busy and big. I found it best to be in the water with my kids especially on the lazy river to not lose sight. Also I found there were not many shaded areas there.

The restaurants in the resort are fine with reasonable kids' menus. This would be a resort we will return to especially now that we have a good sense of the place.

Most others have already stated what I feel about this resort-it is one of the best ones out there to stay at if you want to visit the Orlando area. I really liked the layout of the unit we stayed in and the pools areas were very nice and large vs some of the other resorts I've stayed at. Staff was friendly and I really enjoyed the variety of amenities that were available at the resort even though our schedule was so packed with things to do away from the resort. We stayed in a two bedroom / two bathroom unit close to the tennis courts. We stayed on the 3rd floor and the back of our unit and screened in patio faced a pond and golf course. We often eat our breakfast on the patio enjoying the view before we headed out to visit the various theme parks. When we came back, it was only a short walk to sit on either the lake beach or by the pool for an our or two. On Friday we spent most of the day at the resort though. In the morning we rented a paddle boat to explore around the lake. It was a lot of fun other than when we got hit by the waves a couple of times from a few of the powered vehicles. They were staying away from where we were for the most part though. Later on we visited the area with the lazy river. Since we were only going to be there for a few hours we decided not to rent tubes for the lazy river but we did swim/walk around it a few times. $9 is really too much per person even for an entire day. I pay $10 a day for my local community water park, but when the service is a part of a resort I could see maybe $5 instead. Never once did I receive a call to go to a timeshare presentation (at least there were no messages on our phone). When we checked in we received a $20 voucher for resort activities that we were to return to another desk to redeem. When we received the voucher it was presented as being a perk since we traded to the resort via RCI. When you look at the voucher itself though, it does say at the bottom of the voucher that it relates to a timeshare solicitation. We just bypassed the second desk on our way out. When we checked in in addition to the voucher we received our parking pass, a resort schedule, and menus to all of the onsite restaurants Prices looked decent though we didn't have time to actually eat at any of the onsite places. We did eat at Applebee's though which is located very close to the resort gate area. My only negative comment is that a few of the drains in the bathrooms should eventually be replaced. Most notable were the rust stain marks around the drain in the small bathroom. It was clean, but just looked a bit dirty due to this. Also, it would have been nice to have had a pizza pan and cutter as part of the kitchen items, but we made due with a cookie sheet and large knife. Overall I would definitely stay here again if I would be able to stay in the West village again. The other areas didn't have the amenities I would want for a couple's vacation but would be great for families.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walpole, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "Npotts", "ReviewID": "UR108242381", "Content": "We just came back today from orange lake- I wanted to write a review because my parents have owned at olcc for many years and we have been trading it to see other areas and before we went back I read reviews- I do not agree with the negative ones and knew that is not how I remembered my past stays at olcc- to start we had a blast the only day we left the resort was for discovery cove and I still feel like I missed so many activities we wanted to do on the resort( spent too long drinking those delicious pi\u00f1a coladas by the pool!

After reading all the comments on the timeshare pitch and having more RCI weeks than I know what to do with, I made sure I dodged the sales pitch at check-in, by foregoing the \"$20 gift certificate validation\" LOL and running out citing a wife and child in the hot car outside which was true, but pre-planned:). They only called a couple of times (while we were home), but I didn't answer and they left no message, so I knew it was them. So in short, easy peasy to avoid the whole pitch, but read my comment at end. The west village 2 bdrm, 2 bath villa was absolutely fantastic. Very well furnished, decorated, and appointed with everything we would need for a 1 week vacation. The units are huge and perfectly laid out even with European style bathrooms where the sink is accessible separate from the toilet/shower, so you all can get ready in the morning quickly. Our unit was spotless and completely bug free and it was some kind of mating season for some flying ants or something so that says a lot about the quality of the cleaning. We are a family of 4 with 2 girls ages 5 and 3. The \"starter\" kit of stuff was way more than we needed for the week and we ate in 2-3 meals a day and only went off the resort to Disney on 3 days out of 7. We packed clothes for 3-4 days and didn't even use all the laundry detergent supplied. It sounds like different folks may have different needs, so I suggest checking out what is in the unit before shopping to decide for yourself. We had time to kill before getting our room and ended up buying toilet paper and detergent that we didn't use at all. Even soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion are all supplied for a weeks stay, so don't bother bringing any. If we went back, I'm convinced we could travel with 3 full-size carry-ons given what they supply in the villa and the laundry facilities. Beds and pillows were all excellent quality. As mentioned in other reviews, you can wait for the shuttle or you would need a car to get around all the facilities. The person who suggested the bike rentals is dead on. Based on the age of my kids, we didn't spend any money on extra activities, but I definitely would have considered renting bikes for the week. Maybe rent bikes AND kid trailers? That would be great to boot around the resort. I would have paid $100 for 2 decent bikes and a bike trailer for 2 kids for one week. We mostly hung out at the north village splash lagoon. The pool behind our unit worked well for quick cool-offs before dinner after a day at Disney or shopping. The 2 or 3 pools we visited were all very nice and clean. Keep an eye on little ones because I didn't see a lot of lifeguards, but the pools are about as toddler friendly as you can make them. We ate at Breezes twice. Decent food and prices were not bad for a resort. The service was fine. The millers ale house and olive garden just outside the resort were still way better value for money and tastier food (especially the ale house), but Breezes had entertainment for the kids (magicians, face painting, hula hoop competitions, balloon animal guy on stilts, so it's a toss up on whether I'd eat there or off the resort. Besides...you wouldn't have to drink and drive if you eat on the resort...which is definitely worth the extra price. Booze seemed very expensive compared to places outside the resort, but if you're just hanging by the pools, I noticed a lot of people discreetly using their own booze and no one seemed to care, despite the \"official\" signs. Super Target across the street was handy and cheap for everything from groceries to cheap pool toys that you wouldn't feel bad leaving behind. I am guessing that this place would be pretty good to stay at as a destination of it's own, even though we mainly used it as a base to visit Disney and various malls. If you are interested in the RCI exchange program, this would probably be a pretty nice place to be your \"home resort\"...but as I said, I'm saying that with no idea about the price and terms.

I spent most of my time at the pool while the fella's hit a couple of bucket of balls, golfed, kayaked, and visited the sports bar to watch the hockey playoffs. This resort offers so much onsite which was one of the reasons we chose it. It offers something for everyone in your family. Yes, you have to pay extra for most activities, but we felt they were reasonably priced. We didn't stay at River Island as it was very busy..it was Easter and many families were there. We were there with our 20 year old son and there were other pools to visit. We liked the fact that the villa offered all the comforts of home including a washer and drier (three boxes of soap too). We also liked the fact that there wasn't daily housekeeping so we could sleep in, or do whatever we pleased without interupting their schedule. We did laundry every other day, towels mostly, which wasn't a big deal. We ate breakfast and lunch usually at the villa and dinners out most nights. They do have barbeques set up in various areas and we did bbq one night which was nice. I brought extra paper products, laundry soap, dish soap and paper plates/napkins. They have a dishwasher, but it was just a easy to do dishes by hand.

We are not owners or RCI members as that is just not for us. We love this place and always stay here on our annual trip to the area. It has great rooms, a TON of stuff to do, intimate bars where you are welcomed like \"Norm\" at cheers and wide open spaces/swimming pools where you can remain anonymous. My husband loves it for the golf. I love it because it makes him happy and it has SO much to do. We love Orange Lake and accept it's limitations. It's limitations include - 1. No houskeeping if you stay 10 days or less. Not an issue for us. 2. It costs extra for activities - mini golf, rent a tube, hit a bucket of balls. Accept it and move on with your life. They offer the option to buy things in \"bulk\" (aka 3 days of golf) to get a better rate. 3. Customer service at locations that sell food IS SLOW. This drives me insane but I accept it in trade for the good stuff. Some of the best things we like to do in no particular order. 1. Go see Tommy Treadway at the bar. He really is a good singer and makes everyone feel welcomed. 2. Enjoy a drink or two at bar. 3. Go for a walk on grounds and look for alligators (they are there!). 4. Hit a bucket or two on the range. 5. Golf (just my husband - I don't golf). 6. Watch the golfers from our room's balcony/patio. 7. Get pizza from Paisan's pizza. 8. Get smoothies from Island connections. 9 People watch at pool. 10. Watch the lizards and hummingbirds around the pool. 11. Go to the Gatorland show. Things they could fix: 1. Customer service at food sale locations and at the location where the golf course/snack bar is together is HORRIBLE. I have seen some of the lsales ladies at the snack bar for YEARS. They never get any better. They don't smile. They aren't friendly. They aren't organized. They forget to tell you when your pizza is ready. But yet I see them year after year, after year. Seriously. Listen Orange Lake folks - go and be a secret shopper at your food locations. You will see what I mean. I think this should be the main focus of your energies because I would think each resort guest stops at these locations at least once during their stay. One thing in particular that drives me nuts is ordering an ice cream. You tell them your order. They don't write it down. And then they ask you 5 more times while they are making it for you to repeat your order. DRIVES ME NUTS. 2. Add more benches at the driving range by the golf academy. Currently there are 2. There are lots of spouses who like to come and sit on the benches and watch their spouses. We bring books and sit and enjoy the sun. 3. Trim the bushes on the left where the road from River island's Hippo Slide ends at the road that runs past the legends. Drivers cannot see cars coming from the left and I have seen some near misses. 4. Rent bicycles. For gosh sakes, I can't see why someone hasn't done this yet. The resort is huge. Rent bikes. 5. Understand that guests like to walk/bike/jog. During the day time, it might be okay to walk on the road that is a main drag. However, it is taking your life into your hands to walk at night on the main drag. PLEASE, PLEASE add sidewalks from one end of the resort to the next. 6. One more thing. On the last night of our stay (april 9) the air conditioning unit in one of the units in our building must have gone out. I was only getting 4 hours of sleep that night because of when we were leaving in themorning. That got cut to 3 because the maintenance guys decided to have an argument in spanish for about 2 hours outside while they determined how to fix the unit. I was on the 3rd floor and had to finally holler out. the patio windows..silencio, por favor....this resulted in 5 minutes of silence and then the argument continued.

The sales rep was furious to hear that this was our intention. He basically told us that we do not understand what the agreement was about; that we were supposed to use the money we paid for this trip as the downpayment for the timeshare. He even go as far to telling my husband that my husband had the worst attitude ever and that he is not a good father to our kids or a good husband to me. He told me he felt sorry for me that I was married to such a heartless man who didn't feel that buying a vacation for life for his family was important. He even told my husband that my husband's parents raised him wrong and so forth. Then he brings in his manager and another guy after that to try to convince us to buy. The manager was just as rude.

We stayed in a two bedroom villa that had just been remodeled. Nice decor and furniture, but cabinetry, appliances, and fixtures still seemed older. The beds were not the most comfortable. As others have said maid service does not come in unless an extra fee is paid for. Also, new towels are not brought, so you have to wash them yourself. I personally feel like maid service and fresh towels should not be an extra charge for owners considering the maintenance fees that owners pay. Food at the restaurants was average at best.

Although I have read that people like staying near the lazy river, I preferred the nice quiet area where you don't have any noise from neighboring condos or from the pool area. (something I did not get late at night at Disney's Coronado Resort). Although they offerred for me to attend a sales meeting (i.e. reception), they did not push when I declined and they did not try to hassle me with sales pitches the rest of the stay. So, not sure about the negative comments in that regard. Rooms were clean and well appointed (to the extent that I required). I almost preferred not having maids come in and out each day. About the only thing I would suggest is creating a little \"guide\" or something to that effect letting guests regarding how you would like the condo left (towels laundered, etc...). Also, wanted to give a thumbs up to Breezes (the only restaurant we ate at due to its convenient location to us)! Excellent food at a reasonable price.

Our 2 bedroom villa at River Island was clean and nicely-furnished. Food was yummy, waitstaff/bartender was personable, and live music was entertaining. Now the not-so-positives: The water pressure in the showers is horrible. The pools and hot tubs close at 10pm, which is insane. After enjoying the parks and stopping for dinner, our 8 year old barely had an opportunity to get wet before all of the water activities shut down. And the lazy river is lovely, but the $9.00 per person per day charge to use an inner-tube to enjoy it is ridiculous. And then the most miserable of all.........the \"time share sales presentation.\" When I first called to make my reservation, the very sweet young lady informed me we'd need to attend a NINETY minute, no pressure presentation to receive a discounted rate. I agreed to this requirement. When my reservation packet arrived in the mail, it listed a TWO HOUR presentation requirement, but I didn't balk, because \"what's an extra thirty minutes, anyway?\" But the mere fact that the sales team - and I mean team literally - simply wouldn't listen to our firm but polite refusal, made this quite unbearable. Our original sales guy, Sam, was very frank and straight-forward, and kept promising us that Orange Lake wasn't like other companies that try to pressure folks into buying something when they clearly are not interested. That Orange Lake is so admired and revered that they don't need to push and push and push. So when he pitched his \"deal\" to us, and we refused, he assured us that a sales manager was merely coming over to offer us some limited inventory properties, and then he'd \"sign off\" on our tour, and we'd be free to leave. Peter, the sales manager, dropped by, and he, too, was professional and business-like and left us alone after our firm \"no\". We were told someone was coming then to conduct a quick survey. The next TWO (yes I said TWO) guys I don't even remember their names, they kept offering us smaller and smaller \"deals\", and one of them even hinted at suggesting that \"surely our family could afford just 102.00/month\" despite our STRONG insistence that we weren't interested. The final guy tried to get us to buy a 999.00 week long vacation package that he was willing to finance for me right then and there - and I could take up to TWO years to schedule it. I felt like I was at a used-car sales convention. At this point I became a bit rude, I guess, and assured this poor last salesperson that I was not buying ANYthing, and I would very much like to leave. At this point we were escorted to the \"close out\" counter, stripped of our VIP passes and loaded on a trolley bus with the other \"losers\" and driven back to our vehicles. This miserable process wasted THREE AND A HALF hours of our vacation. Trust me, the lush grounds and nice accommodations aren't worth the \"cost.\"", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cQuick Mother/Daughter Weekend Getaway - Fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "vtxriders", "ReviewID": "UR104653996", "Content": "Booked a room through the Holiday Inn website and got an excellent price on a 2 bdrm condo in the River Island complex.

Good - everything! River Island is an excellent way to spend the day. The condo was in great shape and very clean. We were fortunate enough to not get any sales calls but we were only there 3 days.

Affordable Luxury!\u201d", "Author": "seamard", "ReviewID": "UR104646424", "Content": "We stayed at Orange Lake in the East Village from April 14th - April 18, in one of their 2 bedroom villas. We had a party of 8 which included couples, singles, toddlers, and bigger children. Our stay was absolutely wonderful and everyone enjoyed it. We were in Orlando for to go to Disney World but we still utilized some of the resort amenities. I am going to be as honest as possible so everyone can get a picture of the resort. THE GOOD: The resort is huge and has a lot of great things to do for couples, singles, and families. We played tennis, golfed, went to the arcade, and River Island. River Island (which is the water park complex on the grounds) was amazing!! The kids and grownups in our party loved it. The zero entry pool was perfect, it allowed our 2 and 3 year old party members to play in the pool without us having to worry. The lazy river was awesome! We really enjoyed it. And the water slides were extremely fun. Also they have places to get food and drinks right at the pool and if you do not feel like getting out of your lounge chair, there are servers who circle the complex and will take your order. Surprisingly the place was not too crowded despite our vacation coinciding with Spring Break for the Northeast. For the adults: the alcoholic drinks were inexpensive and they had discounted refills. We got the \"bucket\" which was literally a bucket that could serve 2-3 people for $8.50 (which you could refill for $7.50). They also have smaller refillable drinks that are only $5.00 to refill. Which is not bad for a frozen alcoholic beverage. The rooms were extremely spacious. 1200 sq ft in a 2 bedroom. It had a jetted tub in the master bedroom with a separate walk in shower. The living room had a nice sectional sofa with a pullout bed. The kitchen was well equipped. And they provided you with dish soap and laundry detergent. For the price it was a steal. We paid about $100 a night for this condo and we had room to hang out and have fun. If we had gone to a traditional style 3 star hotel we would have needed at least 2 separate rooms and we would have paid double the price. Also we were able to cook so we saved money on eating out. Another thing we really enjoyed was the screened in patio! We ate breakfast out there every day. The location was perfect. There was a Publix right at the front gate as well as a Super Target across the street from the entrance. There were restaurants in the resort as well as in the immediate surrounding areas. This resort is also located on 192 which gives you direct access to Disney World. It took us less than 10 minutes to drive from the East Village building to the parking lot at Magic Kingdom. It was perfectly located. The staff was great. Everyone was friendly and helpful. And they have 2 Disney World employees that work at the Attractions desk so you can purchase your tickets on sight. THE BAD: We usually stay in 3 or 4 star hotels and I think the mattresses and bedding in the Hyatt and Hilton hotels are a bit more luxurious. (This didn't really matter to us because the price was amazing, but you should be aware of it just in case it matters to you.) Check out is at 10am (You have to leave the room but you can keep using the resort amenities all day.) If you have small children be sure to bring plastic plates/cups from home or buy some disposable ones from the store because the rooms only have glass cups, plates, and bowls. We had a 2 and 3 year old with us so we went and bought them plastic Mickey Mouse souvenir cups. OVERALL: We had an excellent time, got a great deal, and had space to relax.

This resort was absolutely beautiful. My family and I stayed in the North Village, a personal villa and it was quite perfect for my family and I. We statyed in a two bedroom, two bath villa on the golf course, it was very clean, spacious and well stocked with amenities such as laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, soap, towels exc. The pots and pans were very new, the dishes along with silver ware was new. Overall, this villa was perfect. Check-in time was too late in the day, particularly when registration strongly encourage you to arrive for check in at 10:30 a.m. to ensure you get the specific room request that you prefer. After check-in is secure, you cannot officially check into your room until 4:00 p.m. - about 6 hours of riding around, eating & doing nothing. Because this was our first visit to the Resort, checking in felt like an obstacle course - being shuffled from one counter to the next with entirely too much information to absorb. The resort did offer several things to do such as swimming, golf, game rooms, putt putt, and many other things, but the additional amenties were with an additional cost, which I though was INSANE, especially with me being a guest in the Resort for 5 days. Pros: Plenty of space to stretch out Nice Kitchen Very clean-super clean!! Plenty of towels and clean linen Washer and Dryer in villa was nice Dishwasher was nice jacuzzi tub was nice Front desk-really nice Perfect for husband and wife Cons: too much information upon check-in (I felt like we were on an obstacle course and needed a personal tour guide every time we ventured out into the property) Basketball courts were not condusive for 12 year olds (older teenagers were always playing) Movie night consisted of dated movies that my children had already seen Fishing was available, however, I was never able to get info on how to take advantage of this ammenty The additional ammenties that my teenage children probably would have enjoyed came with an additional cost. My children are accustomed to the Beach for Spring Break (very, very last minute trip change from Destin to Orange Lake); super, duper bad mistake. I called the resort and was told there was a beach on the property (man-made, off a lake).........just not the same. So, NO BEACH people! Although our villa was extremely nice and I specifically requested an individual lodging; had I known to to request newest property (the one that's displayed on the web site) with ALL of the extra amentities surrounding this property, I would have requested this location. So in order to take advantage of these extra amenties, we had to drive to get to them and to me, vacation is about total convenience. Overall-the resort was extremely nice.

Despite the fact we arrived during a tropical storm and the rooms we requested were not adjacent (Virgin's fault) the check-in team did all they could to resolve this immediately. We were not sold any time share (maybe because we were exhausted Brits just off a 9 hour flight). We were grateful that two of the restaurants delivered take out as we were very hungry on arrival. We stayed in the East Village. The appartment we stayed in was very spacious, very clean and modern, peaceful. The next morning we awoke to gorgeous sunshine and lovely views of the golf course. The resort is stunning and very well maintained. If you keep your eyes peeled you may spot the odd bit of wildlife (baby alligator paid a visit). We also had views of the Magic Kingdom fireworks which were an added bonus. The resort is enormous and you will need a car (big time). The resort shuttle is very handy sometimes a bit sporadic but the drivers are also very friendly and will pick you up if you flag them down. The service overall at the resort is excellent, always with a smile. The resort is cashless. This was not mentioned in the Virgin Holidays Brochure or Virgin website. As typical Brits coming abroad typically we brought half cash, half travellers cheques. Credit card charges make bringing credit card unattractive. You can pay off your room charge with credit card, cash or travellers cheques but do note that to cash in a TC you can only do a max of $50 a day. Although a minor issue, it was a bit of a pain trying to keep track of spend. The local publix at the entrance to the resort allows you to cash $100 a day. Although we spent a fortnight in the resort we barely had time to do any of the many activities so will need to return another year to try them out (except for the Karaoke - give it a miss, the song list is outdated and nothing for the kids to sing!)

After looking at the pictures on the Holiday Inn Club website and seeing the Gold Crown rating that was awarded by RCI, we were sure this was the place we wanted to spend our spring break. After this trip, we will be sure to ask much more detailed questions regarding pictures that are on the website vs. each village/building because what we saw isn\u2019t what we got. Check-in was easy and quick where you received a $20 voucher for resort activities, which had to be activated at another counter in the lobby.

After checking out and entering our 1 bedroom villa in the North Village, we were quite disappointed!! It was sooo dated! I would rate this room a 2-star at best. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. The furnishings and accessories were dated. The grounds are obviously better kept and maintained than the inside of the condo, which is concerning for me as an owner. The North Village does appear to be one of the older complexes on property. In addition to this, it has been neglected. We had a myriad of issues: There were no sheets or blankets for the pull-out sofa, the oven did not work, there was a bug in the bed, the bathroom door did not open freely, pocket door to the bedroom did not open freely once closed, the closet door was not on track and our refrigerator leaked brown goo from the door. We did call housekeeping to have the oven repaired. It was completely fixed and functioning the next day. Housekeeping also supplied us with sheets, a blanket and pillows for the pull out sofa. The other issues we dealt with as they arouse on our own. A few days into our stay we received a call from a quality assurance representative to discuss the quality of our stay and we welcomed this because we were completely disappointed with our accommodations compared to what we saw online and the Gold Crown rating and all of the issues we had experienced at this point. We expressed all of our concern and issues with our villa; however, this turned out to be a presentation to sale us more points at the OL resort. During this presentation, we toured the River Island Signature Series condo model, which made us feel as though we really got the short end of the stick on our accommodations. This model was plush and had updated furnishings. I am not sure they are really concerned about quality?? There were good things about our stay\u2026 You can stay at any of the 4 villages and can use the amenities throughout the complex located at each village. Our little ones enjoyed the River Island lazy river and pool. By the way, if you choose to stay here as a family, request the River Island village. It is the newest complex and from our tour it was obvious that more care and attention is given to this complex versus the older complexes: North and East. We were just a short 10-15 minute drive to Disney. Also, if you stay at OL you will need a car or should use the shuttle as the complex is massive and to walk to each village to use their amenities might be a bit much. Also, another thing I did like is that you received calls to be sure the issues you called housekeeping regarding were resolved to your satisfaction. Also, you received calls regarding events taking place at the restaurants around the complex.

The reasons I didn't give it 5 stars: The pillows were like solid bricks. Not too comfortable, Our suite was too far from the shuttle stop to use, I think they should add another stop in the West Village. Didn't encounter any trouble with the sales teams. We politely declined everything and they left us alone. I think the complaints about the time share program are ridiculous.

This resort was absolutely beautiful. My family and I stayed in the East Village, bldg 8600. Our villa was perfect for my family and I. We statyed in a two bedroom, two bath villa with a screened in porch facing the 18th hole! Our villa was very clean, spacious and well stocked with amenities such as laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, soap, towels exc. The pots and pans were very new, the dishes along with silver ware was new. Overall, this villa was perfect. My husband and I stayed in master bedroom-king size bed adjoined to master bathroom with jacuzzi tub-very nice. My children and mother in law stayed in second bedroom that had two queen size beds and a nice size bathroom as well. Our villa did sleep 8, becasue the sofa did let out into a sofa bed-very comfortable for watching T.V. at night. The resort did offer several things to do such as swimming, golf, game rooms, putt putt, and many other things. Unfortunately for us, we did not get an opportunity to swim becasue it rained most of our stay while we were there. Pros: Plenty of space to stretch out Very large Kitchen-very nice Very clean-super clean!! Plenty of towels and clean linen Washer and Dryer in villa was nice Dishwasher was nice jacuzzi tub was nice Front desk-really nice Cons: Resort only has out door pools-we did not get an opportunity to swim because of the weather-tornados, severe thunderstorms-Resort really needs indoor pools for rainy days. Our villa had not flat screen T.V.s-out T.V.s were a little dated. Our coffee maker was old and needed an upgrade. We were obligated to do a time share presentation because of our vacation package-was more than 2 hours, it was more like 4 hours! and we did not have an opportunity to pick out time for our presentation. I attempted many times ti change out time but was rejected and finally told that the guest never select their times for presentation, and we have to stick with what we have scheduled. That kind of sucked becasue it did take up a large portion of our day. Anyhow, we will return but will never get pulled into a time share presentation again-very exhausting! So, overall-perfect resort and would reccommend for families with children. Caution: RUN AWAY FROM TIME SHARE PRESENTATIONS!! not worth the time you have to give up for your vacation no matter what they are offering!! it's always an catch in the end. We were told we would recieve a gift after the presentation and all we recieved was an attempted lure to by a prepaid vacation at the resort again. We told our sales guy no at least 3 times, afterwards they brought out another gut, we told no again, afterwards they brought out another guy, we said no again, then they brought out a 4th guy with a fake gift for our time which was a lure to purchase a prepaid vacation at the resort.

We were very happy with the resort. Note, though, that the first unit we were given was on a golf course with no pool or ammenities that we would use close by and we went back to the check in desk and asked if we could get something closer to some sort of ammenity we might use. And they gave us a unit walking distance to the smaller pool and hot tub in the West Village right near where you enter the resort (second road to the right) after coming in at the entrance across from Walgreens. We were happy with this. Do, though, be aware that this is a huge resort and unlike many of the smaller resorts in the area where you would always without question be able to walk to a pool, you could end up with a unit where you might even have to drive to get to a pool/hot tub. If you aren't happy with your unit, though, I bet they would move you like they did us if you ask. Customer service seemed outstanding. The unit we had was an older one story duplex unit that had been remodeled and was in great shape (newer kitchen with granite countertops, nice bathrooms -- beautiful tile, etc., flat screen TVs, paint, beds, furnishings, etc. all in good shape.) The nearby pool area and hot tub met our needs perfectly for a relaxing dip after a busy theme park day. It was kind of fun too, we saw the same people in the hot tub each night, so got to meet some of the other guests. The second bedroom had two queen beds and seemed almost as big as the master, had tons of drawer space, had the second bath connected to it and the common area with locks. We were really happy with the size of this bedroom and the unit in general. In most of the condo resorts we've stayed second bedrooms are smaller than this. The patio wasn't in as great shape as I would have expected, but was fine for sitting out on. I liked the balconies at the Sheraton Vistana Resort and Cypress Pointe, though, much better than this patio. It took us a little longer to get to some of the Disney parks and Sea World from here than timeshares right in Lake Buena Vista, but it was still very convienent for getting to these places. Think 20 minute drive rather than say a 12 minute drive. We weren't by the main West Village pool activity area or River Island, but there are frequent shuttles and you could easily take one of these over or drive over. We did use the tennis courts in the main West Village pool area, a couple of minute drive away. We found staff and other guests to be super friendly adding to our positive impression of everything. We took the shuttle over to River Island to look around, and this is a beautiful recreation area. My teen, though, was totally happy with our close by pool and hot tub and opted to go there rather than drive or take the shulttle over to this other area. (We really only had one resort day with all the other attractions we visited in the area, meaning that we were mostly only at our resort in the evenings.) There were planned activiies, but with our busy itinary we didn't participate in any of these. My parents first signed up to do the timeshare presentation on a Wedneday morning, but later backed out and got their deposit back easily. When the guy asked my mom what was keeping her from attending I got a big charge out of her answer: Shamu, Mickey, the Kennedy Space Center, and Disney Hollywood Studios. There wasn't a whole lot he could say with that answer.

The resort actually borders the Animal Kingdom, all other Disney/Universal and Downtown Orlando parks are within 20mins drive or so. The Resort is huge, and from what we saw very well maintained, made up of some 5 storey apartment blocks but predominantly villas. We stayed in one of the apartment blocks next to the Main reception building, I would not describe them as the lap of luxury, more of a functional, holiday home feel. The apartment was huge, by English standards, and was pretty much as illustrated in the brochures and on the website. All the amenities were modern and in good working order. The housekeeping was generally OK, but lacked some detail, i.e. behind sofas, furniture a little dusty when patted down, nothing a quick vacuum could not fix. The swimming pools etc were good, with activities for the kids throughout the day, especially useful when you cannot face yet another them park. Restaurants were fine, quality comfort fayre, good service and reasonable value. My one cautionary tail is with regards to the initial full on attack on your senses regarding attending the timeshare talks. Straight from a long travel day with two young kids, the last thing you want is to be bombarded by offers and deals designed to prompt you into attending a meeting. We were sold some discounted lazy river vouchers as well some others as an incentive to go for what was billed as a 2 hour presentation. The meeting does not take 2hours - yes they are charming and the chap whom greeted us took us around the resort on a golf kart, which the kids enjoyed, but the whole experience was a relentless sales pitch which lasted approx' 4 hours, as soon as you declined one offer, another more senior representative was introduced whom offered us yet another deal, we eventually had to say the same thing to approx/ four differnent people before we were released, however, then to validate our vouchers for Lazy river etc took about another 30 mins as the deal the receptionist sold us was incorrect, had to speak to yet more managers to get it resolved.

Our 2-bedroom villa (West) was immaculate. The only problems with our stay was the long, long wait to check-in. You'd think they would be more efficient since they have a list of who is checking in and know in advance how many will be coming in. We were checked in around 3:00 pm which was an hour early and were told by 2 people that took my cell phone # that they would call when the villa was ready. After killing 90 minutes picking up groceries at the Super Target nearby and driving around with no call, we finally went back to the registration desk to see what the problem was. They were rather \"short\" and said we could go anytime since the villa had been ready for a while (no call). When we got there the cleaning crew was still there. Part of the problem may have been that we had just driven in from Michigan and were rather tired, but that did annoy. The 2-bedroom villa has a sofa, loveseat, and one chair, TV, computer desk (with wireless Internet). One bedroom has a king size bed, the other bedroom has 2 double beds. Each bedroom has it's own full bathroom, TV and ample closets. I especially appreciate the full size washer and dryer in the unit since it means we can pack less. The villa is also equipped with a full kitchen and a dining room. The sliding glass doors from the living room and master bedroom lead to a cement patio with table & chairs. This year we looked out at a pond that provided entertainment from the wildlife. Other years we have looked over the golf course. We were well back from the road so had no problem with the noise, in fact we couldn't hear it at all. Be sure to ask about the location since road noise could be a problem. Everything was clean, worked and up-to-date. Couldn't improve on the villa at all. Be sure to request a first floor villa if that is important to you. We noticed that some people were staying in the few 2nd floor villas which would never have worked for us. The only other problem was an excessively hard sell presentation. Even after repeatedly telling the gentleman (who we were told wanted to meet to update us on changes recently made at Orange Lake) that we had no interest in purchasing additional timeshare points, we were insulted and pushed hard.

We did smell 'the smell' on a couple of occasions, but on these occasions we could also smell 'the smell' at Disney, so I don't think it's an Orange Lake only problem. No hassle with the security either, the staff at the gate always had a smile and a wave, but then so did we, so maybe it's a matter of treat people the way you want to be treated. This resort is cashless, as is mentioned in other reviews and on the literature we got prior to arriving. Anything you buy at the resort will be added to your room bill, this can be paid in cash at the end of your stay. Didn't see one single bug in our unit! As long as you go to this resort knowing that :~ it's a cashless, there is no daily maid service and it's BIG you should have no surprises.

The grounds were great to tour with the family. The rooms were large, spacious...we rented a double room (1 king 2 queens). But it was the ever growing little things that made the stay annoying. We stayed at the River (lagoon park). Shortly after settling in, another family came barging into our suite. Front desk double booked the suite. We couldnt call the front office since the villa's phone was dead. We hunted for a phone down the hall and an hour after that ackward moment, an employee came to the room and doubted we were guests. After showing ID and reservations he returned to provide us new keys so they could deactivate all keys assigned to the room. Later that night we had to deal with a parking lot party. Security would drive by for a presense, but the kids spread out like flies on #$@ and came back again. This went on until about 3am. Be sure to reserve a room on the lagoon side. If you're a light sleeper, the cars driving over the sewer grates in the street may nudge you awake often and the constant flow of travelers into the condo-facility area. The following day we started using the lagoon area. Its great and an deal place to entertain the family. You wont be badgered by staff, you just simply approach a bar or shop to grab a drink/meal. You could hit the local supermarket, use a cooler bag and have lunch with the kids at the lagoon without issue. The park keeps the staff presence very light. The staff size was only an issue during the high peak meal hours. When we tried to pay after having lunch and our room key couldnt be used for billing, they dont take cash, and our name didnt appear in their system. So I had to race to the room, grab a credit card and run back to pay the bill....while my spouse tried keeping our young kids seated for the journey. They wanted us to call the front desk to correct the issue, but again, the phone was dead during the entire duration so we had to commute across the resort to get support. Other issues - room missing remotes, house cleaning never stopped by to tiddy the beds or provide new towels/shampoo, phone didnt work, and the parking lot commotion is a bit much. The resort meals were medicore at best. Go offsite for better prepared meals at lower prices. Other than the constant escalating issues this would have been a better stay.

The view was not great, of course, but on the positive side it was quiet (very little traffic noise), and the balcony was nice and shady! I know we could have changed rooms, but we liked that we were not in the sun if we wanted to sit on the patio for breakfast or happy hour! We had amazing weather the entire trip. Hot and sunny with very, very low humidity. We were never bothered by a time share sell, not once. But we also had a different kind of package (they called it a \"marketing\" package?). My Dad is a Holiday Inn Priority Club member and was able to use points for a great discount on the first few nights! Those points add up!! The room - Ideal for the size of our group. It was very clean, spacious and well laid out. The beds were clean and comfy (one king and 2 queens). 2 bathrooms were both a good size as well. Never any noise in the halls, or above us. No slamming doors, no waiting for an elevator. You have to do your own laundry (towels and sheets) if you want this done for the duration of your stay. I am sure you could get clean towels if you asked, but we were supplied with good laundry soap, so we just did our own (we didn't bother with the sheets as we only stayed a week and showered every day). The room was ideally located for running back to make sandwiches for lunch, or grabbing a few drinks (they don't really want you to bring your own booze, but you can get away with it if you are subtle)! The pools and lazy river were excellent. They want you to rent a tube/float from them if you want to use something in the pools/lazy river. It's not cheap. As people often don't return the float they've \"rented\", we were always able to just grab one and use it (free of course). No issues with that. Beer can be bought more cheaply at the shops near the lazy river (they will even open your bottle for you), but the drinks at the bars are pretty handy. We never ate at any of the onsite restaurants as we often ate in the room. We did try the Alehouse up the street from the resort and it was very good....well priced too! Location - A bit of a hike to Universal, but only because of traffic. We went twice. But you could probably make a good vacation by simply staying at the resort! Close to a grocery store (Publix) and a Super Target. Publix was way overpriced, but Super Target was great. The resort is cashless - you need to use your card for everything (or credit card) so it's easy to loose track of what you've spent! Good to keep tabs on this as some things (like kids candy and even small bags of chips) are very pricey! If you have kids, stay at River Island. There is so much to do, and it's handy being able to make your own breakfasts lunches and save money while being close to the pools - generally kids really don't find eating that entertaining! Make sure you check what is available in the room before you make assumptions (like we did) and buy extra paper towel, coffee filters and toilet paper! The golf courses and grounds looked wonderful as well! The only solid complaint I have, and this is through my Dad's experience, is that the reservation system is in need of some serious help. We wanted to add a night at the end of our stay and it was a massive pain in the butt - although it did work out. We actually had to check out and check in again!! Really! For an extra night - which we asked about 4 days in advance! If you want something, go to the front desk so you can at least struggle in person! It's a shame because Holiday Inn is always so consistent and efficient with their reservation system. Realizing that this property is not entirely owned by Holiday Inn, I still think the solution is simple - communication! The resort staff don't adequately communicate with those in other areas of their resort reservation system, and the computer reservation systems just don't \"talk\" to each other! Luckily, we didn't really need anything beyond changing a reservation so we didn't need to get to frustrated! But it was one of the most ridiculous things I have ever encountered! PS - the key cards often demagnetize (as they do in many resorts), so always have 2 keys with you at all times!

Basically 7 adults in the villa, pretty tight squeeze, but it was okay. They put us in a villa over a 1/4 mile away from the closest resort shuttle stop so we had to drive everywhere. It's so spread out it was ridiculous. This place is completed filled with families and seniors. We hung out at River Island area to hang by the pool since it seemed the nicest. Here are my tips for this resort. 1) Utilize the Super Target to buy groceries. The Publix has a deli, but the food pricing and their produce is weak and EXPENSIVE. The Super Target has a full service produce section and was much better in pricing. 2) Bring a soft sided cooler. It helped with bringing drinks etc to the pool. The pool rules say not to bring in coolers but if you are discrete it is fine. They have little or no staff around and few poolside servers to worry about busting you. 3) Plastic cooler cups to use pool side or discreetly pour your beer or cocktails in from your personal coolers. 4) DVDs - there is a DVD player in the living room, but they do have a RedBox at the Walgreens across from the West Entrance of the resort. 5) Portable speakers for your ipod, if you have any interest in listening to music in the villa. There is no radio and the tv channels don't offer music either. 6) Bicycles. If you are driving and can, it seemed like it would be great to have bicycles to cruise around on. Too bad they don't rent them onsite. I did see a few kids that had apparently brought their own. 7) If you are planning on working out in one of the gyms, bring your patience. They are all very small with limited equipment. I always had to wait for a cardio machine and the Mussels gym at River Island is the only one with weight machines. Overall this place was okay. For a group of 7 adults ranging from 27 to 40 with no kids it wasn't really our cup of tea. Too many kids, too many seniors....not saying that is a bad thing, but just not our thing. One night we went down to Breezes for some \"live music\" and it consisted of a guy with a portable keyboard singing \"Crocodile Rock\" with a bunch a kids with grandma & grandpa cutting up the dance floor.....again, just not our cup of tea.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA hidden gem amongst all Orlando-Area Resorts\u201d", "Author": "Nut4Disney", "ReviewID": "UR97848944", "Content": "I travel extensively for business. Having recently stayed at the Waldorf Astoria-Bonnet Creek, Walt Disney World Hilton, and even the Homewood Suites by Hilton at Lake Buena Vista, I must certainly stay, that this resort is \"on my list\". I generally prefer to stay \"on property\" which means a Disney resort or the WDW Hilton, or WDW Doubletree Guest Suites. I usually get upgraded to a suite at the Hilton properties, but this time, I wanted to make sure I had a full kitchen. The Homewood Suites just doesn't compare to this property, and neither does any Residence Inn (by Marriott) that I've stayed at, including the one at Sea World! Simply put, the property itself is amazing. From River Island to Golf and mini-golf, there are so many things to do just on the property. So much so, I probably won't even use my Disneyworld annual pass on the next visit. The resort is the size of my home time... really! It's about 6 square miles, and there are conveniences right outside the entrance, from a Publix Supermarket to a Super Target right at the same traffic light. Little known, is that it's really close to Disney's Animal Kingdom and you ould use Sherbeth Road to get on to Disney property. Traffic can get tight over by mile marker 5-8 on Irlo Bronson Highway, and Sherbeth can save you some time, but going down to World Drive (the \"main\" entrance to WDW) is not so bad. Just plan your travels accordingly. I stayed in the East Village in 87526 and the unit was spotless and very nice. The furnishings aren't as \"nice\" as the Waldorf-Astoria, but you're comparing 5-star to 4-star hotels. I did NOT expect to have any traditional hotel services and this is probably where many people start complaining about this \"resort\". It's a timeshare resort, and just like living in a fancy condo, service is different from a full-service \"hotel\" like a Waldorf or Four Seasons. While I didn't need any extra services, I found that the staff was pretty friendly. I went there expecting \"bad\" from some of these reviews, and got the exact opposite! Things do happen and not every situation can be fixed immediately. I've learned to be patient and I have experience in such things as I spent over 180 nights in hotels just in 2010 alone. The timeshare sales part was quick and easy. I told them I live in Florida and that if I were to buy a timeshare, it would be a Disney Vacation Club property. Sale ended! I couldn't care any less about $20 off or even a $75 coupon -- which they upped it to when I said no. Sorry, but it's true. My time is worth more than $75 for a 90-minute presentation.

Huge master bath with a jet tub that (had no black stuff coming from the jets) It was very clean. The unit smelled when we entered though and we thought of pesticide right away but you could tell it had been closed up for a while and was musty. We saw no critters in our condo unit....none! The beds were very comfy. The pull out in the master was a bit old with springs and I called and they brought a new one with out any question right away and they even called back to make sure we received it. We asked for extra blankets and laundry soap twice and it was delivered almost before we got off the phone with a call back each time from the front desk to make sure we receive the things we requested. We even had wake up calls daily. We had no issues at all with our requests. We were all VERY IMPRESSED!!! Great job!!! We had to buy a candle and air freshener spray because the unit definately had an odour. We also purchased some lysol cleaner for general cleaning ie shower that had a small bit of mildew in the caulking around the shower door and to do general cleaning of the sinks toilets etc. It would be nice if that was also supplied on arrival to the unit. Over all the unit was very clean. The carpets could at bare minimum be cleaned if not replaced as I said it was somewhat outdated. The smell was in the carpet I think. The unit was very livable and cozy otherwise. The smell only hit you when you first entered and then it was gone..I guess we got used to it after a while The outdoor smell as other people had mentioned we think was from the bogs. It arrived usually late at night or sometimes just in the mornings and left when the sun came up and the dew left the lawns. It was so bad one morning when I went to the car I almost threw up.It was short lived and worse on the higher floors. We also smelled this on the highway on the way home from the Space Center. I do think its the swamps they are everywhere. We almost wondered if that was the smell in the unit or the pesticide or a bit of both. The unit was great and we all enjoyed it. The staff was fabulous even at the restaurants and bar areas at the pools. The pools were GREAT. River Island was honestly better than our resort in Playa Del Carmen and HUGE. It was beautiful!!! I'm not kidding. Yes $9.00 for the tubes on the lazy river, or the big slide or mini putt but they also have 3 day deals for 34.00 how can you beat that and you spent how much at Disney?? Nothing to complain about!! All day pleasure for the kids and big kids too! The guys golfed the gals shopped. The kids went to the lazy river, arcades and mini golf. The resort has so much to offer. I went to the gator show myself.. everyone else slept in. it was great. He was a bit of a comedy act to boot. Over all we had a fabulous time. The resort is close to everything!! The pools and the grounds were beautiful and WELL kept . The staff were wonderful. The security was superb. We were never hounded about the time share. We said no at check in and that was the end of it. Golf gets cheaper rates throughout the day. Check that out. Ticket counter right there. They even call you daily and leave messages to tell you about the daily specials at the courses restaurants, things happening that day at the resort etc. We did so much off the resort and wish we had more time to enjoy River Island and time at the resort. It really is a nice place! Oh and the alligators in the ponds pretty cool too. Just don't get too close. We would absolutely return ....but would probably stay at River Island Next time!

We arrived at the resort at 10 AM after an early flight and were told that our room would be available right away. This was a pleasant surprise as we thought we wouldn't be able to check in until 3 PM. The desk clerk was very helpful and gave us a map of the resort and directions to our room, as well as as many room keys as we needed (which was great for a large family). We stayed in a 3 bedroom suite on the second floor of an East Village building. When we arrived at the room, we were disappointed by the trash bags that had been left in front of the door as well as the litter that was present in the hallways. The room itself, however, was quite spacious and cool which was a relief. Our suite had 2 bedrooms with king beds and 1 bedroom with 2 double beds, perfect for our party of 6. There were 3 bathrooms with showers and one that also had a large bathtub, which was very nice. The shower adjoining the room with the double beds, however, was incredibly small, and no matter which way the lever was turned, the water never grew hotter than lukewarm. We also had a considerably spacious kitchen with a refrigerator, microwave, stove, dishwasher, and sink, as well as dish sets. There was also a pantry which hid the garbage can. The table in the sitting room was quite large, as was the couch. Some of our party thought that the TVs were a bit dated, but that won't an issue for those who are here to get some sun. The small outdoor patio area provided a nice relaxation space. The cleanliness of the rooms was a bit of a disappointment. The counter surface next to the stove was damaged and ripping up, and it had not been fixed. The windows were also incredibly dirty. Another disadvantage of the suite was the noise. From the bedroom that faced the building hall, absolutely anything anywhere else int he building could be heard. We were kept awake at night by the pounding footsteps above and woken up early in the morning by sound of loud conversations as families made their way down to the parking lot. The amenities of the resort are great, if you feel like paying for absolutely everything. The only things you can get for free here are the towels and the lounge chairs. Everything else from mini-golf to inner tubes comes with a price. The pool and lazy river at River Island, however, are excellent and kept at a nice temperature. The hot tubs often get overfilled, but sometimes you can catch it empty at just the right time. We rented a cabana for the second day, which was nice because it comes with a mini-fridge as well as a TV and is completely covered for those who wish to stay out of the sun. The only complaint we had about the pool was that it was a 15 minute walk, so we chose to drive. If you want to get anywhere on the resort (unless your room is right in front of where you need to be) you need to lather up with sunscreen and be prepared to walk a while to get there. There is also plenty to do around the resort. We visited 2 of the restaurants, both of which were nice. We aren't golf players, but there is an extensive course for guests to use (at a price of course). The several shops around the resort have some really nice things, as well as convenience items. There is also a (free) fitness center which has a nice selection of workout equipment. Beware though, we were told that the scale in the fitness center reads 10 pounds lighter than your true weight. The location of the resort itself is also great. We could get everywhere we needed to go within 45 minutes of driving. We didn't make it to Disney but it was conveniently close by. Our stay at Orange Lakes was relaxing and fun-filled, and the few complaints we had are minor. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the guests are agreeable.

My Mother purchased the timeshare here in 1994 and we have gone down at least once a year since (she owns 2 weeks at orange lake). This is the most popular property in all of Orlando and there are definitely reasons for this. The West Village is the oldest part, but also the only with 1 level properties. They are not as new and exciting, but they are private and offer a more comfortable setting if you rather not have people over your head or if you do not want to walk up and down stairs. We own in the West Village but have stayed in the North as they too offer beautiful 3 bedroom condos. The layout in the North Village is the nicest in my opinion, even if it is 2 stories high. It's close to a pool and tennis courts of that is your thing. If you are traveling with adults only, I suggest you STAY AWAY FROM the large pools. Your best bet is to visit the older pools at the front and back of the resort. While they do not offer the amenities that the new complexes offer, they will give you peace and quiet. The lazy river is not so lazy. Kids are screaming..parent are yelling at their kids...food is in the pool and there isn't a cabana available. It is a mob scene. You cannot get through to the front desk, unless you go there in person. Orange Lake is aware that they are a premier resort in Orlando so I think this has gotten to their heads. We paid 15K for each week...these same weeks go for over 100K in smaller units in the year 2011. We find it VERY ANNOYING that they continue to call you and ask that you come to a \"welcome breakfast\" when clearly it is to sell you on the idea of buying something additional or exchanging your weeks for points. No matter how many times we tell their sales people we are not interested, they never listen. they are very aggressive. So much so that I had a strongly worded conversation with he sales manager 2 years ago. And don't forget the highway running through it. Overall Orange Lake is great property but it is CROWDED and you are just a number. It is not like it was 10 or 15 years ago. Overall, you will feel like you are home and you can cook if you prefer to save money but personalized service will not happen. They will surely call you over and over about that breakfast and don't take the word No lightly. We are proud Orange Lake owners, despite the changes we have seen since 1994 but we believe that they have a long way to go when it comes to improvements. Perhaps they should focus less on condos and more on staff training.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cFamily vaca with small children Jan29-Feb5th 2011\u201d", "Author": "MaineBengalTigers", "ReviewID": "UR95967886", "Content": "I will spend most of my review on the resort, and not the room, for we were on vacation for the resort, 2 adults and 2 small girls, (5 yrs & 2 \u00bd yrs old). We spent most of the week at the resort facilities, unlike most reviews that were there for the Parks, so I tried to see as much as I could of all 4 villages. Accommodations {West Village}: Stayed at Orange Lake Circle, Villa# 2119 on an RCI exchange: (this is just inside the park West entrance} 1 story 2 Bed/2 Bath Villa, 32\u201d LCD Living Rm with DVD/VCR, Bedrooms standard 27\u201d TV\u2019s NO DVD/VCR players, bathrooms kind of cramped set-up, Living/Dinning rooms separated by a step down {lighted, nice for night light}, both ample in space, Kitchen well equipped and stocked for 3 Loads Wash/Dishwash. Paper goods 3 rolls of TP and 3 tissue boxes per bathroom, s/b enough for the week for a family of 4. Hard water and low pressure. Property near entrance to Resort which I could hear Rt192 traffic at night, not loud but when quiet it is noticeable, \u00bd Mile to West Village Clubhouse. Patio view was of a swampy area, Cranes Bend golf hole #4 just on the other side of swamp, Crane birds actually visited one afternoon, very CLOSE, not scared. Free Wi Fi in Villa. Check-in, fast but request for Crib was not met on first night, 2 \u00bd yr old fell out of double bed first night, follow-up with Resort Services was quick the next morning after I let them know {note it is sometimes difficult to get through to Resort Services on phone, so I went to the desk to make sure this was done asap} Customer service good, but the crib and our Pizza order was messed up. Out of 5 services request I made during the week, they messed up 3 of them, this is a large resort but if I only had 5 calls in need of something, and they messed up 3x, not a very good average, but folks were nice and understanding when I complained. Only one timeshare call when I told the sales agent that we were not interested. Calls on answering machine were for resort activities, which helped on some days. Overall Resort had nice grounds and water features. Shuttle service I used twice, no more than 5-10mins wait {Legends course to River Village & my Villa to West Village Pool complex} Resort Reviews by Village: West Village Pool area: {Note: all pools we visited never were more than 5 ft deep, all have zero entry and depths from zero to 1ft, 2ft, 3ft, 4ft} Zero entry had fountains at edge that our 2 \u00bd yr old loved at 6 inches deep. Another pool area we did not visit that did not have zero entry and was near hot tub. Breezes Bar Dinner for family, $58, Kids meals $5, Burger decent, Tuna Salad avg. Daily Happy Hour 4-6pm, $2 domestic drafts, kids hula hoop contests, balloon maker, dancing by resort folks during nightly Sunset Celebration at Breezes/West Pool area, real fun for my girls after pool time, we spent 2-3 evenings at the Sunset Celebration. Arcade is loud but plenty of games, $5 cards get you about 3-4 games depending on what you play, most games are 90-100 points, $5 gets you 250 points with some prize tickets on your card for little trinket stuff for the little ones at the counter. Rental boats can be found here, beach front lake with volleyball, really nicely done adjacent to the pool area. Swampy Club: played WI, chalk board, & crafts, cost $2-$4 for colored sand filled plastic star. Smallish room with 3 Video game TV\u2019s, 2 Ping Pong tables, some legos and board games locked up in the cabinets. Marketplace: smallish ALL IN ONE building, some gifts, Pizza (which like many reviews have stated, is great}, Eddy\u2019s Ice Cream and the Golf shop for Cranes/Reserve courses. Not much on essentials, I needed a razor but they did not have one, but Super Target is just outside the resort for all your needs. Played 9 Hole Cranes Bend Golf course, par 30, some nice holes & good conditions, worth the 50% off greens fee offer they left on my messages (see earlier above), $38 with rental clubs included. North Village: Splash lagoon is nice, great toddler pool no deeper than 1ft with mushroom waterfall feature. Water fountains near entrance for small ones to play in. Pool area snakes around, one end with small water slide into 3 \u00bd ft of water, then moves to water volleyball area, then onto basketball hoop, and towards zero entry pool that snakes around pool complex, depth varies from zero to 4 ft all around, then turns around to another area towards various depths at the other end with a waterfall over rocks. We did not eat at the Terrace or anywhere at North Village, nothing was open, but we were there before noon. Legends Walk golf course is located here, pro shop is SMALL, I did not play the course. East Village: Only saw one pool, did not visit, smallish and looked more for adults. Played Legends Course, nice, they say front is links, on google maps looks back and forth, but the holes are really separated more than I would think for links style, was worth it, paid through Golfnow dot com, $56 at 1pm, so worth that price and I have played many courses, I would pay up to $80 for this Florida course, better than Disney Magnolia, Falcons Fire and Metro West. Had lunch at Legends Bar, burger at bar was a little better than Breezes, average pub fare price. River Island: Lazy River = fun, just difficult for adults to get in and out of tubes, Lazy River depths 2 1/2 to 4 ft throughout, with some overhead waterfalls during trip, about 10-15mins trip for $9 per adult all day fee (kids free with paying adult} Pools on both ends of River Island are zero entry, the pool near the fun zone seemed less busy. Fun Zone is an SAND area with Bungee, Climbing rocks, Hippo inflatable waterslide, volleyball & Mini golf, we did not enter the fun zone {extra cost}. Note: bring your lazy river tube with you to the pool areas after your trip, may have to go around 1 \u00bd times, you can access the other pool areas from the Lazy river there are forks in the river to the other areas. Playground is located at River Island, average school playground size, maybe smaller. Breakfast with Swampy and friends is at River Island Dining, $3.99 per child & $9.50 per adult, drinks extra at $2.50 per. Met Bandit the Racoon, Ashley the Otter & Swampy the alligator, they come out one at a time in the morning. Buffet breakfast, fruits, breads & typical buffet stuff, no pancakes, but one omelet made to order is included, we spent $50 with tip included. Misc: You can purchase a 3 or 7 day fun card that includes mini-golf, hippo slide and some other activities that cost extra. 3 day fun card cost $35, we spent almost 4-5 full days at the resort and did not purchase one, the kids seemed fine in the free pools & other free stuff available. Summary: Orange Lake Resort is great for families, or anybody for that matter. Golf is nice, Bars are nice, restaurants & all facilities are at least better than average. If you are not expecting a 5 star resort, you will be more than happy staying here. Our visit was great, we were lucky with good weather so we could enjoy everything. Most of the negative reviews are for Villas that are not well taken care of or poor customer service, not necessarily what the resort can offer. You never know what you may get for a room, ours was fine, not high end, but certainly acceptable for a vacation home. Only complaint would be the sofa couch was a bit un-comfortable and worn. Hope this review will help those traveling with little ones, feel free to ask me any questions, I use Trip Advisor as a guide in my planning, and all the reviews posted by travelers, good or bad, are very helpful.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGolf haven ..and fun for family\u201d", "Author": "bsticky", "ReviewID": "UR95797516", "Content": "We stayed in Villa #2126 West Village. Our check-in was very quick but then they handed you a $20 \"welcome cerficate\" which you needed to get activated and thats when they attempeted to rope you in to their condo sales presentation. After 3 firm \"NO\"s they finally stopped bugging us.We did not use our $20. Our villa was very close to the West exit to highway..which would have been great if we were going to disney or other off property outings but are vacation was to include relaxing & swimming at the resort. We were able to walk to one small pool with hot tub...which was great. Anywhere else we had to drive to...the resort is like a town of it;s own. You MUST have a car!!! We purchased the 7 day fun pass which included the lazy river raft (which is the only raft permitted in the lazy river), unlimited mini-golf, and the fun zone @ River Island which includes the Blow up hippo sllide, rock climbing & bungee trampalining which costs $50 for adults & children 5 & up! I would reccommend to purchase only the 3 day for $35 per adult & children as 2 days were used for travelling and you do not need the raft that they rent for the lazy river, it was nicer just to float on your back ( because the weather was only 65 degrees when we were there). The pools are free..so there is lots to keep them busy. The North village pool was the best for my 3 year old as there was a water slide that she could do by herself, and adults and older kids could go on it as well. The pool was heated...it was great. The only problem was that we could not find out where to get a volley ball or water basketball for the pool. The West village pool seemed busier so we never swam there but we did rent a Pirate ship paddle boat for $14/ 30 minutes which was the prefect amount of time to go around the lake.(lots of different boats available if you have the funds.. sea doos $62/ 30 mins $100/ 1 hour., pontoon boat $72/30 mins $120/hour, gonala $25/30 min, $39/hour, waterski, wakeboard & tubing $72/30 mins, $132/hour) They offer a 30 minute boat ride for $10 pp. We also attended the Gatorland Show for $5 pp...we saw 2 aligator and had the chance to touch them...ok but would not reccommend it as a must see. Our actual Villa was fantastic, clean, well stocked kitchen. The master bathroom was extreamly small but ok. It was great to have our own driveway which was 5 steps to the door. Inroom safe great idea, you reset the combo very easily. The Marketplace...produce was rotten and not a good selection of things. Highly reccommend going to Walmart (off Hwy 27) to purchase food (much cheaper than Publix as well). We attended the character breakfast $3.99 /child $9.99/adult drinks extra ( juice $2, coffe $2.50) good selection of breakfast foods (cereal, fresh fruit, various breads & bagels, eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, pancakes, etc) Only 2 characters were there...raccoon & otter. My 3 year old loved it and especially loved the tropical island music. The on property gift shops were well priced and great selection..very surprised expected higher prices. We went to the Arabian Nights dinner show which is a 15 minute drive from the villa ...after reading many reviews.. very pleasantly surprised by the food quality (steak - great, chicken- awesome, even the kids meals were good, salad delicious and dinner roll ok, Strawberry shortcake fantastic and the brownies were TOO chocolately?? can you imagine.

We loved it so much that this year we came back with the same relatives plus brought the in-laws along. At check in my notes from booking were not on file(in regards to one of our group members being disabled) The lady who checked us in had a slight attitude about this even though I WAS SAYING HOW SORRY I WAS to in convenience HER with our needs! When we got to our room I had to clean the floor, cooktop & cupboard handles in the kitchenette because they were covered in something sticky. During my quick clean I noticed 3 small insects near the fridge but quickly squished them without paying too much attention. The next night my group went out for dinner and when we came back in the late evening, I went to the kitchenette, turned a light on and WOW there were roaches on the counter, wall and floor! I went down to guest services and informed them. The receptionist took my complaint and after I told her I wanted to be in different building she assigned us a beautiful villa. However, she had to go to her manager in the adjoining office, in which the \"manager\" never once came to apologize for this pest control situation! Very poor customer service if you ask me. I would be making it very clear how sorry I was on behalf of Holiday Inn. I had to wake my 2 yr. old up at 1am to move rooms, be separated from the rest of our group (which was rectified after a large amount of fuss the next day) Toss out several grocery items and be inconvenienced on what is suppose to be a vacation. We were so tired from packing & un-packing and moving all of our group we lost a full day of our vacation. All in all, this time around the service here was lacking from last year. Several people were not so happy to be doing their jobs, 1 of 3 timeshare staff were also rude. A big facility like this should have a regular pest control procedure that would have prevented this and management should have showed us a little more empathy to our situation... including at least ONE apology! The room upgrade is lovely and appreciated but any hotel would have done the same... it's the personal touches that make the situation better. I really thought long and hard before posting this and if I was treated differently this may not have been posted. So, if you book here you WILL have some sort of issue, it WILL be rectified but you will NOT feel like anyone really cares. On the up side the grounds, pools, lazy river and activities are wonderful.

They didn't have a 3 bedroom unit available for the week we wanted so instead we reserved both a studio and 2 bedroom for our family using our RCI points. The studio was located in the West Village which is attached to the main lobby. It was set up like an oversized hotel room (2 beds, couch, small table and kitchen with microwave, sink, range, dishwasher). The room was clean and the beds very comfortable. The hallway to the rooms need an update but the rooms themselves served us just fine. The cost per night listed on travelocity was at the the rate of $69.00 per night which you really can't beat. One thing that makes it different from a regular room is no cleaning service. We paid extra to have the room fully cleaned ($39) and it was a complete waste. The maids made the beds (we were suppose to get new bedding) and gave us new towels. The chips my daughter dropped on the floor were still there so a vacuum was never used. The table was also still dirty so no windex was involved in the cleaning either. I enjoyed staying in the West Village because they had a lot going on. The pool had activities for the kids during the day and karoke at night. The restaurant was also good. Our other 2 bedroom unit was located in the West Village as well but in a different building. The room seemed to be recently renovated and was very clean and roomy. It had a beautiful view overlooking the golf course. It was walking distance to the main lobby and market. I also visited the River Village which looks brand new. It's a large resort with a big pool, slides and lazy river. The air temp was low 70's and the pool was just too cold to use. I found the West Village pool to be more bearable for season. We drove the entire resort which is huge! It's like the size of a small town. Looked like all the sections had there own restaurant, arcade, and pool. Some bigger and some smaller. I would recommend Orange Lake to any family on a budget. I think it's much nicer than a moderate disney hotel. I also liked that I felt like I was staying at resort and not just a hotel.

The toilet paper was rough and super thin. The bedding on the master beds did not fit. They sheet and blanket fit a single bed and not a King size bed. All amenities cost you at this place, including min. golf. The check in was a joke, juggling the guests after a long trip from one counter to another trying to set up a time share sale. The $20.00 free spending certificate can only be used to buy tickets. Another joke. The phone calls to the room to announce that we have our own personal vacation planner??? What's that about?

Check In- signature guests have a private check in area, just ask someone on arrival rather than joining any queues. Check in was quick and drinks were offered,,, Credit cards are swiped and you do have to sign to agree to non smoking policy in rooms and there is 250 dollar charge if you do. I guess you are able to smoke on balconies. When checking out, just need to pop to concierge on 8th floor. Rooms - Stayed on 6th floor and room was excellent, exactly as described on website. Very clean, beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. Flat screen TV's in all rooms with surround sound dvd player in living room. Concierge on 8th floor have plenty of new release films that you can borrow free of charge which came in handy although they don't tell you this anywhere it is useful to know before you go as was perfect when returning back at end of day from parks and trying to get kids to unwind. We even saw films that hadn't been released here yet which kept daughter very happy! Kitchen was very well equipped with modern appliances and granite work surfaces. Master bathroom had jacuzzi bath and full size shower, bedroom 2 just had a shower. Plenty of good quality fluffy towels and toiletries included a razor, shaving gel, toothbrush as well as the usual. Small supply of dishwasher and washing powder etc provided but you can just ask for more if you need it. Balcony with seating for 4 and could just about see fireworks from disney at night. No daily maid service but we did have one clean halfway through the 10 days and we did get a call the day before to let us know what time they would be cleaning which was useful. There is a hoover, dustpan and brush etc there though along with iron/ironing board if you need it. From previous reviews, we were expecting pressure from sales team but we only had 2 courtesy calls during our stay from our concierge leaving messages welcoming us and inviting us to a drinks reception which we didn't go to so can't comment on that but overall very pleased that we weren't bothered at all. Had no complaints at all about the room itself, just one small thing which didn't spoil our stay was that the guests in the room above were very noisy and you could hear children bouncing balls and the sound of dragging chairs across floor but guess that is down to the parents, not orange lake!! Resort - Pools were great, didn't spend much by pool as it wasn't that hot but great private area just for signature guests which needed your room key to get into. It had lovely sunbeds and better towels and there was usually someone there to serve drinks and snacks. You didn't have to walk far though to the nearest bar or restaurant which was reasonably priced and good quality,Starbucks on site too which was good. 6yr old loved the arcade, you loaded up a card and they could swipe to play games which you could also win points which can be saved up and then exchange for small rewards, kids loved it... Resort is very big and do need to drive or get shuttle to other villages. Plenty to do for all ages. Signature guests get a wristband which entitles you to free inflatables for the lazy river, kids bungee jumping, free slides and crazy golf for the whole stay which is a good saving if you have little ones.

Room: Stains on carpet, hair on bathroom floor, and unit needed vacumed. Called the front desk and they said they would send someone. A guy showed up, handed me the vacum, wiped the floor in the bathroom and left. I had to vacum and then re-cleaned the bathroom floor. We did not have a Villa, just a studio. Which translates to a room with a counter that had a kitchenette. Two double beds. No Balcony, which turned out to be a good thing since our room overlooked the pool where they had Kareoke until 11:00 every night. After a long day in the parks we were tired. The noise kept us awake every night. When we asked to change rooms we were told we could upgrade at an additional cost. There was one elevator, which was the farthest from our room, I had a back injury so I needed a scooter, so I had no choice but to use the filthy, paint peeling, smelly elevator. Speaking of smelly, no maid service, so people were told and did place their garbage outside their doors at night. Nothing like walking down a hallway with trash everywhere that stinks. The comfrter on one bed had holes in it, as did some of the sheets. Then there were the cockroaches. Most likely from te garbage in the hall.

The resort is, however, huge, and very oriented toward golfers. There are no sidewalks so it's necessary to walk on the road, or take a shuttle bus. It might not be the best place for families with small kids who'd prefer a short, and safe, walk to swimming and restaurants. We ate at Breezes, a restaurant in the West Village, and both the food and service were excellent. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone staying on or off the resort. The staff is very friendly and they try to be helpful. However, we did have a little trouble. There was a broken fridge in the unit when we checked in (with a car full of groceries). We were told that we'd have to relocate since a fridge repair wasn't available (although we waited for over an hour for a repair person to show up). At first, we were told that the only available room was on the far edge of the resort - too far for the kids to travel to the pool alone. After some complaining, a closer room was found, but it had just been painted and the smell was pretty strong. After more complaining, we were offered a second air filter and some free activity passes, but no other room. We definitely were given the impression that, since we were staying as part of a vacation package, only certain rooms would be available to us. In fact, we were told that River Island was part of a \"different pricing structure\" and that we weren't eligible to stay in that part of the resort. This was annoying since we'd booked a full price package that included accommodation and theme park tickets. I was surprised that we found ourselves subject to limitations regarding the room. I would not recommend booking this resort through a vacation package - I'd recommend dealing with the resort directly to be sure that you get the location that you want.

Given this was a Holiday Inn resort, we did not anticipate the daily telemarketing calls promoting commerce at the resort, or trying to push us into attending sales meetings. It was a nuisance at best. The room was ok, but somewhat dated in terms of furnishings and decor, and a bit worn. The kitchenette was useful and reasonably appointed, even with a dishwasher which was nice, and a top quality microwave convection oven, as well as stove top and fridge. But rooms are not served and we had to regularly cart our own garbage out. On another positive note, laundry facilities are provided and they were very good, with basic machines at no charge, providing even detergent. Very useful especially for a family with small children. After the first full day of our vacation, our daughter was exhausted and unable to dine out. On resort restaurants do not deliver, apart from one which will deliver pizza. We wanted Indian and ordered from off resort. We were told by front desk staff that ordering in was not a problem and deliveries could be received at our room. This was not to be. The gate staff refused entry to delivery service, and in a tired state, had to dress and make the long trek out to retrieve the car then drive the long distance to the gate. Gate staff advised that their job was to keep people from coming to the resort and using the water-park facilities, and that's why non-registered visitors were denied entry. Though it was pointed out that the delivery fellow was unlikely to use the water slides at 10 p.m. in the unusually freezing cold weather, the dedicated if not tunnel minded gate staff protected us all making the trip out to retrieve the food unavoidable. So much for the knowledge of front desk staff who said deliveries were no problem... Did dine at River Island, one of the resort restaurants, and it was superb. Food was better than average and staff were outstanding. The could not have been better in terms of accommodating and attending to every need. The waiting staff and manager of this restaurant should be put in charge of training all other resort staff, who were not nearly as attentive or accommodating. Resort internet service excellent and very fast. Had to reconnect to it manually though each time it was used. Checked out a day early, and found unexpected charges on our account, fairly substantial at that. Tried to discuss issues with manager, but he was too busy and walked away before we had a chance to speak with him, though he clearly saw we were expressing concerns to the desk clerk. In short, some pluses with the resort, but too many negatives to make it recommendable. Did receive a call from resort in response to Customer Survey we did online in response to an email invitation from them for same.

The issue we had with both rooms was that even though management said that there was no housekeeping performed with the short stay, they did come into our room and cleaned it on the last day we stayed. And lo and behold, things turned up missing. My daughter had left the money her grandparents had given her in her pocketbook in her bedroom. We were already on our way to the airport when she opened her wallet and found it gone. We had purchesed 2 packs of ciggarettes for the neighbor watching our dog. I couldn't be sure if we had left them in the room, but they didn't turn up. In our friends room they picked up the towels in the bathroom and w/o realizing also took a pair of elastic socks - the $75 type to prevent blood clots. Obviously that was unintenitonal but if they didn't come into the room, none of these things would be missing. I called the next morning and spoke with a women who took my name and number and said someone would get back to me. She also said to contact Lost and Found. I called them and left my name. Again no one returned my call. I called again a week or so later and asked for the manager. Instead the operator took all the information then said she would file a report with security and they would get back to me. Sure enough a letter came this week and said they checked lost and found and nothing turned up. I called back and asked if they really expected housekeeping to turn in the money they stole. I was told I waited too long to report it. So my daughter is out the money she received as a gift, our friends were out $75 not to mention the risk not wearing the socks - and the neighbor - well, he didn't need the cigarrettes anyway. I was told that even though they cleaned the room, I wouldn't be charged. Thanks so much. I've never had anything stolen from a hotel and I stayed at some that are not the qualtiy of Orange Lake and I've never had anything stolen - ever. Looking at some other reviews, it appears that I'm not the first to have this experience at Orange Lake. I normally use the safe if I leave something of any value in the room, but knowing that no one would be in the room, I had a false sense of security. Actually those I spoke to were rather surprised to hear that the rooms had been cleaned. So keep in mind that if you do stay at this resort, even though you're told there won't be any housekeeping, and its explained on their site as such, there's a good chance they will come into your room.

River island was good too, except the silly charge of 9dollars hire for tube (maybe charge 3 dollars and more people will be interested).

Again the staff at each village were very friendly and happy to help when they can.

Our two bedroom villa, North Village 3775, was one of the older units and needed updating. Having said that, it was very clean and everything was still in working order with no issues. Large rooms huge living room and screened off patios. Check in was really easy, we arrived at 1:00p.m our room was not ready so they give you the keys and your packet and then called at 4:00 p.m. with our room number, this is the best idea ever, all resorts should learn from this we just went right to our room. You can also use the pools while you are waiting and charge to your keys. They have lockers by every pool so you can change and enjoy the day. We really loved all three pools complexs, they are some of the best pools in the orlando area. The grounds throughout the property are amazing, you are truly at a resort. We had no issues with bugs, spiders, or any other critters. They have the best pizza and they even deliver, don't miss out. The food and drinks at all the bars in the pools are very reasonable around $5.00 per drink, and most meals are under $10.00 per item. The only negative I would say is the lack of barbeque areas compared to most timeshares, but with all the places to eat we could see why. I would also recommend taking your phone off the hook then they don't bother you. The resort is 2300 acres and feels even bigger, you need a car, the shuttle does not come often enough for a resort of this size. From our villa to the main road was 2 miles in either direction. You are within a 1/2 mile from any pool and can walk but most people drove. Most of the rooms are on a golf course which we really liked. Our villa was on a night golf course. Pools are all open till around 9:00p.m. which we liked.

The rooms were well kept and updated decor. We did not eat at any of the hotels restaurants because we didn't spend much time on the property. Great location- Disney is only a few minutes away, Universal is about a 20 minute drive. Ammenities were abundant- jet skiing, paddle boats, numerous pools including a lazy river, \"beach\", arcade and much more. Although there were a few things that we didn't like about our stay this hotel is great- we will definately return if we go back to the Orlando area. Below you'll find what we didn't like about our stay. The beds were a bit too firm for my husband and me, the pillows were very large and uncomfortable and the walls are paper thin. We could hear every door close and conversations as people walked by in the hall. We were usually awakened daily by the sound of knocking and the maids shouting \"housekeeping\" as they attempted to enter nearby rooms. Our refridgerator smelled like something had died in it and it was inoperable- not a big deal for us as we didn't need to use it. Lily, the concierge, was pleasant, upbeat and animated. She told us we could participate in an \"orientation\" that would take us on a tour of the resort and would show us all of the ammenities and it would only take 1.5 hours of our time. Yeah, 1.5 hours turned into 4 hours and we had to sit and listen to a timeshare presentation- this was very upsetting. Cesar, our \"tour guide\" was very nice and entertaining but the whole \"orientation\" experience was a neverending nightmare. Not only did this \"orientation\" take up half of our day but we were bombarded by a series of timeshare salesman who just wouldn't take no for an answer. My husband and I had explained our reasons for not wanting to purchase but when one salesman left another came to try to pursuade us. If we had known that this \"orientation\" was strictly about timeshare and was going to eat up almost an entire day we definately would not have wasted our time- or theirs. ADVICE: Don't attend the orientation unless you're thinking about purchasing timeshare- it's a complete waste of time and the incentive isn't worth it.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quinte", "Title": "\u201cNearly perfect.

Each year we return we always have a wonderful time and hate to leave. This year we had 2 two-bedroom units side by side and decided to extend two more days and shared a three bedroom unit. Although they do make mistakes, they try to correct them. In the past I considered purchasing a timeshare for myself. However one evening I received a call in my room from \"Mark\" inviting us to a free breakfast. I was surprised and specifically asked \"Is this a timeshare tour\" to which he responded \"no, it's a free breakfast\". We arrived to find it was a timeshare tour and the breakfast consisted of doughnuts and coffee. I was so disappointed that I was lied to and the sales person was so pushy, I cannot be part of that. My sister however who is an owner has had a different experience than I had, hence her becoming an owner. I do find the beds uncomfortable, however I know they cannot please everyone. Upon check-in we were missing a clock in one bedroom, I called and they brought one right away. However the next day at breakfast the toaster did not work. I called twice, no toaster was ever sent so we finally just ate something else. They also mixed up our 2-day reservation and we were not put in River Island as we were supposed to be however they very kindly made up for this by providing us with a free Cabana rental, very good of them to do that as really all the new units are equally nice. I rave about the pools, the restaurants, the landscaping is beautiful. The staff is friendy, the rooms are clean and tidy, it's almost perfect. However the one beef I cannot get past is the tubes in the lazy river. You MUST rent these tubes, it's ridiculous. The river is not deep enough in most places to swim so you need the tube to keep the skin on your feet. You cannot take your own and if you are caught using one you didn't pay for they make you feel like a criminal. I witnessed people enter the lazy river this year not knowing about the tube rentals. They were happily floating through this beautiful river, relaxed, this is the life... Then suddenly they are harshly told to surrender the tube from a person hiding in the bushes because they don't have an arm band..? After much confusion and this poor employee having to explain this to a family with children why he's ruining their fun he took their tubes and the people were left standing there shocked. Of all the things to charge for, what's with the tubes??? They absolutely completely spoil the River Island experience with the way they treat us over inexpensive rubber tubes that are too large to comfortably use. Of all the things to be cheap over, I cannot understand it. By the time they employ people to sell the tubes and more to ensure you don't enjoy them, how do they make money off them? I don't understand the reasoning. Aside from this, Orange Lake is almost paradise. Every resort I go to I use Orange Lake Kissimmee as the standard of excellence.

We arrived on Sunday, Nov. 7th to check in. The woman, I think her name was Natalie?, was very nice. She asked if we needed any park tickets or had any questions. We said no, she asked if we would like to attend an hour long session telling us more about the resort, we said no. We were not bothered again. We stayed in West Village in one of the villas and it had been completely renovated. It was gorgeous! Two very large bedrooms, one with 2 queen sized beds and one with a king sized bed. Both had their very own bathrooms and the master bathroom had a jacuzy tub. (Very nice after a long day in the parks!) It had granite counter tops in the kitchen and bathrooms. Beautiful flooring, washer and dryer, televisions in both the bedrooms and living room. The living room also had a pull out sofa. This could have easily accomodated 8 people, but there were only 4 of us, the hubby, myself and my 2 daughters. We stayed at this resort for 7 nights. We did not get a chance to see or even try out any of the pools or other things that this resort offered. Believe it or not, it only got above 80 degrees one day while we were there and although I know at least one of the pool areas was heated, we just honestly didn't have time because we had 7 day park hopper tickets.We did order pizza from one of the restaurants on the property one evening while we watched a Disney movie after a long day at the park. It was very tasty and priced the same as any pizza place, and they delivered:) I would most definitely stay here again. Here are the minor drawbacks to this \"hotel\": if you like having your room cleaned daily or every other day, then this isn't the place for you, but if you want to feel like you are staying in your home away from home, then I would suggest it. The other thing I found not so good, was that the towels aren't soft at all, it was like drying with sandpaper. And the water pressure is so hard, it almost hurt. But that's just me being picky maybe. Oh and one last thing, the housekeepers were still at our villa when we arrived. This was not such a big deal except that I think they felt rushed and left a wet towel from the previous renters hanging in our master bathroom! YUCK! Almost forgot, we received a note on our door one night stating they had been trying to get a hold of us. (I had unplugged the phones because of previous reviews about getting very early phone calls about taking the sales tour.) I called the number they left the next morning and a woman stated she wanted to send someone to our villa to do a quality assurance survey. I asked if it could be done over the phone, she said no. I told her that we were all still in our pj's and she insisted someone come in 30 min. I told her no, she put me on hold and then came back and told me fine, that she would try to catch us next time. She wasn't very nice about it and she thought we were the owners of the villa. Again, these are all minor things and we would still stay at this resort again. It was perfect for getting to and from the Disney parks. We purchased groceries at the Target across the street.

All of the pictures, videos, etc that I saw beforehand looked amazing, and we were very excited. We were able to check in an hour early, but the actual check in process took about 45 minutes because they really take the time to hard sell you on a timeshare presentation. We gave in just so we could check into our villa. Our first villa was in the West Village. It was 2 bedrooms, 2 bathroom and very spacious. We definitely enjoyed all the room that the villa had and the upgraded televisions and such. The pools were nice, probably better for kids than for couples but we enjoyed the lazy river a few times and mini-golf once. The second day, we returned back to our room to find a roach crawling in the kitchen sink.. we figured \"okay, it's probably just a one time thing.\" .. I wish that were the case! When we came back the next night from theme parks, a roach ran OUT the front door when we opened it. We called maintenance, and they came to our room and sprayed bug spray. The next morning, there was a dead baby lizard in the kitchen, assuming it got into the bug spray. I was ready to move rooms at that point, but my husband convinced me to stay..... that is, until he got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and stepped on a roach in the bedroom. To the resort staff's credit, they did move us to another room right away, and we were moved to the 5th floor of a tennis villa's building. The room felt stale, but the amenities were very nice (huge master bath had a real jacuzzi tub and a screened in patio with a great view of the golf course and a lake) I had hoped that since we were no longer ground level, our insect problem would be over... false. There were tiny bugs on the counter in the kitchen and again.. the second day we discovered a roach in the kitchen and one in the bedroom. We wound up checking out a day early, which the staff didn't seem too surprised about, and paid $130 to stay someplace else for the last night we were supposed to stay there. Not exactly a romantic first week for our honeymoon. I wouldn't stay here again even if it was another timeshare gift. Oh and the timeshare presentation? The free gifts aren't worth it - every time we said no, thank you - they sent another person to our table to get us our \"gifts\" which was really just another person trying to sell us at another angle. Finally, after explaining another time how we 1. don't even own a home 2. just had an expensive wedding (to which the guy asked how much we spent on our wedding - as if it was his business) - my husband laid his foot down that we were finished with this presentation and would be leaving.

We arrived at the resort (no problems with check-in, by the way) and were amazed at how huge the property is. We were surprised even further when we opened the door to a very spacious and tastefully-decorated condo in the East Village. Another reviewer commented about a small living room, but our condo had a very spacious great room and a bright and airy kitchen. The master bedroom had a king bed and the master bath, with a shower and oversized tub, was probably bigger than some of the bedrooms in my home. The condo could easily sleep 8 people, with two full size beds in the guest room and a sleeper in the sectional. It also has a full size washer & dryer. We ate at the River Island Grill at least three times and they were all positive. My husband wasn't crazy about their nachos, but I thought they were pretty good. If you're taking kids, be sure to take them to River Island, which has a lazy river pool, pool slides, playground, game room, miniature golf, an inflatable giant water slide, as well as lots of lounge chairs and 2-3 cocktail bars for the parents. They do have poolside service, but the waiters can be hard to find at times. My only complaint is that our 2-hour tour actually took about 5 hours. However, I'm sure that's because we ended up buying a unit here.

There was nine of us traveling together for this disney vacation! We rented two, two bedroom suites (just the way the families decided to do it, so we each had our own getaway)! **Check-In/Tour** Our check in went super smooth, AL was great! We expressed that we were hoping for something near one another, he came back with side by side rooms! GREAT customer service! He told us all about the tour, which three of us adults decided to take! They offered some great incentives to take the tour, it did last a little longer than 90 minutes but I expected that so I wasnt suprised! We toured with a gentlemen named Peter, he was polite...until we said NO a few 100 times! After reading reviews about the tour we were prepared to tell several people NO, the reviews were accurate! When we told Peter we werent interested, he went and got someone else, he wanted to show us so more numbers and we had to tell him no, once again he went to get another gentlemen, he also came up with some lower numbers, we again had to tell him no and when he left he sent over a women in which she tried to change our minds one last time before bringing us to the gifting/ticket window! Were we frustrated, not at all because we expected that per previous reviews! Positive feedback regarding the tour: the property is beautiful and they give a great overview! Negetive feedback regarding the tour: you leave your car in a different area than you tour, and they dont bring you back to your car, there is a shuttle however the sign above the shuttle said 19 minutes! It was faster to walk to the car just a distance away, would be a great service for them to return you to car after, I mean they head that way to get another group it would just be an added courtsey! **Room/Grounds** The two bedroom suites had plenty of space, more than enough! The master bathroom was awesome, loved the large tub! We stayed in the east, we were able to see the disney fireworks everynight from our living room and balcony!! It also over looks a golf course, so if your a golfer than it would be perfect! Yes we had a messages on our phone everyday, but it was about specials and things happening around the resort! No bigge! The resort is huge, you will drive to the pools/dining and other amenties, however there is a shuttle if you perfer! They have two entrances and will suggest which one you enter! There is a grocery store and stuff at the entrance, very helpful! There is also a target across the street if you perfer that! Important things to remember, this is a timeshare resort! There is no housekeeping, you make your own beds, take out your own trash and wash your own towels and dishes! They do supply a few boxes of laundry soap, and a few things of dishwasher detergent as well as an extra roll of paper towels and a few extra toilet papers rolls!. We did not get any extra garbage bags or anything in our room, however my mom did next door. They also left conditioner in the bathroom but no shampoo, it didnt matter to me because we didnt intent to use it anyway but it was just strange! Positives about the room: East buildings are quiet, they have the trash drop right next to the elevator (very easy drop off), they have beach towels at every pool, and again the rooms are spacious Negetives about the room: Cooking for nine in one room was a little difficult pan/plate wise, we had ONE frying pan and two sauce pans so when cooking for a large group it could get tricky! We also did have to call maintance twice....once for the tub (the jets wouldnt work) he came right over, switched a switch in the circut box and it came on, the second time we called after trying to use the garbage disposal, something metal was stuck in there, again he came right over and fixed it! Final thing, dont plan to sleep on the pull out couch, it was uncomfortable our guest didnt use it after the first night! (However most pull outs are uncomfortable, so this shouldnt be a suprise) **Pools** We went to the pools in the North area, and the new river island sections! Manly because we had small children with us (age 2 and 6)!! The 6yr old loved playing water basketball and they both enjoyed the waterslides! The lazy river was a nice added bonus for everyone! Keep in mind again that this is a timeshare resort and you will have to pay extra for the mini golf/bowling/watersports/ and other amenties (the hippo and tubes)! This could be shocking if you arent prepared! We had an awesome time, and WILL stay at this resort again in the future!

We stayed on the ground floor in a 2 bedroom unit. It was very well decorated, well stocked and didn't show many signs of wear. The tvs and showers worked great. We also had a screened porch with a view of the golf course, which was nice. The spaciousness of the unit was a plus. Beds were comfy, linens were ample. Full size washer and dryer worked great. Parking was ample and it was great to park right outside the unit. Saving steps is important when you spend your days at the theme parks! Free wi-fi was nice and worked great. Basically, it felt like a comfortable, roomy, well appointed place to come home to. We visited the River Island pool complex. I've heard people describe it as a mini-water park. Well, not quite. It's definitely more than just a pool, but it's not quite a water park. There are several large pool areas, two large water slides and a very large, meandering lazy river, which we loved. I would say it's comparable to Stormalong Bay at Disney's Beach Club, but without the pirate ship theming. We rented a cabana one day -- nice experience. We ate at one of the restaurants by the pool at River Island and the food was fine. We had no problem with the \"cashless resort\" business. Just not a big deal. The shops around the resort were NICE. I found TONS of stuff I wanted to buy. There are lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. I could live in the SuperTarget across the street. There's also a Publix and a Walgreens nearby. Olive Garden and Giordano's are very close. Driving to WDW couldn't have been quicker or easier. I had done my research, so I wasn't surprised about the size of the resort (huMONGous!), the manager calls (minor irritation, but they really should back off on those), or the cashless business. I think some of the negative reviews are because people are expecting one thing and get another. Overall, OL exceeded my expectations and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. In fact, we're planning to go back next year. Now to the cons: (1) Bugs - This came as no surprise to me since there was a crack at the bottom of our front door where you could see light coming in. Of course, bugs are going to come in. We bought a can of Raid the first day just in case. Well, we needed it. Next time, I will request that we're not on a ground floor unit. We saw maybe 3 full size roaches and lots of baby ones. Uggh. These are exterior corridor units, not enclosed like a normal hotel. Bugs are going to happen, I guess. Buy a can of Raid at the deLIGHTful Super Target across the street (loved that place). (2) Smell - Several nights, it smelled FOUL outside the unit. Never inside the unit, but if you walked out to your car -- blech. I chalk that up to the fact that OL backs up to Disney's Animal Kingdom. Don't know if that's the reason or not. It didn't happen every night, and like I said, you couldn't smell it once you were inside, and there was no reason to hang around outside unless you were going to your car.

Some of the negative reviews here had us a bit worried. So first to clear up many of those (at least from our experience). We were in a 2 bedroom West Village - room was clean (although a small lizard ran in one day - but it is FLA), Room in good repair - did not have flat screens but was well stocked. Checking-In - another common complaint but we found check-in fairly easy - the woman told us about the timeshare presentation and we said we were not interested - that was it. Phone Calls - there were daily mesdsages left on our phone but they had more to do with what was going on at the resort that day - not a problem at all. Towels and Housekeeping - a very common complaint on here. As many have stated this is a timeshare resort - it is like being in an apartment for a week - if you do research going in then you should be preared for it. Resort is huge - yes it is depending on where your unit is you are going to have to drive to pools and other activities - no getting atound that. Our Experience - We found the resort to be great, We went to Disney Parks 2 days and they were easy driving distance from the resort. The various pools were great we went to 3 different pool areas while we were there and enjoyed them all. Restaurants - we had meals there a couple of times and found the food to be ok and fairly priced. There are grocery stores near the resort so you can load up with all the stuff you want and use your ful kitchen back at the resort. One complaint - wish they had people serving poolside so you didn't have to get up when you wanted something and walk to the pool bar. Real Treat- If you want to give yourself a treat get a Cabana on a hot day.

We insisted that we paid for a Villa to which she said \"we call everything on this property a Villa, even the Studio Apartment\". I requested to see if there was an actual Villa available, she said she would call some office to see, we ended waiting over an hour for the office to reply that they don't think there is anything available. at this stage I was very upset, the kids were cranky etc. I requested to talk to a manger, and was told they won't be able to help me any more than the Check-In rep. I kept on insisting and said I would call AMEX to Complain, as this unacceptable. soon thereafter, the manager became available to talk to us, and within 2 minutes (literally, 60 seconds) he had us in a \"Golf Villa\"...

We noticed it was about 3:15 and decided that we would walk around the complex for a while. At 4:15, we went to our unit and the maid was still at the unit next door, talking on the cell phone. My husband called the front office and complained and a supervisor came over. We were told that our unit would not be ready for another half hour, so it was 4:45 until we were able to get into our unit. A few days later, the only toilet in the unit got clogged. We called maintainance about the problem. My husband found a plunger in the bathroom vanity cabinet and tried to unclog the toilet but was unsucessful. About 15 minutes later, someone came with a plunger to try to unclog the toilet. He was also unsuccessful and said he would have to contact someone with a plumber's snake to try to unclog the toilet. We told him that we had tickets to a show and would have to be leaviing the unit within 30 minutes. He could not guarantee that someone would be there before then but stated that the person has a pass key and could get into the unti if we were not there. Since no one showed up in time, we secured our belongings and left. We returned about 10:30 that night and no one had come to unclog the toilet. We called maintainance and got an answering service who had no idea of the problem and could not tell us when someone might be there. Since this was the sole toilet in the unit, it needed to be fixed that night. Around 11:15, a young man came with a plumber's snake and unclogged the toilet. As he was leaving, he said he would have to call housekeeping to clean up the bathroom. After he left, we went in to the bathroom to find clumps of feces on the floor, toilet and tub. The bathroom was in worst shape than any public toilet could possibly be. We called housekeeeping since we did not trust that the young man had done so and sure enough, they had not recieved any call. Again, it was an answering service who had no idea when someone would arrive. Around midnight, a man came to clean up the mess.

When I booked my trip for October this year, I was told that I would be able to stay overlooking River Island. We went to our room and it was on the other side facing the street. I called to try to get another room and was told that all of the rooms were booked. We never saw people coming from the rooms, so we are not sure that the rooms were actually booked.

I'll give a basic review of the resort followed by the bad experience this year. Orange Lake is in close proximity to Disney, Universal, and Sea World. A Publix grocery store and Super Target are within a mile of the resort. There are numerous restaurants onsite and offsite to satisfy eating requirements. And plenty of outlet malls within a 10-15 mile radius. The property we own is a 2 BR suite in Bldg 86300 in the East Village. As of October 2010 some of the buildings in the East Village are getting exterior improvements--painting, resurfacing, etc. Our suite is in good condition, but without improvements soon it could drop to fair. The refrigerator made a loud humming noise, the bed and window coverings are faded, the spa tub isn't clean (gray matter comes out of the jets), vacuum cleaner did not work, and dishwasher did not clean in a single cycle. A fresh coat of paint and carpeting are also needed in the next year. The washer/dryer, stove, microwave, DVD player, and TVs all work well. As a sidenote, the TVs are not flat screen/HD models. Wi-fi signal strength is good throughout the unit and does not drop connection. Overall, the unit is good, especially considering we don't spend all of out time there. But we can see how it has \"aged\" over the years and the property we own at another resort has done a better job replacing electronics, furnishings, and decor. After 4 years River Island is still a nice little water park (within walking distance from the East Village). There are plenty of chairs to lounge in, a spot of sand to play in, and 3 pool areas connected by a \"lazy river\". There are water slides, cabanas, bar, arcade, shower/restroom, gift shop, and restaurant all in River Island. If you have kids they should enjoy a day or two of water and games. The resort has security that drives around and has a strong presence around the resort. There are also shuttles to transport one between the different villages. Tennis courts, miniature golf, and small fitness room are also available. One of Orange Lake's best features is it's golf, but I'm not a golfer so I can't review that. BAD EXPERIENCE We purchased shoes at one of the outlet malls, but left them in the unit at checkout. After 3 hours on the road we realized the shoes were left so we called the resort. Security checked the room, but the shoes were gone and Housekeeping didn't turn anything in to Lost and Found. The resort took our contact information, but never contacted us. After a week of calling we finally contacted Holiday Inn Club Corporate, they in turn contacted Orange Lake and then got back with us. The shoes were never turned in and Orange Lake is not liable for lost or left items. We understand they are not liable, but we were dissatisfied with how this was handled by Housekeeping or whoever entered the room after we left and Resort Staff. I didn't expect Management to contact us back because they have more important things to deal with, but Guest Relations could have contacted us at some point. Whoever took the shoes should have known better considering this is an owner resort and I return there year after year. Lessons learned: 1) Never leave belongings behind. 2) Lock your valuables when you leave your unit or take them with you. 3) In the future use Holiday Inn Club Points to stay at a different resort.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cSecond stay here...should say something\u201d", "Author": "majk_p", "ReviewID": "UR84156587", "Content": "We stayed here in March of last year and loved it, so we tried it again in October of 2010 and guess what?

My first two trips were great, but now I understand the negative reviews, and how a few experiences can ruin a trip. I won't get into the size of the resort or anything else, because it is huge and beautiful. You get that from other reviews. Here were our problems: 1. The first day we were there, our daughter wanted an inner tube. We bought her one from the local stores, and went to the lazy river. Immediately we were told we could not use our own tube on the lazy river. So.. We went and grabbed a blue one, then a young kid working for orange lake grabbed it out of my daughters hand and told her if she wanted a tube, there was a $9/day rental charge per person. Now.. Why would I rent a $1 tube, for $9 a day? Would you rent a $20,000 car for $180,000 pet day (9 times the cost to just buy it)? So.. Instead of enjoying the lazy river, we walked it, then said heck with it. 2. On the 3rd day there, we went through a tour with a serious intention on buying. My sister bought into their latitudes vacation program 2 years prior, and we all liked the resort. For 2 years I've researched prices, so I knew what the going rate was. Online, you buy a week anywhere from $1,000 up to $5,000 depending on when you want your week, and what village you choose. In fact, my brother purchased a week in Febuary for $1,000 online. We get through the tour and onto the numbers. First pencil $33,000 for 133,000 points. Ok.. That's crazy. So I mention online prices, etc so they offer a \"pre-owned\" timeshare (arnt all rooms used anyway) for $10,500 but it's every other year. Ok.. Better, but not what I want. This is where it got interesting. The \"manager\" told me there would be a $7,000 charge to convert a used timeshare online to the points system. So as the sales guy walks away, I call my brother. He said the charge is only $795. So now I'm irritated.. Realizing they have no problem being untruthful. And I get it.. A used car salesman wants you to buy a car from his lot, not from someones front yard. I do get it. So.. After another manager comes.. I tell him to work on the price, and to let him know I've done my research.. I mention trip advisor, the good, average, and many negative reviews. The guy says \"You can never trust online reviews, especially trip advisor\". I found that interesting seeing that obviously Orange Lake responds to both good znd bad reviews on this site. So now I'm untrusting .. And I decide I'm not going to buy at this time.. So a 4th guy comes out and offers me the latitudes program. Nice.. My sister did it.. But I've been there going on 4 hours.. Not deciding anything now. So.. At the same time, my sister was doing a tour (a requirement for doing the latitudes program). We all get back to the room, all slightly annoyed and my sister tells me, they considered buying but they wanted the latitudes one more time before spending $5,000 or more. They told my sister \"Oh.. We font offer that anymore.. In fact.. You were one of the last customers on that program from a few years ago\". I laughed and showed her the brochure they let me take, and the price they offered for the latitudes program. Another lie, caught red handed. So.. On to the 4th day. We decided to extend our stay 3 days. My sister called the front desk since the reservation was in her name. 3 hours later, 20 telephone transfers.. And we extended our stay. The problem.. Every person tells you something different. Yes, you can stay in that room.. No.. You have to move.. They are overbooked.. Etc etc etc. Thank god for Jodi at the front desk. She was the only person to truly give us accurate answers. So lastly.. On our last night.. We decide to eat at river island grilling company. Easy, walking distance, etc. We sit down.. Look at the prices.. $24.95 for a new your strip! Seriously? Im not cheap but you've got to be kidding. After talking a few minutes.. 7 of us get up and decide to go yo outback. Our total bill at outback was $30 for 3 of us. It would have been at least twice that if we had stayed. So in the end.. Nice trip, but a true realization that you can't believe a word they say. They nickel and dime you for everything here. It's beyond insane! Another example.. Their \"onsite\" arcade is points based. Donkey Kong, $1 per game. It costs a nickel at Nickel World. Who pays $1 to play donkey Kong? Anyway.. Good luck. If orange lake reads this.. We were your guests in 81229a from oct 10 - 13th, and then you moved us to 82225 October 14th - 16th. I was a guest of my sister, and now.. I'm not so sure if I want to be an \"owner\" after the lies. What happens after you own and you have my $$? I used to recommend Orange Lake.. But now I'm not so sure.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201coverall=pleased,only small issues\u201d", "Author": "magami", "ReviewID": "UR84024960", "Content": "my family had a blast on our disney vacation, and when we werent at disney we spent most of our time on the resort. river island was awesome,,POOLS WERE WAY TOO COLD! like an icebath,,until the last day of our stay, they decided to heat them up a little, which woud have been nicer at the beginning of our stay.

I didn't know what to expect should we decide to stay at the resort - but I took a chance because my daughter wanted to go to Florida. Our timeshare is deeded for Orlando so we took advantage and decided to come down. Upon arrival - we were greeted in the lobby and upon finding out we were owners, we were motioned to another line. We arrived late around 10pm that evening - they were still nicely staffed for the amount of guests in the lobby. Our checkin agent was VERY PERSONABLE and very attentive - he didn't rush us as I had many many questions from being perplexed by the whole ordeal. I didn't know what we were going to receive regarding the sleeping accommodations - and upon our arrival - WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED our 2 Bedroom Villa in the West Village - it was gorgeous - spacious - and our home away from home. It was me, my husband, and 10 year old daughter and it was plenty of space for us. The only issue I had was the front door light bulb had blown - which was quickly replaced once I made the service call. My daughter is avid swimmer and there were PLENTY OF POOLS AND LAZY RIVERS to go around. Instead of going to the parks - we could've stayed at the resort the entire length of our stay and been content. But because we were there - we took our daughter to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventures (she's a thrill ride seeker) - but once we rode all the rides - she immediately wanted to go back to the resort. Granted - we were bombarded with calls to attend presentations, which we did because we have been very pleased thus far. And yes, we did upgrade to the Priority Club status - as yearly vacations with our daughter is very important. We had a great time - starting from the checkin all the way down to checkout. If it didn't rain daily between 1pm and 3pm - we would've had an even better time! I would definitely recommend this resort.

This concerned me a little as most sites rate it as a 3.5 star, but we were going to be busy most of the trip and I got it at a very good rate so beggers cant be choosers. Here is my breakdown of this enoromous Resort. Pros, 1) Amenities - There is everything you could want to do at this resort. They have golf courses (I didnt see a single person on the course our entire 4 day stay), a waterpark, a lake with various watersport activities, and the list goes on and on. 2) Rooms - There are many types of rooms at this property, it is sort of a hybrid between a hotel and a condo complex. We stayed in what I would call the hotel part of the complex and the studio rooms were an excellent size, with fridge, convection oven, dishwasher, flat screen tv and comfortable beds. 3) Security - Everytime you go into the complex they check your parking pass and so forth so it felt very safe. 4) Location - I wasnt sure which side to put this on, for us this trip we went to the Disney Waterparks on two days, and Magic Kingdom one day, and we flew into Tampa, so the location for us was excellent. However if you are doing Universal and things of that nature as we usually do, or flying into MCO I might consider a different location. Cons 1) No housekeeping - This was never mentioned to me either through Hotwire or when we checked in with Steve at the front desk. I probably would have been more upset, but since the room didnt have a safe this worked out not too bad. 2) Sales Pitch - I read the reviews about this and so I came in aware, the only time it was uncomfortable was at check in when I had to say no 5 times when Steve tried to get my wife and I to go to a presentation. ( I know he was only doing his job so not really that big a deal) I also did as many previous posters suggested and unplugged the phone. 3) Resort Fee - I cant stand that so many hotels have gone this route, it is especially annoying when you book through Hotwire or Priceline as you generally dont know what you are getting into @7 plus tax, the only benefit from it I could see was the wireless internet which wasnt the most reliable. I also didnt like that it was a cashless resort, being from Canada I dont like to use my CC when travelling as the CC companies hit you with the lovely foreign exchange fees. Having said all that I would still probably stay here again, however if I did I would make sure we had nothing else planned. This is the type of place that you could spend 3 or 4 days at and not be bored at all, without leaving the resort. A couple of tips in the area, there is a super target just down the steet as well as a publix for all your goodies.

I travelled with my wife, daughter and niece, and stayed from 30th August till 27th September in room 5412 (ground floor) in the Tennis Village. My daughter in particular had done her homework, and we'd requested the East Village (newest) based on general opinions, but were allocated the West Village on arrival at the desk (super quick and efficient booking in process). We queried this allocation and were informed that this was a lot quieter than other areas - must have known us. I definately got the impression we could have been re located if requested so was happy to give it a go. The accommodation was on the ground floor in a 5 storey block, and comprised 2 bedrooms - 1 master with large ensuite - jacuzzi bath and separate shower, and the other with 2 double beds and separate toilet/shower. There was a large well stocked kitchen with lounge/dining facilities and an outside room with meshed screening for sitting out overlooking a large pond - very nice outlook. The unit was one of the non refurbished ones, but was entirely adequate for our purposes, being clean and tidy. We were very close to the main reception area and pools, and having explored all the other areas of the resort came to the conclusion that the booking in clerk had judged our needs spot on. We had the expected call asking us to a timeshare presentation, but we fobbed them off by saying that we were busy for 2 weeks (niece was only staying 2 weeks), and for them to call back then. This they did, but by this time we had heard that the sell was quite intense, plus we had inadvertantly left our parking pass on the car whilst at the nearby Publix store, and had a flier put on the windscreen offering resales for $2900, so couldn't see the point of spending the $15k they were asking for (not that we had any intention). In fact, talk at the pool was about how the regulars felt that the entertainment etc had taken a downturn over the years. We relayed this information to the caller, and we were never disturbed again. Every day there was a message left on the phone informing of events of the day which was useful. During our stay we had 3 visits from housekeeping, so were adequately provided for with the essentials. The resort itself is beautifully maintained, and staff were always courtious and friendly. Pool areas were particularly pleasant with our preferred area being the one closest to us. We didn't eat on site, but noted that there were a variety of eateries, each themed to different tastes. It is a 'cashless' resort, with all purchases being billed to your credit card via the room key - this was settled at check out (again super quick), and could have been paid by cash if requested.

We had them in and they do not just clean, as we had a further unscheduled visit 24 hours later when we were out. They left our window catch off and open for someone to access our bedroom and clean us out of our mobile phones and electronic apple products.

I have called from England over 5 times and sent numerous emails to senior management of the resort. I finally received one insulting email of $150 offer as a gesture of goodwill which has not been received. Which is an insult considering my items stolen were worth over $1500, it happened on their site, with their security and more than likely their staff. Whilst the above was my worst experience of the resort, I did also notice the following \u2013 The size of the resort is huge, you will need a car to go everywhere. The Water-park does not exist, I spent 30 mins trying to find it on site, its just a pool and a lazy river and a baby slide (must be over 48 inches tall to use, not 46, 48 inches to use it). The slow river is managed by the gestipo, I saw one person surrounded by 5 security people because he refused to pay for a ring at 7.30pm and just wanted one ride around the slow river on a ring he found by the side. The restaurants & bars are over priced for the area and do not come with the Florida hospitality you normally hope and expect. If you like dead toads and geekos then you will love this resort because there are loads of them. After staying 12 days there I also noticed that I had received over 25 messages on my room answer phone on top of the ones I had said no to on the phone trying to get me to go to the time share seminar, even though I made it very obvious to management and check in that their behaviour was on the verge of harassment.

We had a note taped to are door that told us they where paint are building. For the rest of are stay we had to deal with paint smell, not being able to see out the windows, wet paint every where. The painters all had masks on, but when the guests had to leave we had to hold are breath and walk through the paint mist. One morning my 4 year old ran to the elevators, when I turned the corner he was sanding behind a painter ( with a mask on) and I could see the cloud on paint mist around him ,I yelled at him to come to me and we would take the 5 flights of stairs down.

Now granted we stayed slightly out of peak season but we were there over Labor Day and the pools were dead. Plenty of sunbeds and no problems. We had no problems at River Island using the lazy river without a wristband as we just picked up abandoned inflatables. The only problem we had was with the pool staff sticking to their guns about height restrictions on the water slide which meant my son could go on but not my daughter. This is kind of problem I dont mind having! The complex is huge - probably bigger than the village I live in in the UK. We had a car so this wasnt a problem (how you would survive without one in Orlando outside of Int'l Drive/Disney is beyond me). We never ate at the resort as we had a car and there are plenty of nearby supermarkets (Target and Publix) and restaurants on the 192, including Kissimmee itself. International Drive is probably 20 minutes drive away with even more choice. That said the prices were in line with Disney parks. Yes the onsite shops are expensive but then you are paying for the convenience. Use the supermarkets. Disney parks are within 10 minutes and Universal about 25 min drive.

We read the reviews before going and was a little concerned, but also realized you can't please everyone no matter how hard you try. We arrived on a Sat and stayed in the West Village from all the readings everyone stated these and River Island had the most up to date rooms (yes, its true!) 1st night we stayed in villa 3050. It was very nice a tad dated, but clean and very spacious. The next day we were moved into villa 2318 as a part of my timeshare stay courtesy of my mom. Now this villa was beautifully decorated all updated electronics i.e. flat screen TV, Spa tub, granite countertops with a nice soothing colored decor. There were 6 of us in my group and this worked out great everyone had enough room and the kids had a place to run around and play. We were facing the golf course (which hardly had anyone on it EVER) it just looked like a huge backyard for them to run and play. All the attractions were close enough if you have a car. Now to say yes this place is HUGE!! However the West Village and River Island have all the entertainment and the West Village seems to literally have everything you seriously don't need to go anywhere just enjoy the pool, movies, music and food and that's your vacation really no need to spend all that $$$$$ on Disney if you've been a lot (like me) and let me say their pizza is DELICIOUS I would have never thought their pizza was that good. I'm originally from NY and very picky about my pizza. Now about those pesky people trying to get you to go on tour. We politely declined and was never bothered again. And for those $9 tube rentals at River Island uh please there were soooo many ones laying around just grab one and float your heart away no one will bother you wristband or not TRUST ME! Needless to say we LOVED it here so much that we bought a villa. Not from Holiday Inn but from a wonderful guy we met while vacationing there and trust me you can NOT beat the price and location of the villa WEST VILLAGE. With all this said know these things: this is a CASHLESS RESORT (use your debit/ATM CARD NO PROBLEM) they will try to get you to go on tour DECLINE, DO NOT BUY ANY TUBES and the giant slide looks fun but trust me you won't die if you don't slide on it no big deal!!! Sit back in your villa and RELAX. We saw NO BUGS, FROGS, ROACHES VERY CLEAN VILLA. No room service WASH YOUR OWN STUFF, and lastly Target is much cheaper that PUBLIX!!

We had a large group of 5 families, friends in common, who decided to visit Orlando for a week and see among other things, the new Harry Potter Castle at Universal. My family and another family decided to share a villa for 8 people in this apparently beautiful resort, at least in our dreams. We have been mislead by the Holiday Inn Website, which shows villas and rooms that, apparently, do not exist at the Orange Lake resort. We paid in advance for a \u201cluxurious resort-style villa\u201d, as described in their Website, to obtain a discount. After reading a few bad reviews at TripAdvisor, I called the Holiday Inn Reservations and also the resort directly to make sure we would be staying in one of the renovated villas and not have any bad surprises in our arrival. We were driving from Atlanta to Orlando, and planned to have a late check-in. We arrived at the hotel around 10 p.m. after driving for more than 6 hours straight and the reception was excellent on arrival but their effort to sell us one of the timesharing options was quite annoying even after we firmly said no to timeshare. It might have been the reason why they assigned us the most disgusting villa in the complex. We went to the villa which was in the West Village, which was a huge disappointment. It could only be described as a foul smelling dirty apartment. Most of the appliances were old and broken, clothes from previous guests were still piled up on the sitting room, the windows looked as though they hadn\u2019t been cleaned for years which made the place darker, and the bathroom was filthy. The furniture felt like it was worn out and at least 20 years old. It was certainly not what we had paid for and dreamed for. I went right back to reception and they directed me to talk to someone at Guest Services. Many people were already there complaining to similar issues with their villas. After talking to a lady and being informed that they did not have the villas shown on their Website or anything else that could please us, they decided to refund our money, which was the least I was expecting. By the time I got all resolved, it was already almost 11 p.m. My friend and his family had not yet arrived at the hotel. We were expecting them to arrive later than us that night. My family and I, tired and hungry, had to wait outside of the lobby for more than an hour for our friends. I was totally embarrassed to convey to them the very bad news. I was the one who negotiate and book this hotel.

The first sales guy we talked to was very nice, and told us upfront that if at the end of his presentation we said that we do not want to buy a timeshare, he will have to ask his manager to speak with us and someone after him and so on. He showed us around River Island, which was very nice, and told us about his own experience with his timeshare. At the end of his presentation we said no, we would not like to buy a timeshare. And, as promised, his manager came to try to convince us. We had to say no to him a few times and then someone else came to speak with us, but only briefly. The last person we spoke to filled out some paperwork giving us the deal we were promised (3 nights at the hotel for $299 instead of the actual price of $900) as well as $200 worth of mail in rebates to Holiday Inn hotels.

The pools at the registration desk have very liberal policies and I saw several people swimming with open sores on their skin. No shower is called for before entering the pools. I felt like I was swimming in a putrid soup, so I avoided the pools after the 1st day.

Well guess what? Being armed with this knowledge we had no problems at this resort. I had phoned in advance and requested either a river island unit or a renovated West village unit. Surprise!! They assigned us to the feared East Village. I asked the front desk clerk why our requests weren't honored and she told me that there were no river island units available and there was nothing she could do. Her mistake was not pretending to actually look for a better unit for us, so I went for it and insisted that they honor the reservation. I had read that people don't get timely replies from customer service so we wanted to get the right room the first time around. I also mentioned the tendancy for negative trip advisor reviews of East Village units. A half an hour later and a discussion with the manager (who I didn't think was going to help us) and they gave up. We were put in a river island unit. (as a side note, there were at least 3 units in our hallway that were vacant the whole time we were there). All of that sounds pretty negative, but we actually had a great time. The unit was fantastic, zero bugs, everything looked new and it was spacious. The kitchen was well stocked. Also, we were there for over a week and at the one week mark, they came and cleaned the room and left enough TP and soap and fresh towels to easily last a week. Condo sales people? I can't imagine why people have such a problem with this. We just took our phone off the hook in the morning and that was that. Sales people are not wandering the resort harrassing you at the pool or restaurants. the correct price for tubes is $9 per day (I have seen prices from $7 - $10). We bought 7 day passes for $50/person that got us unlimited tubes, mini golf, bungee jumping ride and the big hippo slide (which is a hoot). Not cheap and we didn't use it enough, but a much better value than paying individually for the activities/tubes. The also have a 3 day pass that was $34.95 (I think). The days do not have to be used consecutively. During our stay, we noticed that about 25% to 50% of people were floating on the tubes through the lazy river with no wristband. Not sure this is always the case. I never saw any employee take tubes away from non-payers. There were always plenty of loungers by the pool. The staff were all very nice. Especially the young woman who ran the bungee jumping ride (its for kids, not actual bungee jumping). Even the front dest manager (who was not overly friendly during our check in issue) - we saw him at Target the next day and he stopped my kids and asked how they were enjoying their vacation. Would we stay there again? tough to say. We really liked it, but I am not sure how much of our enjoyment was tied to being in a very well located unit. We like resort environments, so I am not sure we would risk being in one of the more residential type of villages.

For breakfast we either ate in the room or drove to the local Dennys or Ihop (the best) for cooked breakfast, that cost around $50 for four of us and you did not need lunch as well there was so much. There is a Super Target and Publix supermarket just off site which were very convenient. Disney World is around 10 minutes and Sea World and Universal 20 minutes by car and no toll roads if you use Interstate 4.

We enjoyed our stay in the West Village. We had a 2 bedroom villa. We traveled with 2 other families so we had 3 villas total. All were well furnished, comfortable and in good operable condition. Lets get a few things straight related to other reviews. This is a TIMESHARE. It is NOT a hotel. You are your own maid. You wash your own towels. You don't get your room cleaned by anyone. Timeshares have timeshare salespeople. If you don't want to listen to them then DON'T GO to the presentation. Despite some reviews here you can't be forced to go to the presentation. You go on your own free will. Tell them no and move on. I've never attended a presentation there in 3 rooms of staying. Don't accept the discounted tickets or free mini golf passes and then complain about the sales pitch. Say no. This place is very large. You may be lucky and be able to walk to the amenities or you may not. Luck of the draw. You likely will need a car. There is a free shuttle service but it is usually packed with kids. There are thousands of units spread over 3 separate villages. It really is a more like a neighborhood. Each village and each building is subject to its own remodel timeline. I'd be willing to bet that with this many units, some building and some unit is under renovation every day of the year. This means that some units will look like the website pictures and some units will look 5 years old and in need of TLC because they are. The pools and other amenities are very nice and enjoyable. Yes, there are charges for the inner tubes, mini golf etc. There are also pools that are free. You have the choice.

There were also spider webs between the lamp in the living room and the coffee table. We were moved to another unit in the North Village.

Did a lot of research prior to going and booking and knew ahead of time about the time share pitch and that this wasn't a hotel so didn't expect daily housekeeping. Checked in by Flo at the front desk and was not pressured at all about time share presentation. One question was asked if we wanted to attend, I said no and that was it. Made sure to disconnect the phones in the room so we weren't bothered at all by early morning sales calls. Check in was smooth and quick, I already knew about the extra daily room charges as I read about it here and also on Holiday Inn's website. This is a cashless resort so they put a $200 hold on your credit card when you check in. If you don't want to use a credit card, you can buy gift cards in different denominations starting at $25.00. We stayed by River Island (room 81705 - view of the parking lot :( . Room was beautiful, newly furnished, clean, lots of space, airy and bright with flat screen TV in living room. Nice jacuzzi in the master bath to soak in after a long day at the parks. Loved having kitchen available to make meals in and full sized washer/dryer. They supply you with detergent for 3 washes, but you'll need to buy paper towels, extra toilet paper, dishwashing detergent and sponge. Target and Publix located nearby to get supplies. There were 5 of us staying in the room and we had plenty of space. River Island kept us busy and entertained. You can get a poolside massage, go down the lazy river (be prepared to pay $9.00 per day per person for a tube, but you really don't need one to go down the lazy river and you can find loose tubes just hanging around. There are 2 sections where the employees hand out the tubes and sometimes they check to see if you have a blue wristband on. Just keep your hand in the water when you go past and move quickly!), play mini-golf, volleyball, go down the Hippo (very large inflatable water slide) or just relax in a hammock. Try to go early to get seats under an umbrella. Lots of chairs available, just limited shady spots and umbrellas or you can splurge and rent a cabana for the day. We ate at Anchors for lunch, prices very reasonable. Kids meals cost $5.00 with drink and fries. We pretty much just ordered kids meals for the adults too (hamburger, hot dogs or chicken fingers). Had dinner at River Island Grilling. Food was just okay, gator a little chewy, sushi good, horrible warm lava cake! Should have just gone to Starbucks for dessert! Two teenage boys (13 and 18) spent time in the arcade during rainstorm. $20 for 1000 tickets + bonus tickets seemed very reasonable until you saw that each game cost minimum of 45 tickets to play, average game used 90 tickets. At least it kept them busy for a while. There is a lake with a small beach by West Village where you can rent paddle boats, Sea-doos, jet-skis, paddle boards, mini boats etc....Would have done the paddle boats ($20 for one hour) but didn't want to be in the middle of the lake during the thunderstorm. This is a huge resort so you do need a car to get around. There is a shuttle service which they say runs every 15-20 minutes. If you plan on using the shuttle, make sure you bring an umbrella to cover your head from the sun while you wait. There are scattered benches throughout the resort where you wait for the shuttle, but they're out in the open, no cover.

They even give you 3 boxes of laundry detergent to get you started. The Publix is on the property so you can get your groceries right when you get there.

I sat in my car for an hour (In the FL heat) and never received a phone call so I called the front desk and was told that my unit was ready and was given the unit number. When I entered the room, the cleaning employee was still in there cleaning the room. I drove back over to the West Village to find out approximately when my room would be ready since the employee who was cleaning the room did not understand english. At that time, I was told that by the time I get there (to the room), It should be cleared. Although It was when I returned, the overall time spent waiting for my room in the FL heat was 90 minutes. So, my recommendation on how to improve the resort:... make sure the rooms are ready at check in time. We get into the room and it's beautiful. I was totally satisfied with it. That night, we order pizza. Not what I'm used to but it was edible. Breezes was a good restaurant. We had a waitress from the Phillippines who was fantastic. The second night we went to Breezes the service wasn't as good. We had breakfast at the River Island Grill and the buffet was good and the serer was quite friendly. At the lazy river, we sat around the pool and enjoyed ourselves for hours....until we were told that due to an unscheduled cleaning, we needed to vacate the pool. Someone had pooped in the pool!!! NASTY! During my presentation, I had the pleasure of meeting Maria from Florida, who was my salesperson. The presentation went well (although it lasted 4 hours) Because timesharing is new to me and the purpose for me being there was to understand the business and to see if this was indeed the right choice for my family and me. I was not prepared to buy on the spot and as I had mentioned to Maria in the presentation, I like to have an opportunity to pray on making such a spontanious decision. Maria left and brought her manager to the table, Jorge from New Jersey. I explained to him as well that I would like to pray on the situations since that is the way I make all of my decisions. He RESPECTED that. After I told him that I would not buy, he sent Wanda from Florida to my table. Now Wanda is quite an animated creature, who appears to be Korean. When she introduced herself, she said that she represents the \"head bosses\" of the resort. She askes me a few questions and I gave her the same answer I gave Jorge and Maria...that I would prefer to pray on it. At this time, Wanda began to \"poke fun\" of my faith by saying \"God does not control your every move! He does not help you with EVERY decision!\" At this time, my husband walks away. He is angry. I have a little more patience, so I chose to sit there and listen to her criticize my Lord - Jesus Christ...She went on and on...she belittled Christ so badly that all I could do is sit there and ask God to forgive her because her ignorance had come to a head and at this point she looks stupid. After all the \"rucus\", Mark from Canada overheard what was going on and came over and apologized for her actions. He genuinely expressed concern and assisted in making the situation better. Because of the experience I had with Wanda, I find it diffucult to refer anyone or to purchase timeshare from a company who shows disrespect and are persecuted because of their Christian faith. Since all of my friends are Christians, I wouldn't have any to refer. My goal one day is to purchase time share from a reputable company who will respect my Christian faith. If Wanda is the face of Orange Lake then Orance Lake is not the place for me.

I have lived in Florida for 10+ yrs. and never knew this hotel existed(what a hidden tresure). This was a \"4\" day get away for myself, boyfriend and my \"2\" teenage boys. I did my review prior to staying so I was prepared for the \"deposit\" ($250.) at check-in ( I put this on my credit card and after checking-out it was refunded within 24hrs) this deposit can be used towards purchases made while @ the resort - yes the resort is \"cashless\" (except for arcade), which was not a big deal because we didn't have to worry about carrying cash w/ us everywhere. (You can use debit, credit card or charge to your room) When we arrived check-in went rather fast; yes they did try to schedule us for \"Timeshare\" Tour but I mentioned I was not interested and it was a done deal (no pressure). \"NOTE\" - this is a \"timeshare\" property - not and \"all exclusive resort\" ( the villas are just like homes and you do need the basic's for your stay). We stayed @ the \"Westside\" clubhouse, the room was very clean and was in a \"perfect\" location (standard hotel room - 2 beds, kitchenette, huge bathroom). The resort is huge and very much spread out between the different villages(being from the area I did have a car; which I chose to park) they do provide shuttle service which is \"hit / miss\" we got lucky a few times and didn't have to wait and then at \"River Island\" we did have to wait 15-20 min; they will drop you off where needed, so the shuttle service was not as bad as some have mentioned. From what I observed \"East Village\" is the oldest and furthest away (did not even visit ) \"River Island\" is the newest village and is set back from the other villages (this area has the \"lazy river\" and other water slides - there is a $9 charge for rental of the floats, but we chose not to purchase and just walked/swam the area (others doing the same) \"North Village\" also had a water slide, but also had basketball & volleyball nets in the pool which the boys enjoyed and made several new friends. \"West Viilage\" is the first village from the entrance as well as the regristration clubhouse, this is where we found to be the most happening (besides \"River Island\") there are \"2\" pools one is the main pool it is rather big and can be crowded the other one is smaller and set-away and seemed to not have as may kids in it. The beach is also at this village where there is water activities (tubing, jet ski's) and sand volleyball. There is a resturant/bar \"Breezes\" that the food was very good and priced within reason they had entertainment in the evening for the children as well as the adults, we found out that you can purchase a \"souvnier cup\" with a frozen drink ($7.50) or beer ($6) and refills could be done during your stay (frozen $5 - beer $4)they also have one for soda's; not sure of the price though. There is also a \"pizzeria\" and the pizza was good as well as priced fair. Over all our stay was \"great\" the boys made new friends and we will difintely go back; there was plenty to do and never left the resort.

We flew there from Michigan and didnt plan on leaving the resort so we didnt bother renting a car. We took a cab there and planned on using the free shuttle service the resort supplies, to make our way around pool to pool and back to the condo. The shuttle service is my biggest complaint. They tell you it runs every \"15 minutes\". Truth is, it can be longer then that and you're left waiting at the shuttle stops, baking in the sun, theres no unbrellas or coverage whatsoever while you wait. And sometimes the shuttle will either pass by without stopping or will stop and yell out to you..\"Where to??!!\" And alot of times, that particular shuttle isn't going to your destination but youre promised, very rudely most of the time, that the next one is on its way.....moooore waiting!! Its very frustrating especially when waiting with hot children. My next complaint is the price of everything on this resort. Average food, average shops, average everything and yet its over priced ridicuously. IF you bring your own car, take full advantage of the full kitchen your room provides and get some groceries to make your own meals. Its a \"cashless\" resort so they want you to charge everything to your room. With all intentions of keeping track, we were still SHOCKED to see that our bill after a weeks stay was double what we thought it would be. Keep your receipts!!! Do not, under no circumstances, attend the \"tour\". They promise you a 60 minute tour to learn about the time share. We sat for 3 hours listening to some salesman try and guilt us into buying into it. Teling us how we \"deserved\" this and our children did too. The more no's you give them, the more salesmen they will bring to you to try and close the deal. And you'll be amazed how they will start out at one price then after a few no's, the price will drop 90%...at least ours did. Its awful and uncomfortable and not worth the waste of your vacation time. The beds are uncomfortable and the pillows are huge. My kids couldnt even use them. The rest of the 3 bedroom condo we had was clean and everything we needed. The staff, for the most part, was rude. The pools are great, lazy river gets really crowded and you can't relax on your tube. One thing I didnt like about that was no tubes or flotation devices were allowed in the river except for the rentable ones the resort provides. They come in 2 sizes, small and large...large is ok for an adult but the small ones are not suitable for children under 7. I wouldnt recommend this place mostly because of the rude staff and shuttle service but if you have your own car, I can see where this would be a much more enjoyable vacation. There is an overpriced Publix nearby, dont buy groceries there. Go to the Super Target across the Street, way cheaper. And No matter what they promise you as a gift for attending the tour, dont do it!!! Not even the \"7 day pass\" for free tubes which you pay $40 up front for but get refunded in the end.

This is a Timeshare Resort do not expect to go there and not have them try to get you to buy it is their JOB just like MC' D's they flip burgers, well guess what here they sell vacations. DUH. Second the people below with the negative reviews must have went somewhere else and wrote a wrong review. I went with my wife and a 10 yr old, 9 yr old girls and a 3 1/2 yr old boy. I am an owner and this is my 1St time here, the timeshare was bought on EBAY for $255 yes that is correct $255.00. People thought I was nuts, but I did my research. I got in late and checked in at about 11:45 PM, MARK from NY was great, he checked us in. I entered the lobby and there were people in there checking in, but the lobby director looked at my paperwork and said \"Oh your an owner, right this way sir\" and directed me to an open associate (Mark). He told me he would give me 5 passes for my whole family for mini golf and tube rentals and the hippo slide for free to go on a tour for 60 Min. I said yes because I haven't seen the whole resort (just pics) and the passes that he gave me were $50 each do the math. We went and saw Judy and she took us on a tour and we saw some newer rooms that had been built recently. We spent about 90 min and it wasn't high sales pressure especially when they found out what I paid. I had a Villa in the West Village and it was remodeled and it was CLEAN. The pools were great and they all had plenty of TOWELS. There was security on duty all DAY and NIGHT at the gates checking for your parking ticket. The ppl that say there is no security or maintenance staff on duty are NUTS or BLIND. There was maintenance working all the time, working on the grounds and everything. Lets get to the price of things, I am not sure where everyone is from but I am from NY and the price of things were cheaper or right around the same at the resort. Food was good, my kids wanted to eat there at Breezes Bar+Grill again and again, kids I think ate for $4.99 or less and for all the families reading this I know you can't beat that. Know what to expect, this is a CASHLESS resort, it all goes on your room card so keep track. They have 10 pools, 9 restaurants 4 golf courses and 2 mini golf's. A long relaxing lazy river and if you do not want to pay $7 per person a day for the tubes, then travel down the lazy river and scarf a vacant tube for yourself and pay $0 its that easy. They don't allow you to bring tubes into the lazy river for obvious reasons, they would like to sell them to you so don't be stupid and write a review saying \"I can't believe they wouldn't let me bring in my own tube\", it's like asking McDonalds if you can bring in your own grill and fire up some hamburgers and just use their chairs to sit in. LOL The resort is HUGE, but the shuttles were always going. I had a rental car, but always saw shuttles running. They have a grocery store onsite, a Disney center, a rental car site at check in, you can check out tennis racquets, basketballs, volley balls, movies and games you name it. It is true what others say, you do not need to leave this place to have fun. I took my family out to Disney and the first day the kids were asking when they could go back to the pools while we were at Animal Kingdom. This was my family's first time on a plane/down to FL/to Disney and to see where my crazy self bought property. I also want to say I checked in in about 15 min, not 1 hr like others state. Take it for what it is worth, but if you are a family I would stay in a renovated WV Villa over any of the high-rises to include the new ones. I drive into my own driveway, get out with my groceries and walk in my front door you can't beat that. Staff was great, helpful and courteous from suggesting some nice tropical drinks by the pools to where things were located. You have any questions feels free to ask me. If your thinking about buying or staying at this resort, don't listen to some of these idiots.

Also, they will hold $250 on your check card, or charge your credit card, but that is because it is a no-cash resort. We checked in on the 18th around 5PM and it was very smooth with no delays. We had a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom villa in the North Village overlooking the golf course with a screened in porch. It was great. The only drawback was them cutting the grass at 5AM, but not really a big deal. The villa was stocked well and they provided enough towels for at least 10 people. They provide some detergent for washing clothes, for the dishwasher, and for washing dishes by hand. The first two days we did not leave the property except to go to the SuperTarget. The pools are great, and the staff is friendly. When the temperature reached 98 degrees, the fruity drinks from the bar were worth the $9 (keep the glass, and the drinks are $7). We played miniature golf, and when we couldn't get to the second 18 holes, we were given a raincheck to come back later that day. One note, the pool lifeguards are great. There was a missing child for a very short time, and they immediately closed the slide in River Island, got all the children out of line until the child was located which happened by the time all the kids got out of line and got into the pool. We never felt our child was not safe there. The Disney Parks, several restaurants, and gift shops are close to the resort. We did not want to leave, but we will return.

We knew this and why because my husband researched this resort and bought a timeshare on Ebay for $ 225.00 . Yes that is $ 225.00 , a resale. His review is all so on here too. So I have read all the bad reviews on no house keeping and how noisy and dirty and poor service and this and that. Everyone has their own opinion and I know this. But our trip was nothing more than PERFECT !!!! Our flight from Hartford Conn. was delayed and then had to land to fix a filter so our flight took almost 5 hrs instead of 2 and half. So I was expecting the worst showing up at 11 30 pm. After reading all the reviews that it took forever to check in. My husband and 2 girls were in and out in 15 to 20 minutes. Then we took off to our Villa in West Village and let me tell you our place was beautiful. Everything was clean, there was enough towels and starter stuff for us. We knew we needed to buy food and extra things and also knew there was going to be no house keeping, and why, research !!!!!! I had no problem doing our laundry and cleaning up after ourselves. Since we were already owners they offered us a tour so we did go to the presentation and took a tour because it was our first visit and there and wanted to see and learn where everything was, there was no pressure at the end to buy into anything more than what we had. They were really nice and took no for an answer . The only messages on our phone was about the resort and what it offered that day and they were all prerecorded . They gave us our free passes for mini golf and the tubes for the Lazy river for taking the tour. We ate at Breezes which was very good and the staff and service was excellent. They also deliver too !!! Everywhere we went we saw maintenance people, cleaning people, SECURITY driving around and there was Security and all booths every time we came and went. Disney parks are an easy access. We heard but didn't see fireworks that was okay we saw them at Magic Kingdom. The kids loved the pools . We swam until 11pm one of the nights . Everyone was nice and friendly, it was nice seeing families having fun and laughing and enjoying their vacation. It was out 1st trip to Disney also so staying here made it perfect. The kids got to see a Gator show and hold a gator !!!! We ordered pizza from the market and it was also good. Everyone says it's expensive but we are from New York so the prices were the same for us and plus we used our coupons from the resort, which saved us $$ too. There were always plenty of towels at the pools expect when it downed poured for 20 minutes due to the Storm Bonnie. It was also cool you could just use your room card to purchase food and anything that you wanted so you didn't have to bring your purse or wallet. I loved every minute we were there and can't wait till next July !!!!!!!! The only regret that I have was I wish we stayed more at the Resort than running around all the Disney parks, but hey we will be back next year so not to worry !!!!!!!!

Michael gave us our keys, map to the place and ignored us the rest of the time. Did not call and when I asked him again he ignored us. So we took our chances. We drove to our unit -86261- Great view of the fireworks -Disney was right in front of us.. It was ready.. brought our things in.. and off to go food shopping... very easy access to Publix, Target and there is a Wal-mart about 5 minutes down 192 off of 27. Came back and went to the pools... West Pool.. water in the pool was ok.... North Pool ... a little cooler but River Island very warm... By the way.. Frogs every where ...Road, walkways and even the pool areas...alive and dead.. was not cleaned up. Everything WAS going good until.... Some one vandalized my new car..It got egged (I guess Security does not drive around much or not at all....) When I went to customer care in the main building, in my egged car (using up my windshield washer fluid) I parked it right under the awning where people park to check in at 9:30 am. I went to the front desk and asked to speak to a Manager I was taken to Customer Care... I spoke with Security and filled out a report.. Customer Care was good until I spoke to the supervisor--N-- (because management was busy, the customer care took my phone and my husbands cell number and was told that management would call us when he got back... but never did so I spoke to ... N...)She was cold said she would credit my account $10.00 to get it washed... I told her I cant see out of my windshield and I did not have anymore fluid to clean it.. so she said she would call someone to clean it for me. She called and the person who was suppose to come could not get up there until around 1:00 pm ... so I was in the main building just waiting for someone to even acknowledge me and tell me they are sorry or even can I get you anything.. Nothing... So mind you the egg is still on my car and it is 90 degrees and getting hotter...(Egg takes paint off of car when sitting) .. While I was waiting a guest came up to me and asked if that happened here and I said it sure did and he said he was going through the same thing door bell ringing and knocking, when he would go to answer the person or people would run away..... also another guest (an OWNER) told me ...while in customer care, she had fruit flies in both of her units... and another guest said she cleaned her own place because they told her that her place was clean and it was not.. she also washed all the dirty towels and sheets and went to target and bought more... she waited for over an hour also.. but when someone who stays at there place all the time and has paid using those they sure bend over to help them out... and gets an upgrade...to Signature.. Anyway...back to my car...while I was waiting for this person to come clean my car the manager came to me and asked what happened .. while I was taking pictures of where all the egg was... roof, hood, windshield and wipers and the whole wipers even in the cracks where the vents where so down inside as well...He said that they were not responsible to what had happened and that they were cleaning the car out of there own pocket and asked be to calm down and relax...He also was a cold person... and went on his way..said he would see me when he got back.. He came back and did not even acknowledge me until after this when I asked to see him again ... after what had happened... Well 1:00 pm came and pass .. N came out of the restroom and said oh your back .. I said back from where I have been here since you told me the person who will clean your car will be here around 1:00 I have not left. She forgot about me... I was so upset I started crying because I knew what was going to happen... egg + heat + car = paint..well a lovely young lady saw that I was crying and gave me some tissue... thank heaven for her. That's when I asked to speak to the manager... I went in to his office and again he kept telling me that they were not responsible for this... I kept telling him it happened on there property so really they are.... Well after I started to cry ... he went out to speak to .. N...and they gave me a certificate to get something eat.. finally after around 5-10 minutes someone came to get my car... around 1:30 pm while my car was being cleaned I went to get something to eat and drink.. still upset.. while I was there a worker at Breezes told me that there has been people breaking into cars there and other things happening there which he could not say but you get the picture... While I was walking back I get a phone call telling me my car is doubled park and I needed to move it or it will be towed... can you believe this...I saw my car was back and I was told to go check it out... I did and guess what and nice chip in the paint where the egg was... I KNEW IT...and to top it off again they -N and some other women who I never met-...kept telling me that they are not responsible for this...and this other women told me oil was spilled all inside her car which was brand new as well... OK... so anyway N said she would have a letter for me for my insurance so I can get this chip taken care of... Now ... the next morning.. I get 4 phone calls in a row so on the fourth one I picked it thinking it would be Customer Care... N...Not.. it was them trying to get me to take a tour...

We had to call down to the office twice for them to go take it out of our truck. It was ridiculous. I've stayed at this hotel before and it was a great experience. I would recommend this hotel to people, but I would recommend you ask before you make your reservation if the hotel is expecting kids and if so, how many.

We have a 2 toddlers, and relying on shuttle transportation to get around the resort isn't really convenient when we have naptimes, cranky kids, and an enormous amount of pool toys with us! We were SO happy that we had a car to get around. Our villa was in the North Village, and the pool that was closest to us wasn't as fun for our kids as the River Island pool, so we drove to the River Island pool everyday to swim. The villa was spacious, but the kitchen was ill-equipped compared to other timeshare places we have stayed in the past. Otherwise, the accommodations were okay -- not fantastic, but nothing disgusting or dirty. We were there over the 4th of July, and our neighbors were extremely loud in the streets, setting off fireworks -- not the resort's problem, but still a nuisance when we had toddlers trying to sleep and being woken up at midnight. We were happy to be close to Disney and went everyday.....but the \"strip\" near the hotel is kind of shady -- not really anywhere I'd want to eat/stop/shop. The Target and Publix were incredibly convenient. The sales pitch was heavy at registration, and we went to an early-morning sales meeting the day after we got there.

We finally got a room at the East village near the pool. We were aware of most of the services provided including washer and dryer in the room. We came prepared with laundry and dishwasher detergent, extra toilet paper. We knew about the maid service, ie if you want you can call for service for a charge, but we opted to bring our own cleaning supplies since we were there for seven days. The resort has FREE shuttle service to the different villages. If you need to leave the property, you would need your own mode of transportation. The resort has gone to a non-CASH resort which means you either allow the resort to hold your creditcard number to your room or purchase a gift card in the amount of $25, $50 etc. I guess the resort could be more enjoyable if the resort held your creditcard number and the activities are just charged to the room. But, we're in a recession and I chose to book the hotel room with a Wal-mart credit card on an advance purchase so not to overspend at the resort. So, when they ask us to hold our credit card, we told them we didn't have one. They also turned your telephone off for outgoing calls, but most people have cell phones and that wasn't a problem. We also purchased one gift card for $25 so my son could play one 18 hour of golf $9 + tax. We brought our own tub down, but couldn't use it at the lazy river, therefore, we didn't ride it. The biggest and annoying problem I had with the resort was the phone calls constantly for a time-share tour. I ignored the telephone up to Wednesday and my sister answered the phone. I told the corporate office I was not interested in the timeshare tour and to remove my name from their computer - they did. I explained to them that I was a PAID guess and this was not a free timeshare trip so, please do not disturb my vacation and the calls stopped. LASTLY, there were two incidents at the resort - (1) a man was arrested in front of my building - don't know what the problem was and I started seeing bugs in the bathroom - big cockroaches. I have terrible allergies and I had to send my husband to the store to get bug spray. He did remind me that the front door had a gap at the bottom where the rubber seal had worn. Oh, the only other place that accepted cash was the game room where the kids can load the machine and receive a game card. I couldn't even get a cup of starbucks coffee with CASH. Although the concept of having an non-CASH resort seems fine, but the resort could make a whole lot of money if they accepted cash. Overall, the room in 8700 building was beautifully laid out and cleaned.

Our first visit here was was for our Honeymoon (Sept 2007) had done an RCI week exchange from our Greece timeshare. This time around was a Lattitudes package we purchased in 2007 for \u00a3995 for 250,000 points spend (which at the time was ok). We stayed in the East Village the first time and were extremely happy with the 2 bedroom apartment we had. This time around we had our 16month old Daughter and the wifes sister with her husband and daughter, and again a 2 bedroom was more than enough for us all. The 2 bed apartments in the East village are HUGE, the Master bedroom and en-suite are massive (the beds are like 2 single bases pushed together with a huge single mattress. The apartments themselves are well kept, the only small thing which makes them look slightly dated is the old style TVs which could do with swapping to LCD's perhaps. The kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, cutlery and even has an ice maker in the huge Fridge. The living area is pretty big with a good sized dinning table and outside is a balcony which is netted off (to keep the little flies, pets out etc...) The apartment was cleaned after the first week, including bedding, towels etc.... we werent really bothered with towels everyday as we used the washer/dryer most days for our own clothing and kids clothing. Just a quick note to say having the washer and dryer on a 2 week holiday like this with small kids is fantastic. The whole of the site has Free wifi which was running smoothly for the Majority of the 2 weeks. They had 1 or 2 outages but nothing major. Car parks are huge and overall the site is very quiet and well kept by the Dozens of gardeners we saw every day! The resort is absolutely huge and you really need a car to get around, the onsite shuttle service is OK if you need to use it but can upto 20 minutes wait. The resort isn't in the best of location to see all the sites, but is pretty close the Disney entrance (ironically the grounds of the site neighbour Animal kingdom) and is about 15-18 miles away from the main International drive attractions. If you have a car though its not a big deal. Now sadly to the bad points: the check in process took over 30 minutes due to the staff not really knowing what they were doing with my Lattitudes package, the supervisor kept running around trying to look busy but not really doing much. I had to wave my arms (figuratively speaking) 3 times to make it clear I hadnt been dealt with. FINALLY got an older member of staff who booked me into the room with 5 minutes and took my creditcard swipe. During our stay we went to the restraunt for breakfast as we walked in we said \"4 adults for the all you can eat breakfast\" and we were seated in a nicely furbished area and offered coffee and juice at the table. The breakfast was ok, lots of eggs, bacon grits, sausage gravy and was all very nice. When we got the bill its turns out the all you can eat breakfast didnt include coffee or juice which was charged at an extra $2.50 a cup. Its a nice place but any chance they can to fleece you for every penny they do. Basic breakfast for 4 people and 2 toddlers came to almost $70 which is sneakily billed to your room. Now being veterans of RCI timeshare weeks we knew we had to endure the usual sit down sales pitch for \"90 minutes\" which we all know turns into more like 3 hours. Firstly we were sent to the wrong building, then after driving all the way to other side of the site and leaving my car there we were shuttled by golf buggy all the way back to the original building about 1km away (??????) the free breakfast consisted of coffee, juice and buns but nothing considered a real breakfast. The salesfolk are polite but seriously oppresive, its serious high pressure sales here, nothing more. Lets be under no illusions here they want your money no holds bared. Eventually after refusing about 5 deals because I didnt have a permanent job at the time, I had some sales manager insinuating if I didnt take his fantastic deal I was a poor father to my family, I guess thats when I lost it and got seriously wound up and as I was just getting into giving him both verbal barrels he waved to a porter who was stood looking blank and said \"what you need me now?\" and got up and literally ran off into a backroom. The porter still looked blank and clearly didnt have a clue what he was on about. At this piont the sales woman who knew things had gotten awkward got up and said \"thanks for your time\" and quickley disapeared. Then a quality control guy appeared before we left to guage our experience and feedback. He listened to our objections for a couple of minutes (not writing anything down) then it turned out he wasnt quality control at all but a last ditched attempt to sell us YET ANOTHER form of timeshare. After the whole episode we walked out and asked who would take us back down to our car. \"You can catch the shuttle bus from just our here sir\" so we sat in the baking sunshine with our 15 month old daughter for 15 minutes until the driver turned out and took us back down to the car. All in all this is a fantasic site to stay in we thoroughly enjoyed our two weeks away and the the lazy river is a stunning pool (although you have to hire the rubber rings at $5/day EACH!!!!) I would say the facilities are 9/10 but since taken over by Holiday Inn the staff and sales pitch is what lets this site down.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort, Great Value, Worth the trip!\u201d", "Author": "littlebearhugs", "ReviewID": "UR69673828", "Content": "We spent the last seven days at the Holiday Inn Orange Lake. We traveled with a group of 17 including 5 small children. I have two timeshares I traded through RCI and rented one three bedroom condo. I read the reviews before I went but knew from previous experience to take the negative reviews with a grain of salt. This resort is a timeshare rental resort, not a hotel. If you know that before you go, you are already aware that there is no housekeeping service and although they do provide you with an ample amount of toilet paper, soap, etc., to start, you will have to purchase more supplies on your own. We found all three units we had to be clean, well kept and had ample space for all in our party. My favorite unit was the three bedroom condo. It was very large and we often had everyone over to the this condo and no one ever felt cramped. It tooks us less than 20 minutes to check into all three units and we were not pressured into going to a timeshare presentation. One firm no was all it took and the check in and check out staff were both helpful, friendly and courteous. The only negative about the whole trip was the repeated phone calls to try and get us to go to a presentation. If it really bothers you, just take the phone off the hook. The grounds and pools are well kept. They do not charge you by the hour for the tubes, it is a one time fee for the day. You can also purchase a weekly rental at a discount if you prefer. We cooked often in the resort and did not try the restaurants so I don't know if they were good or not. We ordered some food by the pool at River Island. It was fine and typical of what you would find in any resort area. The resort is very close to all of the Disney parks and it was very easy and convenient to drive there every day. The resort is massive and although they do provide a shuttle to get around, we used our car and did not find it inconvenient at all.

My wife's girlfriend and two daughters came to visit us for a month from Europe and were planning to see Disney World. So,we decided to combine our vacation with theirs and book a two bedroom,two bath suite in early June. After learning as much as we could about the resort via the website and the concierge,we set off.While the rest of the group was at Disney, I went to the resort to check in. The only real problem that we encountered during the entire week was simply the fact that I had called ahead and requested an early check in.For some reason this request had not been documented in the comments section of my reservation. I arrived at about noon of our check in day and I went through all of the paperwork and the timeshare appointment pitch. I was told that our unit would be ready soon,so I decided to drive over to see what progress houskeeping was making on getting it ready.Turns out,the fellow that was occupying the unit barely spoke English and did not understand that he had to check out then check into a new unit that day,since he had booked two full weeks.I was a little flustered and went back to the check in desk to report this.The staff jumped on this and Chris in management swiftly,and I mean swiftly, procured us an UPGRADED unit (two queen beds in the second bedroom) that was ready immediately for move in.It only got better after that. The resort is huge and fab. The units are luxurious,maintained and spacious.Everything worked.The only problem I had with the unit was that the yellow lights on the patio actually attracted bugs in the evening.So I unscrewed it.Our unit backed up to the golf course. There was a small pool/hot tub nearby as well.The only drawback was the highway noise from 192 at night.Emergency vehicles and trucks could be heard at night,despite the closed windows. We were on Southern Magnolia street. If you are a golfer this will be absolute heaven for you.No ifs,ands or buts. I don't golf,nor did anyone in our party, but the Legends course is lighted for night play and kids golf free. I think there are three courses at Orange Lake.This resort is SO close to Disney,you may as well be staying on Disney property!The toll road between the two entrances to OL takes you North,directly to the west Disney entrance,which is barely used.Avoid the traffic and save time.You're there in 5-7 minutes. The activities and amenities are truly far too many to list.Just go and see for yourself! We loved the lazy river. The windward bar,right at the pool,serves delicious pina coladas. The water slides on the pool complex were enjoyed by the kids.The only thing that we did not like about the resort was the little fees for this and that.Wireless internet service was free and it worked well.There was no daily resort fee.The fees for the tubes on the lazy river was $7/day.The fee for a locker at the pool complex was $9! Miniature golf was NOT free.We have never paid for it at all other timeshare resorts we have stayed at.Use your car as a locker.Put your valuables in the trunk and take only your room key and car key to the pool. Your room key is linked to a credit card when you check in.Keep tabs on it closely.Though everyone seemed to be having a great time and we saw no \"riff raff\"...ya never know. The game room/arcade at the main clubhouse was,in one word, superior. Absolutely cool.There is also a large conference room where recently released films are shown. Feel free to leave your kids who are twelve or over,at the activities room while you parents take a break and watch the film.There is also a paid babysitting service active at the resort. From mini malls elegantly laid out and stocked,to poolside eateries and bars,to lake activities to golf...this place is too much! It's billed as the largest RCI resort in the world,but it is also one of the best,as well! Go! You won't be sorry. Orange lake is not \"Waldorf or Ritz Carlton\" elegant but it is definitely upscale.If you need that type of elegance and level of refined service, pay the money book a hotel room and spend wads.Orange Lake is a very family-oriented resort.

As a platinum Marriott member, the Marriott World Center and surrounding resorts were our first choice. However we had 5+ other family groups that decided to stay here, so for convenience we joined them. Prior to arrival, I read most of the posts on here and was ready for just about anything they threw out at me. Some of the major concerns of the prior guests came front and center, others didn't. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa in the East Village. First off, BEFORE you make a reservation here please realize that this is not a full service hotel. If you want that in a resort, Go to the Marriott Sable or Imperial Palms resort. Your room is supplied with towels, minimal soap, toilet paper, tissue, dishwasher soap etc. Outside of that, you are on your own. If you want your towels washed, you do it yourself. There is a Super Target and a large Publix grocery store just outside the property. Additionally, the entire resort is cashless. This leaves you with 2 options to make any purchase; a credit card or your room key. Not a big deal to me but some people seem to be annoyed by this. There is free wi-fi throughout the resort. I found it to be pretty reliable and usually did not have problems with access or speed. This is a time share facility, so be prepared for the sales pitch. Upon arrival, we were taken into a separate room for a one on one check in. This took about an hour. They do not just hand over the keys and tell you where your room is, you get a complete overview of the property, all the great things about it etc, with several sales pitch dings in here and there. You will also be given an incentive to take the tour which they said will only take 45 min or such. My parents chose to do this, and were not real happy when it took 3 hours of their time. My advice would be if you chose to do this without the intent to purchase and only want the incentive, is to not be very friendly on the tour. They take friendliness as incentive to push harder and draw out the tour. Also when you check in, they DON'T charge you $250, but rather put a credit hold on your card for that amount. There is a difference that some people don't realize judging from reading some of the other articles on this site. This is the same thing that happens at most gas stations, when you run your card, an automatic hold is put on your card for typically $50.00, when your purchase is over, then the gas station releases the hold and charges your credit card. Same thing here, they put a hold on your card for $250 for your on property purchases, when/if your purchases reach $250, they process the charge and put a hold for another $250 and so on. That is the extent of the facts as I saw them, I will now outline my experience and some of the issues that I came across. The East Village is pretty far from the main pool, however we did have a nice view of the Magic Kingdom fireworks each night at 10pm. Our villa was on the 6th floor of the unit and looked fairly nice. Upon closer inspection the floors and bathrooms were very dirty. My wife typically wipes down the floors and surfaces with clorox wipes, and after doing so, she had half the container used with each wipe completely black with dirt. The decor of the rooms was nice, the beds were well used and not very comfortable. The views were nice and other than that the room was ok. Our first day there, the AC didn't work, June in Orlando is not a great time for this. It took them 4-6 hours to get this resolved. The next night, which happened to be our Disney day, we arrived back late to find the elevators out of service. So we had to lug all our goods, strollers and 2 very tired kids up 6 flights of stairs. The next day after returning from our day's activities, we found our room keys to not work. I have stayed in enough hotels to know where not to put hotel keys (around cell phones, blackberries, magnets etc), so to have all 4 of our room keys fail, esp when one had been kept in the car, was a bit suspicious. Anyways, I called the hotel reception and explained our situation and was told to hang tight and someone would be out with new keys. I offered to come to the reception and get them but was told not to worry. Long story short, it took 10+ phone calls and almost 1.5 hours for someone to finally get new keys to us. Unacceptable in my book. The next day, my parents' unit lost their cold water. Cold water? are you kidding me. The solution presented to them was to shower in another unit. Those were my main problems that I came across, the phone rang the first couple of days, asking us to take a tour, we finally got a bit aggressive and told them to leave us alone. My main issue with this resort was that once you got outside of the reception area, it seemed you were on your own. People were not as friendly or helpful as, say a Disney resort or other top level hotel or resort. After complaining, we got a 2.5 night comp to our room, but that took some prodding as initially they pretty much had the attitude that, \"oh well, things happen, not our fault\". Personally, if I am going to spend the time and money to go to a resort, I do want an element of personal service and attentiveness. This facility lacks that. The food that we did have, was pretty good, especially the nachos. As with anything on property (and any typical resort) it is a bit overpriced. When it was time to leave, it took us 2 hours to check out, because the room comp was not applied correctly and they couldn't figure out how to do it. Very unorganized. The pools were nice and the water slide at river city was very fast. You are nickel and dime'd for any extras that you want like tubes etc. I was disappointed at the lack of general property upkeep. The lawns, bushes were not properly maintained. The buildings were consistently covered with spiders and webs, etc. Overall, in my opinion this is an average discount resort that does not focus on the little things to put it in a higher class. If you are looking for an average place to stay for a decent rate without any typical 1st class amenities, then this is your place. The kids had a good time at the pools and some of the events that were held. Personally, we won't be returning. I would rather spend a few extra dollars on a Disney property or at another fuller scale resort. But if budget is your main priority and you don't mind the lower class deficiencies, then you may enjoy this place", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middleburg, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWhat a joke !!!

We were able to see nightly fireworks at Disney which was very cool. My only complaint would be whenever the wind blows a certain way there is a god aweful smell pretty much like raw sewage!

(We live locally). We receieved a week's stay as a wedding gift/birthday gift from an RCI Member. Check in was VERY fast, and when asked if we wanted to do the sales pitch, we weren't really sure what our schedule was like, so the lady was really understanding and friendly and said we could schedule whenever. I only received one phone call the whole week from a very very friendly lady asking how our stay was and if I had any questions, and asking me if I knew when we would be able to achedule our sales pitch. I told her I wasn't sure when my husband would be back to the resort, (if you are married, both must be present). She was still very friendly and said that was fine, and gave me the number to reach her. (When my husband came back, we went to make an appointment, but they did not have any left for the day, and we were leaving the next day, and they do not allow sales pitches on the day you check out.) There was ABOSLUTLEY NO PRESSURE to attend the sales pitch. The room we had was nice, family oriented, tropical. Nothing fancy, really. NO bed bugs, we always check because we had a mishap on our honeymoon, but none there, thank the Lord. We did find spiders, and as for me and my friends, it is the worst thing you could find in a hotel :-P One in the master bath, 2 in the \"guest\" bath, 1 in the \"guest\" BED (yes, actual bed) and one IN the master bed... The front desk was absolutely horridied when I told them, and would take care of it. Publix is extremely close, but very expensive; nice to have, but not a very good value. All the dishes were clean, all the cooking pans and utensils were clean, everything was organized. There were plenty of extra blankets and sheets. We went on a walk all around the resort, which was long, but beautiful- it helps to be a good directional person, because my husband got lost a few times in the resort- it is HUGE- I, with the map, did not get lost at all. The pools are great, all with lifeguards. The best two pools are the ones at River Island (with the lazy river and waterslides) and at the complex behind the main lobby. There is so much to do. Suprisingly, non-alcoholic drinks and refreshments are not as expensive as you would think, and comes in handy when lounging around the pool. In the evenings, at the main pool behind the beautiful lobby, they have lots of activities throughout the day, but the one we liked the best was watching the karaoke! Mostly kids performing oldies/disney songs, it was a blast to watch as the sun set on the man made beach on the lake with volleyball nets, hammocks, and palm trees galore in the background. It is a GREAT, fun, summer atmosphere. I cannot tell you how much fun we had. It was a true blast. I also felt very safe, as to get on the property, you had to prove you had reservations there, and/or a (free) parking pass. We did not do this, and I can't remember the exact price, but for those traveling from nothern states, I would recommend splurging on a poolside cabana for a day. It comes with a private pool lounging deck, a fully stocked mini fridge, a fan, cable tv, and I am pretty sure wifi. I can't wait to go back; it was a week of great adventure.

The other issue is that when we were looking for our rooom, we saw linens and towels in piles laying by the room doors half under the shrubery by a few of the rooms. There were maids hanging outside by their golfcarts smoking and talking and not working. It was very distasteful and trailor trashy. Orange Lake needs a lot of work in every area especially cleaning.

We stayed in west village, literally across the street from the pool. Walking distance, although you cannot walk between villages. You'll have to use either a car or the shuttle.

When I walked in I was a little suprised how many people where checking in, and it seemed to be taking forever. Then a manager came and whisked me off to another office where I knew the \"sales pitch\" was going to begin. The man was very friendly and professional. Yes he began his pitch and I politely turned him down and that was it! Like the other reviews state. This place is huge! We had to leave the check in desk, get back on a major highway and drive about two miles to RIVER ISLAND where our condo was located. Forget about walking around this place it is just too big. They do offer a shuttle, but fortunately we had a rental car. Our room was a king suite and four of us stayed there. My wife and I and two kids. The couch folds out into a bed and we had the room with the king bed. The unit is very well layed out and you will love the convenience of the washer, dryer and kitchen. Only inconveniences, no oven and no bathtub. It does have a huge shower. We ate most of our breakfast and lunches in the room. And the washer and dryer enable you to bring less clothes,saving on luggage charges. It is tastefully decorated and was very clean. THIS IS NOT A HOTEL. You do not get daily maid service. You can if you pay for it, but otherwise you're cleaning up after yourself. The previous reviewers that griped about not getting clean sheets and maid service did not do their research. This in no way dissapointed me. Like I said, we where on River Island. It is next to a nice shopping area and a great pool complex that included a lazy river and two water slides. Tubes are available for rent, but you can still use the lazy river without them. We had dinner dinner at the River Island Grilling Company. It was pretty good. The service was a little slow, and there wasnt that many people there. Another night we ordered pizza from their pizza restaraunt \"Paisans\". It was a little under cooked and expensive, but they where huge pizzas.They have many places for you to shop, eat and drink. All of them are a litlle more than you want to pay, and less than they want to make. But it is convenient. There is a Publix and a Super Target very near for necessities, and much cheaper than the resort. Just remember you have to lug all your groceries to your room, which may or may not be a short walk. We used the bell carts nest to the front door to take ours. There is a sign at the pool entrance that says no coolers or alchohol but we saw several people doing it with no problems. Obviously they would rather sell it to you. We just bought the refillable souvenir glasses and filled them with our own stuff. The resort is very convenient to Disney World. It sits in the backyard of Disneys Animal Kingdom. We went to the DW parks every day, but I could have easily stayed at the resort and had fun. They offer many activities for the whole family.

I was just going to call the next day and tell them we weren't coming. When we got to our room I was a little disappointed that we weren't on the pool side of the hotel but it ended up being GREAT! There was a screened in porch that opened up to the parking lot. We got a parking space right by our door and it ended up being very convienient when loading / unloading. The room was fantastic. Tons of space and we needed nothing all week!!!!! When we woke up the next morning we went to Super Target right across from Orange Lake and went grocery shopping. We ate most of our meals right in the room. We had originally intended to spend three days at Disney but we were having such a good time at River Island that we only went to Disney one day! While I am on the topic of food, we did eat at River Island Grill twice. The food was very good and not that expensive. Try the sushi, it is rolled fresh to order! We spent almost all of our time at the zero entry pool in River Island. My husband and I got cocktails and sat in the shallow water and watched our kids have a blast in the water. We did have to take away the tubes that we brought from home because they don't allow any tubes but theirs in this particular pool. It is expensive but if the kids are under five they get one for free when an adult buys one. There are a lot of people that go down to the pool early and put a towel on the \"good\" chairs. Unless you can get to the pool before 9:30 expect to see a lot of \"taken\" spots. The drinks by the pool are weak and you had to order doubles or top shelf liquor in order for them to taste any good. We did this and allowed the kids to buy ice cream and hot dogs all week and we got Starbucks coffee everyday and our bill was not outrageous. The day came for our 90min tour. We were told to bring our receipt (from check-in)and nothing else to the tour. We decided to walk to the tour reception building (not far from River Island). We got there, we were hot... it was 92 degrees. We were told we were at the wrong building!!! We walked back, got the car, drove to the correct building. When we got in, we were refused our tour because we didn't have our drivers licenses and a credit card. We were mad!! As we were leaving, I remembered that they charged me a $30 deposit for the tour. I went back in to get my money back. A manager came up and informed me that the receptionist was wrong and they didn't need our liscense and credit card and that we could take the tour. I told them that wasn't happening and I just wanted my money back. It took them 20 min to give it to me. The next day someone called us and asked why we refused to take the tour. I explained that the tour was refused to us. They asked if we would take a tour. They offered us cask to take the tour. We got $80 and free tubes for the kids for the week. We took the tour, it took 3 and 1/2 hours!!!!!!!!! Five people tried to close us! I had a 3 and a 1 year old with us and they did not respect that at all!!!! Don't go on the tour! You can buy one of these deeds from someone online for nothing!!! Don't go on the tour!!! Also, do not buy your tickets for Disney at Orange Lake. They sold us our tickets at a \"discount\" and when we got to Disney we found out that we paid MORE for our tickets than we would have at the gate.

There is live music by the pool (it didn't bother us at all, we didn't hear it) and \"dive-in\" movies. Lots of activities if you want them. We are going again next year.... we just know what to avoid now. The beds are good, not great and I really needed my own pillow. I was so tired at the end of the day it never really mattered. One other thing, don't bother packing a bunch of clothes. The washer and dryer in the rooms are new and very nice. We did laundry everyday (bring beach towels, you don't get many towels in your room) and basically wore only our bathing suits!! We needed to buy toilet paper, soap, food, salt & pepper, laundry soap, dish soap and a britta water filter. Expenses: There is a daily fee of $8 in addition to your room charge. Daily tube rental fee of $14. No parking fee. Grocery store and liquor store across the street from Orange Lake. Buy Disney tickets from Disney.

When we first got there to check in we were amazed at how big it was. At the time there was not alot of people so we got to check in right away. The check in process was a bit long and we did end up giving in to the sales pitch to go on one of those timeshare presentations. That was totally worth it. We ended up doing a 90 minute tour but they paid us 75 dollars to do it, even though we didnt buy anything. That was pretty sweet because we had only paid 77 dollars per night to stay there so it was like getting a free nights stay. The room that we stayed in was probably one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. It was nice because they gave me a free upgrade!!! The pools were nice and warm and there were plently of things to do there.... golf, swim, the lazy river, putt putt, massages. They pretty much had everything. Every hotel does have its downside though. This one only had a few though. My first problem with this place was that it was so big that it kind of made it hare to find slot of things at the resort. Next was the pools. Im a pretty tall guy and the deepest part of the pool was about 5 feet. It wasnt anything major though because i was on vacation and i found other things to entertain myself. Finally the last of my cons would be the hidden fees. I booked this place about 2 and half months in advance, and thought i was done paying for it..... well i ended up by paying an extra 8 dollars a day for a resort fee and when a 250 dollar deposit for using a debit card rather than a credit card. They said ill get my deposit back within 2 weeks though but i didnt expect to have to hand over that much having already paid for the room.

I knew within 24 hours of arrival at this resort I must write a review. I just had to debunk some of the comments of the nay-sayers about this resort. Upon arrival, many were checking in and out. They had people handing out popcorn, soda and beer samples, and balloon makers for the kids. Creating a fun & service orientated environment was certainly first on their list. Because of reading reviews, I expected them to ask me to attend a timeshare \"pitch\", to charge me for tubes, minigolf, and watersports, and to be a cash-less resort, all of which were true. In addition, and just like other timeshare locations we have stayed, we also expected not to receive cleaning services, but to provide the necessities to maintain cleanliness of our room ourselves. Again, proven to be true. Our stay was for a week and we had more than enough dish soap, detergent, paper towels, and everything was in working order. One thing that seems to upset most of the reviewers is the timeshare pitch. We were offered, accepted to attend the \"pitch\", and ended up canceling our appointment without hassle. We did talk to a few folks the night before our scheduled appointment to find out about the process. They did tell us the appointment was 1 hour from the time the sales person got to you (so their appt was 2hrs). They also said there was a room and play center for you to leave your kids while you did the tour. And finally, the end result (discounts) seemed to be based on pre-qualification questions (ie. if you plan to golf, visit parks, use resort tubes) because everyone received something different. Because we traveled with a 10, 5, and 1 year old (whom I would not leave in a strange place while on a tour) we sent my husband to the meeting. They would not allow him to do the tour alone (they want both decision makers) and since I wasn't interested in being there potentially 2 hours with 3 kids, my husband asked to cancel and get our money back (we pre-paid for our discount ticket- insurance for them that we'll come I'd guess). They did try to reschedule us 2x's, but the dates didn't work with our plans so they refunded our money. No hassle and no phone calls. Doesn't sound that \"Hard-sell\" to me...they were just doing their job in trying to be accommodating. The discount wasn't that important to us either. All in all, the 2 bedroom unit that we had was spacious, up to date, very clean, and felt like home away from home....just the way we like it. We ate at the restaurants a handful of times and the food and service was good. The number of pools was satisfactory...we did a different pool each day we were there in between our other Orlando adventures. Each proved to provide lots of fun for my family the whole day through. There are daily activities~ many by the pools like hula hoop contests, line dances, and other entertainment~ that always brought an element of fun even if you weren't participating. The fitness facilities were satisfactory some offering more equipment than others. We met about 6-7 families who own timeshares at Orange Lake and all LOVE the resort and have come back regularly for years (most 15-20yrs). My family really enjoyed this resort and would love to go back.

Orange Lake, take note, perhaps you should send a welcome packet including the cash-free policy and the check-in speech.

They did not clean my room daily - I had to wash my own towels - I had to bring in my own toiletries - I was bugged to go to a time share meeting - etc. People for the LAST TIME GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS - THIS IS A TIME SHARE NOT A HOTEL. OK now that I got that out of my system lets talk about how great Orange Lake is. It is located right on Hwy 192, just a couple of miles from Disney. It is right in the center of all the action and around many great restaurants and shopping centers. The resort is huge and very well maintained. Even though there is a free shuttle that takes you throughout the resort, a car is highly recommended. I have a wonderful 6th floor 2 bedroom condo on River Island - which in my opinion is the best spot of the resort. There is the newly renovated West village which is made up of mostly housing style units on street settings. The East and North villages which are surrounded by golf course settings and are mostly condo style, and River Island condos which surround a tropical oasis. The units are very well maintained with all the amenities such as a full kitchen, washer and dryer, 2 full baths, ample TV sets, balcony, A/C etc. Some of the older units are being remodelled as we speak, so request a new unit if this is available to you. Orange Lake has a multiple supply of pools, activities, jogging and walking areas, wildlife, golf, tennis, kids activities etc that you can never leave this resort and not get bored. It is important to remember that this is a home away from home. You will do your own mid week cleaning, laundry, have the option of cooking your own meals and bring in most of your own toiletries. They do give you a nice little starter kit when you arrive complete with paper towels, toilet paper, coffee, garbage bags etc but you will need more before the week is over. If this does not suit you then don't stay here - go to Disney or comparable and pay over 3 times the price for the luxury of \"maid service\". Since Orange lake is a timeshare, they will ask you to come down to a sales presentation. If this is not in your plans simply decline - be firm about it as they will push you to come - simply say no thanks and end it there - they will not bother you again as they know you are not a buyer and will waste their time. I have been going to Orange Lake now for 6 years and I absolutely love it. It is not perfect but then again what is. They are always upgrading and improving every time I go. I highly recommend this resort for all, but research it first online - get all the answers - know what you are getting in to and decide if it is right for you.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "razzyfrazzy", "Title": "\u201cAwesome -- I would visit again!!!\u201d", "Author": "razzyfrazzy", "ReviewID": "UR61624960", "Content": "My husband and I booked a 4-day stay at the hotel with our year-old baby.

It's very close to a Super Target where we got some supplies for our room. Our baby enjoyed the stay as well, although we were mostly outdoors for vacation. We did take her swimming one of the days to the North Village pool complex called the Splash Lagoon. It was great, not crowded at all. The water was a little cold but it was a sunny day so it was fine. About the resort being a cashless one, they told us right away, so no big deal with that. They do try to get you to go to those tours they have. One day they called us and I said I'd think about it and the next day they called again, my husband was asleep and he just picked up the phone and hung it back up.

My husband and I live about an hour away from Orlando, so we go to Orlando quite often. We like to stay for the weekend a lot of times, and this time we stayed at Orange Lake Resort with another couple in one of the two-bedroom suites. It was nicely decorated with lots of space. The kitchen was nice to have - we made our own food while we were there to save some extra money. We did not go to any of the restaurants, but based on the $2.50 soda at the pool bar, we decided it would be best to dine in the room. The beds and sofas are not the best, but not horrible. They could use an upgrade in that area. And the pillows are very thick - I think they are high quality, but I enjoy a much flatter pillow.

Check in We arrived at noon so were not expecting to get into our room but it was ready. There were a few people in line so not so bad but I was selected? to go to an off area office- and later another 2 couples were escorted here. I let the girl know I was \"up\" on my knowledge of the resort having read pages and pages of reviews from Trip Advisor. I requested a tower room not a villa but despite her trying to get one I couldn't get one as we were here too long. It makes sense as an owner might come in during that time and we would have to move. Well then we start in on the breakfast spiel. \"Nope but thanks..\" Long story short she held my Visa \"hostage\" while appealing to my sensibilites to go to the \"breakfast\". Smiling I reminded her she didn't get me the tower bldg.... so no deal. (place happy face here)....So on to our villa. THE VILLA We are right around the corner (I'm still here) from the West village. Everything is a 5 min walk. We are off the main road on Sandhill (2401) and our back yard is the 17th green for The Reserve golf course. Thank G.. we did not get in the tower. We LOVE it here. Groceries? walk 'em right in no elevator -- tons of sunshine front and back . Reminder to you that there is limited sun in tower and screens in front of ea bacony. We have a 100% view of the Disney fireworks down the fairway so no obstructions, We sit inside and watch them every night. Walked into the villa and simply went \"OMG..\" It is perfect. Granite counters breakfast bar w/ 3 comfy stools. Dining room table ready for 6. Walk further in and down a step into the living area -2 couches one which could become a bed both comfortable huge desk for my computer (free wi-fi) large screen flat swivel tv safe located in cabinet underneath.All the decor is south seas. Excellent taste whom ever did the decorating all furniture top notch. 2 bedrooms one front one back ea has their own ensuite. Our bedrom is a king size bed sliding 8 ft? glass doors so most of the room All of this villa was spotless. Houskeeping Each week they come in on Mon. all new bedding/ towels/dust tables/vacuum/leave a welcome pack of Tide (3) dishwasher soap(3) paper towels /tissue / tpaper dish soap salt pepper so quite happy w/ the amount they leave. Again most pleased with the cleanliness. Breezes This is the action area of West Village. Restaurant prices are good. They often have a disc jockey playing a good variety of songs lots of activities for the kids 2 huge pools one more so for the kids as shallow and water spouts- the other deeper and quieter with more seniors. Most days (quiet pool) at 2 there is\" Bingo\" playing 5/6 games with cash pots from say $100 to $200 and up depending on the number of people playing. Here you can use cash. $5. for 6 boards. Yes you either use your Visa or the card they give you to charge everything. It sure adds up quickly so be careful. At 4 there is Happy hour and drinks are 1/2 price BUT only certain drinks so ask. There is a small sand beach with a surprising # of watercraft that you can rent. No swimming as too many boats make it dangerous plus water is a strange colour not making it particularly appealing. This is not really a \"lake\" as so small and it is more of one of the many holding areas of water with Florida being so close to sea level. Golfing We golfed twice at The Reserve and the prices not too bad. There are lots of specials every week including half price golf club rentals. It depends on where you want to golf as to when and where you will find the specials. They give you coupons at the gate and it tells you what is the special of the day. Each day as well they will leave messages on your phone as to happening events. Final Summary We have really enjoyed our stay here and would come back in 4 years. Please note that folks that own here have huge maintenance fees. One lady we spoke to has owned for 20 years paid $10,000 for 1 week then ended up w/ another unit so now 2 and she pays $750 /week each unit for fees. We feel a little humbled to only pay the RCI fee.

Very open and big so walking to all amenities is out of the question. My biggest complaint about the place is at check in. We waited for 20 minutes to get to check in and their was only 1 person in front of us. Then the worst part about the trip was that I had to give a credit card for incidentals. I handed the sales rep my debit card with visa logo and he said that if I used a credit card it would be back in the account immediately at checkin. They don't take cash so they asked that everything get charged to the room and we can pay with our debit card or with cash at departure. I usually don't like having credit cards so I said, only if you guarantee that my credit card does not get charge. I only have a $200 credit for things like this. So the rep guarantee that I wouldn't get charged. Little did I know until after my trip ended at the checkout that he charged $39.00 on my credit card on the same day he told me to my face that nothing would get charged. This was for incidentals. If I had known that, I would have not given my credit card. Then on checkout time at 10:00 a.m. I go to settle my bill with my debit card and found out that they charged my credit card for the food charges that morning at 6:00 a.m. when they weren't supposed to. All the front desk girl said was, sorry, that wasn't supposed to happen. Now, being that I was promised nothing get charged to my credit card when I questioned it twice before handing it over, got two charges on my card. They eventually refunded on the credit card and charged my debit card but their word meant nothing. I told the CSR that I can use my company credit card if nothing gets charged so that it would release when I check out right away and use my debit card to pay. Now , company credit card has been charged twice and my boss will probably be revoking my card and possibly losing my job because the service at this place is shady. I called downstairs to ask questions about disney parking and it went into voicemail and 10 minutes later, a csr calls back to sell me on a timeshare meeting. She didn't know anything about my voicemail that I left for disney parking questions. We had to unplug our phone's so it won't ring in the mornings everyday out there selling us on going to their timeshare breakfast meetings. It was like getting a root canal finding someone at the front desk at any hour of the day to answer any questions. Also, the hallways in the club house smelled like old moth balls.

Also during check-in is when they try to pitch the time share breakfast. My husband and I have been to A LOT of timeshare presentations in Mexico and they offer tons of great stuff, including free spa, hundreds off your bill and discounted excursions. This place offers a lousy $40 per couple!! That would pay for just a couple drinks!! Personally, we did not find it worth it at all and simply told them we were not interested. She then said, ok I will give you $60 to go... again we did not find it worth it especially we weren't planning on spending much time at the resort. Don't plan on getting discounted disney/universal tickets through the timeshare presentation... however, we did get Universal/disney tickets from those shady looking booths along the highway that say \"discounted tickets.\" You do have to do a timeshare presentation through Westgate, it was just fine, lasted 2 hours one morning and we received half-price 2-park universal tickets. Golf: my husband golfed and he suggests not booking through the resort. Book through wholesale webites (teetimesusa). He met some owners while golfing and even they had to pay more to golf than my husband did through the website. The Reserve was below average- the grass was more brown than green. Legends is a decent course if you get it at the right price-the bar there also had decent food. Neither course is worth paying retail price for. Room: do not stay in the west village!! Any other village would be better. We stayed in the west and the rooms were below average hotel rooms with a stinky hallways!! The beds were okay, however the worst part about our whole experience was that they only gave us 3 towels and they expect you to use those the whole week! After long days at disney, we would come home and have to call for fresh towels everyday--and they would only bring 2 at a time!! Also, they weren't planning on cleaning the room for the whole week either, until I called and they offered to clean it once! Not very good service at all! The property: We would recommend this property for families with young kids/.pre-teens because the pools did look nice with lots of activities. It is a cashless resort. No spa. It was apprx. 10 min away from Disney which was nice and their are no tolls between the resort and disney. The shuttle to disney from the resort costs $16 per person!!! Disney charges $14 per car. THe resort had potential to be very nice (the pics on the internet look very nice) however, they need to update the rooms, and provide much better guest service!

Cons: NO breakfast (certainly not a continental breakfast as promised at check-in). Only coffee and small sugar donuts and muffins. Presentation: Very high pressure by \"nice, friendly\" associates. I'm basically reconfirming what others have said ...presentation NEVER lasts only 60 minutes no matter how many times you say \"NO\". We had to see four different sales people for probably eight different offers (units available for use every year as well as every other year) from approximately $6,000 to $30,000. They start offer with highest price/points and progressively move lower (making it appear that each deal is \"better\"). As previously noted by others, this is a points system timeshare. So if you're really interested in purchasing, try to get the highest points for the lowest price possible What totally upset me .... this is not an \"exclusive\" resort as stated in the presentation. Anyone can return to this resort by reserving units through \"Holiday Inn\" .... rates at approximately $150 night for one bedroom, $180 night for two bedroom and $230 night for three bedroom. For about $1,500 for a week you could stay at Orange Lake for a number of years without having the ownership obligation of taxes and annual maintenance fees. (Although it sounds nice, forget about the promises of \"fixed cost\" vacations for your grandchildren.) In our presentation, it was stated we could purchae extra points form $20 per 1,000 points; yet a previous review indicated they had an offer to purchase 1,000 points for only $10. I guess everything is negotiable at Orange Lake. My basic caution to the uninformed .... timeshares are NOT a real estate investment. They depreciate faster than a new car ..... meaning they don't have much value in the resale market.. Also, while the initlal sales price is fixed, annual maintenance fees generally increase each year .

Very beautiful grounds. Friendly staff. When we checked in at 1:00 pm, it took about 1/2 hour, but we were able to check in early which was good. We had reserved two rooms (there were seven in our family). For the first room, we were upgraded to a suite. We were so excited. Then we were asked, \"Do you want to take a tour of the property\". We thought sure, that way we will know where the pools and different things are (since they are all spread out - you couldn't walk to them. You would have to drive or take the shuttle that comes once every half hour) When the first room was asssigned to our upgraded suite, and we had now agreed to the tour (which turned out to be the timeshare presentation), there was not a second suite for the other room - and we would have been seperated by a 10 minute drive!!! I was furious! We were given an upgrade for one, but not the other, and therefore we given nothing!! Being a family - we were planning on eating breakfast and dinners together; we had one vehicle, and did not want to be on different sides of the hotel! A few rooms down the hall or something would of been one thing! The timeshare the next morning was a complete waste of time. The man was very friendly, but we are from Canada and had no intention on buying into the timeshare. We were told we would be having breakfast there. Our appointment was for 9:30 am. Breakfast consisted of sugar donuts & muffins. The \"tour\" we received was a tour of the room we could of had - if we were upgraded..... but we didn't. And they really play on your heartstrings too - just think - you are investing in your grandchildren's future. The timeshare also works on a POINTS system. So you need enough points to book for a specific week during a certain month - it was pretty confusing. The price started at $40,000 and then went down to $7,500 and we could visit every two years. Crazy! By the time we said NO to the timeshare to four different people and about 4 hours later....... we could finally start our day, and headed to the pool. The pools were really great. The lazy river was freezing and not worth the $8 we paid for the tubes to go around once, freeze, and have water poured all over our head under every bridge. Our youngest, who was 4, was using a floating tube that we purchased at their gift shop to help her swim, and she was told she couldn't used it in that pool! So we didn;t go back to the lazy river pool. The one at the main hotel was warmer & better anyways. The hotel is very close to shopping & dinning & Disney. We did have a really fun time. My husband & brother-in-law went golfing & loved it. And it actually was not that expensive!!! ** NOTE: The DO NOT ACCEPT CASH ON PROPERTY! We did not know this. Everything is billed to your room. You can then go to the lobby and pay each night or at the end of your stay, but if you just want an ice cream, a drink or a postcard - it must go on to your room number! Plus there is a $9 a night charge. Which we also did not know when we originally booked. We would consider going back to this hotel since it was really close to things and the pools were good, but we would never invest in a timeshare or stay for longer than a week.

It was for the purpose of visiting Disney and experiencing a good resort on the off days. The pool, lazy river, mini putt and golf courses were all very cool. Not much is free and nothing is cheap. The pool and towels are free, tubes, mini putt are not. The children did not tire of the pool and mini golf. We used these for the 2-3 days of downtime. None of the water in the pools is deep so it might not satisfy our older children (left them home). The room was very nice and clean. There too they don't give you anything. In each room most bathrooms had only one roll of TP per bathroom. one roll of paper towel, three boxes of laundry detergent, no dish liquid or cloths for doing dishes. There is a dishwasher but only a few complimentary packets were provided. The timeshare sales pitch, I put them off at the desk but he \"Mike\" at the registration desk insisted that it is at 7:45 and 61 minutes you are out of there. With pressure from the others we were staying with to get some deals we relented and agreed to hear the pitch. They charged your credit card $30, refundable if you show up. We arrived at 7:45, waited in line to get processed and waited in a side room for an agent to come and get us. Now it was 8:20 ish. Some difficulty registering one of our couples they said. We told the agent we were gone at 8:46 as promised by Mike. That sent things into a whirlwind. The agent (very nice-one would say sweet) said the presentation would take 90 minutes. We said thanks but no thanks and give us back our money. The manager said we would be on the road at 9:10. It was now 8:40. We agreed to stick it out to get the deals. The agent gave us an express run through the pitch then walked us out. I am looking at my watch, it is about 9:15. Not bad....except she was walking us to a demo condo to continue the pitch. Now I got angry. She took us back into the pressure pit. Her next manager came out but in 30 seconds he knew to escalate this. The next manager came out, 30-60 seconds later they are going to get the 'guy ' who gives you the vouchers to get the deals. You travel to the desk and then you have to decide what deals to take right now because you can't come back to get the same deals later. I tell you all this that you can decide for yourself. Don't bring your kids with you because the daycare is a little playground that they have to use for the 90 minutes your gone to somewhere else in this big resort. In the east village you are next to some pretty nasty smelling stuff. It varies in intensity. Sometimes we didn't smell it at all. Two nights we couldn't open our windows and walking to your car in the morning you didn't feel like breathing-had to though, too far to make it. While golfing we could hear the Animal Kingdom Safari P.A.'s on one or two holes. The smell on some holes almost brought you to your knees. It affected my golf score! Just another excuse. The resort says the smell is Animal Kingdom but while in the Kingdom you never smell it. I am not sure it isn't the marsh all around or the dead fish that the vultures eat and leave around the golf course. Who knows? If you want ,google Orange Lake County stench and see what comes up. The little 9 hole course you can golf at night for $35-40 including rentals and a few golf balls, (tees are complimentary) and your children can golf with you for free. That was nice. The ball rolls a long way on that kind of grass that is all brown. The greens were better though. Oh! The online internet access is free in your room!!!

Our mistake. For an hour, we listened to a sales person repeat himself about what made this resort \"exclusive\" (nothing). What made their offer to me \"exclusive\" (again, nothing). After having been given that soft sell, we were introduced to the salesperson's manager. We began the discussion by resolutely explaining that we did not want to purchase a unit. He responded be being condescending, pushy and manipulative. After being told for the umpteenth time that we were not interested, the manager left in a huff and a puff. Then, someone from \"corporate\" came to \"interview\" us before we left. Guess what? Another pitch, another rejection, another pitch, another rejection. Finally, someone from \"marketing\" (isn't that what we had just been through?) came by. He asked a couple of questions that were, of course, designed to open the sell up again. No way, now how....

We are Floridians and have spent many vacations at similar Orlando resorts with non-stop (and mostly free) games, shows, contests, music, etc. Most of the activities at Orange Lake are either cancelled this week or cancelled indefinitely. No comedy night, no polynesian review, no iron chef competetion, adult game night cancelled, the pool games were cancelled yesterday . The river island pool area is beautiful but they have closed down the lazy river the last two days in the middle of the afternoon for a one hour cleaning! It took me 1/2 hour to find one vacant pool chair to sit in and then an hour later they announced the pool would be closing. Also, almost all of the activities, tubes, perks, etc. cost extra, and it is very difficult to get information about anything. My husband and I each called several times about various events and no one answers the activity phone. Shopping is close, which is good because they only provide two rolls of toilet paper per bathroom for the week. There is a Publix down the street with similar prices to our Publix at home. All in all, realize that this is a very spread out resort, and probably fine if you are doing the parks every day and need a spacious place to sleep. I wouldn't recommend as a destination resort if you plan to spend most of your time here.

They are very sneaky when you check into this property. The lady that checked us in outright lied in front of my 2 teenage daughters. She said oh, they just take you in a room with large interactive TV's and show you all the other properties, of course they will try to sell to you, but no high pressure sales at all. She also said that 90% of their guests are through RCI (I'll get to this later). She said that with 4 of us tube rental would be $8.00 each plus tax each day we rent, if we attended just a short 60 minutes and view the interactive TV's we'd receive complimentary tubes our entire stay. We kept saying no, but finally caved. Oh, by the way, they charge YOU $30.00 to go, but when you show up they reimburse you. I talked to one lady waiting for the sharks and they were offered free tubes and mini golf, they had to pay $60.00 to go and were never told they'd get their money back, after talking to us, she said she would be getting her money back. We set it up for the next morning at 8:00 to get it out of the way and let the girls sleep in. I also confirmed with her that after 60 minutes we can get up and leave and still receive our gift and she said yes, if the 60 minutes are up and you want to leave you can. We were unfortunate to get stuck with Ron Moore, who right off the bat told us he normally only sells to \"owners that want to buy more weeks\", so I guess we were to feel honored to have him????? That should have been our first clue to RUN and RUN FAST. He took us to look at a 3 bedroom unit (which we were already staying in). I made the comment that we were Hilton Grand Vacation owners and found the furnishings, countertops, appilances, etc,. to be well below the quality of HGVC, he didn't like that comment. We then went back for his sales pitch. We explained we were not ready to buy and were happy with the HGVC. My husband very politely told Ron we're done, don't want to buy and we're leaving. He did not take kindly to that. He looked at the front of our sheet and said I see you're doing this to get free tubes, is that the only reason... well dah, hello, of course it's the only reason. He said next time you go on a trip and are offered something free to attend the presentation to not do it, for it's a waste of his/their time!!! Could NOT believe what he had just said, they went on to send out 3 more people to close the deal. We started at $35,000 for an older unit and by the time the last one got done we were down to $75.00 for 6 or 8 weeks of usage - what a joke. We also mentioned we were not happy that the front desk girl lied and told us it was all in a large room with interactive TV's. We also questioned if they are selling the units fastest than they can build, why would 90% of the occupancy be RCI? Ron told us the girl didn't know what she was talking about. Anyway, we got out of there in 90 minutes - totally disgusted. Ok, on to the unit. Great size and layout, one thing I didn't care for was room with children in it had a window facing the main walk (anyone could look in or break in). Appliances are very cheap, furnishings were so-so, all of our sheets had small holes in them. Still have the old TV, no flat screens to be found. They had \"want to be surround sound\" in the living room. You would get a channel on, sound would come on for a split second and go away. Talk about thin walls and poor structure. We could actually hear the people above us drop a bar of soap in the shower. They had small kids that were constantly, until midnight, running around. We had to call every night to complain and NOTHING WAS DONE. Did not feel to secure in the building we were in, poorly lit parking lots and did not see one security vehicle patroling while we were there. The grounds were beautiful, the lazy river ok, but you certainly do not need to rent a tube. The kids had more fun floating, walking it then using their tubes. Also, they take away tubes at 7:00 p.m. but it stays open until 10. What's with that? By the time we got back from the parks, we could not get our \"free tubes\". So our 90 minutes of pain and suffering was worthless for we only \"rented\" tubes one day. Would never stay at this property again nor would I recommend to anyone. Again, poor quality and very large, you do need a vehicle to get around. Also, shop at the Target Super Store if you decide to go. Publix right by the place is actually owned by them and prices are SKY HIGH and it's very run down and dirty. Bottom line, go somewhere else!

I took this mini 4-day vacation as a break and to maintain platinum status on both Priority Club and US Airways. I chose this place due to its very reasonable rate $85 for a 2-bedroom villa and very generous Priority Club bonus points which easily put me over the top for maintaining Platinum status. The resort is a gated community. The guard at the main (west) entrance did not have a list of people checking in, so when I came in, I had to get out of my car and get my reservation information out of my luggage in the trunk before the guard let me into the check-in area. I came in after 11 PM, so I was the only person checking in at the time. It turns out that my unit was several miles (literally) from the check-in building. Even with a map, it was very difficult to find, because there are no signs directing guests to the units. When I was in the general area, I actually found a maintenance van, and asked the guy how to find my unit. He said he didn't know how to find my unit because he'd \"only worked there a few months.\" This gives you an idea about the size of the place and the difficulty of finding units at night. I found my place eventually, and it wasn't what I thought of as a villa, but rather it was a condo on the third floor of a huge, Stalinist, six-story building. The unit was quite beautiful, with the advertised 2 bedrooms, a full kitchen, 2 bathrooms including a jetted full-sized bathtub in the master bathroom, and a porch fully enclosed with mosquito netting. The wireless internet was difficult to connect with, but I was able to connect fine after a long phone call with my tech-savvy domestic partner in California. I could not get the DVD to work. The TV's were old-style, neither flat-screen nor HD, but ample in quantity (three!). Although the units weren't all occupied, my unit was very quiet, and I easily slept without earplugs. The only problem was a lawn-mower which ran under my unit at 7 AM, so despite the good insulation, I ended up having to put in earplugs anyways. The complex has a wide variety of activities to keep guests occupied, but if one wants to go out, it's a ways to most places. The closest, of course, is Disney World, but just to get to the nearest (east, in my case) entrance was 4 miles. It doesn't sound like much, but the speed limit in the complex is 23 MPH, and one can get stuck behind the shuttle vans, which I clocked at 19 MPH, and they have signs saying \"Do not pass.\" Count on at least 15 minutes to get to the nearest Disney World park (Animal Kingdom), 30 minutes to Seaworld, and at least 40 minutes to the Universal complex (even further to downtown Orlando). If you want the red light on your telephone to be able to tell whether someone's called you, you will need to clear it of the daily messages automatically left on, which are 60 seconds in length, plus go through 3 voice-mail menus just to delete the message. Since I arrived with 3 or 4 of these daily messages, it was quite a time-burner to get those messages off. Once you get your unit, you're on your own. Although their literature claims there will be weekly housekeeping, once you get your unit, you are told you have to stay over 10 days to get any housekeeping (not that it affected me). The early 9 AM check-out time didn't seem to be early enough for the housekeepers. They came in at 8:20 AM as I came out of the shower. Check-out was difficult. Since it was several miles, an almost 10 minute drive, from my unit to the registration area, I tried to check out through the TV, but they don't have that set up. I then tried to check-out by phone. After 3 voice-mail menus, I was put on hold for 5 minutes, only to be put onto two other voice-mail menus, then on hold for another minute. After that, I was connected to an answering machine. I gave them my name and room number, and asked that they e-mail me my bill. They never did, nor was the bill available on the Priority Club website, which it usually is. I finally called them directly again, to which they said they wouldn't e-mail a bill, but would snail-mail it, and, a week later, I'm still waiting. Despite the size of the resort, there is no evening entertainment. The latest entertainment is the Tradewinds Bar, which starts closing down around 10:45 PM. I didn't eat at any of the restaurants, but did look at the menus, and the prices seemed reasonable. I found the bar prices at the Tradewinds Bar also reasonable for a resort. So these are nice units, but one has to be aware that this is not a hotel. You get your keys and you're on your own. I can't say I didn't get my money's worth, but they definitely did a good job of convincing me not to get a time-share unit here.

We stayed on the 4th floor of a building located in the East Village. I had requested to be on the top floor (6th) and near a pool (sort of) but at least they put us in a building where we had a great view of fireworks every night! Traveling with me were my 3 kids (4,2 and 4 mos), my husband and my mother-in-law. We had a 2BR unit. Prior to coming, I had heard of Orange Lake before and was really excited to find out we got it through an exchange. It was every bit like we had imagined, a fabulous resort with a lot to do right on site - you never have to leave. If you look at my history, my family has stayed in many properties all over Kissimmee and Orlando - so we have been to quite a few different resorts. My favourite thing about this resort is all the different amenities it has to offer: a nice beach, many pools, a few different arcades, River Island and how close the Publix and Target was (practically on site). The only thing I didn't like about the resort (which really is not a huge dislike) is the size of the resort, you really do need to drive from one place to another (fine for us since we rented a car) but it does lose the small resort charm where you get to know other families, the workers etc. My biggest surprise was that the timeshare presentation was pretty painless and no, they did not hound us to attend it all week. They called once the second day we arrived and we accepted. The kids enjoyed the snacks they offered and they gave us a quick guided tour of the River island area. After 2 hours, we walked away with $70 cash. We thought it was worth it. I don't think i have ever given a resort 5/5 but I have to say that Orange Lake was a lot of fun and I would definitely go back. Oh ya, I just remembered one strange negative and that is the smell of manure or fertilizer at different times in the air. Why they would use a stinky fertilizer like that (and the odour can really get unbearable at times - especially in the evening) is beyond me. No, the smell is not coming from Animal Kingdom as rumour has it!! Anytime something broke down, even late into the evening (ie our washer) someone came within the hour to fix it. For a resort their size, i have to say I was extremely pleased with the service. When we checked in they had people making balloon animals and handing out popcorn to the kids. We only stayed a week but we were definitely sad to go. We could have easily spent another week at Orange Lake. Hopefully we will have the opportunity to return in the near future. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. With the 3 kids, it is tough to type long detailed reviews like I used to. if you have booked at Orange Lake, trust me, you will not be disappointed.

My wife and I stayed here for two days during our honeymoon. We searched all over the internet for a nicer upscale place to stay close to Disney. We chose this place off of tripadvisor and also the great discount they gave us (300 for two nights for the biggest nicest \"villa\" they had at the north village--which has the lazy river attached to the complex). The first thing you must note is that they put a 250 dollar \"hold\" on your credit card for a security deposit that was not listed on the website. When we arrived at the hotel everyone was very friendly and eager to help out in any way. The room we stayed in was awesome! But if you have children make sure you get one with a tub all we had was a shower stall. It had a stackable washer/dryer combo whcih was very handy. The pool area was very nice and clean also. Second note if you want rafts you have to pay for them(actually rent them for 7 dollars plus tax) which I thought was ridicoulus since you have to pay 7.95 a day just to use the \"facilities\" they have on the complex. (hence my title you have to watch what you pay for cause you could end up spending more than you want to). On that note the whole complex is \"cash free\" which means you have to use a valid credit card or easier your room key to charge things. If you use your room key things could add up fast without realizing that you spent that much. Also things on the complex are a little overpriced for what they are. 9 dollars for a mixed drink?? 20 dollars for a dinner?? My advice if you are staying longer than 3 or 4 days go to the Publix (local grocery store) and buy groceries and snacks for the family and use the full kitchens they have in the rooms (which we saw a couple of families doing while we were there).

Since we were in Florida specifically to see Disney, we didn't use any of the amenities - but I wanted to provide some information on the resort and rooms. 1. When driving in, make sure you use the West Village entrance. If you are coming from I-4 or the airport, it is the 2nd entrance on 192. If you use the East Village Entrance, turn around and go down 192 1/8 of a mile. We wish the guard told us this, instead he made us cut through the resort, which gave us the scenic tour and felt like a 'forever drive' - not a great first impression after traveling all morning. 2. Check-In - I read all the reviews about the horror stories of the check-in process. So when checking in, I had my guard up. I basically went to the desk with a mission, get the keys and go. I may of come across cold and possibly rude to the lady behind the desk, but whenever she asked a question I said: 'No Thank You'. It also helped that I left my husband and sleeping daughter in the car. When asked about discounts 'No Thank You', when asked about our plans 'Not Interested' - worked like a charm. I was done with the check-in in less than 10 minutes 3. Room - the room was surprisingly spacious. We were on an exchange, so we are only familiar with the Wyndham Cypress Palms, Star Island (in Orlando). The decor / out datedness of the rooms are similar. However it did seem very spacious. We did have a couple of comments on the 2 bedroom villa: A - we had a bottom floor unit, which was great especially when our daughter fell asleep in the car - very easy transfer B - Washer / Dryer: full size - not your standard stackable unit found in many timeshares C - 2nd bedroom had 2 full size beds and own bath. However the bathroom had a small shower only. Which means if you travel with friends and they have a child who only takes baths - they need to use the 'tub' in the master bathroom. D - Towels are 'hard' - needs to be run through some fabric softener E - Didn't have a good starter pack - ie: we didn't go to the grocery store until the 2nd day, hoping we can just make coffee with the starter pack. Even the coffee maker was a 12 cup, the starter pack only included enough coffee for 4 cups. Dishwasher soap, only 3 were included. Which means you are forced to buy more (which you end up leaving, hopefully for good use from someone else) when you are there. The same with laundry detergent, etc. Sink - no sponge is included / makes it very hard to wash pots and pans, etc ... If you stay there and cook within the unit - bring some staples or be prepared to purchase the staples F- We didn't use the on-site grocery store. There is a Publix and Target right before the East Village entrance G - we didn't use the pools (I thought it was too cold in FL) however I did call and find out they did not have an indoor pool throughout the entire resort. They did say the pool was heated at 84 degrees (however I didn't test this out) H - Patio - our room has a screened in patio. This overlooked the golf course. It was very cosy and inviting. I - Wi-Fi: we got great wi-fi within our rooms. This worked well with our laptops and our IPhones. The speed was better than what we have seen at other timeshares. We were even able to connect to our sling box at home and watch movies in the evening at reasonable speeds 4. Attractions - The resort is very close to Disney. It took us around 10 minutes to get to most parks. This was very convenient All in all, I would recommend the resort to a family. Having a full kitchen and washer/dryer is helpful when you have young kids.

I wanted a good size unit with a kitchen to cut costs. We got exactly that. We booked straight through the Holiday Inn website. The rate was less than $100 per day for a one bedroom. My 10 year old loved the pool with the lazy river and water slides. The DJ was a lot of fun and kept us busy with resort games when we needed a break from the water. We also used the miniature golf which was fun. The food at the two restuants we tried was average at best, but convenient and not nearly as expsensive a similarly average food at Disney resorts. The sunset party at the lake pool is a lot of fun with a fire juggler, live band and fun activites. The staff had even set up a haunted house during the week leading up to Halloween. The downside -- I called four times over three days to get a light bulb. The alarm clock also didn't work, but I didn't even try to get help with that. The onsite ticket sales are not worth the hassel. At check-in, I had to argue with the onsite Disney representative about what tickets I wanted to buy. She was clearly being compensated for selling something I wasn't buying and after traveling all day, I wasn't in the mood to argue. Then we went to the Kennedy Space Center. I was sold \"tickets\" in the lobby when I stopped to ask directions to the highway. I figured buying tickets at the hotel would save time at the attraction. But, was I was actually sold was a VOUCHER. This voucher required that we stand in an extra-long line for tour groups and other complex transactions. We found other equally annoyed Orange Lake guests in that line with us. We all thought we had tickets and didn't appreciate the 30 minute line to redeem teh vouchers. If you stay away from the onsite ticket sales, the resort has tons to offer and the staff was actually fun.

She called house keeping asked what was available and got us a room in West Village immediately. The Room-- (the good) Clean comfortable and had everything you could need for your vacation. West Village is the original buildings that were recently refurbished so there were little things like the sliding door in the living room didn't open but that was minor. Internet, hot water worked the whole trip. the beds were fine. Not luxury but fine. (the snarky) My one complaint is that OL eliminated the mid week tidy. So bring/buy extra paper towels, toilet paper, dish washing detergent, (the good) First day the herons were dam near up to the patio as I was having my morning coffee. (the bad) Every night when we returned to the room these little frogs covered the door. Once a frog one was right on the door knob. The Facilities-- The resort is huge but we were close to West Village and shuttle buses ran around. Pools were beautiful. We went to the west village and river island. Lazy river was fun. We didn't do use of the water slides. There were plenty of lounge chairs. Tubes are available for rent. We ate at the pool side grill in river island. The food was good and reasonable priced. (snarky) We used the vouchers from the time share presentation--NO CHANGE IS GIVEN SO SPEND IT ALL. Don't golf but I saw people doing it right outside the bed room. (bad) Must be mating season because these flys were every where. Two flies attached on everything. Landing on you if the felt like it. Not moving when you shoo them away.

We were not able to stay in the new part of the resort, however, you can access any part at any time. Unfortunately, weather was not on our side and we were not able to use all of the ammenities but there was a alot to offer. There is so much to do at the resort, it is diffcult to decide what to do especially if you are doing other Orlando activities during your trip. The positives: Super Target and several restarants are across the street. Our two bedroom Condo was awesome and perfect for small children. Great lazy river and amenities at the resort. WORD OF ADVICE - The resort is right in front of the back entrance to Disney and we did not discover this until the end of the week. If you hope on the toll road right outside of the entrance, you will be at the front of one of the parks in 5 minutes or less. It is amazing how close it is. Negatives - really do need your own car to save time when visiting this resort.

The gift shop prices were good, too, and there was a small grocery area with lots of selections.

The River Island pool complex is one of the nicest pool areas I have ever seen at a resort- but the pools at all of the other villages were also nice. Our 1 year old enjoyed Splash Lagoon in the North Village as well as the \"beachlike\" areas in River Island. I cannot say anything negative about the service, accomodations, or activites at Orange Lake. Everything was great- especially our first meal at the River Island Grilling Company. Second meal wasn't as good. Don't sit outside if the bartender is the only server or your service will be too slow. The clam chowder at this restaurant was very good.

But all we got was a week's worth of tube rentals for the lazy river and a coupon book. And that just wasn't worth it- especially since the presentation lasted about 2 hours and \"breakfast\" was just crummy donuts. Skip the presentation, stay in River Island, and I can't imagine that you would have much to complain about. Thanks for a great vacation, Orange Lake.

We had free wireless internet in our room that was very fast. The only problem with the room was the sliding glass doors were broken and a pipe under the sink was leaking. We called maintenance and a very friendly man named Ed was here first thing in the morning and fixed all the problems within 15 minutes. It is just a couple miles away from all the Disney parks.

It was a bit confusing to know where to go when we arrived at the Guard gate, but the security was friendly and directed us to the West Village entrance. When we arrived at the Check-In there were staff members to greet my family and I. My children, both 5 and under, were welcomed with popcorn, drinks, and balloons. Check-in took about 30 minutes as the employee informed us how we could receive complimentary breakfast for attending a quick informational session on the resort. We would also enticed to take the tour for a free all day pool side cabana rental and two free raft rentals for the lazy river. Having read the reviews prior to our stay and knowing we had no interest in purchasing a time share, we declined. The staff member was not pushy at all and we never received another ask for us to take the tour. We stayed in the East Village at a Two-Bedroom Villa. The room was not read until 4pm, and even though we arrived at 2:30pm we were told not to enter the room until 4pm. However, I did notice on the Room Attendant sheet in our villa that the room was ready at 1:45pm. The Villa was so nice, I would not believe that we were able to book such an amazing room for so cheap. It was clean, cozy and spacious. Our room had a kitchen, stove, microwave, blender, and all of the things you would need to cook a nice meal. We also had a welcome pack with dishwashing detergent, soap, laundry detergent, salt & pepper, sugar, coffee, and lots more. The only thing I would bring if you are staying at the villa is a sponge or dish cloth to wash your dishes. We had a DVD player to watch movies at night and there was a TV in each bedroom as well. We were even able to wash our laundry in the washer and dryer in the villa so there was not a pile of dirty clothes to bring home. The East Village pool was right next to our villa. At night you could even see the Disney fireworks from the balcony in our villa. It was awesome. On our second day we went to the River Island. If you wish to float down the lazy river on a raft you have to rent one for about $10.75 for a two person raft for one day. You are not allowed to use other rafts on the lazy river. River Island was awesome with all sorts of things to do, I felt like we were at a water park. There is a giant inflatable Hippo slide that costs $3 per slide, $9 for an hour, or $15 for the day. There were so many things to do. There is even a Starbucks right near the pool! There was an arcade, putt- putt golf, and so much more. It was so relaxing and the zero entry pool was great for kids that are still learning how to swim. I am definitely going to return to this resort and if I had the money, I would most definitely buy a timeshare here. I don't think I will ever stay at a regular hotel again when you could stay at the Orange Lake Resort. We were able to cut costs by cooking pizza and making our own lunch in the room. There are excellent restaurants within the Resort or you can drive just outside of the gate to Publix, Super Target, Outback, Olive Garden, Carrabbas, etc. I can\u2019t wait to go back!

That area is equipped with a new restaurant, bar and is surroundd by new cabana's. This area is also adjacent to another, seperate pool called the \"stage pool\" which is small but nice and quiet. Also in the West Village you have tennis courts and basketball courts that are located right outside most of the villas. You also have the lake right there which has jet ski-ing, kayaking, paddle boats and other water activities in the lake. You can also rent fishing poles and go fishing when you like. In another village (north?) is Spalsh Lagoon. It has a pool that is constructed very well and has a basketball hoop and volleyball net located inside of it. It also has a cool water slide that is perfect for kids as well as it has a nice quiet area for adults to relax in that was not crowded at all. It also has a \"kiddie pool\" for younger chldren. It is my favorite pool in the resort. River Island is good too, although it can be very crowded. The lazy river is fun and pretty neat just to chill in if you have a tube. If not, you can float or swim through and it is not that bad either. I HIGHLY reccomend getting a cabana as it is worth whatever you will pay, even if it is for one day. We did two days in the cabana at Water's Edge in the WV and both times it was great. TV, phone, internet, drinks and small snacks await you when you arrive as well as a couch, table and two arm chairs. Very relaxing.As with anything there are some things that could be better. Paying 7 bucks for tubes at River Island is a little much. I understand that probably has t be SOME fee, but 7 bucks is a lot, especially if someone has more than 1 kid. Some things tend to close pretty early, like the basketball courts and the tennis courts. Lights on at like 11pm, which if you are out with family all day, it is nice to play a little ball without the sun at night. The restaurants are alright,-River Island restaurant is very good and I would suggest getting the brownie sundae or the bananna foster for dessert. Plenty of restaurants outside the resort as well as the resort is close to everything, including Disney World, Universal and all the parks. Overall, this is a solid family vacation.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ajax, ON", "Title": "\u201cCan't Wait to Go Back\u201d", "Author": "triathleteman", "ReviewID": "UR36368368", "Content": "I was a little concerned after reading some of the comments regarding this property.....We had no problems whatsoever. Check in does take 15min per group if on RCI...this is because they pitch the sales seminar...we just said sure no prob, gave them the $20, and where whisked through. We didn't show up for the seminar, so $20 saved us the hassle at the desk, and the sales seminar. $20 well spent.

EVERYONE else we met was extremely nice, helpful, and we really enjoyed ourselves. The only time we were asked if we were guests or owners is at minigolf, because the price differs. Now on to the critique of the amenities. We stayed in North Village, right at the pool, really really nice. Our 4, almost 5 year old loved the pool and small slide. The lunch cafe is expensive, we didn't eat there though so we can't comment on quality. There is a height restriction on the slides in River Island. 48 inches. Our son was too small, kind of a bummer! We did eat at the restaurant overlooking the River Island, pricey, but good food!

I say this because it is VERY important to all staff at the resort to classify you so they can treat you accordingly.

Each time we had an interaction with an employee of this resort, we were treated rudely and curtly. If you can avoid dealing with anyone who works there, you may have an enjoyable stay. The room we were given had extensive mildew damage, as evidenced by the unfinished patching on the walls. We kept the AC on all the time so as to deter any mold/mildew growth while we were there. Our first day at the pool, which is why we selected this resort, we encountered two giant water bugs in the pool. If you google \"giant water bug\" you'll see what I'm talking about. They were nasty and made us paranoid the rest of our stay since they were easily 3\" in length with a head that had 2\" pinchers on it and they weren't afraid to use them. There was no way I was going to let my 6 year old daughter even near one of those things! Really, we were able to make the best of this trip, but were so thankful all along the way that we were not owners! How I feel for the people who actually are! Also, the activity schedule stated poolside games each day and they were nowhere to be found. They also have poolside DJ each day, but the music selection is restricted to the same 5 or 6 songs, so that gets pretty old after week. Please note that putt-putt golf is extra and is not included in the price of your villa. Save your money and stay at Marriott's Harbour Lake resort instead.

You will be called DAILY to sign up for a timeshare tour. This is a resort and not a hotel - you will be given one set of linens and a full washer/dryer to launder yourself. This place is HUGE and you cannot walk from place to place. You must have a rental car -it is 1200 acres! If you do not sign up for the timeshare they do not tell you the ins and outs of the place. They do not have early check in or outs. They will NOT give you the keys until 4:00 or after and they knock on your door at 8:30 on check out day to see if you are ready to leave. They give you a SMALL supply of toilet paper, paper towels, etc. and you will need to go to the grocey for the rest - which is right outside the entrance to the resort. If you buy a drink at one of the pools/bars, keep your cup as it is refillable for only a few dollars. We found this out on the last day after collecting cups all week! Also, all of their receipts have coupons printed on the bottom for the resort gift shops, etc. - they did not tell us this until I discovered it on the last day also! Very convenient location to all the parks, but we really missed the beach! They claim to have a beach but it is a small pond with some sand on it that knowone uses. Overall this is a very nice place, just a little strange being treated as a timeshare guest when you clearly arent. Pretty clean and spacious and VERY BUSY! Allow plenty of time to check in - it tool us over an hour since they are trying to talk you into timeshare and buying tickets to parks, etc. Oh, and buy your Disney tickets before you get there. The discount ticket places are a rip off - they are busted daily - and the state of Florida will not allow AAA or the resorts to sell discounted tickets. You can buy them at Disney.com or AAA before you arrive and save LOTS of money!", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat trip at Orange Lake\u201d", "Author": "ElissaRN", "ReviewID": "UR35529964", "Content": "As many others you can be wary when reading the reviews but we really loved our one week stay at this resort between July 10th-17th. Check in was a long process - they had 3 separate line up when you first entered, one for owners, one for RCI exchange and one for people who are just renting the units. The last one was only being looked after by one staff member but seemed to have the longest line up. When we check in - they made it sound mandatory that you attend their 'welcome meeting' and - BEWARE! - they tried to take a deposit from my credit card to ensure that I would go, which they said would be reinbursed with credit at the resort and a discount coupon book. This discount coupon book is in no way worth the 'deposit' that they try to take from your credit card. Now on to the better parts.... our 2 bedroom condo was located in the newly renovated West Village and was really nicely decorated, clean and brand new inside. We did have free WiFi in the room but at times it did not work. The kitchen is stocked with all the conviences of home along with a washer and dryer tucked behind a sliding door. Living room/dining area had a large dining table that sat 6 people; 2 couches in the living room - one being a queen pull out and a flat screen TV with a DVD player. There was also a large balcony (we were on the second floor) which had sliding doors both in the living room and master bedroom. Master bedroom had a comfy king-size bed and ensuite bathroom with a jacuzzi tub. The second bedroom had 2 queen beds and a doorway into the second bathroom. The grounds are definitely huge but well maintained and you will need to use a car to get around (my husband and I thought that they should rent out golf carts so people can get around - which would be better for the enviroment, instead of us needing to drive to the pool) There is a shuttle that takes you around the grounds that we did see often but never ending up taking. We mostly used the pool area in the north village \"Splash lagoon\" where they have a small pool that was only a foot deep which entertained our toddler for many hours. We did venture over to River island as well - the pool area is beautiful and the lazy river is so nice. The tubes cost $7 to use them for the day or they have double tubes that will run you $10. We did not eat at any of the resturants onsite so can not comment on them. (However we love the fact that there is an Olive Garden just across the street!) The distance to Disney is really close. You can actually see Animal Kingdom Lodge (where we usually stay when we go to disney - as we are DVC members) just off in the near distance when you are driving into the resort. In fact it pretty much takes us the same amount of time to drive to the parks when we actually stay at AKL compared to driving from Orange Lake. The really only downside was that we were not able to see and do everything the resort offers as it is so big. We will definitely be going back to this resort again but will probably spend a week at Orange Lake and then a few more days in a Disney resort, just so that we can enjoy more of what the resort has to offer (definitely checking out the golf courses next time) as well as enjoy Disney! All and all it was an excellent trip and I can't wait to go back!

My son broke a drinking glass during our stay and the charges were waived. We have stayed at Orange Lake Resort several times before and are really impressed by the improvements that have been made over the past few years. FInally internet connection is available from just about anywhere in the resort and not just in the new sections or near the club houses. The West Village Pool area has been completely redone and it is more inviting for families with small children since they converted the pool to a zero entry one, compared to the olympic style pool that was before. The depest part of the pool is only about four feet, so it is great for those families that have children who are still learning to swim. Our children are both good swimmers, so we had no worries at all. One afternoon we ate dinner at the new Breezes Restaurant and it was a good value for the money and the food was good. We tried all the pools, from the West Village, to Splash Lagoon (North Village) to RIver Island and we liked all of them, but our children specially liked River Island because of the Lazy River. The resort was not really crowded most of the week, I guess because for most children school had not yet finished, so we did not have any trouble finding sitting areas around the pools with umbrellas. I used the exercise room facilities at River Island and all the equipment is great, our children played at two of the three video games arcades and they had lots of fun. We ordered dinner one night from Paizanos, the inhouse italian eatery, when we had friends stay with us a couple of days, and the pizza, calzones, wings and pasta were very good. The burgers, hot dogs and chicken tenders sold by the pool areas were all nice adn so were the fries.. We did not eat at the RIver Island Grill during this stay, but we have before and the food has always been great, just a little higher price than the other places to eat in the resort. We visited two Disney Parks during our stay, Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios and had a blast, specially at Hollywood Studios because it was during Star Wars weekend, since we are all big fans.

Two hours for $40 in Orange Lake money plus a coupon book are well worth it. We had a miscommunication with our cleaning dates, but this was resolved to our satisfaction. We ate at the River Island Grilling Company restaurant, and the food was great. The portions were generous to the point that we enjoyed the rest the next day in our unit. (2 meals for the price of 1) The West Village pool renovation was top-notch. Enjoyed Breezes Express.

The lazy river is nice and the \"waterpark\" two slides and a pool connected to the lazy river was nice. Didnt dine at any of the restaurants on property. so cant speak to that. They offered at checkin to do the timeshare presentation offered $75 cash or $100 in restaurant credit on property and after saying I wasnt sure and had to check with the wife the offer went up to $100 cash or $120 restaurant credit. We didn't find the time to do the presentation so I can't speak to how hard sell they are but at the rate I paid a week is less than the matinence fee for the place annually. Paid the 8$/day resort junk fee up front and was hoping toget a room that my wife wouldnt have to walk as much and near a pool but was pre-assigned and told that we could only move to a unit with its porch facing a major road but the unit in the West Village while it didnt look that nice outside it really was nicely done inside. Actually she probably had to do less walking in the room we were assigned because you park right in front of the unit as opposed to having to navigate a building and you can park up close by the pools in each of the villages. Had to call for washcloths but that was jsut an oversite from housekeeping. Other than that it was a great place for a very reasonable rate.

Read poor reviews with caution.\u201d", "Author": "jeffcarp", "ReviewID": "UR31935261", "Content": "We are halfway through our stay at Orange Lake and really love it. I'd first like to address the negative reviews that you may find here. First and foremost, this is a timeshare. A timeshare doesn't have daily maid service. A timeshare doesn't replace your towels. A timeshare doesn't pick up after you. This is a timeshare - you do your own laundry, your own dishes and you are your own maid. If this isn't appealing to you, then you shouldn't stay at a timeshare. Informed travelers should immediately discount those negative reviews complaining about the fact that they couldn't get new towels. (Hint: use the washing machine). Second, the number of negative reviews about getting \"roped\" into a long timeshare presentation is stunning. DON'T GO. This, again, is a timeshare folks. Timeshare salesman have one goal - sell you a timeshare. It is amazing what some people will put themselves through for a free perk. No one has come to our unit, grabbed us by the arm and forced us into a van to attend a timeshare presentation. Don't go and it isn't a problem. There are several complaints about timeshare salesman calling the units early in the morning. The first thing I did when I checked into the unit was unplug the phone. Solved that problem. There are several other complaints about no Internet access. They don't advertise that you get Internet access, so that shouldn't be a surprise. What IS a surprise is that I am writing this review over the complex's free WIFI access from the clubhouse, which reaches my unit easily. It wasn't advertised that I'd get this but I am. Let's get one other thing out of the way. Yes, this place is HUGE. It is massive. It is (I've heard) the largest timeshare complex in the US. How people get here, see it is huge and then complain about it after the fact, I will never know. Know what you are getting into before you go. Whether the fact that it is huge is a problem or not depends. We are in the West Village, in the single story golf condos. We can walk, within 3 minutes, to the West clubhouse and all it has to offer - pools, mini golf, restaurants, arcade, ice cream, pizza place, etc. The fact that it is huge isn't a problem for us. If we were further away, we'd need to use the free shuttle service (think nice car rental style buses with air conditioning). The complex has everything - pools in each village. This week (first week of June), there were hundreds of chairs available at every pool all day long. No issues with finding a place to lounge by the pool. The condo was very nice - recently redone with new furnishings, appliance, paint, etc. Just a very roomy, very nice condo all around. As one of the largest timeshares in the US, I am sure there are condos that aren't so nice. Each condo has a refurb schedule and depending on where you are in the refurb schedule for the particular condo you get, you may have a different experience. I only know that our condo was great. The location is very good. It is close to Disney, right on highway 192. There is a brand new SuperTarget within 2 minutes. A Walgreens is right at the entrance of the West Complex. There is also a Publix grocery store. We will eagerly be back to this place.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "GA", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe the negative reviews!!!\u201d", "Author": "kaemap", "ReviewID": "UR31888473", "Content": "This resort was wonderful. Took the family and stayed at a 2 bd villa. The villa was big, clean, comfortable with everything you could want. Staff was excellent. Arrived at 5pm on a Sat. and check-in line and time was short. We did go on the \"tour\", only because we rec'd $100 cash. It did last 3 hrs as other mentioned, but if you want to cut it short, just say \"no, I am not employed at the moment\" and the tour will end there. We did have to get a little \"aggressive\" in saying no at the end (and to 4 people, bosses of bosses, etc) but we took it at the beginning of our stay (Sun morning) so it was ok and worth the extra $100 bucks to spend...in cash not credit at the resort. There is so much to do at the resort that we didn't have time to do it all because of the other sight seeing things we wanted to do, but if you just want to relax and stay there, it would be worth it. Plenty of grocery stores around, Super Target, Publix and a Wal Mart about 4 miles down the road. This resort is near everything. From our Villa which faced the galf course we could see the fireworks at night that they put on at Disney, at least the times we made it back to the resort before 9pm anyway. We had a light bulb that was burned out in the entry way when we got there...just called the front desk and went out to dinner. By the time we returned, the light was fixed. The have express check out, just call and leave your last name and condo address and time of departure and just drop your keys in the box on the way out...didn't even have to leave the car. The pools are great and there are plenty of them. There are fees for things, but some things especially events for the kids are free. The Laxy River doesn charge $7 per tube, but you can wade/swim in the river (pool really) and there were always disgarded tubes floating around if you wanted one. Drinks at the pools are pricey..at first...$8 adult and $6 kids (slussy things), but you get a glass that you can keep for the kids and get refills for $2.50 anytime at any pool, and for the adults you get a glass and coupons for refills for $2.50 anytime at any pool. We didn't eat on the resort, we were always out at dinner time, so can't comment on the food. The pools open at 7am so if you love a morning swim or quiet time sitting around the pools, there was hardly anyone there at that time. No, house keeping did not come in everyday to make our beds or clean our mess....but come on folks this is a resort, not a hotel. If you stay a week or more, you will have to buy more TP, laundry soap, coffee and filters, but no big deal. Beds were very comfortable and walls were very thick...could not hear neighbors at all.

We also got a follow up call to make sure we got what we needed. The cutest thing is we had ducks and flamingos coming right up to the window and looking right at us, like feed me, feed me. Check in was very fast and easy. The gal at the desk was very helpful with information and directions.

The person on the phone said it was not a sales presentation but just an update since my friend already had a timeshare. But when we got there it was a sales presentation. We quickly stated we did not want to participate. He apologized. After speaking with his mgr and after 20 minutes of waiting, we agreed to forfeit the offer and they quickly put us back on a shuttle back to the parking lot. That would be my only complaint. Other than that, the pools are beautiful and the whole property is fantastic. Good place for people of all ages and families as well. Nice to have the kitchen so for those who want to cook, can. We did a couple of times to save some $. Since it rained practically the whole time we were there, we didn't get to enjoy the pools as much as we liked. But at least we had a beautiful room to stay in since we stayed there more than anticipated. Did do Disney, Epcot, and Animal Kindom, between the rain. I recommend this resort to any one.

The unit was clean, nicely decorated, and very spacious. Flat screen TV in the living room, with DVD and free wireless internet.

It is a timeshare community, in which you do not get housekeeping during your stay unless you ask for it, and pay for it. The resort is beautiful with multiple pools and restaurants, although we spent most of our time off site at the theme parks and outlet malls. Disney is 5 minutes away via a $1 toll road, or a bit further if you do not want to pay the toll. Universal is about 20 minutes away. The only complaint that I have is the continuous phone calls throughout the day - one morning the phone rang 5 times before we left for the parks around 10am.

We flew in to Orlando, drove to Daytona for three nights, then drove back down to Orlando to stay at this resort for the last two nights of our vacation. After reading all of the negative reports about this resort, I actually tried to cancel my reservation. To my surprise, cancelation means no refund. My fault for not reading the fine print. Anyway, as we were warned, as soon as we checked in, (which didn't take as long as everyone else claimed,) we were asked to participate in a \"tour\" which of course, was a time share presentation. It began at 7:45am the following day and we were told that if we completed it, we would get $110 in free food and beverage from anywhere at the resort. We agreed. The tour wasn't bad.There were at least a hundred participants, yet somehow we all got our own host (Doug) who took us around individually and showed us their immaculate condos. INothing like the promotional room they had us staying in... but that's besides the point. Anyway, after the tour was over, the sales pitch kicked in. At first we were being polite and listening even though we were not at all interested in purchasing a time share. Then, after we said \"No\" for the 20th time, three more people had their turn at us in hopes to change our minds. It was all fine and dandy until they started throwing insults at us, saying things like, \"What? You can't even afford $175 a month? Why are you even on vacation if you can't afford $175 a month? That's when I told them that we were done and we wanted to leave. At this point, what was supposed to be a 90 minute tour had become a 3 hour lecture. But, we did end up getting our $110 and it was well worth it. There is a restaurant in the resort that I believe is called Riverview something or another and it has delicious food! I used the vouchers to get us a steak and lobster dinner with gator as an appitizer. Mmmm... It was great. The best part was the seating. We went around 9pm and we got to catch the movie in the pool. Yes, it sounds crazy but there is actually a huge movie screen that drops down so that you can sit in the pool and watch a movie! We didn't actually sit in the pool to eat our lobster, the deck out back of the restaurant overlooks that pool. It was absolutely beautiful! All in all, the service was great, all of the waitresses and hosts, and whoever all of those people who stand around in hotel lobbies, they were great too. The only downside is, as others have montioned, the pictures representing this hotel/resort are misleading. It was my belief that when I stayed here, like at any other hotel, the pools would be right out back. There are indeed quite a few pools at this place, yet I only saw two. It took us about 15-20 minutes to get from one side of the resort to the other and it's very easy to get lost. There is no way you can walk from pool to pool unless you are in need of exercise. There is, however, a bus that is always right out from that can take you wherever you want. I actually wish I would have stayed a few more days. It was plesant in the sense that everything you could ever want was right inside that little community. On the morning we were to leave I got up extra early and Iayed out by the pool and watched the morning pool exercise class. It looked like so much fun! To bad I'm 23 and not 63. I would have totally joined in! And one more thing. If you feel adventerous and want to leave the resort for a nice romantic dinner, go to the Colorado House of Beef. Corny name, great food. I got the snow crab and it was the greatest thing I have ever tasted! We were the only people in there, too. The place was dead so the service was great. All I can say is do it. Take the chance. Stay at this resort at a really cheap price and take the tour. It pretty much gives you your money right back to you. Just make sure you don't lie to the timeshare guy and let him believe you're interested when you're really not. It gives him false hope. JUST SAY NO! After he gives his speech of course.

Another great thing is down by the beach area you can get jet skis and such and the worker there, Jerry, was incredibly helpful and informative and made our jet ski experience even better. My only real complaint came the first morning at 8am when my husband and I awoke to the sound of construction outside our room and then 10 mins later came the obligatory phone call about the timeshare. The woman asked us if we would like a complimentary breakfast and to learn some more information so we could go back to tell our friends about it, and I told her the only thing I would be telling my friends at this point would be that on my vacation in which I was expecting to relax and sleep in, I was woken up at 8am by construction outside of my door. She never phoned again and the construction started much later the following 5 days. Also the view from our room was simply of some air conditioning units and another building, but really, we didn't spend that much time in our room, and when we did, the view was really a small detail compared to the nice decor inside and the convenience of having a stove and refrigerator to use. The location was within a couple of minutes of Disney and Seaworld and there is an abundance of restaurants, grocery and convenience stores within a few miles.

One of the best resorts I have stayed/exchanged through RCI. Yes it was BIG! As everyone has said.....I was worried about my trip after reading all the reviews but really I was pleasantly surprised. Yes we had to drive to the pools; my kids were a bit bugged about that but it really was only a short drive. Seriously......who would go to Orlando and not rent a car. My check in was easy and the ONLY negative about the trip was the push to \"pre-gift\" items, tell you about the great prices for the parks, tube rentals, but of course......you need to go to the TimeShare 1 hour meeting. I signed up for the tubes because I was under the impression you could only use the Lazy River by using a tube but after spending 5 minutes there I realized my family would be fine without a tube. I immediately went back for a refund, which was handled quickly and efficiently. On Friday and Saturday afternoons the workers \"threw\" the tubes into the Lazy River at 5:00 for anyone to use for the remainder of the evening so my kids were able to \"try\" the tubes but after 20 plus minutes they were done with the tubes and just swam as we did all week. (We sometimes stayed at the pool until 7:00 or 8:00pm.) I also was worried that we would not have poolside seating from some previous comments but we must have been there on an off week because there were so many chairs to choose from we had the pick of the crop even when arriving there at 10:30 am. Note....the slides are a blast at the Lazy River, nothing I have ever experienced and try walking against the current; great exercise!!! As far as the room, it was spacious for 7 (2 bedroom for 8), quiet location in the West End with everything in great working condition AND Free Internet Access in our room. We did not utilize the pool or restaurants in the West End but spent everyday at the Lazy River Pool, restaurants and shops. The drive was about 3-4 minutes from our unit. It is great that they have Starbucks, Burger/Hot Dog lunch area or their restaurant for lunch or dinner. Just do beware that with large parties at the restaurants on site they do add on a service charge (18% tip) to your bill so no extra tip is required. My kids met lots of friends, spent evenings in the Lazy River until closing, and we all felt very safe in the complex. This resort was so close to all the chain restaurants, Disney World, Universal, and shopping; it was a great central location for that Orlando experience. Overall we had a wonderful trip here and I am sorry that I can't exchange here again for another few years.

There was a different line that was quickly getting longer but was getting assisted much quicker than we were. I had probably been standing in line for longer than 20 minutes and had asked several employees if I was in the correct place. Eventually - after an exhausting wait - somebody from one of the check-in tables in the back offered to help me check-in. As soon as we got to the villa - it was not what I had been promised or told of over the phone. I had asked if the rooms were all on the ground level. It was important for me since we had kids and were there to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Which is one of the reasons why I booked at this resort. I wanted to change speak with someone regarding changing to ground level perhaps but after going through all that trouble - it was just exhausting to even think about doing it.

The villa in itsef was nice except that someone would expect to have more than just 1 packet of decaf coffee in the room or the option of regular coffee since we do not drink decaf. She also told us that the resort was completely smoke-free and smoking was not allowed even in the balconies/patio. Some of our friends and family declined to decline our invitation because of this. And then I found out that smoking is not allowed in the villa itself but is allowed on the patio's/balconies.

If it is a golf holiday you are looking for, know that there are MANY off site courses and there are many price points to choose from. Convenient grocery store, had reasonable meals on site and found the staff to be helpful. We will continue to use our week and bring family members that would not normally have the opportunity to stay in a resort type setting. We did attend an update with the timeshare personnel.

Even though it is said to be 'studio', bedroom is separated from living room area by door and bathroom area in between. Pullout sofa bed could be used as 2nd bed. Kitchen is quite small but sufficient for making small meal. (there are stove, refrigerator, sink (all of small/mid size) and cookware). However, they need to be re-arranged. For example, one pot with wrong lid, all different glass cups or dishes. There are two big screen LCD TVs (one in bedroom and the other in living room) with DVD-VCR combo. There is no laundry in our suite but we could use in shared laundry room located in hallway. We got a call next day after we checked in. We said not interested then never got bothered again. We usually left in the morning and came back in the evening. That might be why we could avoid sales pitch. For driving to WDW, we found taking 429 was quite better than 192 in terms of traffic. It is toll road but it should be worth. Much faster and no trouble about traffic. For grocery, just couple of minutes drive to publix (east of 429), approx 10 min westbound drive to walmart. And there are tons of restaurants on 192. There are some little downsides; in clubhouse studio unit, it is not easy to ventilate because living room's window cannot be opened.

Our truck was broken in to while parked on the resort in front of our unit.

We were headed to a breakfast reservation at Disney and were EXTREMELY UPSET to have to wait 30 minutes for someone to show up. We called several times during the 30 minutes and spoke to the Security Manager who didn't seem at all concerned that our vehicle was damaged on their property - he was very nonchalant and unsympathetic to our situation. We then wrote a report with the resort security and also reported it to the Orange County Sheriff's dept. We then talked to 2 people in Resort Services, who claimed the resort was secure and that no one could get in without security seeing them - although the bordor of the resort along Hwy 192 is not fenced in and has a golf fairway running the stretch of the border, that anyone could run across and be in the resort - guest services believed that it was impossible to believe that someone entered in this way. The guest services personnel suggested that they do not know the type of people that are guests at their resort and insinuated that any guest on the property was most likely the suspect in the break-in. I find it very unfortunate that the employees of this resort believe that the guests of their resort are criminals and bad people. Maybe they should change careers from hospitality to working at a county jail or state penitentiary. We also submitted some paperwork to the legal department of the resort. After 7 days I called resort services to see if there was a response. I was told that the legal dept had reviewed our information and had an answer in 2 days, however resort services was to call us with an answer and they claimed to not have our telephone number to call.

Our room was in East Village, clean, nice and had all amenities expected at a time share resort. Rooms are laid out almost exactly like we're used to at Wyndham. First time used dryer - there was a problem in the dryer that left dark brown streaks on our white/light clothes. Also the front door & back patio door would not close on their own - we had to basically slam them shut. Called maintenance in the morning, and they were there within the hour to fix both problems. We paid the $20 to do the \"45 minute breakfast and time share info.\" We did get our money back in cash after completing the meeting. Unfortunately breakfast was VERY disappointing. 2 types of muffin & 2 types of donut. Coffee, juice, & some bananas & apples. They say you pay $20 so they don't lose money if you back out. HA!

There were a lot of pools to choose from, which was nice. It also had several tennis and basketball courts, and had a few golf courses, though we didn't go golfing. Well, that's about all the positives. When we booked our mini vacation, we booked in the North Villiage - since we were told that it was the newest section of the resort. We told them we would not accept any other locations and they said it wouldn't be a problem. Well, once we went to check in, they said they gave our rooms away, and it took over an hour of fighting at the front desk to get our correct rooms. We booked two 2-bedroom villas. The villas themselves were pretty nice. Had a big master bedroom/bathroom and also a nice living room. Neither of the villas were perfect though. One had no water at all coming from any faucets and the other had a busted tv. There were also water stains all over the ceiling. They got the water turned on after one full day, but it never was right... really had no pressure at all. Also, the walls and ceiling are very thin, so anytime someone in the unit above us even walked around, it sounded like they were about to come through the roof.

Sure, going in their lazy river is free... but what is that? You want to actually use a tube on their lazy river... oh, that'll be $10 for the day please. Miniture golf is $9 a round, a 12oz steak at their resturant is $30, the ability to use the water slide at the pool is $100/person/week, the bar near the front pool doesn't have fountain drinks, so a bottle of water or a CAN of soda is $2.50, a little spray bottle of suntan lotion is $10... it goes on and on.

(Three herons walked up to our patio while we were having breakfast outside--I think that they would have walked inside if one of us had not been standing in the open doorway! ) The Golf Villas are all one and two stories. The one story one that we were in had lovely cathedral ceilings. The villas in the other villages have 2 to 7 floors and screened in balconies. I could not have been more delighted with our newly renovated golf villa: # 4247. I loved the sunny Caribbean style decor--the granite counters, the jetted tub in the king size master bedroom, and furniture--it was spacious, clean--and appeared very very unused! It was well-equipped with a dishwasher, microwave, full sized washer and dryer, safe, --and even Fiesta Ware dishes. The carpeting was new. The \"Starter Packet\" with paper towels, dish washer detergent, coffee, etc. was a great help. I expected the worse for the check in process--but perhaps because it was not a busy time or that we arrived later--around 5:30, there was barely any wait. At check in we were asked to see a time share presentation (only 1 hour), and I declined (thanks for the warning Trip Advisor writers!). I was told that someone would call me, and of course she did. But once I told her we were not interested , she accepted that and willingly listened to the concerns that I read on Trip Advisor, and answered my questions. She even told me where we could pick oranges!. As she promised, I was not called again about time share presentations. I was so impressed with the grounds and many pool areas--everything was clean (even the public bathrooms) and well maintained. Everyone was friendly and personable and went out of their way to be helpful. Also, thanks to other Trip Advisor commenters, I bought a $5.99 tube at Publix to use at the River Island Lazy River (fun!!) to save the rental fee. I would be hard put to find a fault with our vacation experience, with one exception : Although there are many areas throughout the resort that have wireless internet access, there is no access inside the villas. So if you really need to utilize some of your vacation time to do work, it is a real pain in the neck. And it would be nice not to have to pay for it! The other minor complaint was that the only info at check in (and in the unit) was a map, event calendar, and menus for the restaurants. There is a need for a packet of info about the villa itself --info on how to use equipment, inventory, rules of use, how to leave the unit--do we take off sheets, etc?, how to check out, where to put garbage and recyclables and how to use the phone. They said that they were working on it. Although I've benefitted from Trip Advisor comments, I've never commented myself. This time, I felt that it was \"pay back\" time, and Orange Lake needed a good review.

We were two families in a two bedroom unit at River Island. Our children ranged from 5 to 15. In the past we stayed in the West and East Village, this time we wanted to try River Island. We booked through our Visa travel and used some or our points to defray the cost of our stay. It was expensive but we truly enjoyed ourselves. We had requested to stay on the first floor because we had a few children in our room and we did not want to disturb anyone below us. When we checked in with Alicia at the front desk we had a mix up with the Visa payment and this was handled very quickly with both parties and I have to say that Patrick was quite helpful in getting this resolved. There was no line ups for check in and we were greeted as soon as we stepped in. After the paperwork was resolved Alicia gave us all the details of the resort and the amount of keys that we had requested. When we arrived at River Island we found out that we were on the 5th floor. You will know what floor you are on by the 3rd number that follows 81. We had also asked Alicia if we could have a unit that faces the pool and she said that she did not know how the room numbers worked. We ended up facing the rear parking lot. It's not a bad view mind you, but I called the front desk and asked about our request. I forget what the girls name was but she said something like they don't rent out level one and that the rooms facing the pool are reserved for owners? I don't know if this is true but hey our room was very nice, we were pleased. When you arrive every unit has a doorbell and a peekhole. Our suite had a fully equipped kitchen to the left and a washer and dryer to the right. Upon arrival you will get a starter kit with some basics that you will need til you get to the grocery store. Also to the left you will find the master bedroom with a comfortable king size bed and an array of pillows to choose from. There is also a desk and a sitting area to read a book or lounge for one person. The main bath is big with a separate area for the toilet. You will find plenty of counter space, a large jacuzzi tub and a separate shower. There are also shelves next to the shower and I used this to put our pants and shorts. They supply the bath towels (thick) and also some toiletries. A hair dryer is also supplied. The master bedroom also has a good size closet, a 3 drawer dresser (not enough if you have to put clothes for 3 people) that's why I used the shelves in the bathroom, either that or I brought too much clothes. The living room dining room area is beautifully decorated. The L shaped couch has a double pull out. The kids found it more comfortable if we took the mattress off and put it on the floor. Extra bedding is supplied but we were missing the fitted sheet so we called housekeeping and it was delivered within 20 minutes.Afterwards someone called to make sure that we did receive it. There is a plasma tv, dvd player and safe situated on the tv unit facing the sofa. The dining room has 3 chairs and a wrap around that fits 7 for sure. There is sitting for 2 at the counter in the kitchen. The second bedroom has two double beds, a 3 or 4 drawer dresser with a tv above it. There is a good size closet also. The bathroom has a good size counter, toilet and stand up shower. There is also a shelving area that you could use for whatever you would like. There are phones in each bedroom and in the kitchen. For the internet connection ($) the plugs are in the master bedroom or in the kitchen. Once you purchased it then it could be wireless. In the broom closet you will find a vacuum, broom, mop, iron and ironing board. Now back to the kitchen: full size fridge that makes ice, microwave, can opener, toaster, coffee maker, blender, dishwasher and all the accessories needed to cook. Yes no pizza cutter but you do have a cork and bottle opener :) Our unit had a balcony that had a table and four chairs. We often ate lunch there. I was worried that we would hear noise from the hallway and the other units but the units are very soundproof. We did eat at the Lazy River restaurants. All were good but costly. Hopefully you will have MerciDieu as your waiter, what an awesome guy!! tip him well he deserves it!! The lazy river is lots of fun. We did like the other reviewers and waited til later in the day and were able to use tubes that other people had left floating. The kids enjoyed the hammocks, playing in the sand, sliding down the slides...we tried the pool at splash lagoon and liked that both pools were heated. Be careful when walking in sandals around the river island area, it is slippery when you get a wet patch. We did get a family pass at the putt putt area. For the price you pay for one week it's worth it. We also did the hippo slide for a day. Now talk about fun. We laughed so hard. There is shuttle service around the resort. Orange Lake is quite big so this is nice to have if you did not rent a car. We did not wait very long for a ride and we did tip $1, they were very courteous and helpful. Once they dropped us off at the front gate so we could go to Publix for groceries. It's about a 5 to 10 minute walk. After they drop you off they will let security know that you have gone and when you get back security will call the shuttle to let them know to pick you up. Rick was great at the front gate he even let us wait inside. If you are going to play tennis the best spot for this is at the Check in area. You will find over 6 courts and have better surfaces then any other area. We really enjoyed the haunted house they had going during Halloween. Well thought of, great job!! When it was our last day we asked to check out later and they let us. This was very nice since we had a late flight out. Now the guys or concierge that work at level one by the elevators were extremely helpful when we had a question and it was nice that we could check out right on the spot. I must say they were friendly to both adults and children and always had a smile and a greeting. Now you might wonder why I put above average for the overall experience, well I have to say that the rugs could use a cleaning as could the tiles. There was some dust in some areas. I think they have to keep and eye on this because its the little details that count for some people. I am not saying that the upkeep is not good, far from it. We constantly saw that the grounds were being attended to but some things might be slipping that maybe they are not seeing. Some of the loungers could also use a good scrubbing. Not once did we regret our stays here at Orange Lake, and we do appreciate that our comments count since they do send you a survey to answer via email.

We stayed Oct. 25-Nov. 1 We traded our Puerto Vallarta timeshare for Orangelake through RCI. I was a little apprehensive with reading some of the negative reviews. That changed as soon as we arrived. Upon arrival did not have to wait at all for check -in process which went very smooth. Staff was very helpful in explaining how to get around the resort. At this time I was also pitched the timeshare deal with a \"tour of the facility.\" I declined. I should add that I did receive three phone calls to our room,during the week, asking if we had changed our minds regarding the Tour. This was slightly irritating. But it was only a 30 sec. phone call and easily dismissed as our stay was amazing. Anyway, we stayed in the East village which is about a 3-4min drive from the West village check-in area. I highly recommend a car to get around the huge resort although there were shuttles that conveyed guests all around the resort. The unit was a two BR /1 bath/2 showers and was very spacious, plenty of room,clean and modern decor. Kitchen had just about everything we needed except for a pizza cutter. The only negative thing about the unit was the pantry door in kitchen was broke- the slide on top was missing. We did not need the Pantry as there was plenty of counter space to put our food. So it wasn't a big deal. The pools at this resort are fabulous. There was a nice heated pool right outside our building which we took full advantage of . River Island which was about a 2 min. drive from the East village had a beautiful pool / lazy river area. It is basically several pool areas attached to the lazy river. There are also two smaller water slides that the kids liked. There is also food, shops, massage area, and a bar. It is a great place to lounge around and/or play with the kids. The North village and West village also had really nice pool areas. All the pool areas had hot tubs. The West village also has a lake which was OK. You could rent waverunners and paddle boats , fishing poles, etc. We did fish but I don't think there are any fish in the lake ; ) There is a nice beach area but there is no swimming. There was also plenty of other activities- video game room,ping pong,table games,play station games, etc... I need to mention that this time of the year is great for visiting the Disney parks. There are not a lot of people which is nice. The lines for attractions are short which makes your wait times very minimal. Some things were a bit expensive at the resort (putt-putt golf $9 per person)but you don't have to do these things and you would still have a great time. I would take the negative reviews with a grain of salt and overlook some of the petty things that people complain about.

Most of the time we stay either with relatives or in one of the many Disney resorts.

The price was right since it was off season. To our surprise, we found beautiful landscaped grounds with an almost perfect unit. I was a bit nervous at first because the elevator was pretty unappealing and that was our first impression of the building -- I've been taught that you never get a second chance to make a first impression !!! This area needs improvement. Once in the unit, it was fabulous. Almost everything was redone with new appliances, furniture, beds, window treatments, etc. The view of the lake from our kitchen, living room, bedroom and large balcony was spectacular and we had the first hole of one of the golf courses below us. The furniture was very comfortable. I had to call maintenance two days in a row to replace my \"it should have been replaced\" shower head that had water spraying everywhere but on us in the shower. The bathroom faucet was also not new and was leaking all over the brand new countertop. (This never got repaired correctly) All in all, everything else was just fine.

Been there every year for a couple decades so I've seen the changes and growth since the 80's. I take lots of other vacations also so I do compare accomodations. I'm not here to \"sell\" Orange Lake, they don't need it but here's my humble opinion and clarification on a few things I've seen written. The grounds are well kept and lush. It is a very large resort. You do need to drive if you're going from one end to the other. Shuttle service is available and will drop you anywhere on property. Rooms and villas differ with the West Village being the newest since remodeling began this year. They are not ALL done yet, so if you book into West you may get an old unit. The refurbished units are lovely. Many pools; WV has zero elevation olympic size pool among others; if you have small kids you'll probably spend lots of time at River Island (small water park) If you appreciate low key there are smaller pools that are very quiet. North Village has shallow pool with slide and volleyball net in water. Lots to choose from. Restaurants are pretty good; newest one still being built in WV; opening in Feb '09. My biggest complaint about them is they're all too cold! A/C blasting all the time. With a million restaurants down 192, we rarely want to eat on property. Just our choice. Staff is very courteous, again just MY experience. Check in was super; this year we only stood in line about 2 minutes and someone came and got us and walked us over to another desk in lobby to save time. LIke that. Am I saying I've NEVER had a crabby look or word in 20+ years--no. However, it's pretty much all positive for me. Location is great. OLCC borders on Disney property. 192 can get jammed up pretty quick but allowing an extra 15 minutes at certain times of day takes care of that. A few things I've read in reviews that are not correct are as follows: 1) there is no charge to get into River Island (water park) It's part of Orange Lake. There is a fee for this gigantic slide outside the fence at RI that does not belong to Orange Lake. Strategic placement though. I've never paid for a tube rental yet. We just use one for a quick trip down the lazy river and then let it lay. There are handfuls of them just laying around. Maybe because October is \"down season\"? 2) You don't HAVE to ever spend more than 90 minutes at a sales presentation. I listen, ask questions and at the 90 minute mark, look at my watch, smile and say \"gotta go\". I've not had anyone give me a hard time or be rude. It's all in your attitude and how you handle them. I just did one this month for $80 in Orange Lake \"bucks\" Works out nice to have them for spending in the bars , restaurants and snack shops on site. They also offer discounted park tickets and golf fees among other things. Also have never had a sales person \"hound\" me by phone as some reported 3) Internet use is \"expensive\"...it isn't. Anyway the entire property will soon be WIFI so it's a mute point. I've droned on long enough, point being...every traveler does not expect (and receive) the same treatment. I've had 95% good experiences at Orange Lake and have heaps of happy memories. I'm a pretty positive person and realize you get what you give. My humble opinion would be: if you're thinking about OLCC, give it a try. Judge for yourself. Whether you're playing a round of golf, having a frozen cocktail on the beach or sliding down a water slide like a big kid...you can make some memories too.

This was our first trip to Orange Lake Resort and I had read many negative reviews. I have to admit that our experience there was great. The resort was clean and for the staff was friendly. We booked this resort directly with their marketing department since we had already planned to take a timeshare presentation. We saved several hundred dollars on our bill since we took the presenatation. We were told when we reserved that we would not know which village we would be in until we checked in. That worried me a litte, but when we checked in, they put us in the newest village at River Island and we had only asked to be put there when we checked in. Our room was great and looked just like the photos...it even had a dvd & vcr combo player. We couldn't find anything to complain about other than the staff didn't seem to know much about any other part of the resort other than where they were working. We found the beach to be closed to swimming even though we had read you could swim. The lake was a little disappointing...not at all what I had expected. The timeshare presentation was as most are. We have been to them before and they are all pretty much the same. We were upfront with the salesman and told him we planned to buy in the future..not that particular weekend. He went thru the presenation, was kind and curteous and never was too pushy. We told him we were much more likely to come back and purchase later if we weren't turned off now. The whole thing lasted a little over 90 minutes. Many reviews complained about the miscellaneous charges for tubes, water slide, etc. They definately do charge for all the extras, but then you only have to pay for what you choose to use. My kids never paid for an inner tube for the lazy river...they either went without one or found ones laying around...and we were there for 8 days. We did play mini golf once and they gal working only charged us for the adults and let the kids (12, 10,& 9 yrs) play for free. Not all staff did that...you just have to be nice and you'll soon find out who will bend a little. My girls also had their hair braided at the resort and it was much cheaper than at any of the parks. We paid $35 instead of the $50-$60 we found every where else. The restaurant food was probably among the best we ate for the week...other than what we cooked ourselves. I loved that everything we really needed was right out our door. We did venture over to one of the other villages for a Dive In Movie night and watched Iron Man while our kids swam. We could see Magic Kindom's fireworks right out on our patio at night. I really think that your resort experience is much of what you make it.

We stayed at the Sheridan Vistana resorts for our first few nights and an had excellent experience. We did our Disney visits while there and reserved our pool play for the boasted waterpark at Orange Lake. Disapointments started as we walked in the reception area. There was a very small amount of staff available for check in and waited over 35 minutes just for one guest in front of us. The checkin is 4pm (which is common for waterpark resports) We recieved access to the water park and headed there while waiting for the room to be available. The park was advertised as 12 acres!!!! HARDLY. They have 1 lazy river with a few side pools and not much more than that. In addition we happened to be placed in the furthest location from the pool area. There was a 7 minute drive by car just to find it over their spread out design. After checking in we were guided to our room by the bell boy. His ideal plan of route was to walk around the building guiding us past the dumpsters and in a side door leading to the basement. They put us in a discusting room in the bottom corner. There was no windows or daylight to be seen. The shower did not work propperly. You felt dirty just walking in the bathroom. There was not noise barrier to the music being played in the lobby and we heard this into the wee hours. It took 4 requests to have a crib delivered to the room and it was not till 11pm that our infant was able to lay down to sleep. And finally to top it all off we had additional charges after checkout. Supposedly expedia charges $12 for the convenience of booking through them but fails to make it very obvious during the time of reservation.

My party was myself, my husband and our 9 month old daughter. We were asked if it was our first time there, and we said yes. He explained a lot of stuff to us, showed us on a map where our room was.

I called the front desk, and was told they would bring them to us. 5 mins. Later a knock at the door, and our high chair was there but no pack n play. He was never told about the pack n play. So he said he\u2019d bring one to us later. Well, maybe 5 mins. Go by doorbell rings again (yes each unit has a doorbell!) and there he was with our pack n play. We later received a message on our phone in our unit making sure we got the high chair and pack n play. That first day we did some shopping at the outlets, and then Downtown Disney. Came back late, and went to bed. Next morning we had to be at the timeshare thing by 8:15 am. They gave us donuts and juice and we met with our sales guy. We got the history of the resort, a tour around the resort in a golf cart, more info about the resort. Then we ended up at a building where we sat at a table and discussed about our vacations past and future. Was told some more about the timeshare industry. Then a tour to River Island, the newest, nicest section of the resort. The room we toured was amazing and beautiful and everything you would want in a condo unit/timeshare! !!!! Then back at the table to discuss price. At first we had said no thanks, as we could NOT afford it!! They kept lowering the price, and we kept saying no. we went in there deciding to say no. Our daughter was getting fussy. We wanted to get to Epcot Center that day, by now about 2 hours had passed, maybe even more. We wanted or $50 and to get out of there!!! Then he says he is calling his manager over to see what he can do for us. He offers us the same unit, in River Island but for half the price and an awesome affordable monthly payment, it was a foreclosure unit! We discussed it among ourselves, and decided to go for it. Vacations in our family are important, and we did fall in love with the resort the short time we were there. And we do plan to take vacations for a very long time. We were sold on the whole \u201cpoints\u201d system, with being able to exchange points for all over the world in other timeshare resorts. And the fact that we own the deed to our week and our unit, and the fact that we can pass it down to our kids, and then their kids and so on, someday. So we were there probably another hour or so, after final paperwork was done, this and that. We did not get $50 but we got $70!!! They take your picture with your sales guy, you get one copy. We buy our tickets to Disney for 2 days. And we were out of there. And could not believe what we had just done! HAHA. We were off to Epcot for the rest of the day, again got back late, but had an amazing and awesome day! Perfect weather, I might add the whole 4 days we were there. Next day we got up and I cooked us breakfast in the kitchen. Then the 3 of us were off to River Island to enjoy the beautiful pool and lazy river. We walked around and took some pictures of River Island. We actually went back into the unit we toured to get pictures of the room to show family and friends back home. It must be open during the day. We had no problems getting in there, and we remembered where it was on the bottom floor of the one building in River Island. Then back to our room to get ready and off to Magic Kingdom for another amazing awesome great day!! We did not have enough time to get full use of the resort, and with a 9 month old, it was a little hard too. We plan to go back for a week next year (in the fall) and use the pools, the lake/beach area, the mini golf. Hubby says he might have to take up golf (there are 4 golf courses on the resort!). We hope to bring our family along with us one year, as our 2 bdrm, 2 bath room sleeps 8 people! One room with a King size bed, one room with 2 double beds, and the sofa pulls out to king size bed. The rooms in River Island are just beautiful. All in all, we were impressed with resort, the staff was so nice.

This place is beautiful and I really liked it but my biggest complaint is how far away from the pools and clubhouse we were. We needed to drive or take the shuttle bus to get there. Also everything costs so much money. The putt-putt, inner tubes, hippo slide etc was all at a cost. Even owners get nothing free.

We stayed in a three bed in the North Village in one of the villas around the golf course. The trip was booked through RCI and we have stayed at a number of very nice resorts in different countries. This was booked as an exchange week in the West Village and on reading some of the negative reviews were very apprehensive. We all spent the two weeks wondering just how people could give this place a bad review. The staff were friendly, the whole complex whilst huge did not seem overly busy or crowded together, the resort was very clean with what must be a huge team of gardeners for the amount of green space, and the villa was spot on. The villa itself had three large bedrooms each with their own bath room. The master bedroom had a large bathroom with Jacuzzi with the other two being smaller but perfectly adequate. The kitchen come living room was a large area with all the usual furniture. The air con was fantastic, and needed to be! Yes this may not quite be 5 star but its not bad at all. If you want to be picky the large telly and tvs in each bedroom were CRT\u2019s and not LCD/Plasma and there was a video player not a DVD player shock horror. The kitchen was clean and well equipped but I agree the finish was only average, but a good average, not anything that will spoil your stay in any way. You have to be very picky and I would suggest a sad sad person to find serious faults. Some reviews mention pressure to attend a time share presentation. This consisted of, at reception on arrival \u201cwe have a meet and greet tomorrow, what time would you like to come\u201d to which we replied \u201cWere not interested\u201d end of conversation and receptionist still smiling and being friendly. A week later a phone call \u201cCome to our meeting and we will give you $70 cash\u201d reply \u201cno thanks\u201d again polite and no problems. There was no knocking on doors, no constant phone calls, and no people suggesting they would be out on the street with their 5 children and pregnant wife if you don\u2019t buy that you get at many time share resorts. The pools were all clean and well thought out and the lazy river area was by far the best. Here I found there were enough sun loungers for about 10 each but unfortunately I only picked up 2 towels so could only make use of a couple. Towels are free by the way at the side of the pools. I would advise though at peak season you may struggle for a table/parasol if you turn up mid afternoon but this is the same for all resorts I would have thought. Everything at the resort costs money, tubes for the lazy river, access to the big slide etc but given how cheap we got the villa I was expecting this. The location of the resort means you need a car. On site there is a regular shuttle service, On a rainy day this did not just stop at the bus stop but took you back to your door. Site is ideal for the Disney parks and about 20/25 k to universal/IOA. This is our second time to florida and the 1st with a sat nav, its worth every penny, far far less stressful and means less \u2018assistance\u2019 from the 5 back seat drivers in my vehicle. I wont talk about the parks or I will be here all day. All I would say is that if you can dodge the hurricanes like we managed you will get 12/13 days of good weather (low 90\u2019s) and very quiet parks with little or no ques where it takes longer to get around the que than it does to que at the end of it. We managed to stay on many of the top rides and only que\u2019d for about 5 minutes for the front rows. Shikra 7 times in an hour, duelling dragons 6 times in an hour, 4 times on the front row etc etc. I took hundreds of pictures and if anyone wants to see any or ask further questions they are welcome to e-mail any requests to dtsufc@hotmail.com.

I was nervous given the bad reviews I saw. We were in the west village and felt duped because the picture on the RCI website is not an indicator of what you get. However, that is not Orange Lakes fault. We chose to do the presentation as the owner of 3 timeshare weeks, I like to see what is out there and wanted the discount on tubes. We were in and out in under 2 hours. However, the person, Tracey who took us around was obnoxious. She kept saying they were the #1 resort whenever I questioned anything. We prefer snow, so there is no way we would buy in Florida, but when she covered my 10 year old daughters mouth who was talking about the various places we have vacationed, it was uncalled for. After that I was done, and reported it to the manager, who still wanted to sell us the timeshare. They berated the ones we own which was inappropriate. however, we laughed it off and had a good week. Our goal was a downweek with our daughter who had been at camp most of the summer. She opted not to go to EPCOT as she wanted to lounge by the lazy river. We rented a cabana ($119) for the day and it was worth every penny as we had family come by and it was a party. The minature golf and water sports (jetskiing) were also great. The resort is big so you do need a car, the shuttle looked pretty regular. The lack of a DVD and hookups for the one we brought was a pain, but a short trip to radioshack and $26 we had an adaptor and were able to play WII when it was raining yesterday. There was no lack of chairs etc at the various pools as we tried them all. Shady chairs were few and far between (and taken) but there were chairs. This past week is considered a down week. Maintainence did bring us two new (but old models) TV's when two didn't work. however, a lamp was never repaired. While I wouldn't go back because I prefer mountains, overall the resort was average and not the worse place in the world. It is large, they do leave messages about what is going on in the resort, but gasp.. they can't understand no thank you when you don't like golf... It is close to the parks, it is close to grocery stores, and has the basics to make meals. There were no grills which was a pain, but supposedly if you ask for a dvd player at the front desk they will lend you one if it is available.

The last half of the stay was pretty much ruined by Tropical Storm Fay, though it helped to draw attention to some of the good and bad at the resort. Overall the resort is very comfortable, clean, well-maintained, with gorgeous grounds and nice sized pools and water activity areas for families. With 4 18-hole golf courses surrounding the units, it's a golfer's dream. First the good. The unit had ample space for a family of 5. The three kids slept in the second bedroom, which had two queen-size beds. The living area was generous and comfortable, and the kitchen more than adequate. The surroundings were quiet and peaceful, and the balcony had enough room to have a meal on. River Island, Splash Lagoon and the West Village Pool area had plenty to offer. The lazy river was nice, but there was plenty of space to take the sun as well. The kids enjoyed the slides and mini golf. The entire property looked very well kept; the grounds are huge and beautifully landscaped throughout. From the East entrance to our unit in the East Village was almost 2 miles! The Publix located onsite made grocery shopping easy, though at a (slight) premium. Despite booking at the West Village (older) through RCI, we were promised a newly-refurbished unit over the phone, and were in a newer East Village unit when we arrived. The resort seemed pretty empty, however, and I'm sure it was not hard to find space. Now the not-so-good. To begin with, for such a nice resort one expects to see a level of quality throughout, but in a number of respects, things were \"chintzy\". The kitchen, for example, had a stove with uneven burners, and no window in the door of the oven. The counters are inexpensive laminates; the cabinets have plastic handles. All of this is easily overlooked, but it presents as something less than first class. And similar choices were made in the bathrooms and bedrooms. Sheets were clean but older and covered in balled up bits of cotton. The predominance of white in bathrooms, coupled with the plastic shower floor and bright lights gave a less-than-relaxing ambience. Despite the fact that wireless internet is offered almost everywhere else in town (including Holiday Inn, Days Inn, even Denny's!), it was not available at the resort, except in one of two designated \"internet cafes\". During the storm, these were closed, meaning that there was no access whatsoever. It's not that I want to use my computer while on vacation, but I can't afford to miss my e-mail. At best, it meant a one-mile drive from the unit, plus $6/hour or a daily/weekly rate. While sitting in the unit waiting 30 hours for the storm to pass, there were many times that the lack of internet connection came to mind. Everything comes with a price tag. The use of rafting tubes is over $7/day/tube. For a family of 5 it amounts to more than $200 in a week. On the one hand, they will reduce this to $20 if you take the \"tour\"; on the other, this is one of the cheapest \"gifts\" I've ever been offered to attend... and on my vacation, no less. The beautiful grounds were great for my daughter to practice her X-country running. But they also meant it wasn't easy to get around without either a car, or using the resort shuttle. At other resorts, we have felt that the proximity of all the amenities was definitely a plus. The distance here was a negative for us. Lastly, during five of the seven days we were there, we were treated to the rather intense \"perfume\" floating our way from Disney's Animal Kingdom, right next door. It was strong enough to keep us all inside! Bottom line: We enjoyed our stay and we would go back, but it wouldn't be our first choice.

We stayed in River Country in a two bedroom condo. The room - very pretty and clean (except for one stain on the master bedroom rug). We had a view of the parking lot! Nice to hear car alarms on vacation! All new appliances and a big 42 inch Flat screen TV in the living room. Spash Lagoon - very relaxing and fun with the waterfalls. Very clean too. Water is a nice blue. The other pool (North pool?) is also very nice, a little more crowded but not bad at all. Pool is also very clean. The chicken fingers at the snack bar in River Country are very very good. The other restaurants - not so good The bartenders at the River Country bars very nice and make excellent drinks. The room smelled of fish every time we entered! When we complained, I was instructed to chase down the maintenence people and ask them to see what they could do. What happened to THEM contacting housekeeping. By this time I was so frustrated and didn't want to deal with it anymore, we just went to Publix and bought a can of Lysol. It didn't help! The living room couch is uncomfortable. Tried the pull out bed and it was like laying directly on springs! The beds were so uncomfortable, we took the queen size matress from the second bedroom and placed in on the living room floor where we slept for the week. The pillows were just as uncomfortable! Hard as a rock! River Country pool is really quite gross. I assume this is because the water at the highest point is two/three feet tdeep. It is so overcrowed that even the so called lazy river gets congested with people. I was totally grossed out regarding the number of toddlers wearing diapers in this very overcrowed and DIRTY pool. I never saw anyone cleaning this pool the entire time we were there. My father in law slipped on the grime of the pool and hurt his hand. Not customer focused at all - everytime you turn around there is a charge for something. Float costs $10 per day for a double and $7 for a single. Give me a break! You even have to pay $5 to slide down a big blow up slide. Ridiculous! Believe me, we are not complainers at all, but I felt compelled to write a review. It is sad, because we did enjoy our previous stays, but it is obvious that the resort is no longer customer focused and is more concerned with sales and becoming even bigger resort! I am seriously thinking about writing the VP that is on the resort TV channel all the time! Ahh, I think I just want to forget about this vacation! 5 Star - Royal Crown - or what ever... I do NOT think so! I even told the timeshare sales people that they could not pay me enough to buy a timeshare there. What was there response? How about if we give you a really cheap timeshare?

This is the first review I have ever done on a resort, and this one really deserved my time in telling others how great of a time their kids will have. I have stayed at many other nice resorts like the Marriott Grande Vista, Silver Lake, and Wyndhams, and this one offered so much more for the kids and the adults to have a great time. When we arrived the people were very friendly. We stayed in a West Village Golf Villa 2 br./2 ba. It was very large and clean. The entire resort (which is about 3 miles long) is beautifully landscaped. The golf villa had a golf course and lake in the back yard, and we could pull right up near the front door. It was like having our own private house, rather than staying in a building and having to park in a large parking lot and going up an elevator. We were able to easily and quickly just carry our groceries right into the front door by walking up the front yard walkway. If your kids love fishing, this is the place!! My son (11 yrs. old) and my niece (13 yrs. old) were catching so many fish!! Every 5 to 10 minutes they had a large mouth bass on their hook! These fish were big, 12 to 24\" long, and the kids were having a blast! Every morning, that was the first thing they wanted to do, is walk out the back sliding doors to the lake. We could see them right out the window. There are 3 swimming pool areas. They are huge!! One has a very long lazy river, with waterfalls, and a gigantic pool with two water slides, and pool volleyball. Very, very big. Most of the pool is not deeper than 3 to 4 feet. There are also very large areas that are great for little toddlers that is 1-1/2 feet - 2 feet deep, which is perfect for them especially if they are practicing swimming. They have all kinds of things to do at this resort including an enormous sized inflatable water slide called the hippo. Just go to their website to see photos. There is literally so much to do there. Huge gamerooms, bowling, bingo, mini movie theater, activities center, miniature golf, ping pong, pool tables, you name it! If you go to this resort, you will need to have money to spend on all these extras. The hippo slide is normally $13. for one hour or $18. for the day. However, they gave us a $3.00 off coupon. We paid $10. because due to the overcast sky looking like rain, would not sell us an all day ticket, but let the kids ride all day long anyway for the $10. I cannot stress enough how much fun the kids had on this gigantic slide!! They kept going down it over and over again, every which way. Children 9 and under were free for playing miniature golf. Technically, they charge $10. a day for the inflatable tubes but do not worry about that. There are so many tubes laying all over the pool area, stacked up everywhere. People that go on the timeshare tour get unlimited tube rentals for their entire family for the week for $20. so so they do not bother to return them, and there are literally tubes everywhere. All I can say is this is the first resort I have went to where the kids (ages 7, 10, 11, and 13) did not one time say they were bored or nagged us to take them somewhere. They were so happy and occupied with everything to do here. Truly amazing place. Restaurants also, and stores. The resort has a free shuttle that will pick you up right near your unit and take you anywhere within the resort complex for free. This was great for the kids if they wanted to head to the miniature golf or game room area, and I was not ready to leave yet. They could go where they wanted and then I could meet them there. GREAT PLACE TO STAY WITH KIDS!!! FOUR NEGATIVES I CAN LIVE WITH: In the area we stayed, there was no wireless internet access. We could only have it at the clubhouse area. We could use their computers or use our own. If you book here, and you need wireless internet, just make sure that they have it where your unit is. Most areas there do have it. Everything is pricey at this resort, and costs at least double what you would expect to pay anywhere else, and almost everything you do there costs money. Some things are free like the movies, swimming, pool slides, playing in the activities center, etc. Anything else, there is a charge. There are no lifeguards at the pool areas or at the lazy river, only at the slides. However, the water is not deep. Most of the water is about 3 to 3-1/2 feet. I believe they should definately have lifeguards as it is easy for a parent to lose sight of their kids. Lifeguards should especially be around the Lazy River so parents are not forced to have to go around it with their kids every time they want to go in. My kids are older, so it wasn't too much of a concern for me, but for smaller kids. I am really surprised there were no lifeguards. We had ants in our unit, and we had to put all food items in the refrigerator. Most places in Florida will have ants, as it is a common everyday problem here. I have lived in South Florida for over 20 years, and know that ants are hard to keep out. However, they could do a better job with spraying, I think.

We really appreciated the washer and dryer in the room, but due to things like this there was no maid service and you even have to strip your own bedding at the end of your stay. I don't know how much this place costs to own or stay but overall it didn't add much value outside the hotel room. There is a nice waterpark on site with slides, beach and lazy river, but everyone must pay admission, intertube rental, tent rental, etc., etc. I've stayed at other timeshares with similar activities but they were included in the cost of the room. There was a smaller pool onsite which you could use without charge. Also there was no spa on site. It is very close to Disney, within a 5 minute drive and lots of resturants/shops on the way, including a Walmart. The property is huge and took a few days to get our barrings and stop getting lost.

The phone calls came at all hours but the most annoying calls came at 8:00 a.m. The first day we were surprised by the calls and simply took the phone off the hook. That compelled the hotel staff to come to our room and knock on the door at 8:15 a.m. to inquire if there was a problem with our phone. The air in our unit was broken. We called maintenace the moment we arrived and were told someone would be out to fix it. They came to fix it at 9:30 p.m. It broke again in the middle of the night so we called maintenance again. They came out to fix the air 3 times in a 3 day visit, including one 11:30 p.m. repair. The whole time they refused to move us to another room. Finally on our check out date, a repair company came out and informed us that the units airconditioning was broken for several weeks and they were shocked the unit was rented out.

Though, the T.V. in the living room could have been bigger and the reception could have been better. But, we barely turned on the T.V. with the exception of the kids and adults who played Wii on rainy days. Yes folks!!! June is the wettest month for Central Florida and you can expect tropical monsoon like weather at times. But don't let that scare you into not coming. We still managed to put in a couple of good days at Universal. Avoid the long lines at the Simpson's in Universal Studios....The kids ages, 9,10,12 and adults did not think this ride was worth long 90 minute wait!!! We do not recommend this ride if the line is long. Mummy is much more fun but there are some restrictions... OLCC Kids enjoyed Splash lagoon more than River Country. The slides at River Country were too slow for them. Splash Lagoon is smaller but the rushing waters make it more enjoyable for all. Splash Lagoon has a volleyball net and a Basketball hoop. Lazy River was okay for 1 day but not worth the money to keep going back....besides it was too far from West Village. Splash Lagoon is closer. I was surprised to not see any bugs in the unit After all this is Florida and it gets hot so for those of us who live down here we know what to expect.

When we booked this resort as part of an Expedia vacation package, I called the resort, gave them my reservation information and requested that we stay at the River Island area. We were told that they could not guarantee that we would be able to stay at the River Island area and that was ok with me. The female on the phone told us that she would at least record the request in the system so that the check-in staff would have it when we did check-in on our arrival. She said that they would try to accommodate the request if possible. As a side note, I asked her if we would be hounded about timeshare because we were not interested and she told us that when we check in just mention that we were not interested and that would be it. Upon our arrival, we were told that we were limited to staying at the check-in clubhouse and staying on the first floor. The staff at the front desk told us that certain first floor rooms were dedicated to those that book rooms through Expedia and other similar travel services. The front desk staff also told us that we were not eligible to stay in any other areas. And yes, they had our request that the female, from my earlier call, had told us that she would record into the system. We reluctantly went down to view the room. To get to the room, you had to exit the building through a side door from the main floor, take an elevator located outside down one floor, re-enter the building and walk through a poorly lit corridor that was used to store several large housekeeping and maintenance carts. At the end of the corridor there were two doors. One was the entrance to the golf cart storage and maintenance garage and the other the entrance to the first floor rooms. After finding the room we entered and the first thing we see is a large vent cover disconnected and leaning away from the wall. All of the wires were openly exposed. Ironically, we even had to wait at the check-in desk because they said the room was to ready yet. The lighting in the room was very poor and it had a very pungent smell. We returned to the front desk to reject the room and requested another room. We were then told that we could not change rooms. I finally had to call Expedia. After about an hour on my cell phone, since they wouldn\u2019t even let me use a resort phone, the Expedia agent called the front desk manager and finally got us relocated to a room on the main floor. I decided to give up on an upgrade option. It was hard enough to get to where I was. After getting our newly assigned room, we proceeded to get our luggage and that took another fifteen minutes to find someone to get us a luggage cart. Within a half an hour, we received a phone call inviting us to participate in a timeshare seminar. I politely declined yet I received a phone call from the same female resort representative everyday that we were there. So much for the \u201cjust tell them your not interested\u201d that I was told.

We had a great vacation, and overall liked our accomodations. However, there were some negatives about this resort. Most importantly, the personnel tend to exaggerate the resort. It is a very large, all-encompassing resort, but it seems like they even go so far as to make up details that aren't true to make the resort seem even nicer. This affected our family because we were told all the rooms were renovated, only to be put in an unrenovated room (West Village). The room itself was not bad, but as an RCI transfer, our original property was a lot nicer. This room was advertised as newly renovated with a hot tub, new furniture, etc. While the room wasn't a dump, this was simply not true. We were able to switch rooms to the North Village, but it was a production. The \"Dive-In Movie Pool\" we were informed about was never found by us. I kept looking for it, but I think the check-in lady made it up. Either that or it's not built yet (they were renovating a pool). That was a disappointment. The staff is not super knowledgeable about the resort details. Don't bother asking them where stuff is or what time it closes. We were either given no information or faulty information regarding those topics. It was really difficult to get any real information from anyone. The lake was also kind of disappointing. It was very small, and there was not much to see in the way of nature. Also, non-motorized craft as well as jet skis had to share the \"lake.\" It was really more of a glorified pond. Side-note: 2-person kayaking is NOT fun. All you do is hit eachothers paddles and make eachother mad. We switched rooms to an actual renovated room, and it was much nicer with a hot tub and screened in porch and all. However, there was a VCR in each room. VCR? Really? Just spring for the DVD player or nothing, I'd say. Some of these points may seem picky, and they are. The main idea is that as a state-of-the-art resort, everything should be PERFECT. A lot of these things would not have bothered us if we were told up front about them. Or not told about them if it wasn't true. It was just a case of overinflated expectations, I think. I think having such a large resort (7 sq mi) is a positive and a negative. On one hand, the resort had almost anything you'd want available (groceries, mini golf, pools, etc...); on the other hand, it was hard to find many things. You must have the map on hand at all times, and you can't really walk anywhere. Even the pool in our complex was a good 7 min walk. Our room was located 2 miles from the front desk lobby. They do provide shuttles though, which is helpful, and there's plenty of parking if you want to drive places. The pools were could find (3 out of 8) were nice. River Island is particularly impressive. The pools close at about 9 or 10, and the river and slides close at 7 pm. However, gates are not locked, and pools are not guarded. I guess that can be a bad thing if you have terrible children wandering around the resort unattended, but it was nice for us. My boyfriend and I had the lazy river and hot tub all to ourselves at 10-10:30 pm. While the resort wasn't overcrowded, it was nice to have a private (PG-rated, I swear) swim. The location of the resort is very convenient. It is practically at Disney, and there are a plethera of restaurants and shops. There's a Super Walmart nearby, and the groceries are way cheap there. Perfect for vacation. You could probably buy all your meals and souvenirs at the resort, but it'd be expensive. We didn't really buy anything there. There were birds and other wildlife around, which I liked. I guess people could see it as a nuisance or danger, but I quite enjoyed our 3-pawed raccoon friend. He didn't bite us or anything, and the birds would walk around in groups. It was cute. Overall, I would say this is an above average resort.

The washer, dryer, and dishwasher were so loud that we could only run them when we were out during the day (no one could sleep through them or watch TV).

I was terrified about heading out to this resort. We were taking our two young children on a trip to Florida to visit family, while spending time on our very own resort. Once I started checking the reviews, I was horrified to hear all the complaints about this place (ie. garbage everywhere, unfriendly staff, horrible and disgusting rooms, too big, too far from everything, close to the toll highway, can't see the fireworks....) I got myself all worried and decided to call the resort for information and to request a clean room, stressing that I was traveling with very young children. We also called to request a crib and a high chair. I also mentioned that I worried about what I read about West Village and she said they were in the process of updating all the rooms. During our conversation, she got a bit defensive because she realized that a lot of my questions were based on the negative reviews that I had read. I was still a little skeptical after I got off the phone, unsure whether she was truthful or not. Actually, lets change that to \"a lot skeptical\". But I was ready to argue if need be, darn it...to get a decent, clean, newly furnished room, if I wasn't happy with what I was given!!!!! When we got to the resort, we were pleased to see Security check for VIP tags on your car window. They directed us to the registration building. The place was spotless, there were tons of staff directing you to the next available desk. The woman greeted me and was very friendly. She told me that we were staying in a great unit in the EAST village. When I told her that I was getting worried about this place because of the reviews I read, she said that \"all you have to do is call the resort directly, speak to us and we will accommodate you as best we can\". Calling ahead did make a difference, a crib and high chair awaited in the room. When we arrived to the building, I was so worried that my husband waited in the car with the kids while I checked it out! It was fabulous, a clean, spacious 2 bedroom condo with all the perks (full kitchen, clean bathrooms, towels, toilet paper, paper towel roll, 3 tvs etc. We were also overlooking the golf course (which was taken care of every morning by 7:30 am by several staff). The pools were fabulous (beach type entry into the water)! My three year old loved that! The water park was amazing. Sure they charge for the tube, but my son used it once and didn't request it again. Sure the resort is large, but you can choose whether you want to head to the water park for the day or lounge by one of the quieter pools. You can choose to eat at home or head to the restaurants. Yes, Publics was busy and somewhat overpriced, but if you choose to cook, you're saving a lot of money overall. A rental car was a very important asset. Walking to and from the different locations was quite a way and during the day, VERY HOT. We didn't use the Shuttle but saw several of them going back and forth throughout the day. Sure, a few of the phone calls were to invite us to a presentation, but we just simply said we were not interested and that was it. Sometimes, we came back to the condo to a message about a special event. We listened and hung up. Disney Village, the parks, Orlando Downtown, Prime outlets, Shops and Restaurants are a short drive away. We really felt like we were on VACATION on a resort. We checked-out one day earlier to head to North Redington Beach (2 hours away) for a few days and I can truly say, Orange Lake and the beach made a great family vacation!", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay!\u201d", "Author": "adamsfamily2", "ReviewID": "UR16778111", "Content": "We got an exception deal through Expedia which is why I chose it.

Lots of nice pools and other ammenities (like the West Village arcade) we didn't get a chance to do There is nothing wrong with this place at all. It is GREAT! Expedia lists it as a 3.5* and I felt this was accurate. We were given a villa in the West Village in the appartment style villas in the 5500 building. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable with 2 bdrms, 2 full bathrooms and large living and kitchen areas. We stayed for 2 weeks and I was very happy with everything. The pools are well kept, clean and beautiful- we especially enjoyed the lazy river at River Island! Yes, we had to drive 5 mins from our room to get there but that was fine by me! We also used the pool in the West Village in the evenings as it was open until 11pm. We enjoyed having it to ourselves at that time of night! They are improving and adding things to the West Village so I am sure if will be even better once the new pool area opens. According to signs it opens Summer 2008. But even without the added ammenities we still enjoyed the West Village. Just a few things worth mentioning so you know what you are getting into here. The place is HUGE. I mean enormous. You should have a car, although they do have public transportation you can use. We enjoyed drinks at the Tradewinds Bar in River Island but for the best service sit at the bar- the bartenders are great! You will receive daily calls (for us at 8:44 am daily) which I presumed to be timeshare invitations. I never answered the phones and the time of the calls didn't bother me as we were always nearly out the door when they came in. If you are bothered I suggest unplugging the phones or try answering the first time and telling them you are not interested. We were NEVER pressured by anyone to buy anything.

It is a beautiful resort and centrally located to all Orlando has to offer. From my experience (and other reviews) I do believe all RCI exchanges are in the West Village. There are two types of accomodations in West Village, villas (condo-like units) and hotel-like rooms, which are located in the same building where you check in. This newly remodeled building also houses a coffee shop, internet cafe, game room, kids club, as well as desks for Disney, rental car, and RCI, etc. The top couple of floors are the hotel-like rooms. Ours was very much like a standard hotel room, (two double beds with a pull-out sofa bed) with the addition of a mini-kitchen with full size refrigerator, dish washer, microwave, and four-eye stove top. Bathroom was standard hotel like. I had the opportunity to see a two-bedroom unit, which had flat screen TVs and seperate sleeping quarters. The accomodations were nice, but if you're traveling in a large group, a villa might be more comfortable. The resort itself is seperated into different villages, each with it's own restaurants, pools, shopping, etc. West Village currently has one pool with a snack bar and is located close to putt-putt. When we visited, they were almost finished with a second, larger pool adjacent to the first pool. There were always plenty of available lounge chairs. Also adjacent to the accomodations we were in, is an 80-acre lake that offers a small but pretty beach with palm trees and lounge chairs, as well as rental boats, jet skis, etc. West Village does not currently have a restaurant but the restaurants in the other villages are close by (by car or the on-site shuttle service). There is a convenience store next to the check in that offers sandwiches, drinks, and your typical resort-type merchandise. We did not use the on-site shuttle service, so I can't comment on the speed (or lack thereof) of same. There are a couple of very nice shops and restaurants in River Village. This is the largest village and home to the lazy river and restaurant where we ate dinner several times. The service was a bit slow but expected due to the number of patrons. There is only one restaurant on site that serves breakfast and it is located on the practice putting green. The food there was also good. I have no complaints with this resort at all. However, it is so large, it is impossible to see everything. Off grounds, there is a grocery store located just outside of one set of the entrance gates, as well as lots of other nearby shops, restaurants, etc. For something different, try Sleuths murder mystery dinner theater. It's located off International Drive in Orlando, approximately 15 minutes from the resort. I took my eleven year old daughter and she loved it. The price includes beverages and hors dourves prior to the show, as well as dinner and beverages during the show. Don't let any negative reviews about RCI exchanges through this resort worry you!

There was one window that didn't even have a view. The room was dark and outdated. The water barely trickeled out of the shower and the closet door was falling off the hinges. The floors were filthy. Our intent was to have all of us traveling together be near each other. This didn't happen. After at least three attempts at trying to get a two bedroom condo (which, mind you, we were supposed to get in trade) through RCI and through the front desk, were told that there was nothing they would do for us and if we were able to move out of the room, they would charge a cleaning fee. They were more concerned about this \"cleaning fee\" than granting our request. The lady on the phone kept repeating something about a cleaning fee, over and over. I asked her why she didn't clean it before our family moved into it a few days before. She said they'd call maintenance about the closet door. Why didn't maintenance just fix it without having to get a complaint first? Tacky. In our three bedroom condo, the lock would not work, so we could not all leave our condo at the same time. Somebody had to stay behind. We called maintenance and they had to come and reinstall our lock. The lady was rude on the phone. The maintenance man, who was very nice, said that the keys they gave us were used over and over again and scratched. They were so scratched that they wouldn't work anyway. They cost about 40 cents a piece. The front desk reuses the keys to save costs??? Everything costs money at the resort. . . you'd think they could afford new keys. The pool with the waterslides and lazy river were so crowded, the only way to get a chair would be to sleep on it overnight. There were no tubes left to purchase and the ones that were purchased sat by tables with nobody using them for hours. Sometimes there were no towels by the pool and piles of garbage outside of people's rooms. The stench from Animal Kingdom was sooo vile one evening that it literally made people gag. There are a lot of little critters in the garbage cans, too. Raccoons by the kid pool, not cool. The last day we asked to stay later b/c our flight did not leave until later. We were told 11 a.m. was the latest we could check out. They locked us out of our room at 11 bells on the nose. Once you're out, you're out. We had to call security to open the door b/c they couldnt open it from the front desk in order to get the rest of our belongings out of the condo. Rediculous. A few positives, it is close to good restaurants and the sports bar is nice. The bartenders are pleasant. Publix, the grocery store, is very close and convenient. That's a plus. The weather was unbeatable. That's pretty much the only thing that reallllly made Florida worthwhile--oh, and being within driving distance of nice beaches. We have never been treated so poorly at a condo/resort. Usually, if there is an issue with anything, it's remedied within a few hours. It just felt like they could care less about their customers. RCI really didn't seem too concerned about our issue with the room, either. We read reviews before we left so we had an idea of what we were getting into. We hoped for the best.

Within the resort there is a large lake with a sand beach. The beach shop was closed for remodeling. Normally they rent fishing poles, paddle boats, jet skis, etc. It looked like it would have been fun if it was open. Having to pay extra to rent tennis rackets, use big slide, mini-golf and some others activities was not a big expense, but annoying. No maid service included during stay, however could arrange tidy and new towels/bedding for a fee. This is a very active resort and not especially quiet - lots of people and some traffic noise.

We just returned from a week long stay at OL. I initially booked for the West Village for a 3 BR, but was put in the East Village. The East Village is comprised of 6 story tall building units. Our building was the farthest on the resort, but right next to a smaller pool. The unit was clean and suited all our needs. Sure the appliances are not state of the art, but this is a rental unit that tends to get quite a beating. If you call maintenance, they usually address the problem within 24 hours. The only complaint for our room, was that our unit was so close to the pool, you could hear everyone at the pool until closing time & we could hear our upstairs neighbors get up in the early morning. They used to offer once a week clean up, but they no longer offer this, without a fee. If you keep your unit as your home, this should not be too much of an issue. The washer and dryer is handy in the event you want fresh towels and they do offer a \"started kit\" of garbage bags, detergent, paper towels, tissues, toilet paper & dishwasher soap. This kit was suffice, aside from a few extra garbage bags & a good sponge for the dishes. The East Village is the closest to the Disney resorts and and clear days you could see the fireworks! The West Village Club house has gone through some good renovations and at the time of my stay they were still in renovations and redoing the large West Village Pool. I have 4 kids and they enjoyed the game room, free movie \"theater\" and free popcorn offered at the clubhouse. Splash Lagoon is a great alternative to the River Island. We only visited River Island once, it was A LOT of fun by VERY crowded. It seems people would come out at 8 AM and reserve lounge chairs. We arrived at 9:30 and saw very slim pickings. The lazy river is a lot of fun, and great for relaxing. The required rental tube (you can't use your own) are $7-10 but that is nothing compared to what you would pay at the water parks. The cabana's at the River Island were overpriced at $100 a day!. Also, we had small items stolen at the River Island pool (sand toys & baby floats).Pool parking at River Island is also hard to find past 11 AM. Splash Lagoon & the smaller East Village Pools are more \"family friendly\". I would also avoid River Island Units as they are currently constructing new buildings in that area and you can hear construction noise. The front desk staff didn't have a clue on what was going on, event-wise. We got a different answer for everything. Pickup a resort schedule when you check in for resort events. I would definitely come back and recommend to a friend. The resort has good amenities and activities and is a great break from the crowded parks.

We stayed at building 4, Unit 2508 week of March 28th, Fri to Fri check in/out. Here are the plus and minuses: I was going with the assumption that it was going to be miserable and I even warned my family ahead of time that if it was a dive, then we will go back home. I called RCI several times and called Orange Lake several times begging to stay in the Eastside or in the refurbished rooms. Of course, they will not guarantee and say they will put a request in. When we checked in, we were informed from the check in clerk that when you do call Orange Lake, they can put you into a room, of course it will be in West Village but it could be done..especially if you call soon enough even though they say it is up to the checkin people at the resort....Well, we were placed in a refurbished unit. The Bad: Parking is outdoors and the elevators to the unit are in great need of cleaning. Looks like someone spilled dark drinks on the walls and its left there stained. Garbage bins on each floor in front of the elevator is not pleasant to see or smell, especially after a long hot day at the parks and returning home to see that and smell it. Of course, its not like that all the time, sometimes we get lucky and someone on the grounds actually empties it out. Our building was on the third floor of five floors I think and our unit faced 192 which is the main drag to Disney. Its the older section of town back in the day before all the resort style hotels were ever built. I can also compare to Pidgeon Forge, or 441 in Fort Lauderdale..for those of you who may be familiar. Anyway, our building is the first set right when you turn into the resort and at night, you can hear the cars go by, which isn't too bad, but it is bad when the truckers honk their horns early in the morning or all the emergency vehicles that go by, at least once or twice early in the morning. Whoever stayed above us, sounded like they were moving furniture every single night but it soon dies down and then it's pretty quiet. We also faced part of the golf course, so be prepared for maintenance workers working on site at 8 am ..so if you want to sleep in, it's kind of hard. The Good: The Unit is nothing to look at from the outside, but once you walk in, its clearly a different story. Nice long hallway. Master bedroom on the right, with a king size bed and its own bathroom. Nice size bathroom with a jacuzzi tub/shower enclosure. To the left is another small hallway with its own door, that separates the second bedroom which contained two queen size bed, its own flat screen t.v. and out in front, is a bathroom with a tub/shower. The door can be closed giving complete privacy to the second bedroom user. My daughter liked this a lot. Before reaching the second door to the second bedroom, there is a closet which has the stacked washer and dryer. All bathrooms are in dark brown with black granite, nicely decorated aand smelled extremely cleaned and new construction like smell. Kitchen very nice with brand new appliances and brand new kitchen ware. Furniture in the eating area and living room very new and comfortable. It was a pleasure to come home every evening. We thoroughly got lucky and enjoyed our stay. If I could be guaranteed this unit again, I would definately come back. I could see that the one story units looked very old and the furniture was old wicker. Oh, for those that like to drink coffee outside, there was a very large screened in patio which was accessible from the master bedroom as well as the living room area. If you trade your unit, call Orange Lake directly and very sweetly tell them your concern and ask to be placed in the refurbished section..like ours 2580. They can do it, even if they say no guarantee. When I checked in, they said, let's see where they put you because we are at full capacity and I don't think we can change it..so it can be done. 192 traffic can be pretty bad, with bumper to bumper traffic so be patient. It was very hot there this week, but I had a nice time with the family and was so greatful to be placed in a nice unit. If all the units looked like mine, on the inside, it gets gold crown, outside, I would say silver. Hopefully, they will upgrade all the older units for everyone to enjoy. I did not use any of the facilites so I cannot comment on those. I was however, very greatful to be placed so close to the entrance making entering and exiting quite easy as I could so how large this place was.

But, in a nutshell, the 1 week stay, with our grown children and 2 grandboys, was EXCEPTIONALLY good. Seven of us were in unit 2520 and I've concluded that the West Village \"2500\" units are all rennovated and our 2BR was outstanding -- sparkling clean, spacious, upgraded with beautiful new furnishings, appliances, floor coverings and decor (even a new large flat-screen HDTV). Everything in the kitchen and bathrooms was brand new- the countertops, sinks, faucets, etc.! These units are just inside the main gate; however, they overlook the golf course and the highway noise was not a problem. This turned out to be a bonus for us because we were in and out of the resort so much and didn't have to drive far to our unit. One of the pools (good for kids) was just across the parking lot. We booked thru RCI and all RCI guests get the West Village...not a problem, but I'd suggest you call the resort about 10 days ahead and kindly request an assignment to the \"2500 units\". They are in the process of upgrading West Village (the oldest area) and have started at the front. Then tell them to put a note on the assignment \"do not move\". If the clerk will do it, you've got it made!! The staff was extremely competent, friendly and helpful. Check-in (20-30 min. during prime time) and express check-out (instant) was efficiently handled. My wife left a clutch purse (containing 2 pr. glasses and a watch)at one of the pools and 2 days later checked at the Island Trader in the River Village to see if it had been turned in. The very helpful staff gal (sorry I didn't get her name) actually remembered seeing this clutch purse in the Sun Shop at the North Village! She was given permission by her boss, Cynthia, to leave her post of duty and meet me at that shop, along with a security person, and unlock it since it had closed for the day! My wife met them there and, sure enough, there was the clutch purse with all its contents! This is going beyond the call of duty as far as I'm concerned!!! All the staff was outstanding. We did have to call for linens for the sofa bed, but they accommodated that immediately and called back the next day to double-check. The phone did ring each morning but we took the phone off the hook at night, having been warned about a Timeshare talk. At check-in, there was no real push for a Timeshare presentation after I politely told them No Thanks. A car is needed to get to the River Island, etc. and the other pools which are also great for kids. The grounds are beautiful and clean. There are plenty of restaurants within 2 miles right outside the gate and the resort is only 10 minutes to all the Disney parks. Do not be alarmed about bad reviews, if you can get an updated West Village unit. We wish we would have had more time to spend at the resort but our reason for being there was to go to Disney which we did on 5 days. We did spend one lovely day at River Island pool (loved the lazy river-just resign to the fact that the float tubes have to be rented; our grandkids were too small for the slides) and North Village pool- great for kids. The only restaurant we ate at was the Legacy Grill in the East Village and the food was very good. The Publix on-ground is handy and quick but we drove to Super Wal-Mart to get the bulk of our groceries for better prices. Houlihan's across the street, next to McDonald's, has a great breakfast buffet for $5.99.

We had a great room with a full kitchen and a washer and dryer which, although very noisy, came in handy for small loads every day. Bathroom counter area was small. The best part was walking down the stairs and through the gate and we were at the pool/lazy river in less than a minute. We did notice may people driving from other villages to RI which we would not want to do. I am a runner and ran around the whole complex numerous times and all the areas were beautiful and very well maintained. We rented a car and got around very easily to the Disney parks. One of the greatest money-savers for us was the Publix grocery store on-site. It has absolutely everything you could possibly need and more. We bought groceries and ate breakfast every morning in our room and lunch most days as well before we went to the parks. This and the large suite made us feel much more at home than a regular hotel room. We don't care for much interaction with staff or other guests when we travel so we found this very comfortable. As other reviewers have said, there is plenty to do and you could spend your entire time there with your family and not even go to the parks. They even have Starbucks on site. The \"fast food\" from Anchors was quite good quality. We ate at the Legacy Grille one night and the food wasn't exciting or inexpensive so we ate dinners at the parks or off-site for the rest of our stay - many restaurants within a 5 minute drive. One staff member did tell us that they are building two more buildings at RI over the next couple of years which we could see are very close to the current building. I'm not sure if they've started yet, but it will be very noisy I'm sure so be sure to ask before booking and stay at the other end of the building. Overall, an excellent stay.

Overall the room was very clean and appeared to be in good repair. To comment on some of the other reviews: The resort is definately huge. We never did see the actual lake on the property. The East village is within a mile of the River City water park/shops and can be easily walked. There are sidewalks throughout the property. It would be a hike to get to the West Village from the East however. Someone commented that it was hard to get to due to traffic. Anything on 192 in Kissimmee is hard to get to due to traffic. Particularly when the theme parks are letting out. Orange Lake is on the less congested side of 192 and has easy access to I-4 and route 27 within a few miles. We opted out of the sales meeting breakfast. We were not contacted again during the course of the week by anyone on the staff. There were phone messages left about resort activities not none were sales pitches. I will say that the resort nickle and dimes you. The Lazy River floats are $7 for one and $10 for a double for the day. Mini Golf is $10 a head although you can get a family pass good for a week of mini golf for $40. The Treasure Cove arcade is expensive with most games costing nearly $1 to play. They do it with points on a card so you get 50 points for $1 and then the games cost anywhere from 38 to 80 something points to play. Most were 42 points. Overall it was a great stay.

The gentleman assured me we would be in a \"Newly refurbished\" West village unit. The check in process was very quick, I was concerned because I had heard this was a lengthy process. We told them we would not attend there \"FREE\" breakfast and he pushed for us to go (claiming this is how he makes his money), we simply stated no.

The room was not refurbished...simply repainted, but still very outdated.

The pots and pans were falling apart, the screws were loose on the handles, we asked the handyman who came to fix the shower for a screwdriver and fixed the pots ourselves. The sheets were however clean, that was a nice touch. Don't even think about miniature golf there it was $10.00 a person and definitely not worth it.

We complained that we needed to be nearer to a pool, and were ultimately moved to an area close to a small back pool that we could access by foot, after we were told that any rooms near to the main pool area were full.

At a different restaurant, night two, our waitress told us her life story in between taking our order... answered requests with..\"YUP\".. as she continued to walk by, never asked if we needed anything, forgot to bring us our requested second round of drinks, and threw away the left overs we asked to have wrapped up. As we left a restaurant, a new employee was leaving at the same time, asking other employees about signing out.... \"I know they want us to, but I never do....just call in a time tomorrow.\" I wondered what was up with the management that had produced such poor service and such poor attitudes!

The use of the mini golf,.... the large balloon slide,... even the lazy river all come at an additional fee, leaving a visitor feeling taken advantage of.

The shuttles are not marked so your not sure which shuttle to get on as to where you want to go.

Ample pool chairs at the pool, golf courses are gorgeous and well groomed. My husband said they are challenging yet fun. Also we had a challenge with the consistency of the answers we received from employees as to how to get around.

I had read the Travel reviews prior to leaving, which recommended avoiding the West Village. We called in advance to request not to be put there but were told we could not prearrange this. Fortunately, we were placed in a 2 bedroom unit in the East Village and found the accomodations to be really quaint & nice!! We arrived at the Orange Lake Resort (drove in from NC) at around 1 PM and had to stand in a bothersome line to wait to register - an employee gleefully said if we were \"owners\" the wait would be minimal. After about a 45-60 minute process we were told the room would be ready after 4PM so we headed off to Epcot (I had ordered our 7-day park hopper passes well in advance and had them on-hand). BTW - they are renovating the reception/check-in area (located in West Village) so I was glad to not be staying in their. The assistance about Disney from the service counter was very good and helped during the registration delay! Unfortunately, when we went back arounfd 10PM to get our room keys we had to wait in a line again (no express for those already checked in). East Village is very nice. We were on the 6th floor overlooking the golf-course. The unit had two bedrooms, two bathrooms (MBR had a nice whirlpool bath), a large kitchen with eat at counter, living room and dining area, plus a screened in porch. Also, East Village was nicely located as there was a seperate entrance/exit that was closer to Disney on 192 . We were typically not at the resort much except Christmas morning - we took a small Christmas tree and decorations and some presents and spent a couple of hours in the suite doing Christmas and breakfast. Disney World was great...so beautifully decorated. Even though the parks were busy we never felt crowded except when a main event was happening (like the parades or fireworks). We thoroughly enjoyed using the fast-pass system, which tremendously helped us plan our days. Highlights were Cirque Du Soleih, which was unbelievable as was the Candlelight choir at Epcot and the Harlem Choir at MGM. We also took tme to tour Disney's top 4 resorts and had a reasonably priced great lunch at the Floridian (gorgeous!!)

If you can get GPS with your rental car or bring a portable one along, we did and it made all the difference. We made the mistake of arriving at night, check in is at a temporary location in West Village due to construction. We were expecting this because Orange Lake called up prior to arrival to let us know, which was appreciated. West Village and River Island are divided by a highway, so once you check in you have to go back out of one section past the highway and turn into a vaguely marked area to get to River Island, not so fun/easy in the dark. We followed the sign to River Island but it took us the long way around to the condos which were marked 81000. Our condo was 81502, no building marked as such. We decided to see what was inside 81000 and once inside learned 81502 was in fact located in that building on the fifth floor. The 2 bedroom condo was clean, with a good view of River Island. No complaints on the condo or River Island. On Monday evening, the televisions suddenly stopped working. Called the front desk, maintenance, all the numbers for the resort and just got a busy signal. Since we wanted to see Monday Night Football, we went to the Legends Lounge, they had dish network and learned that all the cable in the resort had gone out. Would have liked to hear from someone at the Front Desk or from a recording. Had a great time with my 13 yr old son using the pool area and arcade. We ate at River Island Grilling, the food was delicious, the service was very slow, we were one of three families in the restaurant and it took 30 minutes to get our sandwiches. The Connections Lounge/computers etc. personnel were very friendly and helpful. They are putting up another building next to the River Island condos so it was quite noisy for most of the day, we only noticed for one day because we were at the parks most of the time. We were told we wouldn't have any maid service and returned back one day to find that our room was serviced and we left everything out, fortunately nothing was taken but dirty pillowcases were left on our son's bed. Went to the timeshare presentation, which was only supposed to be an hour was closer to 2 hours but the discounted tickets were worth it because I really know how to say \"no thanks\". Even though we are already owners at another resort, they tried to give the hard sell and actually told a few lies. If we weren't already owners, we might have fallen for it. I would pass the resort shuttle service. My hubby golfed at Legends (this was the only course open which we didn't find out until he called from home to make a tee time. If you are considering using the courses, call ahead to check on course availability) and was told by three separate shuttles they weren't going to River Island, so it was a long wait. The resort is so large that you would need to rely on the shuttle or drive to other Villages. We were so busy with the parks that we didn't so back to the West Village side. I heard there are tennis courts, basketball courts and a beach area but after a day at the parks, we just didn't feel like driving back over to the West Village. The Publix supermarket is close to River Island, not walking distance, they had a good selection, nice fresh sushi area and deli, the prices were similar to Los Angeles prices, no big difference. As we were packing to leave at 7:30am, check out is at 10am, Housekeeping rang our doorbell to ask what time we were checking out, I mentioned that since check out is at 10am, we would be checking out at 10am. We have been to quite a few places and have never had Housekeeping inquire about our departure, that was really the last straw. We won't be returning to Orange Lake, there are too many resorts in the Kissimmee/Orlando area to put up with mediocrity.

It was great however the Lazy River complex is promoted & the perception given is that it is big & beautiful, it's not very big at all! We went in mid-Nov & it was very quiet we consequently had a lovely time playng in the water etc however I'd hate to go in a busy time as there just isn't enought to do; it actually states pool capacity is 46 this is for the pool with the only water slide which is very short (approx 20ft) yet there are approx 200+ sunbeds around the area - even with it being very quiet the children (ours included) were heading for the slide & due to the lack of any lifeguard some children & their adult compaions were being very stupid & standing up on each other & surfing - this doesn't help when you're explaining to a three year old how to play-safely. The whole resort is immaculate it looks like a pretty film set & is pleasant & welcoming. We brought our Disney tickets using the offer promoted to us that if we went to a one hour talk we'd get the discount, we weighed it up & decided to attend however wished we hadn't bothered not only did they waffle on for too long,(3 hours+) it was a very hard sell & ended with the salesman insulting my father & basicaly because we had no intention of purchasing becuase we own a timeshare locally in the UK (where we use the sports facitlites all year) they were really rude. It put a big dampener on the day & ruined our pleasant perception of the place. We had stayed at Orange Lake about fifteen years ago & it was actualy better then as it seems they have got too big & although efficient at their job they have lost the personal touch - you are just another punter they hope to sell a timeshare to. Location is great for getting to the attractions. Another point is we hired our cars from Dollar at the airport, if there is a big que when you get to the rental desk, go across to the other terminal, we hired a trolley boy & he was worth his weight in gold; on his advise we changed terminals to a Dollar desk with no que we would have had to wait approx two hours in the original que. Also we needed two car seats, we hired them from Dollar for one night then went to Walmart & brought two to use for the duration of the hoiday it was far cheaper than hire & we just gave them away at the airport on the way home.

The pools in the North Village are perfect for families with young children. We also had a great time in the Lazy River at River Island. The resort is big and you have to drive most places. Definitely request a room close to the pool if you plan to do a lot of swimming. Disney is also easy to get to, only a 10 minute drive. Having a 7 day Disney Pass we found it hard to decide which we'd rather do, stay the day at Disney or go back to the resort. The kids almost always said lets go back and go swimming.

The resort as a whole is extremly large and unless you have a car you must either take the bus or walk. If you walk you definately will get your exercise. Our accomodations faced the golf course located on the East Village, so it was very quite, relaxing with a pretty view. That said, you should first know not to go to the Publix market located at the entrance as you will leave your weeks fun money their. Take the time to go further down to Rt 27 and go to the Super Wal-mart, it is very large clean and has eveything that you will need for your kitchen. Make sure that you take the tour of the resort that is offered so that you can get a credit for the tubes, and a food/beverage credit. This will take a little time out of your first day, but will save you $250.00. The tubes otherwise are $7 per day and if you have a few children this quickly addes up. We saved $220.00 just by taking the tour. We did not buy and neither will you. The presentation is wonderful and the tour person we had was very sweet, but you can get a much better vacation booking trips on your own. The resort is only average, though they do try but they just miss the mark. We do a good deal of traveling as a family and we all agreed that this was only average. They need to have better service at the pools and golf carts instead of the bus would work out so much better for getting around the resort. If you are planning on staying between now and the spring of 2008 make sure that you ask to be put in either North or East Village. The West Village which is where you register on your day of arrival will make you want to get back on the plan and go home. They are in the middle of a very large renovation and have done a very poor job at making the area inviting. We never went back to this area once we checked in and neither will you. The rest of the resort is very pretty and you forget that all that ugliness exists at the beginning. If you are like us you will do well to go for a short drive to Celebrations just down the road. This is the planned community designed by Disney which was what saved our vacation. They have wonderful resturants the area is beautiful to walk, shop, go for an ice cream, take in a movie and just relax. They have everything set for Christmas right know and you get to forget all the craziness of Rt 192. The resturants at the resort are okay we ate at Legacy Grill and watched the football game, it is not fine dining. The wait staff is wonderful and the Grill very relaxing, the food was fine for what we wanted this particular evening. We had breakfast here as well one morning and our children liked it, especially since we sat outside and watched the golfers. But, if you are looking for fine dining which we want in the evening then you can only find that in Celebrations. You would also will do better to get your tickets for any of the attractions on-line prior to leaving. They say that they have discounted tickets at the resort, but on-line is still the way to go. If you are going with children and they want to play mini-golf, it also costs, as does everything there. The golf will set you back almost $30 for three players and the hippo slide is another $7 per pass per child. These are all the things that they do not tell you. If you are a guest at the resort all of these things should be included. Everywhere else we traveled all the activities on the property are included. Sometimes ,you will have to pay a small fee, but not like at Orange Lake. I hope that this helps the next traveler to Orange Lake, as I read the reviews prior to leaving and it made our trip so much smoother. By know what you are getting yourself into prior and are prepared your vacation will be relaxing. We had a good time because we were prepared, but we all agreed that \" TOP NOTCH\" accomodations are not what you are going to fined at Orange Lake. It is much better than staying right in Disney, but as far as vacations go this was and will only be your average type of vacation. Enjoy and remember just say \"NO\" to the time-share pressures, they make it all sound so wonderful, but you are only buying a week and a specific week at that.

I would sit down prior to reading this. This was the worst resort I've ever been to. Upon checking in, the resort looked very nice. The grass was mowed. Shrubs were trimmed and it seemed like a pretty nice place. When I made my reservation I asked for a unit as close to A pool as possible. Well we were no where close to a pool. It was at least a half mile to the closest pool and the resort doesn't provide shuttle service off their planned shuttle route. So we walked to and from the pool toting both kids. When we get to the NEW pool (after a 40 minute wait for the shuttle) the life guards informed me that my 5 year old, swimming son was too short to go on the free slide but I could pay $13 for an HOUR at the \"Hippo\". Keep in mind that the day before my son rode Space Mountain at Disney World with no problems. This same day it was a little over cast and NONE of the dining facilities were open. When I asked a manager why she told me it looked like it was going to rain so they chose to not open for the entire day! Even though this is Florida (it rains in buckets) and the pool was packed. Also there were SWARMS of bugs called Lovebugs. Apparently they are a genitically modified bug that was created by a grad student (science project gone very wrong!). They are worst in the spring but I found them to be incredibly annoying and will avoid central Florida in the future during these times(spring and fall) Now here is the worst part of my entire stay. On Thursday of our Sat to Sat stay I got a call from my credit card inquiring about fradulent charges. When I checked in I get the from desk my cc for incidentals and with in a half an hour someone was using it to buy shoes on ebay, a family history on some website, concert tickets and a bunch of stupid things. Well the moron had everything sent to their home address! I called the police and I plan on pressing charges. Now when I call the Front desk to talk to a manager about all of this they get me Jose who really didn't speak english! He flat out called me a liar and hung up on me. At this point I lost it and took a little jog down to the front desk to deal with Jose face to face. When I got there I was told the only Jose that worked at the resort was in grounds maintence. Little wonder he didn't speak english! This place sucks! I'd stay away.

Let me say that all the different areas of Orange Lake have their charms. We've stayed in the West Village and enjoyed the quiet of a detatched Golf villa. While these units are the oldest, we have never been disapointed with the accomodations. For families with kids, it's actually nice to have a back yard the kids can run around in. We noticed many workers around the west village units backing what we've heard about all these units being agressively upgraded. We've also stayed in the North Village which was really nice. My point is, that while it seems everyone tries to get into River Island, in my opinion, the other villages are nicer they 90% of the other timeshares in the Orlando area (we've stayed at several). Now, about our last stay. Let me start by saying there is another building going up at River Island. Workers start at 7am sharp, and this can be on the loud side. We stayed in a 3 bedroom on the 8th floor and happened to be the end unit directly across from the work area. Luckily we have small children that were up at 7am anyway because sleeping late with the construction noise was not an option. The fact that no one tells you this when you book your vacation may be a source of irritation to people who like to sleep in. The front desk did offer to move us to another village, but we decided to stay where we were. The rooms at River Island are REALLY nice. We've stayed at many timeshares, and haven't seen better. I won't bother talking about the pool at RI, other then to repeat what others have said....it's awesome. I heard they invested $85Mill in this \"water park\" and it shows. The kids had a hard time picking between Disney, or the Pool...it's that good. The man made beach area was a great place for the kids to play, out of the pool, while we had a few drinks in the hammocks. The two pool bars and Restaurant were also a wonderful convenience to have outside your door, and If your kids like arcades, the one in the RI main building is great, with all new machines, unlike a lot of the run down arcades I've seen at other resorts. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you have kids on rainy day it's a life saver.

Went to the Gatorland Show which encouraged us to visit Gatorland another day - glad we did as it was one of the best experiences for the kids.

This was an RCI exchange that I booked in January of 2007. A few days before we arrived, I called Orange Lake to verify our reservation (they had our reservations) and at that time I politely requested any where other than West Village if it were possible. I was polite with my request and did not make it a demand. No guarantees were made to me during that call. I thanked the gentlman on the phone for his time. Upon our arrival, we went to check in at the temporary check in office (new building is still under construction) and got in with not much of a wait. They have kid games outside with loud music cranked - this was tacky to me and cheapened the resort to a county fair carnival atmosphere. Also, I won't leave our kids with strangers so this type of arrangement where you dump your kids and then go register wasn't an option for our family. We were pleasantly informed that we'd be staying in the East Village and I thanked the gentleman. We were given maps and sent to the next line where you get your parking pass and room keys and get hit up for a tour of the resort. We booked a tour and then cancelled later just so we could \"get on with it\" or other wise we might have been trapped. We drove to our east village unit and were thrilled with the accomodations. Two bedrooms, two baths, nice sized kitchen and living room with attractive furnishings and decor. We also had a nice washer and dryer which we used often. Part of the deal with staying at a time share is you wash your own towels (this is not a big deal) as so many of the reviewers have complained about this. You pay what you pay by NOT having some maid come daily, otherwise, you'd not be able to afford staying here -plain and simple! I'd give up maid service daily for more space anytime on vacation. It's wonderful not to have four people crammed into one room for a vacation. I was offered maid service during our stay because we were there for more than a week. We chose not to and cleaned the unit ourselves, using clorox wipes we bought and ran the sweeper that was in the unit. We took care of our unit as if it were our own home. This is something I think is lacking in some of the Orange Lake attendees. The evidence of this was in the open air halls where it looks like people have let trash dribble all over the hall on the way to the trash chute. People should double bag their trash if it is leaky. I can't imagine owning here and then mis-treating my timeshare like that. Some people are just disrespectful and sloppy. We used the pools at River Island. They are gorgeous and very big. We ate at River Island Grilling and at Legends Sports bar. Both were nice. We did the mini - golf (very fun) and we walked around a lot and enjoyed the wildlife. We also had a spectacular view of the Space Shuttle Launch from the golf course outside our unit. That was truly amazing. I never viewed the interior of a West Village unit - I would not like the ones near the West Village Clubhouse only because I would not like all the noise and the traffic. We stayed in building 86400 and it was so nice and quiet at night. Very peaceful for sleeping. It was our home away from home for 10 days. We had a rental car and driving to Disney was a cinch and took very little time. We had a GPS unit with our car rental which takes away the hassle of maps. We never got lost. If you are staying at the resort you WILL want a car. I would not like to wait for a shuttle. When I say the resort is huge it is HUGE!! It is like it's own city. We used the Publix for our groceries. It was clean and had a pretty good variety. It might be a little more pricey but it sure was convenient. All in all I would give Orange Lake a 9 out of 10.

You need to get in the car to get anywhere within the complex itself. River Island gets very busy on warm days, and the inner tubes for the lazy river cost $7.50 per day (or $10 for a double). Splash Lagoon is quieter and all in all much nicer. The 50m pool and West Village club house were being 'remodelled' but no-one had bothered to warn us, The on site resturants are expensive in comparison with what you can get just 5 minutes down the road. The nearest supermarket (Publix) is only just off site - on Orange Lake owned land I think - and it's expensive compared to standard Wal-Mart. Internet access is expensive ($8 per hour) and only available at river island. Staff at the business centre were just not interested in serving the customers. Our apartment in North Village was spacious and clean - but no hooks to hang caps, swimming gear etc. on (sounds daft but drove us mad). Well equipped kitchen except no scissors !!!! But the worst was the hard hard sell of time share. We were invited to a 'tour and breakfast' which we were assured would 'start at 10 be in the pool by 11'. We (somehow) were also persuaded to part with $20 at the time we agreed to the tour which we weren't quite sure what for (see later). All this happened as we checked in amidst the temporary tents and building site that is currently West Village. We wanted the tour to see what was there so took up the invitation. But the tour was just a quick skip up the road in a golf cart while a sales man talked continuous nonsense to us. Breakfast was coffee and muffins. The $20 it turned out was for a 'gift' so if we didn't stay the length of the sales pitch we didn't get the gift - but we weren't sure if that meant we lost our $20 or not. The sales guy was so convinced that he'd made us an offer we couldn't refuse he hadn't even bothered to ask about our income or even if we wanted to go back to the same place on holiday all the way across the Atlantic year after year. When said we weren't interested and we wanted to go he got most offended and made out that we were trying to get something for nothing (breakfast, 'free' gift). 2 and a half hours after starting the 'tour' we eventually got away with our 'gift' which was a weeks worth of inner tubes at lazy river for 4.

After reading all of the horror stories regarding RCI trades, I was worried. I had called the resort and RCI ahead of time with my concerns and asked to request another Village, was told no by both parties, stating that RCI only owned in the West Village. About 2 weeks prior, the resort called me to tell me about the construction, etc, and I again expressed my concerns about the West Village units. The person I spoke to this time did put in a request for me, when we actually got there, they honored my request, but told me that he was not actually supposed to do that. Check in was smooth, however very crowded, since it was prime time on a Saturday. Although construction is going on at the front of the resort, they manage to keep it organized. We never laid eyes on the inside of a West Village unit, we stayed in a 2BR East Village unit which was very nice and spacious. MBR had a king bed with a master bath with a jacuzzi tub, 2nd BR has 2 queen beds and another bathroom. Washer, dryer, full kitchen living room and dining room. Although the resort was very well maintained, it was HUGE, almost too big, you could not get to much of anything without a car. River Island was nice, however we liked the pool at the North Village much better. River Island is very pretty with the landscaping, but the way the pool is set up, you cannot see your kids unless they are right in front of you. We ate at both restaurants, very good food, maybe a little pricey. On Sunday, the Legacy Grille had every football game on different TVs, you just told them your team and they sat you where that TV was, my husband loved that! The resort is very close to Disney, maybe 5 minutes. We only went to the Animal Kingdom and Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party, which was AWESOME! We got to the park at 4pm (that was the earliest you could enter if you only had tickets to the event) and the most wait we had was maybe 10 minutes max. The parade was great too, definitely worth seeing. Overall, the resort is very nice and I think we lucked out on NOT getting the West Village, from what I was told, all of the units will be remodeled by February of 2008, and the rest of the resort under construction will be done sometime in 2008.

A friend has a timeshare through RCI, so we decided to go for a week, and were able to get condos very inexpensively. We rented four. They would not promise that we could all be together, but when we arrived, they did put us all side by side. It was wonderful, because we could leave the patio doors unlocked, and the kids (and adults) could run back and forth betweeen condos very easily. We were in the West Village, units 2043 - 2046. These are definately older units. Ours were all two bedrooms, with two full baths. (no Jacuzzi's) The units are quite large, with full kitchen, dining room with table for six, living room with couch, love seat, and chair. Back patios had two chairs, table, and lounge chair. Comfortable even if a bit shabby. They give you a little package of stuff when you arrive in your unit - three rolls of toilet tissue (plus what was already on the rolls), dish soap, trash bags, dishwasher detergent, laundry soap,coffee for one day, and 7 coffee filters. We had to buy another packet of laundry soap, but it was only $2 at the convenience store at River Island. Publix is outside the East gate for food, but they WAY over charge for everything, so be prepared. All the water parks were great. There are extra charges for things, but i really don't think it was bad. We shared tubes, and even though it states that you can't bring in food and drinks, everyone did. (sandwiches and soda) No one ever checks or polices. Plenty of towels to be had at each pool area. The River Island Grille and the Legacy Bar both had good food. The pizza was ok. Very overpriced for what you get. My husband and two others golfed a few days, and said it was good. (right out the back door - literally!) Pelicans, cranes, herons, all kinds of birds out the back door too every morning. Great to watch while sipping my coffee. I would definatelly recommend a car, even for in the resort, it's much quicker and parking is no problem at all. The timeshare talk is a total joke. It is definately 3 hours of sell. Breakfast is a muffin or a donut and a beverage. The \"coupons\" etc, can be gotten at any ticket booth or hotel in Orlando. The one good thing was $50 in food vouchers for the restaurants on the resort. I would seriously recommend not going to the talk if you don't want to buy. It's just not worth the time.

Some items need replacing, such as the blender, hairdryer, etc. but a very nice place overall. My only complaint would be the size of the resort. The villages are spaced quite a distance from each other which becomes an issue if you want to spend a lot of time in the different pool areas.

Our unit was #2019 in the West Village and was a disappointment from the start. The two bedroom unit was nowhere the value of what we traded in, no whirlpool tub in the master bedroom, no Lanai or screened in porch, the lovebugs were just horrific and you couldn't sit outside and enjoy yourselves because they were all over everything. The master bedroom had water stains on the ceiling and you could see where the ceiling had already been repaired. The back deck was strewn with debris from the trees and didn't look like it had been cleaned before we arrived because my wife swept it when we got there and it stayed fairly clean for the week that we were there. We moved the sofa only to find a lot of dirt on the floor under the sofa which we vacuumed because obviously their housekeeping did not do a good job before we arrived, that's if they cleaned it at all. We attended a sales presentation with Ralph who asked us to have an open mind for his sales presentation. When I complained to Ralph about our accomodations, he replied that it was RCI and not the resort that was responsible because RCI apparantely requests their exchanges to be located in the West Village which is the oldest part of the resort. Even though I told Ralph that I had a bad taste in my mouth about our accomodations and I would have a hard time to keep an open mind, he did absolutely nothing to try to satisfy us but casually continued on with his sales presentation. One would think that if a resort is trying to sell you a timeshare, they would place you in one of their newer units; however, the closest we got to a new unit was in the walkthrough the model unit with Ralph. We are very skeptical about using RCI again, because in listening to and reading more reviews, it appears that it is routine for RCI to place their exchanges in the oldest units and rips people off and there is no recourse or any apology from RCI.

Another family member owns the 3BR Tennis Villa unit we stayed in. All I can say is \"WOW\"... this resort has everything you can imagine. Yes, it is very large and you definitely need a car to get around. We knew this in advance so it wasn't a problem for our group. I am noticing a pattern that most of the negative reviews come from people who went through the timeshare presentation. We were also notified of this in advance and didn't answer the unit phone once. Upon check-in they asked my husband if he wanted to attend a presentation and he politely declined... they politely accepted. The unit: Our unit was a 3 bedroom which was unbelievably spacious! There was more than enough room for our party... Again, it might be inconvenient for some people to not have daily maid service.... but we were properly informed... so this was not a surprise to us. The location in the Tennis Villa was perfect! Just a short walk to the clubhouse and the pool area. I understand it is under construction now but it was a fantastic location for us at the time of our visit. The property: The resort is absolutely huge. All of the different areas have their own \"personality\". The River Island area is really nice. The kids (and adults!) had fun floating around and swimming in the pools. Splash Lagoon was our favorite area. This wasn't as busy as River Island as it is not quite as new. The little waterslide was perfect for kids! The spray park was nice for the little ones, too. The golf courses looked really beautiful. We packed so much into our schedule that we didn't get to play... this time! All of the grounds and walkways were meticulously cared for. Its hard to touch on everything because there is just so much to do and see! I feel like we didn't even scratch the surface of this resort! The only problem we encountered on this trip was when we attempted to go to the River Island Grilling Company. We went there and asked how long the wait was. They told us 20 minutes so we took turns walking the kids around the River Island complex. About 30 minutes later we asked when our table would be ready. They told us it would be AT LEAST another FIFTY minutes!? We explained that 30 minutes ago they said it would be 20 minutes.... etc... They didn't feel bad at all which rubbed me the wrong way. We ended up leaving because it was way too late for the kids at this point. Again, that was the only problem we encountered at OLCC... and that had to do with restaurant staff / management... not the resort. We loved this resort so much that we ended up buying a week after we got home. A little tip for you that I learned... you can buy timeshare units on resale and save a TON of money! (Of course you always need to be sure you are working with a reputable company!) I highly recommend this resort to any family traveling to Orlando.

I'm now 15 and let me say, I'll never stay anywhere else in the Orlando/Kissimmee area. The resort is absolutley beautiful. There are several pools and even a water park now. This place is fabulous if you're traveling with teens. There are so many things for your teen to do and you don't have to be with them. They have teen partys, there's a movie theater, mini-golf, an arcade and the best part is.... you don't have to drive to them. Just hop on the shuttle bus and it'll take you wherever in the resort you want to go and it's free. I've never seen any insect there and even if there was it's Florida, Florida has bugs just like the rest of the world, but personally I've never seen any. The resort is very clean, my parents own a timeshare in the newly built East Village and it is gorgeous. I hear that if you go through RCI, then you automatically go to the West Village which is kinda outdated (hint hint, don't go through RCI) but overall the rest of the resort is very nice. They have restaraunts and so many things to do as a family also. And the best part, it's like 10 minutes away from both Disney and Universal Studios. Orange Lake also has it's own highway that goes directly over the normal road and straight to Disney. Getting to Disney on the main road takes forever because everyones in the ares isgoing there, but since Orange Lake has it's own road it takes a lot less time because it's just the people from Orange Lake going there. The staff is very nice but I do agree, don't go to the seminar about buying a timeshare. Only if you do intend to buy should you because they are kind off pushy for you to buy but other than that the staff is very nice and helpful. Which trust me once you get there, you;ll autpmatically want to buy. The resort is pretty big so I wouldn't recommend trying to walk from the East Village to the West Village (tried it at like 1:30 in the morning with my friend, had to wake my mom up to come get us, that was interesting) but definatly bring like a bike or skates. Also all the rooms are smoking free, which means...... now smoky smelling room when you walk in which is very good, because there's nothing like walking into a room full of smoke as soon as you get off an airplane with recycled air. And if you like golf, this is definatly the place for you. Some place don't even have a golf course but orange lake lol my dad jokes around and says Orange Lake is a golf course with villas on it. Instead of it being a resort with golf courses. Overall this resort is definatly one of the best I've ever been to. Staying at this resort is a privledge really. My friends own a timeshare at Westgate which is down the street. Compared to Orange Lake it's really garbage. It's my favorite place in the world and I don't think any place will break that record.

We stayed at Orange Lake Resort August 19-26th 2007. The summer season dramatically drops at this time so the resort had a comfortable amount of guests. I chose the Orange Lake resort under a guest certificate through RCI. I have to admit that I came very close to cancelling my booking after reading several very scary online reviews of this resort. However, in the end I decided to stick with it and try out the property. I am a very discriminating traveller who is used to staying in 5 star/diamond resorts. I take note of the small details when it comes to hotel and restaurants. The check in process at Orange Lake was quite fast, painless albeit a little rushed and impersonal. It literaly took only about 2 minutes to check in. During check-in, my daughter enjoyed the kids welcome cart (face painting, animal balloons, popcorn and lemonade). This is a nice little treat they have set up, however I did notice on the schedule that the kids welcome is only set up at certain times. I was then directed to \"marketing\" to obtain my parking pass. This is where they try to lure you in for a timeshare presentation with the reward of free attraction passes. The gentleman was nice enough in his bid and let me get on my way once I explained that I wasn't interested. We were given a two bedroom/two bath unit located in the East village overlooking one of the golf courses. The buildings in the east village are six story complexes which look like small apartment complexes. The drive to the unit was a little lengthy, however the scenery along the way is nice as all of the grounds are very well kept. Upon entering our complex, I noticed that the elevator and outside hallways definitely need to be cleaned a little more often. Even though the hallways are outside and subject to the elements (dust/dirt/bugs, etc...), it is a shame that they are not maintained to the same standard as the grounds. I have to say that I was EXTREMELY relieved when I opened the door to our unit. It was very nice and cool (ac worked great)! I was extremely impressed with how spacious it was (approx 1000 sq feet). It was very clean including the bathrooms and kitchen. The appliances were in good shape however the dishwasher and washer/dryer definitely were on the noisy side (still bearable though). There was sufficient initial supplies and dishes, etc,, The unit was decorated in the bright Florida colours (Iblue and yellow), however still looked very nice and quite tasteful. One of my favorite features was the HUGE sectional couch in the living room. All four of us could sit on the couch quite comfortably at the same time. The living room TV was acceptable, however they should be looking at replacing the smaller TV's in the bedrooms as their age is starting to show in the picture quality. I checked the beds when we arrived, the bedding was of fairly good quality and the maitresses were clean, in good shape and were very comfortable (I'm VERY picky when it comes to bed quality. After all one of the most important aspects of a good stay is a good night sleep. The master bath had a huge spacious ensuite with a big jetted tub and separate shower. It was white, simple but nice and clean. There is a blow dryer available in the bathrooms, however they appear to be a little old and could probably use replacing. The patio was enclosed and had a beautiful view of the golf course. The only thing it was missing was a barbeque. My only complaint about the room would be the cushion on the eating table bar. It was a light color and VERY stained with food/drink spills, etc. So much so that we actually avoided sitting on it as it was quite disgusting. Again it's a shame that everything in the room is so nice, yet they don't take the time to recover a cushion that desperately needs it. I thought that we would receive a mid week cleaning and towel exchange but was advised that that only applied to stays over seven days. All in all, I would rate the suite an 8 out of 10. As far as the ammenities goes, Orange Lake rates quite high in my books. During our first night, we attended the Orange Lake welcome party at the \"West Village\" pool area. It was a great time, they had hula hoop competitions and dancing lessons along with prizes. Again it's all in the details, there were a few pool chairs that needed a good cleaning, I wasn't really interested in spending much time swimming at the West Village as it is starting to show its age. River Island and Splash Lagoon however are awesome. Very nice and very clean. There were lots of chairs available (again the season was winding down). The river is alot of fun for both adults and kids. My only pet peeve about the pools was that they only provided towels until 7 pm, yet the pools were open until 10 pm (the towels were pretty thin and cheep looking as well). I noticed that most of the resort \"activities\" were located at the West Village pool. We ate on property once, at the River Island Grilling Company. It was very good all in all. I would definitely eat there again. As far as the staff/Customer Service goes at Orange Lake, this is probably one of their weakest areas. I really didn't come across anyone who really went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Most of the staff seem to have a very curt and \"not really interested in helping you\" attitude. It really anoys me when staff are not properly trained to be professional and hospitable. A fiendly helpful voice and a smile goes a long way in my books and it appears that OL's employees are definitely lacking in this area. The only really nice employee I encountered was one of the Massage Therapists but he didn't actually work for Orange Lake. All in all, Orange Lake was a real hit in alot of areas like room quality/spaciousness and choice and quality of swimming facilitiesand activities. The misses were the Customer Service, lack of attention to the \"little details\". I also wasn't crazy about the size of the resort and the fact that you have to drive to the pools. The location of the resort itself is acceptable but you would definitely need a car if you stay here. I was quite satisfied with my stay and would definitely stay here again if I wasn't planning a week of amusement park visits. The activity schedule had some neat things going on like kite races, nature walk, etc. I think most of the really bad online reviews have come from guests who were placed in the old \"West Village\" portion. We were given a large handout showing the total refurbishing of the West Village that is currently taking place. By time we left, they had actually started the refurbishment of the check in centre that we had used. It looks like it will be quite nice and completed sometime next year (2008). No doubt once it is done, everyone will then be asking for a room in the West Village! I did receive an email on my blackberry shortly after check-in, requesting feedback on my stay at Orange Lake. It appears that the current management are interested in the opinions of their guests, so hopefully this resort will continue to get better and better.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort, but don't get tricked into the presentation!\u201d", "Author": "Mandersjo", "ReviewID": "UR8511928", "Content": "The resort is truly awesome, the room was great, the pools were beautiful and everything was kept up and clean.

The woman on the phone said she was making sure our room was okay with us and also that there was a breakfast at River Island that we were invited to. She said that if we came to the breakfast and listened to a presentation about the remodeling of the resort we would get $75 to put toward food or disney tickets.

Well we got there and got put with John from Ohio who preceded to hard sell us for the next 2 1/2 hours. They take you away from where you park in a golf cart so you can't get away, take you on a tour, ask you rhetorical questions the whole time, and by the way there was NO BREAKFAST! I told him first thing the lies that the woman on the phone told me and he \"acted\" shocked. We learned later that this is what other people were told and is probably how it's done every time.

We told him first thing that we were not going to buy a timeshare, that we didn't want a tour and that we were promised breakfast. What we got was over 2 hours wasted on our vacation, a couple of cookies, way more stress that necessary on vacation and a bad attitutude toward the resort.

You don't have to worry leaving the property if you don't want to. Now things on property are a bit pricey....arcade games $1 each, $7 a day per person to rent tube for lazy river, inflatable slide has a per person cost, and golf prices are nuts. The one other thing I wasn't happy about was you only got maid service and clean towels ONCE during your stay. You had to wash your own towels or pay $7 a day for new ones. Our unit didn't have a washer/dryer in it. Only one on the floor for everyone to use. Most other building had them in the rooms. We stayed in a studio unit in the west village. It was ok, nothing near as nice as the units in the River Island section. Ours was older, but did have a lot of things to do in the clubhouse. They are supposed to do this section over very soon. Our kids loved the pools that were open late, so after a long day at the park we swam outside our room before bed. The also have a small lake with rentals for boats, jetskis, etc. We didn't find enough time to do that but it looked great. We ate at the River Island Grilling Company and it was faboulous...don't miss the bananas foster...yummm!!!! I would go back again, but skip the timeshare presentation. It's just like the others...a load of crap!!! They talked us into it (we were looking to buy a timeshare somewhere) and told us it was only an hour unlike other places and offered us wholesale ticket prices and a $60 food voucher and said we'd have time to think about it. We go, they take our kids and put them in a daycare thing, and take us by golf cart over a mile away. After 3 1/2 hours later, I'm flipping to go get my kids and they didn't want to let me. They said if I left before the presentation was complete we got nothing. So I stuck it out, and was so upset. They expected us to decide then, when the told us we had all week to think about it. It wasn't real high pressure, but they sure made you feel bad. I felt like i was lied to and the prices were nuts!!! There are a ton of timeshares in FL and they tried to tell us the had the best trading power which they don't. Disneys timeshare were almost half and they give you a year with the price guarantee. Then I wanted to leave and asked if we could come back to get our tickets since the kids aren't used to being left in a daycare. They said sure, but gave us our food voucher before we left. We came back and hour later to get the tickets and they didn't want to give it to us. They said we left so that was it. I was pissed!!! I ended up in tears before it was all over and swore never to come back. We did get our tickets, but I will never do a time share presentation anywhere again. Granted this had nothing else to do with the resort, so don't judge your opinion of this resort on that alone, just don't go to it.

Did not get the room I was told when I booked the room. There was a black fuzzy spider crawling on the curtain when my son opened it to look out the window. Air conditioner did not work-- stayed 80 degrees for 1hour. Asked to change rooms-- stated that it wasn't the room I was sopose to have anyway. But since I was only staying one night no big deal. They put me in another room. The air conditioner worked. Everything was veryyyyyyyyy dirty. The bathrooms out by the west village pools were disgusting. Even my 5 year old was scrunching up his nose. The morning to leave my daughter was sitting on the sofa bed ( the one she slept on) and she let out a bloody scream. There was this huge spider with long legs crawling on her. I killed the spider kept it in a paper towel and gathered our things and went to the front desk. The young man was nice ( new to the job) not a surprise it seems all their staff is in training. ( the pool guy, the girl that was trying to plunge the bathroom toilet by the pool and the two guys at the front desk that I worked with were all new to the job) The young man took me to member services where Dee told me they spray every day. Bologna!!! I have to say that they didn't try the sale pitch with me because I live in Florida-- just an hour away. They also didn't send me to get a parking permit either. The clientele is very low at this resort. The type that get the free nights to see the resort. If you are a timeshare owner of a nice resort, it would be a huge waste to stay here. If you are coming to Florida for vacation, there are way better resorts to stay at with great pools. That was the only plus was the pools.

After walking back and forth around the outside of the building, I found the door - behind a wall, behind a dumpster. Nice. I got up to my floor and started the search for our room. This was a quest in itself, room numbering seems random. I found our room - the door was propped open by a towel and only had 2 beds, not four. I called down to guest service, waited on hold, got transfered, waited on hold, finally got someone. They corrected the room and did send someone up to help me move the gear. The room itself. Blah. Outdated, somewhat dirty, the hot water handle fell off in my hand from the shower (I found the little \"H\" sticker on the side of the tub, so obviously it has fallen off before), sandpaper towels, no shampoo (even though we were in a regular room, not the condo side). The pool river complex, was OK. My kids could not use the waterslide (must be 48\") so my 7 and 5 yo were disappointed, after paying a \"resort fee\" on top of the room rate, we still had to pay $7 for tubes for the lazy river. On the whole, big disappointment. We could have stayed on disney property in 2 rooms and done better! Also, you keep getting the condo pitch in messages on your room phone.

We have stayed at Time-share resorts before, so we more or less knew what to expect. Boy, were we wrong! We booked our stay through Hotels.com. Once we were checked in, we were told that we would be staying in the main building of the West Village. We were then \"directed\" to the \"customer service\" desk to obtain our parking permit. We were informed that to use the tubes in the Lazy River, there would be a $7, per person, per day charge (as we were a family of 4 staying for 7 days, this would amount to $240.00) unless we would attend the \"non-heavy sell\" timeshare pitch for 60-90 minutes. If we did, the tubes would only be $20 dollars for all 4 of us for the week. There was no mention anywhere on their site of a tube charge at all, so already we were feeling a bit pressured and ripped off. We then found out that there is also a $7 per day charge to get new towels. The hallway to get to the rooms STUNK. It reeked of a horrible mildew and sweat combination smell. The suite itself was nice, a kitchenette, two bathrooms and two queen size beds. The bedroom area overlooked a game room, but this closed about 11:00. We found out later on, that there was very little hot water in either shower. Upon \"trying\" to get to sleep, we found out, that the walls were \"PAPER THIN\". We heard the couple next door to us, talking, \"being intimate\" (loudly, try explaining that to an 8 year old) and playing music until 4 am or so. Keep in mind, that they were performing their business at a normal sound level, but due to the walls being so thin, it sounded like they were right in the room with us. In the morning, I went to the Management office and explained the situation and calmly asked to have our room changed. The receptionist looked up our information, and then told me that there were no other rooms available, which I found hard to believe. When I questioned her about this, she told me to contact Hotels.com to see if they would upgrade me to a more expensive suite and that all of the walls in the rooms of the main building were the same way. I asked to speak to a manager, who then told me the same thing. It was only when I told him that it was poor customer service, did he then say that he would try to do something. I asked him to send someone to look at the showers also. I contacted Hotels.com, who were told the same thing. An engineer came into the room and told me that the shower valves were broken, and it would take many hours to fix. I'm not sure which of the above worked, but the manager did call back, to say that they had found a \"no show\" room and that they were moving us. Upon getting to the new room, we found that the overhead light in the bathroom was out, not a big thing, but in additon to all of the above, it just added to our misery. We did not have to sit through the timeshare presentation, because my wife told them flat out that the only reason we were there was to get a coupon for the tubes. They gave us the coupon without subjecting us to the hard sell. The pools were nice, the Lazy River was fun. We handed our coupon for the tubes in the first day, and after that, they did not even ask for any names (or of others,it appeared) If you ask me , the tube charge is a big scam. The smell in the hallway does make its way into the rooms at times. My brother who came up from southern Florida for the weekend, and stayed in a two bedroom suite in the North village, did find a few large roaches crawling around in the morning (roaches, not palmetto bugs).

We had a great time and I wonder now why we did not go back sooner. The place has expanded much in the past years. We stayed in East Village in a 3 bedroom condo that was beautiful, clean, and well stocked. There was a small pool not far from our condo where our daughter and her friend liked to sun and swim. I enjoyed the small but up to date gym which was adjacent to the pool. My son and his friend enjoyed River Village where the lazy river is, miniature golf, shopping and water slides. I personally found the place to be too busy for me and stayed at the smaller pool. The pool at West Village is great - I went in the evening and had plenty of room to do laps. The nearby lake beach gives one the feeling of actually being at the ocean. My son and friend made good use of the shuttle service throughout the resort because this is a BIG resort and you cannot walk to everything. One of the nicest things is that there is a Publix grocery store right at the end of the resort - you don't even need to get on the highway to go grocery shopping. Across the street from the main entrance is a good size Walgreen that is open 24 hours which is accomodating if you have a late arrival. The only bad experience I had was really not the resort's fault. The number of parents who let their children go to the pool without adult supervision - even though the sign says you must be over 12 to be at the pool alone. The small pool by our unit did not have a staff member on duty so this happened a few times while we were there. Several times children under 12 were unaccompanied by an adult, some of them could not swim and often times their behavior rude.

Discovered however that they did not have my 2nd week in the reservation system. Talked to the RCI rep and OLCC staff and were able to resolve problem. The staff member, Michelle Thompson, was able to clear up problem. Apparently the condo unit was sold, and no more weeks were allowed to be banked for that unit.

Or... there's always the free movies offered every night at the clubhouse theatre...as long as you don't mind the smell of a little urine or the sound of rowdy teenagers running rampant. And most surprising to us.. though most of the families that were there were just regular, hard working, decent folks trying to have a nice vacation, there was also a definite undesirable gang-like element whose intimidating and inconsiderate attitudes made it hard to believe we were actually staying at a Gold Crown resort and not some cheap, cheesy, roadside motel. Now, in all fairness, not all of Orange Lake resort is like this. But this is a HUGE place...as big as a town. And if you are unfortunate enough to be placed at the Clubhouse in the West Village, you are definitely on the wrong side of the tracks. The 2nd week we were mercifully given a 2-bedroom unit in the North Village. The unit was spacious and well kept and the grounds were lovely. But this did not make up for the fact that you had to load up the car and drive EVERY time you wanted to go to the pool. And if you wanted shade, you needed to wake up at the crack of dawn to get a good spot. The resort's newest attraction, the River Island water park, is great...if you're willing to fork out $10/day per inner tube (they don't let you use your own floating devices) and wall-to-wall people doesn't bother you. And if, while floating down that lazy river, getting stuck time and time again in a bottleneck traffic jam as bad as any outbound freeway in a major city on a Friday afternoon sounds relaxing to you, then Orange Lake is the place to be Oh, one more thing, if all I've described doesn't sound exciting enough and you're looking for some adventure and a \"little\" competition, don't miss Saturday afternoon grocery shopping at the Publix just outside the resort.

We stayed in one of the West Village towers June 1 - 8, 2007, Mom, Dad & 3 school agers (7-9-12) and I cannot complain about our accomodations. The condo was clean and spacious and with the door closed, we couldn't even hear our kids! I can't say it was meticulously clean, I brough Lysol and asked the kids not to walk around barefoot,but we checked under mattresses etc. and I was very comfortable staying there. Orlando has lizards and these annoying little \"love bugs\" this time of year, but we didn't have a bug problem in our room, though I heard that some others may have. We were happy to be on a higher floor for that reason. We didn't have any problems with customer service, though we didn't have many requests either. We received sales calls, but it was just as easy to not answer the phone. We made one service request about the toilet overflowing and they said they'd send someone up who didn't show, but it was getting late so I didn't worry about it. When we called the next morning, someone came and it turned out we had a plunger in the room all along, but he took care of it and we didn't have a problem anymore. We ordered pizza a few times to our room and came just as planned without incident. The kids LOVED the lazy river, the arcade and beach volleyball. It was SO nice to be able to have so much to do at the resort on our off days from the themes parks. Trust me, I'm pretty picky. Bad accomodations are a deal breaker for me. We checked in early (though the room won't open until later) and after we got the key, we went by the room and begged housekeeping to let us in to see the room. Once we saw it for ourselves we were okay. With a larger family and a modest vacation budget, we typically stay at the Residence Inn and I'd compare Orange Lake to that. It's not the Ritz, you may need to clean under the rim of your toilet and in the jets on your tub, but overall, it was a good stay.

There is no better place for a family with children. First, the lodging: the River Island section of Orange Lake is the newest - opened in 2006. It has about 6 or 7 floors and is absolutely beautiful! The 1 bedroom was perfect for me, my husband and our 2 children (7 and 3). The bedroom was separate from the rest of the rooms, the children slept in the livingroom in the sofa-bed. Our unit looked like a model. Beautiful colors, very clean, modern - everything you would want and need. There was a kitchen with new appliances (of course), a dinette area, living room, bathroom (shower only) and a washer/dryer room. We were on the bottom floor, so our screened in patio led us right outside. Honestly, we couldn't have been more pleased. I can't speak for the other areas of Orange Lake, but from the outside, they looked nice - but not as nice as River Island. If you have children, the other advantage of staying in River Island is that the pool /water area is literally in your back yard. It's a HUGE pool with tons of pool chairs to use; I really enjoyed the lazy river where you could use their floats and float throughout the area. There was a large area with sand and hammocks as well. We didn't partake of the restaurants and gym in RiverIsland, but that was all very convenient as well. We ate one evening on the property - there was a Luau night on Thursday. I would pass on that...the food was okay, but they could have made it a bit nicer (served on paper plates, plastic utensils, etc.) for $20 pp. The entertainment was pretty good. The final advantage to this property is that it is literally 5 minutes from Walt Disney World! It is right down the street and that was extremely convenient. Would I stay here again?

My son loved all the visiting wildlife and it was nice to have a patio to sit out at in the evening . Everything worked and it was clean and tidy. The furniture was spotless and the decor was lovely, the only fault is that the bathrooms are a bit small, but how long do you spend in them and the kitchen a bit outdated but had everything you needed. My husband checked out 2 of the villas when we at the pool at River Island and he said that he preferred where we were as the villas were much bigger and he thought that the whoever did the interior designing must be living in the past !!!!! They are also more like a hotel block with no luxury of a patio, just screened in balconies, I don't know about the other areas but this is just an opinion. We had messages on the phone everyday but just listened and then cancelled them, no-one bothered is at all during our stay regarding purchasing a unit. Staff were friendly and so were the people staying there, my son has made a freind who he will keep in contact with from Illinois. He used the Treasure cove arcade alot by the pool, not cheap so you have to make sure you don't let them have too much to spend, but it was good for him to go and make friends and get away from the heat. The love bugs at the North pool were relentless, so we gave up with that one and stuck to River Island. I think the charge for the floats is a bit much, ($10 for a double ring )but you could often share with other families and some people offered theirs up if they were leaving the pool area, which was really nice of them.

Under no circumstance will they allow you to check in even a minute early.

They cried and cried until we had to go to another pool with no slides. The lazy river pool was easily the best thing about this hotel and we could not enjoy it because of the slide rules.

We stayed there for 3 weeks from the UK, and loved EVERY minute of it. When we checked in, it was speedy and the reception staff were helpful. No delays, no problems and certainly no lack of information. The directions given to us initially, was to look out for a \"swamp\" (This worried me to say the least) ... when we got to the room, it was actually the FISHING LAKE!! Please don't be put off by the description. The location of this room was totally unsuitable, as we were travelling with our 4 year old twin boys. Although it was ground floor, there was no screened in balcony, and nothing to stop them from falling into the water, as the room was LITERALLY next to the lake - about 10 feet away? After going straight back to reception, the second man we saw was very apologetic, and understanding (as he has small children himself) and thought that maybe we were given this room as we wanted to stay in the same room for the 3 consecutive weeks, but swiftly changed our rooms .... the second room was 4013, and absolutley great! The allocation was sort of a 2 bedroom bungalow (semi-detached to a 2-floor block) On entering the room, it was SPOTLESS. The room has been completely refurbished (as have ALL the Villas/Rooms/Apartments in the West Village). The washer and seperate dryer were brand new, and came in VERY uselfull during ur stay. The kitchen had marbled work surfaces, and every part of the place was splotlessly clean, and everything matched - even the wallpaper and curtains (believe me, I have read complaints about this too!!!) We ordere pizza onsite the first night, and it was quick, and gorgeous! We picked up basic breakfast provisions, planning to go to the Super WalMart the following morning.

The pools are beach style (zero inch entry, and maximum 4ft 2inches by the pool volleyball nets. The lazy River was brilliant, and you could go in there with arm bands on (or smaller floaties for babies - the sort they sit in with a solid bottom and holes for legs - not smaller rubber rings which were not allowed in ANY part of the pool, neither were float boards) It seems that maybe our expectations of a resort appear to differ from a lot of othe people. The flashing red light on the phone didn't make any noise, so you could ignore it if you wanted (it was no big deal, just listen to the pre-recorded message, usualyy for golf lessons etc, or just press the button and put the phone down on the unit and carry on with whatever you were doing. Go back in a few minutes and hang up once the message had finished! We were bothered by ANY live calls, although we had about 2 or 3 messages left every week. Yes, this respirt is very big, and a car is DEFINATELY an advantage, and necessity for most, but there were shuttles that ran from designated spots every 20 minutes to every pool and resort activity. We went to the sales tour, and did not feel under any pressure to buy at all, and in fact, found the tour and information very uselful. We would seriously consider buying here if we did not already have financial commitments. In fact, we are going back there next year, and it's already booked !!! The only complaints I could make was that there was no screened in balcony on the West Village buildings, and was not pleasant to sit out of an evening (lots of bugs). There are NO COMPLAINTS about the room, cleanliness, decor, staff, food - in facrt anything! We knew beforehand the size of the reort, so this was no suprise. Having stayed at other Timeshare resorts, we were also well aware of sales pitch etc, and a polite\"No Thank You\" ALWAYS works. Please feel free to e-mail me if I can add anything further for you. We loved this place, and as I said, definately coming back. The staff were brilliant, and the one occassion a maintenece man came out to fix our sliding door, he was there within 20 minutes and very pleasant and informative about the reort and wildflife. Talking of wildlfe ... we had the pleasure of feeding squirrels and Ibis every morning, and a lovely racoon came by almost every evening. (For a City girl, these were treats) but the best thing had to be the 2 parents and 2 young Cranes that appeared about 7.30am every morning. They were very tame, and I hand fed them peanuts. It was so sweet!! There is nothing to worry about at all with the West Village. It is brilliant..... go there, enjoy it - you are on vacation after all.", "Date": "May 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Old person in USA", "Title": "\u201cService was very bad\u201d", "Author": "sweetasarose", "ReviewID": "UR7631350", "Content": "Where do I start? The room was nice. The pools were nice except they are not as spectacular as the photos indicate. The slide in splash lagoon is for small children. In the picture it looks like it's for teenagers and adults. The service was terrible. Here is a list: 1) 2-3 phone calls daily trying to sell us something. I called three times trying to get the phone turned off so we wouldn't get that annoying blinking red light with sales messages on it. 2) One day we walked into our condo, making all the racket a family does. My little girl walks into the bathroom and encounters a strange man in there. It was a repair man (who had come to the wrong room). Now, I understand that mistakes like that happen. But he should have announced himself when we walked in instead of hiding in the bathroom. My little girl was pretty frightened. 3) I walked to the desk where tickets are sold and asked what we could do besides going to a theme park. The answer was: Why did you bother coming to this resort if you weren't going to go to a theme park? Evidently the person who said that was the manager! 4) We went to the sales presentation (felt like a cattle call). When touring one of the pools, the sales person pointed out a bar and said (in front of my children) \"this is where you can get drunk and make fools of yourselves.\" Then said to me \"Your husband has a big stomach. I bet he drinks a lot of beers\". Needless to say I was so stunned and hurt I just mumbled that we rarely drink. 4) The housekeeping staff rang our doorbell at 8 am the day of checkout then ran down the stairs. We found out later that they did that to several guests who were checking out that day. 5) There are many other times the staff was just rude or stupid that I was starting to wonder if there was something I had done! I've tried to talk to the supervising staff. One was sympathic but the other made it plain that she was only saying some things so I would go away. I do not think any of the staff who made rude remarks to me will be talked to or disciplined.

Other pools were deeper. - Pizza restaurant was good - Grounds itself are clean Negatives: - Front Desk did not tell me anything about the resort. They just provided a map. - No free maid service. I had no idea where to put my garbage that was piling up after a week. No change of towels unless you request. - Fire Ant hill right on the edge of the walkway where you park the car. I had no idea that the mound of sand I saw was a fire ant hill until my sister who lives in Florida told me. My kids could have inadvertantly stepped on it. - Unit was nice, but had missing light bulbs, no dish drain,. - Resort charges about $2 a call for 1800 numbers ( when using your calling card) - Playground was nice but pretty worn out. No swings. Very small - Our unit was right on the golf course which was nice, except you had to worry about getting hit by a golf ball or golf cart if you went on the grass.

Overall we enjoyed our stay, but it was rocky at the start. Online it tells you to get off of I-4 on exit 64B, but it is just exit 64, the roads have changed, and at first we drove by the exit. When we found our way to Orange Lake we were initially put in the West Lake Village. Our unit was a one floor home that looked like a small ranch house. When we entered our unit we were very discouraged because it was just so old. The washer and dryer was in the kitchen which had rough floors, the living room had a small couch that only could sit three small people at most, and out of the living room was a small patio. The patio had just a plastic chair and table set that looked upon one of the golf courses. The patio just was not very appealing, and the doors going to it were hard to open and very dirty. The bedrooms/bathrooms were the worst. The second bathroom was as big as a small hall closet. The bathtub was dirty, and small but took up most of the space. It was old and needed to be replaced. The master bath did not have a jacuzzi like all of the other units in the resort. The televisions were as old as the unit, 25 years old. We were fed up, and called the front desk to ask for a unit change. We were especially mad to learn that our family member with a guest certificate was staying in the East Village. They had no issue moving us to the same building as our relatives. The East Village was so beautiful, the building we were placed in had six floors. Our unit was on the fourth floor with a view of the Legend's Golf Course and Club House. The unit had nice yellow walls with cheerful decor that consisted of a sectional couch, dining room set with a bench, a kitchen with a bar area and an enclosed patio. The bedrooms were a good size however the beds were nothing to rave about. The master bedroom had the jacuzzi I was wishing for, and a large vanity area. To take a virtual tour of the unit just go on www.orangelake.com. We were very pleased except for the fact that we did not get our welcome kit that should have had paper towels, coffee, dish liquid soap plus salt and pepper. A call to the front desk took care of the problem. The pool for the East Village is a best kept secret because it hardly ever has a person in it. The crowds flock to the River Island which is quite spectacular with its lazy river, but it is always too full with small children. Many do not pay attention when they are swimming down it and tend to run into people. I would stick to the other village pools. The shopping in the River Island is nice because it has a Starbuck's and a nice gift shop area. Overall we had a nice time and would go back to the East Village, I highly recommend asking for the area when you check-in. At night you can see the fireworks from the Magic Kingdom in the East Village. I recommend bringing golf clubs because the courses are great especially the Legends designed by Arnold Palmer.", "Date": "May 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cAverage resort!!!\u201d", "Author": "NjGgg", "ReviewID": "UR7588703", "Content": ".The unit is old with lots of bugs! 2.port-a-crib instead of normal full size crib! 3.our light was not working!

The woman I spoke to on the telephone to book my reservation told me the room was so nice that we would not believe it ! So I thought that $149.00 for three nights plus the additional $124.00 per night for two nights more (we stayed a total of 5 nights) was a good deal. Boy was I in for the shock of my life when checked in at the front desk. Check in time was at 4:00 PM. We did not arrive until 9:00 PM. The woman at the front desk said that our room was dirty and not ready yet ! WE BOOK A MONTH AHEAD OF TIME!! So she said no problem, I have a different room for you (nicer)! So she left the front desk to check to see if the second room she suggested to us was ready. A half hour or so she returns to the front desk and says that room was not ready either as it was also not clean! She stated she wouldl find us a better room while looking in her computer. Her statement: at last I found you one! She gives us our room cards and directs us to our room. By now its 10:30 PM. We are very tired from our long trip to Florida, and we were not in the best of moods. To go to our room, we were heading to the basement level passing the boiler room. I do believe it was an entrance for the maintenance staff. When I opened the door to the room the moldy smell was to much for me!! So back to the main desk. The woman at the front desk said she could not change the room after the room cards where made! So we had to go to the Customer Service desk. When we arrived there the woman working there said that she was closing for the night and could not assist us! So now what do we do!!! I then asked for the Manager who was very nice. He found us a room, but it was very dark (window was overlooking Game/Reception room and meeting hall inside the building! We had no natural sunlight in the room and the Game/Reception room held functions nearly every night with the loud sounds of the functions being held blaring in our room. We could not even hear ourselves think. We were there for 5 nights and never once had maid service. The rooms were very old, and the air conditioning unit in our room constantly made very loud \"cranking\" noises. We kept waking up during the nights thinking someone was trying to enter our room. We also ran out of toilet paper so I went to the front desk to get a roll. The woman at the front desk asked me for my room number and stated she will send someone with the toilet paper to our room. Well, I never did get any toilet paper. I went to a local store and bought some! On May 9, 2007, we went on our scheduled Time Sharing Tour. Mo, our Time Share Representative, who guided us, was very nice. We explained to Mo that we were very negative on the Resort because of the room we were placed in. We voiced our concerns and stated that because of the room we were placed in, how could anyone say YES in buying a Time Share in Orange Lake Resorts. Mo stated that we were not the first to complain about the rooms; that we should have been placed in a Villa. He stated that Orange Lake Resorts were using an outside Marketing firm who were responsible for placing us in the room we were in, and that Orange Lake's was going to release this outside firm from their contract in June, 2007. I explained that apparently, Oramge Lake does not seem to be concerned with the welfare of the clients if they allow this firm to place them in dark, old, dingy rooms, and not one of the beautiful Villa's they have on sight and that we were promised. Once out tour was completed, the Tour representaive thanked us for our time, and did not offer to drive us back to our car at the Tour Reception Center. We were left \"stranded\" and walked the long distance back to the Tour Reception center to retrive our car. One last note: the grounds and pools at Orange Lake Resort are beautiful, but the service and rooms they put you in have a lot to be desired. To anyone wanting to go to this Resort, make sure that you get in writing that you WILL be placed in one of the new Villa's, and not the old hotel room that we were placed in.", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cRiver Island did not disappoint...\u201d", "Author": "thedcdiva", "ReviewID": "UR7538907", "Content": "Just returned from a 5 night stay at the River Island complex at Orange Lake.

We stayed in the East village in a 2 bdrm unit and were very happy. It looks just like the pictures on the website. We exchanged our week through RCI and this is considered a Gold Crown resort. I would say it is if you don't get stuck in one of the older units in the West village. There are new swim areas in the North village and River Island village that we liked a lot for our 4 1/2 and 2 yr children. Very kid friendly there. My only complaint about the resort is how big it is and the time it takes to get from one village to another. With 2 small children, it is not easy to walk to another village to use the pool or eat, etc. My idea of a vacation is not about getting in a car and driving to the pool but that is what we had to do. There is a spring fed lake on the property with a nice beach with beach chairs. It is a nice change from the pool. The main reception area has a Disney Planning desk which was very helpful. You can ask questions, make reservations, and buy tickets. There is also a general store in this building which is helpful if you just need one or 2 things. The Publix is just outside the entrance to the property. We ate lunch twice at the River Island Grilling co. - the flatbreads are great! Also ate dinner there and had good food.

The plastic bag containing unit supplies for 8 people for a week was a joke, 1 roll of paper towels, 3 dishwasher tabs, 3 rolls of toilet paper, 1 box of tissues, 2 garbage bags, etc. We only ate onsite once, at the Legends Grill. Food and drink was expensive and quality was marginal at best. Houlihan's across from the resort on Hwy 192 became a favourite. They have a happy hour that runs from 2-6 and 9-CL with $1 beer & $2-4 drinks and $5 appies and meals. This resort nickels and dimes you to no end, $1/phonecall, $9 for a pool ring/day, $5 for a ride on an inflated slide, unless you opt for the $36 weekly pass, mini-golf was $9/person. There was no menus for the onsite restaurants in our unit nor was there a local phone book, tried to get one but was told they didn't have any. The timeshare presentation was a nightmare. \"Kim\" told us that since we are already owners elsewhere, we could have$160 for 2 couples to attend a 1 hr tour so we could go back home and encourage others to go there. Arrived on time but waited 20 min. for our guide, Billy. 5 min into the tour, we told him we had a tee off time in 1 1/2 hours and he abruptly closed his books and said it wasn't enough time and refused to continue. He stated that there was no such thing as a 1 hr tour and that he was giving us the usual sales presentation. We wasted another 15 min filling out a \"report\" and were offered no compensation whatsover for our time. Golf fees have gone up considerably in the span of a year and if you're staying in the West Village, bring helmets for the kids because your yard is the fairway.

We went as a family with 3 children ages 14,11,7. We had a two bedroom condo in the West Village. I read the reviews and I was alittle scared but decided to go anyways. I was glad that we did. The accomodations where very nice. We had fridge, stove, washer dryer it was all good. We drove down the road to the WALL-MART spent $150.00 and got enough groceries to last the week. We took mom out to dinner 4 times and I cooked dinner the other nights. The pool in the west village was awsome, the kids loved it plenty of towels, lounge chairs, nice music. Good family vacation. Staff was friendly and very helpfull. Our blender broke, I called front desk and in 18 minutes there was a very nice man at the door with a new blender. Shuttle was great as the place is very large. Get the all week pass for mini-putt, $32.00 much cheaper than $6.00 each per round, and we putted every day some times twice all for the one price of $32.00. Do yourself a favour, drive east on the 192 and go to Melbourn. Its about an hour drive through the beautiful country and you end up at the beach. CLEAN and FREE. The kids got to see and swim in the Ocean We continued on the A1A up to Cape Canaveral and returned back. Dislikes where very little. No internet in room, I had to go to main building and wireless was very slow. OK so your on vacation who needs internet. Well unfortuantley being self employeed I did need to check e-mails. The arcade in the main building was very run down and stinky. BUT in the North village they had a brand new arcade and the kids loved it. Lazy river... waste of money for tubes. We spent the $44.00 to rent tubes, the kids fell off them and they where a waste of time. We returned them no money back, and just floated and had way more fun. Forget Dysney, we spent the money at a DISCOUNT travel place and got cheap tickets to Universal Studios. The kids had more fun at ORANGE LAKE resort. No fitness centre, just a cardio room for those that work out every day you will be doing push-ups in your room and chin ups on light posts. You will get a message on the phone every day telling you about all the great deals you can get if you listen to their sales speach. Well just say NO THANKS, and continue on your day.

We booked our stay through RCI, so I was expecting to stay in the West Village, but I was very pleased to find out our condo was in the North Village. We were in a building of 6 units - 2 uppers, 4 lowers, right on the golf course. Our two bedroom, two bath unit was very clean and well-stocked. The furniture and linens were in excellent condition. We loved having a full-sized washer and dryer. It allowed us to travel with much less luggage... a must when traveling with children. The units were very quiet - I never heard our neighbors or street noise. We liked that the complex was close to a Publix supermarket as well as other resturants along HWY 192. We did not have to go through any high-pressured sales pitches, although it was annoying to be asked to attend a tour just to get our parking pass. I firmly told the woman behind the desk that I wasn't interested and that we already had our park tickets. She didn't press the issue any further, which was great! We felt that the complex seemed to be geared towards older people and of course golfers. If you love golf, this is the place to be. The pool complexes offered something for everyone. We did not eat at any of the on-site restaurants. The one thing that I did not like was on the day of check-out we had a housekeeper at our door at 8:30 asking when we would check-out. We told her 10:00 (check-out time) but at 9:50 there was another housekeeper there wanting to get into the room to start cleaning. Orange Lake seems to be very strict about their check-in and check-out times. This was the only time that we have traveled that we were not allowed to check in early and were hurried out the door.

When we called the front desk to ask if we could have some extra bags, they treated us rudely and told us it was our responsibility. So that meant I had to go buy trash bags at my expense of money and time-not something I want to do on vacation. Also, they let the trash pile up outside near the trash cans for 3-4 days at a time. It was obvious that critters were feasting nightly as the ripped trash bags showed. After a couple of days the smell and sight we had to see every time we went in or out of our front door was quite nauseating. The pools were nice and amply stacked with pool towels. The golf courses were nice and the golf staff was friendly and professional. The restaurants were a mixed bag. The seafood grill restaurant was fabulous and we had a great meal there, but some of the other restaurants weren't even open when they were supposed to be. Overall, we had a great trip-mainly because we didn't spend too much time at Orange Lake. Oh, I almost forgot the daily call inviting us to the \"sales pitch breakfast.\" One morning it came at 8 am. Totally irritating. Like I would ever buy here. I have no idea how it maintains a gold crown RCI rating.

Overall the unit was very nice, in good repair as it really is only about 2 years old. Overall was quite clean but...one disturbing thing...over the toilet ON THE CEILING in the master bath there was a glob of something my husband stated was, uhhh, fecal matter, to be polite. I didn't get up on a chair to investigate though...ugh. I just used the other bathroom since there was just the two of us. I did notice spots on the tile floor in the master bath also which led me to believe it had not been mopped. The second bathroom is perfectly nice but it would benefit greatly from a hairdryer installed in there. Also, one of the towel rings must have been recently installed as it still had half the neon green price sticker still attached to it's face plate. A little attention to detail here would go a long way. They supplied us with plenty of towels and facecloths, especially since the unit sleeps 8 and there were just two of us. The first couple days I was there had breathing difficulty (whereas I do not normally) when sitting on the sofa because of the scented cleaners they use presumably to freshen the fabrics. Kitchen was very well equipped and washer/dryer were fantastic. We had enough supplies provided by the management to get us through the week. Except for coffee, which you can pick up at the Publix right at entrance to resort. You get a starter pack of toilet tissue, trash bags, facial tissues, dishwasher detergent, dish soap, coffee, tea, creamer and sugar, also a box of laundry detergent. You can pick up more and softener at the Walgreens at the west entrance. We had plenty of dishes, glassware, baking dishes, and utensils. We ate at a couple of the onsite restaurants. Paisan Pizzeria was very good. Had subs there one day, pizza another night, all good. River Island Grilling Company...oh my...it was crap. Poor service, had to wait very long to get our cold tasteless food served by incompetent girl who didn't even bring half our stuff but offered to bring me my side dishes after I had finished. Hello??? She was just plain not good at waitressing. She kept walking up to our table and just staring at us eating. Creepy. Good thing we were using vouchers we had received from sitting through the \"owner update\" (aka 2 hours of pressure to upgrade our unit ownership. They do get a bit \"testy\" when they can't convince you. Consider yourself warned) or I would have been livid. It was a shame to waste our vouchers on this substandard meal though. The Starbucks onsite was convenient but staffed by indifferent clerks who couldn't smile if you handed them a hundred dollar tip. But nothing can beat the unprofessional attitude of the staff at Connections at River Island (their internet cafe). Just rude and unbelievable. The girls manning the desk ranted and raved and cursed on two occasions when I was there making me feel very uncomfortable while I was using the internet. I can't believe these girls are getting paid a wage for what they do. One stood outside gabbing with friends on her cell phone and looked a bit put out when she had to come inside to accept my payment. Another sat near me reading her emails and exclaiming loudly over them and shouting to coworkers inside the office. Unbelievable. As our unit is backed by the 18th hole of Legends golf course we were woke before dawn every morning while the greenskeepers drove their loud equipment up and down the cart paths and mowed greens all before dawn. I didn't anticipate that annoyance when we purchased. Funny, they don't tell you about some of these quaint charms when they are giving you the hard sell.... ;-) Another hilarious feature, black vultures circle the building all day. Really. You'd think you were staying in the Addams Family house! But they are quiet and well behaved and roost at night in the trees to the east and north of the village. They're harmless and I started to really enjoy watching them. We were told they circle around because just over the wooded area is Disney's Animal Kingdom and the animal manure is dumped on other side of our woods. Yum! To be fair, the new attraction River Island is very nice and I can imagine a family with young children would have a blast there. We did play 36 holes of mini golf there on some cool evenings. High priced, even for owners! But they do have a good special that allows the whole family to play unlimited all week for a good price. My husband loved this place and used the pools and spa in East Village a lot. He gives it a FIVE, I give the place a THREE so I gave it a average of FOUR...

We enjoyed Disney of course and learned from Orange Lake staff about a short-cut to the Animal Kingdom that was great for us. Also, we were delighted to know that Orange Lake has a Hertz rental service on-site; we returned a rental we got from the airport and would likely take a taxi or shuttle to the resort from the International airpoport next time. That was the most stressful part of our trip - arriving at night, from the Orlando airport, not knowing the roads, detour due to road construction, trying to find the resort. One negative: unless you enjoy harassment, avoid going to a sales promotion AKA complimentary continental breakfast for one hour. It will take at least 2 hours and you will be hounded to buy a timeshare for 11K or more.

I freaked and asked to be switched. The staff person said she is not allowed to switch rooms, stated to call customer service on the house phone (she wrote down the number) and they could switch. So down the hall we went and I called customer service. Not a great call...she said room cleaniness or concerns about the unit would not be a reason to switch rooms. She suggested I go speak to management. So, I walked down the hall and spoke to a manager. He heard my concerns and while I never stepped in the room, I told him we were tired from our trip and didn't want to get there and find out the room was a pit. He did say the room I was in was not an upgraded room and tried to find another spot for us. He said there was nothing available at the moment but perhaps after checkin is done, he would be able to move us. He asked to try out the villa and let us know if it was unbearable then he would do what he could. So, with a sour face I left and we went to our 2 bedroom West Villa. We walked in and to my surprise it was really nice, and very very clean. And this was not an remodeled unit. No cobwebs, no bugs, all was okay. So as we started to unpack, we got a knock on the door. The manager said he couldn't bear the sour face and wanted me to have a great trip and he found a 2 bedroom villa in the East Village. I was blown away! He had a crew of guys there to take our luggage and escorted us to the East Village. He walked us to the condo and it was even more beautiful than the West one was. The space and decor was amazing. He was great and offered incredible customer service. Our stay was awesome! No maid service for the week was a bummer but I just did a load and that took care of that.

Not Orange Lake Resort's fault - but it was really cold in Orlando last week. It damped our visit. We used the pools a lot less. Overall, the resort was perfectly fine for a family visit. The number of messages from the golf and sales people was annoying. I hate the blinking light. They automatically send messages. We even received a message at 1:21 AM. That is ridiculous! My parent's checked in so I can not comment on that process. We stayed in the West side and had two adjoining units. Our kids played football on the golf courses - we did not see any golfers for the first 5 days. But the birds were very brave and even knocked on our window to see when we were going to come out to play. The sprinklers did turn on every now and then which made for a lot of laughs as we would get caught in the shower. A lot of the kid activities revolve around the pools so we did not participate in many. River Island was a hit despite the cold. We could only take it for short stints. Charging for tubes is a bit lame. Same for the $3 inflatable slide rides. We opted not to do it. The family pass for minature golf is a good deal. I am glad we had a rental car because the shuttle was not very frequent. I even gave others rides around the resort. I also found the people driving in the resort to be going to fast which is why I preferred to drive the older kids to the arcade or basketball court rather than have then waiting for the shuttle or walking. A few speed bumps could help. We did go to their theater one night. Nice touch. Go get popcorn from the bar. They played a DVD? I wonder why the rooms still have VHS? Time for an upgrade. The old TVs should be upgraded too. I have not seen a remote with out number keys in a long time. The resort is very convienent to Disney, Sea World, and the airport. We did not eat there. But we did buy Starbucks coffee every day at the River Island cafe. The kids even had ice cream - despite the blue lips from the cold weather. The units could have been a little cleaner but I have stayed in much worse. Having a washer and dryer, refridge, dishwasher etc... made having breakfast at home easier than a hotel and having to go out for every meal.

Unfortunatey though, the garbage men woke us most mornings before 7am collecting the rubbish bins, and if we were lucky enough to go back to sleep, we then got woken before 7.30am by the major building work next door. i asked to be moved but was told by the lady i spoke to that she couldn't make that decision, but promised me that the manager would get back to me within an hour. 24 hours later, still no call from the manager, and despite a few further calls, i was unable to make contact with the manager because he was busy! When i booked in, the girl at reception didn't tell me that i needed to get a car security entry pass from tickets sales! orange lake used to give the passes out when you booked in, but now they make you queue at ticket sales, who try to sell you your park tickets and a timeshare presentation. I called to have my tv remote replaced (i tried changing the batteries myself but it didn't make any difference), a week later this was still not replaced! Not a big deal, but a real pain getting up changing channels. I hired a ring from river island, and whilst it was next to me 30 minutes later, some nice person had taken it, so hold onto the hire rings with your life! I had fun with my son renting a jet ski for 30 minutes ($52), but the lady that hires them, was the most unfriendly person i have ever met. She was sitting on the counter reading a book whilst she was talking to me. It frankly put me off going back. Although this is a gold crown resort, they only have video players in the lounge, so i went to the reception to enquire if i could hire a dvd player, and an uninterested girl told me that orange lake had no dvd players. She did however, tell me that they rented videos, which were $6 a time, and were very old videos, that were not worth a free rental. No where sells or rents videos anymore (apart from orange lake), so the video players are a compete waste of time. Most days I had at least one phone call or message on the villa's answerphone telling me about the golf deals, and the timeshare presentation. Myself and my family left after 2 weeks, all feeling very tired and in need of a holiday where you can lay in after 7am. Orange lake is a massive resort, but I may have been staying in the middle of a jungle on my own, because the customer service was non exsistent.

The newly reopened & redesigned Reserve course is a huge disappointment to me. It is very unforgiving, frustrating and poorly planned.

We were very excited as this was our first visit to Florida as a family. Unfortunately, because this was an RCI reservation, we were thrown into Dungeon room #5145 in the West Village. Upon arrival it took us about ten minutes to locate our room since the access hallway is adjacent to the dumpsters, noisy air conditioners and hotel utility vehicles. The hall doors had several layers of chipped paint and wallpaper and the carpets were filthy. Our room was very functional as it had a small kitchen with stove top, microwave, fridge and even dishwasher. The only window in the room (with bent and dirty mini blinds) looked out to the INTERIOR of the community room or game room. We immediately went to the RCI office and told the Rep there that we were willing to pay additional money to get out of that room. Unsympathetic and unmoved by our pleas, she simply stated that we booked a studio room so we have to stay in that studio room. We're not snobs and are pretty good about rolling with the punches, so we decided to stick it out and remain positive. After all we were going to be sight seeing all day anyway. The first day we hung out at the River Pool which is pretty nice. Second day we went out to Cape Canaveral National Seashore which is beautiful. That night we went over to the little lake at the resort which has a pretty beach. The picture on the web site fails to show the view of the other side of the lake which is of cinder block walls and what appeared to be dilapidated houses and a trailer park. Ugly. Still remaining positive we walked over to the pool since our daughter wanted to swim. We ordered cocktails from the pool-side bar and relaxed and did a little people watching. We quickly determined that maybe we were snobs after all since we were appalled at what we saw around us - Young kids (13 or 14) smoking cigarettes with their Tattooed and toothless parents, many other kids unsupervised and misbehaving and other adults \"hooking up\". We watched in horror as some kid continued to hock loogies, from the pool, onto the pool deck, over and over and over and over. That did it for us. We went to the RCI office the next morning and asked if we could have a partial refund since we were checking out. The Rep who was there (Cynthia) seemed very concerned and asked why we were leaving. I told her we weren\u2019t happy with the room and she pushed her lunch aside and got busy on her computer. She found availability at another RCI property (Vacation Village) and booked us right then and there. She SAVED our vacation and should get a big fat raise as far as I'm concerned. We left Orange Lake immediately and checked into our new property which we absolutely LOVED. This actually turned out to be one of our best family vacations so far. Thank you Cynthia!! In all fairness, Orange Lake is very nice over in the East Village. The grounds are beautiful and the pools are nice. If you're not too picky, then the West Village Dungeon rooms may be okay.

The resort is very big and there is a lot to do which was a plus for us. We wanted a nice, quiet vacation where we didn't have to leave the resort a lot. First of all, our check in was quick and we were given a room in the North Village. After reading reviews from this website I knew I wanted one in either the North or East Village. We checked in at 3:45 pm but our room wasn't going to be ready until 4 so we went to the Publix that is right by the East Village entrance. It was great having a grocery store so close by. At 4 we went to check out our room and were satisfied. The room is spacious, has a good layout, and came with a nicely equipped kitchen. I've traveled to 3 RCI properties in the last couple of years and stayed at all Gold Crown resorts and I must say that compared to the others this was the worst. I'm not saying it's bad but I don't see it as a Gold Crown winner in comparison. We stayed at the Pueblo Bonito Sunset in Cabo and those rooms were absolutely amazing. Orange Lake does not even come close. Anyway, we checked out the new River Island complex first and it's very nice. If you have children this would be a great place to go. We do not have children so we were trying to find a quiet place to relax in the sun but unfortunately every place we tried was swarming with love bugs. It was really annoying and I hope the resort does something about this soon. The next day we checked out the pool in the West Village and I liked that a lot better. It seemed to be quieter and less crowded. Unfortunately, the bathrooms were disgusting. Not a big deal but just another reason why this shouldn't be a Gold Crown. The only downside of the pool in the West Village is that every day at 2pm they do Bingo over the loud speaker for an hour. We just wanted to relax and found it a bit annoying. Also, every day around 3:30 the bugs came and we were forced to pack up. We wanted to play miniature golf at River Island but it was $9 a person to play and I thought that was too expensive. I haven't played in years so maybe that is the going rate. We instead went to the older miniature golf course in the West Village and played there using the buy one get one free coupon we got after we took the tour (more on that later). We cooked in our room most of the time but we did go out to dinner once at the River Island Grill. We had the filet and mashed pots and they were very good. Service was a bit lacking but the food was yummy. The drinks are ridiculously over priced ($7 for a cocktail) but it was our one night out. All in all a nice experience. We decided to take the tour/owners update and our salesman James was very nice. It wasn't high pressure and we just honestly told him that his presentation was nice but were weren't interested. There was no hassle and we were out of there fairly quickly. All in all it's a decent resort but lacking a bit in cleanliness and maintenance.

We had no bugs or holes in the sheets or towels. In fact we enjoyed our villa very much. It was a short walk to the main area where I played bingo a few days for big bucks (I never won, but came really close) and there were lots of activities going on there. My son went to watch movies and play ping pong. The weather was great though there were a few 'love bugs'. Apparently bugs brought over from who knows where to kill misquitos, but don't and now they can't get rid of them. Not a big problem. We enjoyed all the pools and yes had to pay for the tube, but hey we were on vacation!! This is not a rental that fawns over you which is great when you are with a family.

It must have been because we found several balls in our back yard. On the whole I found it a great place. It's not a luxury timeshare, like one where money is no object and romantic and all, but for a nice reasonable vacation this is the place to go.", "Date": "October 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay in the West Village Rooms!\u201d", "Author": "antgina", "ReviewID": "UR5932546", "Content": "After seeing the wonderful advertisements for this resort & given the fact that RCI rates it a Resort of High Excellence, we considered this a no brainer!

The towels had holes in them, the kitchen floor turned our socks black from the dirt, dead bugs in the tracks of the sliders, mirrors with smudges on them, hair on the bathroom floor, cob webs everywhere, the cheapest toilet paper, papertowels & tissues we've ever used! The ironing board cover was burned, the kitchen counter had burn marks on it, the inside of the dishwasher was dirty. I could go on! We called several times and they first sent someone to clean the tracks of the sliders but they left the vacuum cleaner out when they were done! Then they finally sent housekeeping over to do a complimentary midweek cleaning but it didn't make up for it. My daughter didn't want to sleep in the bed! Make sure you do not get a room in the West Village Villas. Demand a room in the new East Village. My friends had a brand new suite there.

Before we arrived, I was very anxious that we would get one of the old style villas that everyone said to avoid, so I e mailed before hand to request the new apartments (waste of time) and was promptly given an old style villa on arrival. However, on reflection the \"old style\" was by far the best option. We overlooked a fantastic golf course, had lovely animals visiting us every day. Not horrible things, but lovely Ibis, Cranes, tiny frogs, Lizards, birds of prey and Racoons. Fantastic. !!! There are the odd beetles that get in; they are not to be confused with roaches though. The whole time we were there we only spotted one roach, and that was outside under a slide. So hardly worth a moan. We went without a car despite everyone saying we were mad, and managed fine, we used a Taxi to get to Disney and everywhere else, and this worked out cheaper and safer than getting a car. Orange lake is a huge place, and has nearly 2400 units, spread out over a very big area. There was absolutely No over crowding though; there was always a place to sit or a deck chair to relax on, never any problems getting a reservation at a restaurant. It is not the sort of resort where you are fawned and fussed over, so you do have to be independent and ask for what you want. such as being dropped at your villa rather than a drop off point, they will collect you as well if you ask, take your bags to your room and collect you on departure 9You do not need to tip). In three weeks we had about four phone calls from teh time share people, about attending a presentation, they were very polite when we said no, and increased the offer over time to $75.00 and free breakfast and a voucher book. We said no, as time is precious. There are four pools, a small one near the entrance, which is lovely, very quiet. In fact hardly anyone there, on a few occasions we were the only ones. There is River Island the new complex. This was quite busy, and although lovely we preferred splash lagoon, which was great for children aged under 8. Much quieter there as well. There is a 50 meter pool as well, great for getting fit. The pools were well maintained, we did see people taking water samples regularly for testing. Towels are in great big hampers and you just help yourself to what you need, so do not worry. In fact I would leave your suitcase free of towells all together. There are a several restaurants, all good value. The grilling company at River Island serve fantastic food. About \u00a312.00 for a fillet Mignon, with starter and side order. Cheaper than UK prices for quality food. There are cheaper thing on teh menu as well. Childrens meals including a drink were around \u00a33.00. The apartment itself was clean, and in good order. In did not have any wow factor but it had a nice kitchen, huge washing machine and tumble dryer. So nice clean clothes to go home with. Air conditioning, good general accommodation. The only down side was the bathrooms were small and a bit disappointing. But how long do you spend in the bathroom on holiday? The staff were always very nice, not too gushing or over the top. There are a lot of Americans that stop there, so do not expect a Brit holiday. Whilst we were at Disney, we would get a taxi to Animal Kingdom, as that was the cheapest and closest to Orange a Lake, then we used Disney transport to get around. We had a look in on Animal Kingdom lodge, thinking we might treat ourselves next year. In comparison to Orange Lake, it pales into significance. The hotel itself looked fabulous, the lobby was very luxurious, and the animals were roaming the savannah. It all felt a bit claustrophobic, there were a lot of people in a small place, long queues for dinner, much much smaller rooms than Orange Lake, and quite a small pool in comparison. So if you like a bit of independence, then Orange Lake is great and a much better option. Although the new units at Orange Lake are very luxurious the peace and tranquillity in the villas was great. I did not have to worry about telling my four year old to be quiet either, for fear of upsetting a guest below of above us. We had a great time, and world go back in a shot, I hope this helps you", "Date": "September 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "brookeebabi6722", "Title": "\u201cLIZZARDS\u201d", "Author": "brookeebabi6722", "ReviewID": "UR5779276", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Orange Lake Country Club for 6 days.

We all agreed the resort had much to offer re: activities, but failed to meet what our family has experienced \"Gold Crown\" to be in our ownership and travels. We exhanged in through RCI and we were placed in a newly refurbished unit in the North Village, unit 3822. The positives of OLCC- the pools, pool towels were provided, the various activities/options, the unit size, and the unit appeared to be recently refurbished. Additionally, when we did telephone or stop by the clubhouse with a maintenance concern, it was addressed immediately (except for an exterminator being sent, as promised). The negatives (in our opinion)- ants all over the kitchen and living room, towels and loose trash left in front of our unit, unit not very clean, stained towels, holes in towels, holes in one set of sheets, no blankets or pillows for the sofa bed, jacuzzi tub jets did not work, hot water heater broke, dryer broke, replaced with another dryer that was not operating properly and smelled moldy, lied to by sales staff (Marcus said we had to take a 1 hour RI tour to use the new RI facilities), disherwasher not installed in cabinet securely, no ceiling fans in bedrooms or on porch, kiddie pool at Splash Lagoon needed a good scrubbing, no hot tubs at Splash Lagoon, and a leak that developed in our unit was not repaired. The number 1 negative in our eyes was staff attitude; customer service and stewardship/responsibility seemed to be non-existent. Maintenance issues can happen anywhere, but an ongoing maintenance schedule would have prevented many of the issues we had during the week. As for the bugs, yes, I expect to see a bug, frog, or lizard in my unit while in Florida, but I do not expect to have a swarm of ants in my kitchen and living room...for a week. Again, this was something that could have been prevented. Also, an exterminator never arrived, as promised. We stay at our unit at Seascape in NC once a year, which is like a blast back to 80s decor, but we don't care because the unit is clean and the staff is friendly. We also stay with Marriott often and we've not had the aforementioned problems. While at the Westgate Smoky Mountains, we had a mouse in our unit, and being in the mountains, we took it in stride and appreciated the exterminator coming out to catch the little thing. We are not a family that is impossible to please, but we do not expect or excuse multiple problems in one week, especially when the staff never took responsibility in caring about these issues. We were told multiple times \"this happens all the time.\" My point is, if this \"happens all the time\" you are aware of the problems and should fix them, not leave them to be problems for your next set of guests arriving. In 6 years of timeshare ownership and trading, this is honestly the worst place we have stayed. No, it's not terrible overall or like a dumpy motel, but OLCC is not the top-notch resort it attempts to represent itself to be.

The rooms were huge and very comfortable. They were also very quiet for the most part. If people were in the hall you could really hear them from the second bedroom but that was about it. The window in that room also let in too much light for my liking, but my son did not seem to mind. We did not get any sort of basic welcome/starter pack , which we didnt realize until we got home that there should have been 2!! So we ended up buying everything when we should have just called and complained. The room was clean and the beds were pretty comfy. We spent a day at River Island and rented tubes (which should be free) for the lazy river which my 4 yr old son loved. The pool is salt water and we got a bit sunburned so be sure to slather on the sunscreen. They also need more umbrellas around the pool area. They would get snapped up very quickly. We ate lunch at the snack bar Anchors and it was hot and tasty. We also had Starbucks coffee and ice cream from Currents. The coffee was a bonus because Starbucks is nowhere to be found except maybe at the parks. It was a bummer to have to drive to the pool but since we really came more for the theme parks, it wasnt a total buzz kill. We picked a perfect week to go to Orlando as most kids were back in school. We were able to walk on rides at Magic Kingdom and MGM and do some 2 and 3 times in a row. We could see fireworks from our balcony but they were pretty far away. The resort is extremely convenient to all the parks. We ate at the River Island Grilling Co twice. 1st night we just had appetizers and they were pretty good. Service was not great. The second time our waiter was clueless about the menu and bar drinks and my scallops was prepared wrong, so it was sent back and then when it came back the scallops tasted bad. They did comp my dinner but it wasnt the best dining experience. We ordered pizza one night and calzone on another from Paisan Pizzaria and they were both delicious and were delivered to our room very quickly. The onsite Disney ticket agents were so professional and helpful. The arcade was not huge but when tropical strom Ernesto rolled in, it kept my 4yr old happy. The resort did leave 2 messages keeping us posted on the storm. There are not really any good restaurants close by that we could find. Just chain fast food and dining.

During my check in they had popcorn, face painting and balloon crafts for the kids. They gave us a 2br villa on the North side just a quick walk to the Splash Lagoon. It was clean and very roomy. The only gripe I have about the villa is that my son could not hook up his PS2 due to no A/V inputs. Tip #1... go to your local Wal mart and for $16.00 you can fix the problem, believe me it comes in handy, when you are in a hotel with no A/V inputs. FYI Wal-Mart and Super Target are a 10-min drive from the complex. Kitchen was BIG, it comes with washer and dryer, dishwasher, micro and oven with a full size fridge. The bedrooms were very big and comfy. Master comes with a king size bed, and the other with 2 full size beds. There is also a full size sofa sleeper. From our balcony we could watch the Fireworks show from Disney, it goes on at 10pm. Our first day we went to River Island... Very nice but a bit too crowded. Since all the shade was taken we got a Cabana. For $99.00 you get 2 tubes, TV (this one you can hook up a PS2 without an adapter) table w/ 4 chairs, phone, fresh fruit and a half size fridge with softdrinks and water. Oh! and a USA today paper. The Cabana it self can be zipper close so you can leave your stuff in there with no problems. I forgot to mention that the Cabana comes with a ceiling fan... NICE! The lazy river kept us in the water for a while. We order food from the River Island Grill and let me tell you it was good and cheap ($4.95 for chicken finger, fries and kids drink/ Nacho plate for $8.00). River Island also offers Internet Cafe, Arcade, Gym, 2 Outdoor bars, 2 big slides, 2 Jacuzzis, ticket office and a Coffee shop serving Starbucks. Tip #2 if you are planning to spend the day @ River Island, come early! Our second day we went to Splash Lagoon, in my personal experience its a much better place than River Island. Less crowded and the water much cooler. Great place for little ones, my 2 yr. old was having a blast! We never answer the Villa's phone. That kept us from going to the timeshare presentation, which I was not interested. If you are planning to get a time-share buy it from a private owner.

I just got back from a weeklong vacation at orange lake! My family of four traded into a 2 bedroom villa via an RCI exchange. Our flight arrived at 11 and we went straight to the resort. We were able to check in but were told our keys would not open the villa until 4. We were given a room in the west villiage, which we were a little upset about. We asked about availability in other villiages but told the units were assigned prior to check in. We drove around the resort and then went to the Publix which is in a shopping center connected to resort. We got food for the week amd then around 3 we went to see if maybe our room keys would work, which they did. At first sight we were all impressed. The unit was not like the floorplan on the website. It was very open with high cielings. My husband and i slept in the master bedroom, so i will start there. The bed was large (king size) and the room was also very spacious. We had our own sliding glass doors that led to the patio as well as our own bathroom. The bathroom however since it was an older low rise unit did not have a jacuzzi tub. My 15 year old daughter and her friend slept in the second bedroom and they had more than enough room in there! There were two queen size beds and a televison. The bathroom was connected to their room as well as to the living area. They managed to have enough drawer/closet space for the two of them, despite the fact that they packed more individually then the rest of the family combined! My ten year old slept on the pull out couch most nights, but since her best friends family was at the resort the same week as us she slept there alot too. The appliances in the kitchen must have been brand new, there was an eletric stove and a convection microwave as well as other new appliances. Our friends who also stayed in a two bedroom were given one in the north villiage and other than the master bathroom, i thought our unit was actually nicer. All in all the accomidations were impressive! We were a short walk to the main west villiage clubhouse, which was very nice. There they have 3 pools as well as the beach and mini golf. This was where the teenagers spent most of their time since they could get there without a lift. The clubhouse had games also like shuffleboard, pool, and ping pong. The beach was really nice as well as very empty most of the time. On the final day of the trip the girls rented a mouse boat for an hour and had fun! The east villiage river island pool complex is also very nice. The lazy river was fun, and in my opinon paying to rent tubes is pointless, it was much better to just swim along without one. The slides at the east villiage were cool, they went really fast actually! The exchange at river island was a nice place to walk around a little as well. Outside of the resort, the best day we had in orlando was when we did discovery cove, which i would reccomend to anyone! it was amazing! We went out to dinner most nights, and our favorite place to eat was houlihans, which was really an experience, and is also right across irlo bronson. Other than that we mostly stayed in the resort relaxing. All i can say is that for all you people who complained about how huge the resort is, take the shuttle? Rent a car? It's not a big deal - it just makes room for more stuff to do!

Don't bother wasting your money! It was soooo hot in there you couldn't wait to get out and the food wasn't the greatest or the selection, service sucked too!!! I think that's the only complaint we had. Also, the West village area is very crowded due to people checking in and out constantly. We were glad we were able to move to the River Island Complex. Oh yeah, the only other problem we couldn't believe we had to deal with was the number of times they closed the lazy river for an hour in the middle of the HOT afternoon for cleaning. It seems they have ALOT of accidents with \"LOGS IN THE POOL\" 3 times on 3 different afternoons, someone [--] in the pool and they had to close it for cleaning. Never in my life have I been to a resort where this has happened, much less 3 TIMES! I asked the waitress about it and she said you'd be surprised how often it does happen. The 1st day it happened we just heard through the grapevine and could hardly believe it but when it happened 2 days later, I asked one of the lifegaurds why they were closing the pool again and he's the one that said \"LOGS in the pool, you know, kids!\" I couldn't believe it! Then on the day we were leaving we heard it happeded again! That was our biggest complaint about Orange Lake. It was kinda the standing joke of the week, wondering if the pool would be closed again due to \"LOGS\" Check out time was 10am and our flight wasn't leaving til 7pm so we asked for a late checkout but that was out of the question. We were told the West and North Village pools had shower areas in the restrooms and we were welcome to use the ammenities until we left for the airport. We chose to go to the North pool until it was time to leave. This pool is very nice too and we figured it wouldn't be as crowded as the west. We found It wasn' t too crowded but they don't have showers in this area, only in the West Village so you may want to keep that in mind if you want to shower after checkout. All in all our stay at Orange Lake was very nice and we would definitely go back. As a matter of fact, my brother and his wife bought a vacation special that they can use in the next 2 years and their timeshare offer is frozen until they come back in case they decide to buy. My husband and I (40+) are already owners and traded through RCI to go to Orange Lake....Next year we're off to ST. Martin..........CARIBBEAN, HERE WE COME!!!!! We had enough of Disney for a while but as for my brother, his wife and 3 kids........they couldn't get enough!!!", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "COLCHESTER , ESSEX.

Now the kids have grown and left home we decided to have three weeks acting our shoe size and not our age. Our accommodation to our delight was in the east village, two bed, two bathroom and all modern appliances. All very clean and fresh. Could not find fault with anything. The apartment was serviced once a week and yes we did wash our towels but I found that as they supplied the washer/dryer, electricity and powder it was not much of a hardship. You do get a welcome pack and I did find ours after two days so look in the cupboard in a plastic bag that looks at first glance just to contain spare toilet rolls and you will find coffee, tea, dishwasher powder and a few other items to get you started. Would be better if it was left out in the kitchen so easier to identify especially if arriving jet lagged! Yes, the resort is very big but we only hired a car for two of our three weeks the last week we spent on the resort using the shuttle bus and walking. I timed a walk from our room to reception and it takes about 40 minutes, 10 minutes to river island and about 3 minutes to the pool in the east village. The bus ran very regularly and often if using it at night the drivers would ask for your block number and take you right to your door, if not the most time it would take to your room would be about 5 minutes walk from the stop. We ate in all the restaurants including the new tradewinds which opened whilst we were there and could recommend them all. The only negative area for us was we went to the country music night and found they shut the bar at 7pm. If driving to the disney theme parks use the toll road 429. (Not the 192). Leave the resort by the east gate (by the publix) turn immediately right onto the 429, (it runs through the middle of the resort). It cost 1 dollar in toll fees but we could get from our apartment to the car park in the magic kingdom within 15 minutes and most of the time we were the only ones using the road it was like having the m25 to yourself. Cannot comment on the older apartments but spent some time talking to some owners of these and they were saying that they were being refurbished and brought more up to date.

In a word the condo was awesome. There was plenty of room for the 10 of us and having 3 bathrooms came in handy in the morning when we were all getting ready to go to the theme parks at the same time. The condo itself had 1 bedroom with a king bed with a nice size chair , a desk, and a large closet.. It also had a large bathroom with 2 sinks, a Jacuzzi tub and separate shower. The 2nd bedroom had a double bed, a small couch that converted into a full size bed, a round glass table with 2 chairs, and a nice size closet. Its bathroom only had 1 sink and a shower. My daughter said the fold out bed was not very comfortable at all. The 3rd bathroom had 2 double beds. It had no other furniture besides small chest of drawers and a small closet. It had no bathroom in it but the 3rd bathroom is right outside the door. It also had only a single sink and just a shower. The kitchen is full sized and comes with most everything you need to do any cooking if you wanted to. They did no have any storage bowls for leftovers so we bought large freezer bags to do that. The living room had a large sectional couch which made into a queen size bed but my other daughter said it was more comfortable to sleep on the couch itself and not fold out the bed. The screened in balcony was great and we could see fireworks every night from both MGM and the Magic Kingdom theme parks. No bugs to bother us as we sat out there every night The air conditioning worked great and the ceiling fans were very nice as well. All in all I had no complaints about anything. The room was clean and there was no worn furniture or bugs or dirt or mold or anything bad. There were some raccoons that we saw on the 3rd floor landing that left their \u201ccalling cards\u201d on some of the stairs but we managed not to step in any! The pool areas, the lake, and the other public areas were also very nice. They were building a new 36 hole mini golf course at River Island and they opened up a new steak and seafood restaurant the day we left so we did not get to try it. The two 18 hole golf courses were impressive and fun to play. Prices are good especially after 11 AM. They also have 2 Par-3 courses one that is lighted for night play. We did not play those as we were too busy. The resort was kind of pricey when it came to meals and other purchases. You had to spend $6 a peice for the floats to use the lazy river and the food and drinks were about the same as they were at all the theme parks. But the prices were what you should expect to pay at one of these places so it was not a suprise. we planned ahead and brought a lot of our own snacks and drinks to the pool with us. You are not supposed to do that but we did and no one said anything to us. If I had one bad thing to say about the place it would be that if you are going to spend your days at the theme parks and just need a place to sleep and get cleaned up, Orange Lake is too much. You could spend 3 or 4 days just doing the things available at the resort and never have to go anywhere else with the possible exception of the Publix grocery store which is right out the east gate or the property.

The room is cheaply appointed. There is NO ceiling fan in the second bedroom. There are no DVD players. The mattresses are uncomfortable and there are no mattress covers, so you feel every nook and cranny of the mattress. There are racoons everywhere in the evening going through the garbages. When we called the desk to let them know, they said \"yeah there are a lot of them around here\". Also, the resort is down wind of the 'animal kingdonm'. On a humid evening, the smell is thick. There are number of swimming pools, which is nice, unfortunately, you must drive to most of them. They didn't use a nice material when surfacing the decks though. You and your children will definately burn your feet, unless wearing water shoes. The black ground bakes in the afternoon sun. Further more, they just put in a lazy river which we were excited to use. You may only use it though with a rented raft for $6 a piece. If you have children and are there for a few days, this can be VERY expensive. Also, they put in a couple of nice water slides, those though are for children over 48\". Again, something not advertised and something very dissapointing to children. The slide simply aren't exiciting for someone over 48\". By the way, the surface of the pool deck at the lazy river is extremely slippery and again, very hot. Try keeping water shoes on both of your small chilren. The pool is supposed to be a fun place. Not only do they nickel and dime you at the pool, but we took our children to the arcade one evening and they won some tickets, but when my six year old brought up 38 tickets, they said sorry, that's only good for 35 tickets. They round down and not up. All my child wanted was an extra tootsie. All she wanted was tootsie rolls. Not a pack, just single ones, so she chose 7, they refused to give her 8. They wouldn't round up two more. This may sound trivial, but these are the things that you get for halloween and end up throwing out. These 38 tickets that she won cost $5. This was just a principal thing for me. Also, one day they had a bon fire that they had announced but canceled at the last minute due to chance of rain....it's Florida...there's always a chance of an afternoon rain. It didn't rain, they just canceled it with no explanation. Again, another dissapintment for the children. Another time, they had an 'aligator show'. For $5 a person, your chilren could see a terrible short movie and see a baby aligator and another small aligator. Again, $5 per person. It seems trivial, but for what they were giving you this should have just been a guest appreciation event. If we had never stayed at any hotels or resorts in the area at similar prices, we might not have expected much, but Orange Lake was easily the worst place we've stayed in Orlando.

Anywhere you go there will be people who are not, will not and cannot be satisfied. The last vacation we had last August, 2005, we brought with us our friends who have no other words but praises for the whole experience that they wanted to go back even before the whole experience is over. We loved the pools, - the 8-year old boys with us loved to frolic in them, - and we can't wait for the River Island to be in full swing. You can't expect the pools to be quiet and with limited number of people on a peak season so if you are somebody who doesn't want to be bothered we suggest off-peak season vacation. The villa itself are well kept and mind you, we have also stayed on those \"old villas or condos\" that were mentioned in some of the reviews when my mother-in-law was with us but we find no problems with it. About the OL bird that comes to \"visit\", we find it to be more natural due to the fact that it adds to the beauty of the resort. Insects are somewhat expected to be present due to the many lush shrubberies and the lake itself. The grounds are well kept. The amenities are superb and we are hoping the next the next time we visit OL we would be able to use it instead of going to the theme parks. We love the comfort of the big, well equipped kitchen that we have and the thought of Publix just \"around the corner.\" It is always a welcome sight to see the starter pack provided each time we visit.

It had been cleaned, but the floors were dirty, and all week long we had to wear socks if we didn't want our feet to get black from the floors. I had read reviews by guests who had requested a newer unit, so right away I called guest services and asked for a newer unit, possibly in the North or East Villages. Unfortunately I was told that requests were only accepted by owners. So we just stayed put. Like I said, the unit was \"ok\", but it jjust wasn't very clean, and it had a nasty smell. There were bugs, but I know that is to be expected in older places in Florida. We had a problem with our fridge not working, and I called guest services to have someone take a look at it. We left for the pool that morning, and when we came back later in the day, it still wasn't working. Since we had the fridge stocked with groceries we had just bought, I called guest services again, and the operator I spoke with said the first call had never even been logged. She made sure to log the call, and got someone out right away to fix it. As for the pools, again, they were beautiful at a glance, but they were very crowded.

Our unit was about 5 years old (I think) and was large and well equipped. Upon arrival, we did notice a couple of maintenance issues which we called about and they were dealt with immediately. The resort complex is large and they are adding to it. The grounds are lovely and well maintained. My kids enjoyed the swimming pools and we enjoyed a couple of good meals at the Legacy Grill (without waiting). Overall, I would return here in a heartbeat. The location is close to Disneyworld and to the Orlando international airport. We found the staff friendly. The East Gate entrance closes at 10 p.m. We found that out one night, and had to use the West Gate entrance. Check out at 10 a.m. was firmly enforced on the date of our departure but our kids enjoyed the pool until it was time to leave for the airport.

We exchanged an RCI week (again) to get here. I've read some other reviews posted for March 2006 and am surprised they had problems. We've stayed here twice and have had nothing but an outstanding experience both times. We were unfortunate enough to get a studio in the clubhouse. It just wasn't big enough for a family of four. There was no chance to upgrade as all units were essentially taken. First about the unit. If you are a family of 4 or more, then don't book a studio. Way too small. Some people don't like the West Village 2-bedroom golf villas. But my wife and I prefer them over the new high rise, hotel-style villas. (Granted, the golf villas are older, but they are bigger and no stairs or elevators to deal with. Parking 10 steps from you door is a plus after a full day of activities either at the theme parks or here.) I like the ground floor golf villas. Walk out onto the patio with coffee and paper in hand and watching duffers slice the ball as badly as I do at 7:00 a.m. each morning. It does my heart good. We like the golf villa so much so, we bought a golf villa timehsare here this trip. (Hint: If interested in any type of timeshare here, make sure to ask the sales people about pre-owned timeshares. THEY ARE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS CHEAPER!!!!! You can always buy a golf villa and trade to the new style villas if you want.) We toured the new villas, but weren't too interested in them. Sure they look prettier, but really, how much time are you staying in your room?? Is it really worth the extra cost? If you ever get a chance to use them, the on-site amenities are just too numerous to list. (See other reviews.) Our kids just loved all the pools (I lost count at 10!!!! That's all the fingers I have and the wife wasn't too happy about my driving with no hands on the wheel.) We can't wait until the on-site water park opens. They say it will be done by May-June 2006. It looks amazing. They say that it cost $52 million to build! We found that the resort grounds were immaculately kept. Still. They have added a bunch of new units since our stay 3 years ago. (Had the West Village golf villa then.) We had only one minor housekeeping issue (no pillow cover) and it was taken care of in less than 15 minutes. All units, including studios, are fully equipped with plates, glasses, dishes, stove, microwave, etc. and include complimentary coffee (1 package regular and 1 decaf). (CAUTION: BUY MORE COFFEE IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!) Every unit (except studios) have FULL SIZE washer/dryers in the unit. You already know about Disney and Universal being sooooo close, so, no need to go there. The biggest problem we had was traffic coming back from the parks. It was a real hassle when you're beat from all the stuff the parks offer. I have to say that without a doubt the people that work here are OUTSTANDING. Everyone, and I mean everyone, we had to deal with from check in/out to the internet cafe, to the bars and restaurants, to the on-site grocery store (milk is cheaper here than at Publix) to the timeshare people to housekeeping were nothing but professional and very friendly.

We had a First Class, Gold Crown exchange, but Orange Lake treated us as if we had a steerage exchange. Orange Lake has three tiers of accommodations: Villa, high rises and \"Guest\". We were assigned to \"Guest\" accommodations because we were not Orange Lake owners. RCI has a policy that you get equivalent accommodations when you go through their exchange program, so we didn't worry. The \"Guest\" accommodations we were assigned to were worn and musty, definitely not at our level of exchange. I have seen better two star accommodations. So, we went back to registration to tell them that we wanted better accommodations. Registration told us to go to another desk. Desk #2 told us to go to desk #3. When we got to the desk #3 it was closed. So we went back to Desk #2 and got a phone number. We were told to use a telephone in the middle of a busy lobby. It was very hard to hear since they were holding Bingo in the same area. The customer service representative that answered was polite, accommodating, and understood our reason for wanting a better room. She made the computer changes and told us to go back to Registration and pick up a new key. By the time we were done going back and forth over an hour had past. Not the best of starts. At this point, we were tired and hungry, so we went down to the pizza shop in the Registration building. It took over 20 mins. to get a server to acknowledge us and another 40 mins for the pizza to come. By the way, there were only two other customers in the shop. When we got to the new room, it was much better and appeared to be up to Gold Crown standard. It wasn't until we checked around the next day to find that there was mold, mildew and bugs in both bathrooms; some of the bathroom tiles in the master bath were falling off; and a number of supplies, like soap, were missing. We called Guest Services and got the supplies, but no one in the week we were there addressed the tiles, mold, mildew or bugs. Maintenance was not a forte at Orange Lake. We came back to the suite one night at 11pm to find our fire alarms chirping. Apparently, they hadn't changed the batteries in over a year, so we had to wait until midnight for maintenance to replace the batteries. By the way, they say they have shuttle service between the buildings and functions, but we had to walk a full half a mile to get to a shuttle stop. We then had to bake in the Florida sun for 15 mins. It wasn't worth it. One night, we were called and invited to a one hour breakfast the next day so that they could tell us about the new water park being built on site. We were told that it was not a sales pitch; they understood we were RCI exchangers and wouldn't want to buy anything. They just wanted to advertise the waterpark. Three times I was told that it wouldn't take more than an hour. Silly me, I believed them. After 2.5 hours we were released from timeshare sales hell. We couldn't really leave, because they drove a mile away from our car to go the \"breakfast\". We had to go all the way through the sales pitch to get out. The double talk and fake professionalism was laughable. Then to end things, we went to check out and they charged us $5 for placing three 800 phone calls. What a rip off.

The slide pool was great but so overcrowded even my children chose the smaller less crowded pool by the end of the week. This is totally not Orange Lake's fault but the large crowds at the pool seemed to breed rudeness. The line for the slide was long and people decided they were not going to wait... a simple lifeguard there to monitor could have solved that. When the activities director tried to conduct a race down the slide, timing kids as they went down, was a practice in futility. The condo was a 2 br 2 ba unit that wasn't the worst in our history of RCI but close to it. Poor televsion choices, for when it rained of kids break time from the sun, turned into an issue because it had never been an issue before.

Out of the 7 nights we were there, we spent 3 days at disney and the rest of the time, our kid wanted to stay at the resort and swim.

I would not have been happy with a clubhouse room or one of the older units. when checking in we did specifically ask for a newer unit and I think we were lucky to get one.

I guess to that I would say i'd take my chances and check in way late in hopes that all the older units are assigned and you might get lucky and get a new one. The one HUGE negative we found was that the restrooms at the main clubhouse pool area and east village pool area were absolutely disgusting. There was NO water pressure anywhere so the automatic toilets were not flushing all the way and then one toilet acutally overflowed very slowly. GROSS. We rarely saw housekeeping cleaning around the pool areas. Some people might say the resort is too large, but if that's your only complaint - there's still building so it's only getting bigger. For as big as the resort is, you don't feel like you're always surrounding by large amounts of people. By giving us so many swimming options, it really spreads out the people.

We visited the villas in the much maligned West Village and found them to be really quite nice. I don't know why some folk have been so negative in some of the reviews on TRIPADVISOR. This Resort has a Gold Crown Rating from RCI and in our view certainly deserves it. It is true some of the \"Older Units\" may need updating but the Management is busy doing so. We were not \"Pestered\" by the Sales staff. We attended a presentation and said we were not interested and that was the end of that. Before our two weeks were up, we decided we wanted two fixed weeks here where we could always come to and so bought two Spring weeks on the RESALE market. They are both in the \"Older\" Villas in the West Village Area. One of them we bought through the Orange Lake Resale Dept (Very effecient,honest,courteos, and forthright) and the second week,Privately through the web site \"Redweek.com\".

I had to go to a different desk, but the lady there was very friendly, and found us a unit in the East Village to switch to, she said it was brand new. The place was beautiful! Nicely decorated with a very large galley kitchen with eat at counter. Full size pantry. Very clean and bright. On the other side of the counter was a large tv on a built in shelf facing the living room. There was a built in banquet seating at the dining table , also several chairs. A very comfortable living room with a huge couch, lots of colorful prints on the walls. A totally screened in porch overlooked the Legands golf course. Full size washer and dryer. TV's in master bedroom and in the other bedroom with 2 double sized beds, perfect for our 3 kids!! The master bathroom was fantastic, large shower and jacuzzi tub. The place was just beautiful, spacious, well decorated and painted, and totally clean and new. There is a pool in the East Village, but we went to the Splash Lagoon pool becasue the kids loved the slide, waterfalls, basketball hoop and volleyball net, you get the balls at the pool shop. They have a nice restaurant there also with outdoor seating, a separate kiddy pool, and a splash fountain the kids could run through. The whole Splash Lagoon pool area is beautiful, with lots of pretty trees and plants, a fountain, and lots of lounge chairs and tables. WE LOVED IT!! They are building a new pool area with lazy river, we would love to go back and check it out. The west village clubhouse where you check in looked a little dated, but they had free popcorn for the kids & balloon animals to keep them occupied for a few minutes. They also have a desk where you can buy all your park tickets, and a separate Disney desk where we got our Disney tickets. In addition, they have a small inside play area, arcade, and movie theatre. They have lots of family activities, but we spent our time visiting Magic Kingdom, MGM and Epcot. We had a rental car, and thought it was quite convienent to the parks, especially Magic Kingdom. Last year we stayed at Disney's Wilderness lodge and used Dsiney Trasportation. My husband and I liked having our own car much better. Disney's monorail is nice, but it only connects to 3 resorts, and 2 parks (MK and Epcot) I believe. We had to take their bus a lot, and it definalty slowed us down as it had to make other stops usually before getting us to our destination. Also, if you stay at Wilderness lodge and take the boat launch to get to MK, you usually have to backtrack to the Disney campground area, and also Contemporary to pick up people. Orange lake is defiantly closer to Disney though than Universal. We were very pleasantly surprised by how nice the place is. We are already thinking of going back.

I have been to the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Hilton Head Island, just to name a few. You would think that the resorts there would be even more extravegant than ones in Florida, but Let me tell you how dissapointed I have been at several \"top\" vacation spots in the world. Every year when we come back to Orange Lake, I feel like I am at a home away from home. I know my way around, the condos are ALWAYS clean, stocked and if something is wrong (which there usually never is) management is there, as soon as you hang up the phone, to fix it. anyone who doubts staying at Orange Lake is only making a huge mistake. I get more excited to go back there every other year than I do to go anywhere else. Thanks Orange Lake, you make our family vacations the best!

I recommended this resort to my two girlfriends so that we could all do a couples get-away one summer. After speaking with them a week later, I was aggravated and appalled when they told me they would not stay at the resort because of bad reviews they read on the internet. I did not believe it was possible that Orange Lake could have negative reviews. Then I came online and read for myself, a bunch of one-timers writing about all sorts of mishaps. I'm not about to say that what they are saying is untrue, I do not know that. What I do know is that I stayed at Orange Lake for one fabulous week and we had no problems at all. We stayed in a two bedroom unit with eleven people. Now I don't know about anyone else, but when I go on vacation and stay at a hotel or resort, I call in advance or do as much research as I can, so I can be prepared as to what I may need to bring. A simple phone call would would tell you if the resort has this, how many of that, etc... Orange Lake has several pools, during the day in mid-summer, of course the pools will be crowded, of course it will be loud. It is Florida and it is the summer. If you plan to go to Disney World, newsflash, that place is loud and crowded, if you're prepared for that, then you have to imagine that any resort in that area will be similar. A bunch of families there to have fun, and doing just that, having fun. You need not stay at a resort near Disney if you want a quiet vacation, or try to get a room on an upper floor. These are things you have to think about before you plan a vacation. Things happen, bad things, they can happen anywhere, maybe you have bad luck or maybe the person who was in the unit before you broke the stove burner and didn't tell anyone. I understand freedom of speech, but I think it is wrong to discredit a resort because you went there once and things went wrong. I went there once, everything went right and my fiance and I plan to buy weeks there when we get married. I am not one to do or not to do judging by what others say, I'm not telling you to go to Orange Lake, I'm not telling you not to go, but what is life if you do things based on other people's opinions?

I wanted to submit a review after reading a few on this website. I hope my review is helpful. I exchanged through RCI to get into this resort. Orange Lake is a BIG resort with some very nice accomodations. We requested and stayed at the Tennis Villas. We has a large two bedroom, two bath unit that was very nice. Our unit was clean and spacious. We had a small, screened-in patio that overlooked the lake. The patio was okay; somehow a few insects found their way into the patio. The kitchen included everything we needed. It had a starter supply of coffee filters, one roll of paper towels and dishwasher detergent. There was enough pots, dishes, glasses, mugs and cutlery. The dining table really sat 6 people. There was a counter area that sat 2 more. Don't think that you can comfortably seat 8 at the dinner table. I think this is common with timeshares. (I stayed at another timeshare, Hilton Grand Vacations Club, in a 3 BR that slept 12 and the table sat 6 also). The master bath was HUGE. My daughter loved the jacuzzi bath and I liked the large shower. The second bathroom did not have a bathtub; only a shower. We had enough towels, including facetowels, for eight people. The washer / dryer worked well. The beds were comfortable; pillows were OK. The unit had a thermostat so we were able to adjust to our liking. We did not use the sofa bed so I cannot comment on that. We had a problem with a water leak from somewhere above us. Thankfully, we were still in our unit and put a large pot / towels under the leak. We called the front desk and left for our daily activities. When we returned, the maintenance people had fixed the problem and our carpet dried quickly. No musty odor. We had a midweek cleaning. With a timeshare resort, if you want fresh towels, you have to wash / dry them yourself. We did ALOT of wash during our stay because I like fresh, clean towels and clothers. They only provided a starter supply of laundry detergent so if you are like me, go buy your own. The parking lot fills up in the evening so we had to walk a little further sometimes. It depends on the time of year. Since we were off season, it wasn't bad. I would think there would be a problem in high season. I thought the \"ONE\" elevator was a bit slow sometimes. Thank goodness we were on the second floor so we just used the stairs when we could. I believe thay have 2 (maybe 3) luggage carts. On check-in day, they are hard to find. I expected the same on check-out day so I moved most of our items into the car the night before we checked out. Our location was great. It was near the central pool complex. They had plenty of pool towels and the pool was pretty busy during the day. They had a variety of pools to choose from. They also had a small playground area for kids. There really is an Orange Lake. You could rent a pedal boat or a jet ski. We rented a petal boat for an hour and had a nice time going around. There are some private homes around the lake. They had a small beach area which is great for the kids. The only thing was that they would not allow swimming in the water. I read that there was runoff that could be harmful and then I also heard from a resort staff person that there was a small alligator living in the lake. I never saw the alligator but did not venture more than ankle-deep in the water. Remember that in Florida, alligators can be found in lake areas. I couldn't criticize the resort for this, but maybe they should post some signs at the beach about NO SWIMMING. Since the resort is large, we had to drive to the North Village to use the pool complex there. It was very nice. This is the newer area and the pool has a water slide. There was also a fountain the kids could play in. The kids LOVED the water slide. The water was very clean and there were enough chaise loungers for everyone who wanted one. I can see availability of these chaise loungers being a problem in high season. We did not eat at the restaurant. We ordered pizza from the pizzeria and it was good. They deliver to your room. They have a small general store but we did not buy anything from there. You get a better selection and price by going outside. You need a car to get around this resort. Though the resort claims it is closest to Disney since one area is adjacent to Animal Kingdon, don't think this means you can get to Disney faster. There are two entrances / exits to the resort. Both go to Route 192 which is always crowded; sometimes more than others. We were there in late OCTOBER and it consistently took us 15-20 minutes to get to Disney. I took the time to attend one of the timeshare presentations to find out more about the resort. They have an internal exchange system and I understand that only Orange Lake owners can exchange into the North and East Village. They are planning on building a water park at this resort; I forgot when they said it would be completed. If you are interested in buying at this resort, do your research and don't buy from the sponsor, as you will always pay a higher price. Look at the resales or purchase from an owner who is looking to sell; you will get a better price. I think the Tennis Villas, North Village and East Village areas are worthy of the RCI Gold Crown Rating. There were other areas (single story units / sections) that were older and not as spacious. This is probably where most of the complaints about accomodations come from. I would have been very disappointed if I got a unit in one of those other areas. My advice is to research this resort before you come and ask for the area you want. Hopefully they can accomodate you. If you won an auction to get into this resort, be aware that you may get an older unit. The studio units are in the clubhouse and they are kind of like a hotel room. If you get a 1 bedroom unit, you cannot stay at the Tennis Villas, as they only have 2 and 3 BR units here. One thing I have learned in my years of exchanges is to stay away from ground floor units. If you are in a multi-story building, the ground floor offers less privacy, a bit more noise, and the probability of more crawling insects making their way in.

The first choice was an older unit at the back of the complex - it was ground-level and very spacious but dimly-lit with extremely small bathrooms and sagging mattresses. We chose a 5th floor unit in the Tennis Villas because of the view, the close proximity to the registration area and the updated furnishings. This unit seemed slightly smaller than the first, but was much nicer. This area was also extremely quiet - we had no problems with noise of any kind. We were not hounded by timeshare sales agents, either. The Splash Lagoon pool area is extremely nice - large, beautifully landscaped and lots of fun for the kids.

When I purchased my time, I was promised a two bedroom condo and a morning presentation since I would only be staying for three days. I paid almost one year ahead of time. My 8 year old son and I traveled sixteen hours in a car to be greeted with a studio with two beds and when I questioned this I was told by reservations that I was lucky to have that. That was after fighting for a place to park and dodging the drunks on golf carts. I was then shuffled off to another desk to set up my \"tour\" which was moved to a 12:30 p.m. time versus the morning. Check in is at 4:00 p.m., we checked in at 4:00 p.m., the morning was already booked. How is that possible? Maybe it's the same people that take the seats at the pool? So that ate up the middle of one of our only three days of our vacation. The next morning we went to Splash Lagoon. Much to our surprise, we got there 10 minutes after the pool opened and every chair by the pool was \"checked\" with a towel. There were only four people in the pool, every chair covered with a towel. They must have all been on the morning tour that I was supposed to be on! I drug a chair from another area over to watch my son in the pool. Of course, he got pounced by the teenagers that were unsupervised and left after being choked and dunked. We were then off to our presentation with Mike. I told Mike all the problems that we were having. He offered me the great deal of $21,000 for 20 years at 15.9% interest and one week a year could be mine! He must think I left my common sense in Ohio. Why would I put all that money into one week at a hotel that cannot even give me the room I was promised or at least guarantee me a seat at the pool! Instead of paying all these people to walk around the pool and do nothing, why don't they pay some lifeguards! After I told Mike no, again, we left. The next day I checked my credit card to make sure I was not being over charged, of course I was. Orange Lake has decided to put a $120 hold on my account for incidentals without my knowledge. Nothing was said at check in. Nothing was said with reservations. Nothing. I then called the front desk to ask what this charge was for. I was transferred to reservations to which a woman snipped at me that this was customary and I should have asked. How do you know to ask that you are going to be charged for something you did not know about? By the way, incidentals are if you decide to use their restaurants and charge it to your room, that would be an incidental. I was incidentally paying for everything with cash and not spending my every waking moment at Orange Lake giving them more of my money. That didn't matter because they already had my money! I was also being charged to turn on the phone in my room. What the heck is that?! To add insult to injury the only time I used the phone was the time that I was on the phone to Orange Lake. Maybe next they will put a lock on the toilet and you will have to pay for the use. Taht would be an incidental. She then said that it would take days to release my money. Mind you, it took one day to hold my money, several days to release my money! This is not Orange Lake this is Lemon Lake. At least when you stay at a hotel, you know you will get hotel treatment. When you stay at a resort and get hotel treatment, that's the slap in the face. This is the most unethical place I have ever stayed. Never ever ever again.
