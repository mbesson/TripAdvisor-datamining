{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Amazing Resort, Service and Management This is one of the best Amans I have ever been to (and I have visited every one in Asia except China and Sri Lanka!).I attended a wedding and everything was perfect. What truly amazed me was the professionalism of the General Manager, Lisa, who was charming, warm and always there for the wedding guests. Her staff are also perfectly trained and catered to one's every wish. Even an ironing board took only 5 minutes to arrive! This is a beautiful resort. The website does not do it justice! The pool is magical, the beach is so spacious it is decadent, and the villa... the villa is superb! Sunken bath, outdoor shower, giant terrace with thatched roof, and wonderful views (ask for a villa with sea view). Truly magnificent. And they will renovate the resort now so I cannot imagine how amazing it will be after this work!!Thanks Lisa (the GM) for a great short break. You are a jewel in the Aman collection Hopefully you can also run Bora Bora!!!", "Date": "Nov 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR800713398", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "LaVerite"}, {"Content": "Aman Resorts do not disappoint Service levels even better than average for Aman.Many positives: Serene location, hill top long distance views. Very relaxing environment and ambiance. Prices more reasonable (i.e. resort restaurants) than other Aman or comparable resorts.Negative: Hill top very long distance view of sea. You must take a shuttle car to Aman owned beach, or ride a resort provided bicycle. If you are seeking ocean front resort, most other resorts offer this and Aman does not. This is not clear anywhere we looked for information on this resort and was our one disappointment.", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR970734747", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ValVil"}, {"Content": "Utopia Staying at Amanusa is dangerous. I have now contracted Amanusitis - a near fatal disease which makes it impossible to concentrate on work once returning home from a stay there.The place is simply stunning !I had been there for dinner only on previous stays in Bali, so had some idea of the place, but staying there is something else.We had come from a four night stay at Amankila - also a wonderful resort, but Amanusa has a lot of advantages over it - naturally you are transported via a very comfortable 4WD, complete with pillows and cold drinks. On arrival you are treated as if you are the only guests there. Straight to the villa, and check in is a one minute experience. We were upgraded to an ocean view villa, with private pool. The welcome bottle of Moet arrived seconds later.The bath was filled with frangipanis, the bed scattered with rose petals ( we had advised Amankila that it was our 20th wedding anniversary, and they had passed this on to Amanusa ). At night our private pool was candlelit, and candles lit on our bedside tables. There was an indoor shower, and an outdoor shower.The room was simply gorgeous - not too minimalist, and surrounded by private gardens. I like to see some colour in the gardens and decor, and there was enough, whilst still looking very stylish.The three restaurants are all good - the Italian restaurant - their feature restaurant - was very stylish, and the food excellent. The Thai/ Indonesian restaurant has the best views of Bali, and also excellent food. At the beach, the casual restaurant there serves fabulous pizza and burgers. The head chef came out to meet us one night - Hamish - very friendly and obviously very good at his job.The pool was fantastic. For most of our stay, I was the only guest in it ! Water temperature was perfect. Poolside service impeccable - as soon as a leaf from the many bouganvillea surrounding the pool dropped, it was swept up ! Cold water, towels and sunscreen were delivered to us within minutes, as was a platter of iced fruit.To go to the beach you take a car ( beautiful old roofless VW ) on a 5 minute drive around the golf course. I thought the distance to the beach may have been an issue, but not so. It was actually a very enjoyable scenic drive. The beach club is to die for. The sand was perfectly white, the water a beautiful shade of blue. There are 8 private bales, each accompanied by a pair of sun loungers. Once again, you are immediately spoilt by the staff.The beach hawkers are there, but will only come to you if you allow it. They were not pushy at all, and we enjoyed the process of purchasing sarongs, scarves etc. My husband and I each had a full massage on our private bale ( the hawkers are multi skilled ! ), I had a pedicure, and bought a silk scarf, all for AUD $50 !So, in all , this resort has it all ! It is very expensive, but once there you forget about that and jusk soak up the wonderful experience. The staff know exactly who you are, from the lobby staff, to the drivers and restaurant staff. My husband was ill for most of our stay, and once this was mentioned to a staff member in the lobby, it seemed everyone in the resort was aware of it, and constantly asked if he was okay, or needed a doctor. ( He loved the attention ! )I've been to Bali about 15 times, but this was just an incredible holiday, different from the previous visits due to the level of luxury provided by the resort. It is very special. I previously rated Huka Lodge in NZ as my favourite hotel / resort in the world, but this place tops it. I cannot wait to return ( and return I will, at all costs ! ), so just need another special occasion to justify it !", "Date": "May 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR722233590", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Bali-dreaming"}, {"Content": "Sybaritic escape We stayed in one of the pool suites which are exquisitely designed, each with its own private bale into which beautiful fresh heliconias were placed as a finishing touch.... and speaking of which, at Amanusa there are many (sit at the pool and within minutes receive a welcome cool fresh fruit salad and cold towel) We loved the Beach breakfeast...go early and watch the sun rise (sleep later when the heat is intense) We have stayed at several Aman resorts but the food here has to be the best.

This was our third time at Amanusa at we were a bit disappointed. We already stayed there in 2001 and 2002, becaming a real Amanjunkies, but this time the resort was below our expectations. Only a few details, of course, but when you pay $ 1000 a night you can expect PERFECTION (or not!?!). 1) The first times we were there we were immediately recognized by name at the airport and at the resort for all our stay - with only 30 rooms I think you can make it! - this time did not happen.2) The rooms are always beautiful but they look a bit old: the cushion of our sofa and of our day bed on the terrace were dirty, with lots of spots: they simply need to be washed... nothing more... Same problem with pool day beds.3) I had to ask three times to book a table at a restaurant near the hotel, before receiving confirmation. I waited only for a written note, nothing more! When asked for information about a new restaurant in Bali the Guest assistant said she knew nothing about it and listed the names of the most famous restaurants in Bali, that you can find in any guidebooks. I think that hotels of this level should have a concierge service with top preparation. If you don't know, you can still enquiry, or not?!!!4) Last (but not least), at the end of our previous stays at Aman resorts, we always received nice gits on departure, such as wooden statues, mother-of-pearl ashtrays, and so on. They are nice souvenirs of our trips we keep in our house. This time: a little box of chocolate cookies, the same we had with our coffee! I know they are just little details, but at these prices...On the positive side, always GREAT POOL, GREAT BEACH CLUB, GREAT VIEWS (lots of building sites) and beatiful gardens as usual.", "Date": "Aug 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR861572797", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Miciogatto"}, {"Content": "Excellent Perfect all around, very well invested, excellent staff and service.

We stayed 3 nights here and 3 each at Amankila and the Amandari.I personally didn't like Kuta beach and after seeing the rest of Bali would have skipped this part of the trip. Way too touristy and still struggling from the bombings.The Hotel was very nice, rooms great - what you expect from an Aman. We really liked the Amandari and Amankila much better.It is expensive and they do everything they can for you. It is all about service and they follow through.Eat locally - it is 1/6th the price.Golf at the Bali Country Club wasn't very good. We went to the Nirwana course next and it was *top notch* and well worth the drive. I was also dissapointed by the Bali Handara Kosaido country club. If you are a good golfer - just visit the Nirwana.So nice hotel, but I didn't travel around the world to see Kuta beach and be hassled by hawkers around every corner.", "Date": "Jan 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR110046962", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Matt321"}, {"Content": "Fantastic hotel I stayed at both Amanusa and Amankila and I prefer Amanusa as the hotel has more space and the beach is much nicer.
