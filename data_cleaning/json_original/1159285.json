The Inn at St Botolph's seemed a perfect fit and, if it weren't for a few but significant let-downs, I would have rated this much higher. Disclaimer - I made my reservation through the online corporate travel agent, so the Inn's website may warn travelers of these things that I didn't see. First, the Inn allows smoking and the smell of smoke permeates the halls and rooms every night. If you stay when the weather is warm, opening your windows might alleviate this if you don't smoke (not an option in February). Second, if you find you have to cut your stay short you still must pay for the entire reserved stay. I could understand this policy for, say, a remote cabin or VRBO, but an urban inn in the center of Boston? Someone having to cut their stay short is likely experiencing a stressful situation already, this just adds to that stress. I also was unable to connect to the internet there using my company's computer - the staff did try to help and referred me to their provider's 800 number but, after an hour of trying, I chose not to keep pursuing it - caveat emptor if you're travelling on business.

The Inn also offers a complimentary breakfast which includes bagels, breakfast bars, refreshments, etc. The Inn is right across the street from The Prudential which has numerous shops and restaurants.

It is an unassuming building which blends into the row houses in its cute Back Bay neighborhood. The hotel is very small, with only 14(?) guestrooms.

Room - wonderful: We stayed in the smallest room, a studio suite. It had a comfortable bed, a well equipped kitchen, and a sophisticated, unfussy decor. I wanted to check out a 1-bedroom before we left, but ran out of time. Hotel amenities: a small fitness room with free water bottles; a guest laundry; a wonderful lounge with hot and cold drinks always available; and a friendly, helpful person always available in the office. Only complaint: the bathroom was really cold and there was no counter around the sink. Another comment: I had never been to an access-code hotel before. Right before we left home, I received an email with out hotel room and hotel main-door code.

I was a bit concerned about this when I first got to Boston, but after walking around found that the 'downtown' area was a bit shabby and dull anyway, compared to the Basck Bay area which is lovely. In all, the Inn is close to what you need - it is practically opposite the Prudential Centre, with food, shops, etc., and a few blocks from Newbury Street, which is pretty with all its fairy lights. On my first night I stayed in a 'one bedroom' suite, which was next to the lift, which was a bit noisy; on the others, I stayed in a studio, which was much better, though smaller (not a problem for solo traveller). In terms of breakfast - it is very simple, and could do with fresh fruit - which would be disappointing if you were in Boston for the cuisine, but I was not. Having a printer and a laundry were incredibly useful to me also. The Inn has a policy of not cleaning the rooms for stays less than a week unless requested.

There is a continental breakfast available free every morning with bagels, muffins, orange juice, coffee tea and yoghurt which was very handy and saved us having to go out for breakfast every day. Also use of an Apple Mac in the breakfast room which let us print out boarding passes for the trip home. The Inn is very well located right next to the Prudential Centre/Copley Square for eating shopping and a short walk from Newbury St and Boston Common.

Despite being just one or two blocks from Copley Place and right across the street from the Prudential subway station, it was actually cheaper than the conference rate at the Marriott, it came with breakfast and free wifi, and the suite even had a living room and a fully-stocked kitchenette! I was quite impressed. There is no check-in or check-out and there are no hotel keys: a couple of weeks before your stay the staff emails you access codes for the main hotel door and for your room door, and the codes simply start to work at the time of check-in and stop working at the time of check-out. There is a front desk, of course, in case you need something, but it really felt more like I had rented a small apartment for a few days, which is why I say this place is great for the independent traveler. (Room cleanup is on an as-requested basis, but even that is nice since you don't have to worry about leaving things out during the day.) Breakfast was a bit less impressive than I would have liked, since it is fairly basic continental fare, and while we were there they ran out of yogurt and didn't get more for a couple of days. Still, it's nice that they have anything at all, and they do have a fancy coffee-maker that stays operational throughout the day so you can have as much coffee, tea, or hot chocolate as you would like. Overall, I'd say it's a great value, especially for the location, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

This inn is for people looking for more of a condo experience. You really feel like this is your own little apartment smack in the center of Boston. Here's a summary. ROOMS: My husband, 2 year-old daughter and I stayed in the one-bedroom suite (bedroom closed off from living room). Very modern and sleek. For those with young children, rental baby cots are available (40$ flat rate). It fits snuggly in a corner of the bedroom. The Queen bed is very comfy and there's an angled wall-hung flat-screen TV facing the bed, as well as an iPod docking station. The living room is stylish and comfy with another flat-screen TV over the gas fireplace. Our room had a small kitchen area (fridge, microwave, sink, and stovetop) perfect for having breakfast or fixing a quick lunch. All new utensils and dishes. The bathroom is small but efficient. Shower only, but a large one. Plush robes at your disposal. Amazingly enough, even though you are mere steps away from the Prudential Center, rooms are very quiet because the inn is located on a calm side street. My only small complaint was that it was difficult to balance the air conditioning between the bedroom and living room. When the living room was comfortable, we were freezing in the bedroom. Took more than a few tries to get it right. BREAKFAST: Free of charge. There is a common lounge area downstairs where you can pick up coffee, tea, juice, bagels, yogurt, and English muffins (no plain bread!?). You can eat there, but most people seem to bring everything up to their room. CHECK-IN/OUT: Super easy and efficient. Two weeks before you check-in, you receive two codes by email. One to open the front door and the other to access your room. No keys to carry around or lose! Codes are functional only from check-in time, i.e. 3pm. No front desk, but should you need anything at all, there is an office downstairs manned from 7am to 10pm. PARKING: This is the biggest issue for a lot of people wanting to stay here, but it's really not that complicated. Basically, there is no parking, on-street or otherwise. However, as I said, the Prudential Center is steps away and has a large garage. Boston hotels charge on average 40-45$ a day for parking whereas it will only cost you 25-30$ a day at the Center (25$ is with an easy-to-find online coupon). If it's full, there are many other indoor garages in the same vicinity that offer approximately the same rate. So just temporarily park in front of the inn, unload your car, take it to Prudential Center, and walk back to the inn in 3 minutes. FITNESS: If you need a workout, there's a small fitness center with a couple of machines. No pool. LOCATION: PERFECT!!! In 3 minutes, you can walk to the Prudential Center (conference center, shopping, restaurants, and a subway stop). In 7 minutes on foot, you're on Newbury Street, the main strip for boutiques, restaurants, and caf\u00c3\u00a9s. In roughly 10-12 minutes, you can walk to Copley Square. There's also a neighborhood park for little ones and a plaza with waterworks to cool them off on hot summer days. Finally, there's a 7-Eleven conveniently located right in front of the inn and a supermarket by the Prudential Center. All in all, a wonderful stay in a wonderful city.

We planned everything in about 10 days. Once we had set the date, I went about finding a hotel room for us to stay at on our special night. I spent hours looking at various hotels (both small and large) hoping to find the \"perfect\" place. After almost giving up on the idea, I stumbled upon the Inn at St Butolph St. I was immediately excited about the prospect of staying there, it was a small (16 room) hotel, which I preferred, it was in a great location (right in between the back bay and the south end, all the rooms were suites, and the deal sealer for me was that they had keypad access to both the hotel front door and the rooms themselves - meaning no checking in, you simply type in your code (emailed to you in advance) and presto - your in!! This is very cool in my opinion. The room was very nicely decorated, with a full kitchen (including flutes for the champaigne we planned on drinking), a desk, couch, seperate bedroom, and a huge flat screen tv with literally hundreds of channels to choose from. The only thing to go wrong about my stay was that somehow I must have made a mistake when booking the room, and ended up booking it for the night before our wedding instead of the night of - doh!! As soon as I realized my mistake (on the morning of my wedding no less) I called the Inn and begged them to give me a room for the actual night we needed it. The were most understanding, and my wife and I ended up getting another room at no cost for our honeymoon!! I can't thank them enough for their willingness to work with me on this issue, as a second nights stay was certainly not in our last minute wedding budget. All in all, we had a great stay, dined at Legal Seafood (in the near by Prudential Center), strolled down Bolyston and Newbury Streets, stopping for some window shopping, ice cream, and yes, more champaigne!!

The Inn At St. Botolph provided everything and more that we were looking for. Located in Back Bay this Inn is unassuming in that it blends in to it's surroundings among Boston's beautiful brownstones. It's unique style of \"check in\" is a wonderful alternative to the usual front desk service of most hotels and inns. The rooms are on par with some of Boston's most luxurious hotels and if you need anything there is somebody available to take your call with a push of the button. The Inn's rooms have luxurious furnishings, a fireplace, full kitchen with all of the accessories, and a glorious bed that will make you want to never leave the room. Boston is typically a walking city and The Inn's location is within walking distance to most everything the city has to offer. My wife and I loved the idea that we could just as easily prepare a meal for ourselves right there in our suites kitchen or travel to one of the many wonderful restaurants in the immediate area. You are also surrounded by lots of conveniences as the Inn is close to many of Boston's largest shopping centers. I have traveled extensively for business and I wish every city had an Inn like this. For extended stays this is like having an apartment in the city waiting for your arrival. No crowded lobbies, no complex maze of a hotel to get around. The Inn At St. Botolph simply and magnificently provides a home away from home (albeit an upscale home) for the weary road traveler. I can't say enough about this wonderful property.

This is a Brownstone in the historic Back Bay area that was converted into a hotel. It is very hip and modern. The inn reminded my husband and I of a wonderful edgy place in London, called base2stay. The hotel is located one block from the Prudential Center and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s metro). All the booking for the hotel is done over the Internet. Once you pay, they email you an entry code for the keypad to their front door. This made us feel more secure as it limited who can get in to the building. You are also emailed an access code to enter your room. It is a lot like your front door code thus remembering both numbers was not hard. The keypads is a great idea as we did not have to schlep keys with us around Boston nor fumble for a key to get in to our room. We can see this 21st Century lock becoming more common at inns. The Inn at St. Botolph definitely lives up to its namesake, the patron saint of travelers. It should be ranked even higher than it is in TripAdvisor. The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated. A small kitchen is included with the room. There is a two-burner glass top stove, a full size refrigerator, lots of glasses (including some for Champagne and for other wines), utensils, and a kitchen sink. The bed was heavenly with its very soft and warm blanket made by Berkshire Blankets (We plan to buy some of these Massachusetts blankets for our beds soon!). The lighting is not the typical hotel room lighting. It made the room feel homey. Photos that you see online really represent how nice the rooms are. There is free access to their wireless Internet. And if you haven't brought a laptop, there is an iMac in the basement lounge which you can also use free of charge. We did that to avoid the higher nasty airline luggage fees you pay at the airport. Due to the keypad entry to the inn, there is no need for a front desk. But1 That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get face-to-face service. The office desk folks were very friendly and helpful. They even steered us to one of their sister restaurants which ended up being an excellent recommendation (see our review of Teatro). The Continental Breakfast provided is light, but there is enough to eat to have you satisfied until lunchtime. Parking warning: Boston only allows residents to park on the street in the city. There are metered spots out front, but they are only for residents after 6:00pm every day. This means Sunday through Saturday. Boston parking lots can run $40.00 per day without reentry (meaning you have to pay every time you exit the garage). We highly recommend hopping on to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or a city bus. A cab is a better alternative to driving and parking a car in Boston.

This was a fantastic experience, and felt more like I was going home as opposed to back to a hotel. Michael, Dante, and Tom were all very cordial and polite, helping us with everything we needed.

Michael helped us out, recommending a delicious place that delivered. It was unbelievably simple! We didn't have to leave our suite unless we wanted to!

We were able to save a huge amount on eating out in the evening by buying food from the nearby Whole Food Markets and keeping it in the fridge. The whole place blended style and function very well indeed. We were very satisfied. The hotel's location is also very good: convenient for the Newbury St. shops in Backbay, about 30 minutes' walk to downtown Boston and also well located for the T system (although we walked or cycled everywhere). There is also a convenient Hertz car rental in the nearby Sheraton hotel. St. Botolph St. itself is delightful with a great period feel to it. Breakfast is provided in the lounge downstairs although it is probably easier to eat it in your room. We thought it was perfectly adequate with fresh bagels, muffins, fruit, juice and coffee.

The building was extremely quiet, and has been recently renovated. The decor is very nice and everything smells clean and new. There were 3 large flatscreen tvs in the apartment, but the Direct TV programing was very limited. Not a problem though since we were so busy seeing the sights in Boston that we had very little time to watch tv. The small kitchen had a full size fridge, microwave, and toaster. It also had a 2-burner stove, 4-cup coffee maker and was furnished with dishes and cookware. We did not use the stove, but we did use everything else. If you have a large family or group and need 2+ bedrooms and prefer to have everyone together, the Inn at St. Botolph is perfect!! It is one block from the Prudential Center, which is a mall with all sorts of shops and also the \"T\" is located underneath. There is a T entrance on the same side of the busy street as the Inn so you won't have to cross the street to get there. I also highly recommend the T as the quickest and easiest form of transportation around Boston. It will take you anywhere you want to go, and is easy to use. The quiet neighborhood where the Inn is located was a nice alternative to the busy sections of town where the hotels are situated. Although I did not take advantage of it, the Inn offers an exercise room and lounge in the bottom floor. There is also a computer if you need to use it. One of the nicest aspects of the Inn was that they e-mailed you an access code for the front door and your room so you did not have to deal with check-in procedures like regular hotels.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cAn amazing luxury for our budget!\u201d", "Author": "TheLoversRaLa", "ReviewID": "UR39223536", "Content": "This is an amazing hotel for the price and the location. We went for our 2nd wedding anniversary and it was great. The room was very nice and the amenities great. We stayed about 4 days and the kitchenette came in handy---We splurged on one of our meals and went to Mistral--My husband was then able to have RACK OF LAMB for breakfast the next morning thanks to the microwave. The breakfast is not regal, but we ate out for both lunch and dinner so it balanced out. The muffins are easily brought back to the room and toasted in the toaster oven (there's also butter if you like). They put no limit on how much you take from the breakfast area, so I was able to take couple extra juices and granola bars for snacks. There is also fruit and yogurt. The money saved on breakfast was well worth it. Also, the fireplace was very romantic and the decor was definitely photo worthy. We felt as if we were living in the lap of luxury. We are young and have no desire for anyone to carry our luggage or anything else. The \"abbreviated\" services model never hindered a thing--we had an issue with turning on our fireplace and a nice gentlemen who works the desk came up and fixed it (it needed a switch turned). We were able to ask all the questions we wanted of the desk and they were always prompt with returning e-mails before our visit when I had questions. Honestly, if every hotel in America went \"abbreviated\" I can't say I would see it as much of a loss, since I'm either in my room, or out and about and can't say I need anything substantive in between. The maid service was also excellent. Oh, and I loved the drapes! One small issue, the lamps above the bed...are stylish but relatively unnecessary. My husband was hastily moving one and it actually hit him in the lip--not pleasant. Otherwise, the storage space in the room is amazing. I read one review that said their were no drawers, etc to speak of. My room had 2 closets and 2 dressers. (I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite).

Location: We were in Boston for a two night stop from New York and so the proximity to Back Bay Rail Station was helpful - as it wasn't far to drag our cases! The subway is very close indeed as is the Prudential Centre. The 7-11 is opposite the hotel (doesn't sell alcohol however). The street is quiet and respectable. We didn't have a car - but as their website says, there isn't parking (all seems to be resident permit parking). I would really check this out if you are driving. We walked into the centre every time - but this does take a little time. Subway would be a matter of minutes. Check in: Before we left the UK we had not received our entry codes. Apparently this was a problem with Expedia not supplying them with our e-mail address - but they could have telephoned us I suppose. Nevertheless, once we called them, they were very helpful and the codes were sent through straight away. Personally I like this this system. I think most modern travellers loath having to 'hand in the room key' and 'return by a certain time'. The elimination of keys and interaction with reception staff was most welcome and made our stay that little bit less formal. Staff: Staff were helpful throughout. We left our cases with them before check in (and again after we left our room) and they were most obliging. When there was a problem with the air conditioning, they arrived straight away. Can't fault the friendliness. Room: We were thrilled with the room. Having your own kitchenette (with a decent fridge / freezer / ice maker) was tremendous. The decor is very trendy indeed and works extremely well. All curtains / bedding etc are high end and high quality. Made for two excellent evenings after we returned from various restaurants. Can see that the free internet and US calls would appeal to some. The TV choice was excellent. Their welcome guide was comprehensive - but would be good to recommend some restaurants to which they are not affiliated (thought I understand why they don't). My one minor disappointment was the water pressure in the shower. The cubicle was massive - but the shower lacked any real punch. This said, I have found that in other US hotels. I have ummed and ahhed about giving it 5* as there was one thing I wasn't hugely happy with. Our bed backed onto the lift shaft and this could be quite noisy (and unpredictable - depends when someone uses the lift!). During the day and evening this didn't matter - but in the middle of the night I found that it woke me up. I would think very hard about accepting Room 103 again. That said, I am not saying that I woudn't, because the benefits of this hotel were enormous. I didn't use the gymn - so can't comment on this. Breakfast was a nice touch - but needs to be a little more imaginative. If you like a more modern experience in very stylish surroundings, then this is for you. Despite the issue of the lift noise we had a superb time and I hope to return.

Breakfast is lame (bananas, Sara Lee muffins, granola bars, coffee and juices), but with all there is to see and do around there, it was hardly an issue.

You probably couldn't cook a three-course meal in it, but it's more than adequate for making breakfast or eating a take-out meal. The bathroom was fairly tight, but since it was new, I didn't mind. There's free wi-fi, and it worked well. And all phone calls within the U.S. are free on your room phone, which I've never seen anywhere else. My flight out of Boston didn't leave until 9:30 pm.

Overall, it was a great experience. We booked a 1-bedroom suite (kitchenette, living room, bedroom, bathroom), and it was an adequate size for ourselves and our 6-year old son. There was plenty of closet storage as well. The many windows made it bright during the day, but the room-darkening curtains made it sufficiently dark for sleeping. The staff were consistently polite and helpful, and were immediately responsive to any of our needs. They even called us back when we tried to call them but got no answer--even though we didn't leave a message! Our room was very quiet, and we couldn't hear the elevator, which was right next to our room. The location couldn't be better (5-10 minutes to everything), and overnight parking was only 1-1/2 blocks away, at the Prudential Center parking garage. There are a few things to take into consideration if you're planning to stay as a family with younger children at the Inn at St. Botolph. First, the kitchenette is not completely family-friendly. For example, it was stocked with 12 or so champagne and wine glasses, but there was not a cereal bowl to be found. The plastic drinking glasses were so huge that they were unmanageable for smaller hands, and there was no trash can for kitchen trash. But the nearly full-size refrigerator/ freezer (with auto ice maker) was a tremendous asset, as were the toaster oven and two-burner stove top. The black rubber floor in the kitchenette and bathroom was probably not a great choice for a hotel room--they looked dirty, even when cleaned. As for sleeping arrangements, the Inn provided an Aerobed for our son at our request, but the bedroom was too small to accommodate it (also, the queen bed canopy-type frame was also way too big for such a small room, and made it difficult to move around in the room--a lower headboard/footboard configuration would have been more appropriate). Putting the Aerobed in the living room was impractical, given our varied sleep schedules. Finally, to be fully family-friendly, a bathtub instead of just a shower stall would have been helpful. The bathroom was clean and nicely arranged, and there was plenty of room on both sides of the sink to put our belongings. The towels and comfy bathrobe were of obviously high quality. We will definitely stay at the Inn at St. Botolph's again, and would recommend the hotel to others.

The walls were nicely painted in a sophisticated and welcoming hue of brown (which happens to be my favorite color). We found our room (#304) without a hitch.

My favorite decorations include the round ceiling fixture, the oversized wood blinds and drapery (so we could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and sleep in), huge LG TV and full body mirror.

Let me start off by saying that the rooms are impeccable decorated. I looked through the pictures on this site and my room is pictures and looked exactly as shown -- gorgeous modern furniture and fine linens. But once you get past the appearance there are some basic flaws which make a several day visit at this price point annoying. I will start by listing the negative and needs improvement aspects of the Inn @ St Botolph and then finish the review with the positive aspects. 1) Absolutely no parking. I was warned of this by my secretary before arriving but was told it was easy to find. After driving several hours to Boston, I parked in front of the Inn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building at 99 Botolph Street to get my several bags of luggage into the hotel and up the elevator to my room. I called the number on the room phone that said house manager (I believe it was room 109) and the gentleman who answered was very cold, uninformed and said that he didn't know where public parking was located and that the Inn Manager Ryan was not available. Very annoying -- so luckily my iPhone had \"around me\" feature and I was able to find the closest public parking garage about 1.5 blocks away. As this point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 30 minutes had passed trying to get the directions and when I looked out the room window to the street there was already a $40 ticket on the windshield of my rental car for parking after 4PM in \"Resident Only\" meters. I drove down to the public garage and the fee was $23 a day. 2) I walked back to the Inn from parking and unpacked by bags to find that there were no counters in the bathroom to place toiletries on. I had to place my items on the nightstand or under the sink. There was also no soap self in the shower which meant shampoo and soap had the rest on the shower floor during the entire visit. Bizarre, but I marked it up to growing pains, as they are a new Inn. 3) The security safe on the floor of the small closet was broken and would not stay shut causing the closet door to have issues closing. In such a small room this was creating an issue for me to get passed the bed to the bathroom area. I realized if I placed the ironing board in front of the safe to keep it closed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my closet would stay shut. 4) I opened my laptop to begin checking emails and look for a nearby restaurant / bar and found I could not connect to the Inn's Wireless Service. I looked around the room and in the drawers for a welcome letter with connection instructions and there were none. Once again, I braved calling the manager on duty and received voicemail (about 7:30 PM). He called back sounding very inconvenienced about 30 minutes later (I felt myself apologizing to him for even calling) and he gave me the pass code for the wireless which I tried but did not work. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about to call back at that point so I emailed the Innkeeper (Ryan) with my issue so he could resolve it. Ryan did not call me on this issue for more than 24 hours -- luckily I had a wireless card that worked close to the window. Once Ryan explained that \"pop-up blocker\" needed to be turned off \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it worked fine but then the connection expired later that evening and it did not reconnect again for the entire visit. 5) The first morning I woke up and walked into the very nicely appointed kitchenette to make coffee (there is a mini-coffee pot), however I discovered there were no small bags of coffee in the room. The coffee basket required the pre-measured packets so I went out and asked the housekeeper in the hall and she said they do not have coffee available for those machines and I could walk 1/2 a block to the 7-11 for coffee. Not cool and not appropriate when you are obviously trying to attract new, discerning customers. 6) Although the sheets on the very plush beds were high thread count (probably Frette) the many pillows were very tall and firm -- to the point I was uncomfortable and ended up sleeping between two of them as I could not get comfortable. There really needs to be a mix of pillows for different styles of sleepers. 7) Lastly, the elevator down the hall would \"ding\" very loudly every time it opened. Even with my room at the end of the hall -- it could be heard throughout the night. I am sure they can lower the volume or even turn off the floor bell since this Inn is very much like a private residence with keypad entries to the rooms instead of keys. The upside of the Inn at Botolph for the price is: 1) Location, location, location! 2) Beautifully decorated room. 3) Security camera for letting visitors in with. 4) Walking distance to Prudential Center, shopping and nice cafes / restaurants. 5) Very clean -- daily housekeeper. 6) You do not feel like you are in a big hotel chain - very intimate (but you do need some service!). 7) Frette luxury bathrobes and plush white towels in bathroom. 8) Rain style showerhead in bathroom. 9) Windows open fully to allow breeze into room and gives a nice street view. 10) Fully stocked kitchen (cups, plates, wine glasses, etc.) and refrigerator has an icemaker. I think once the Inn at 99 Botolph work through the growing pains of being new it will become a truly wonderful place to stay. They need work on refining the guest service dramatically and have the house manager (or someone) greet guests during basic Inn hours. If guests arrive late there should be a welcome letter or phone call from the Innkeeper explaining wireless, nearby public parking, cool places to eat and where to get coffee / breakfast the next morning\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 things that you would do if a guest was staying in your home.
