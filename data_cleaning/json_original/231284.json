We stayed at the Hotel Amadeus as they were offering a good deal. When we arrived the reception staff were very friendly and allowed us to check in a little earlier than their advertised time. It turned out that the room we had booked (as part of the offer) was a double room but we had wanted a twin room. The hotel staff said no problem and separated the beds to make the room a twin. The condition of the hotel was excellent and it appeared to be very recently refurbished. Everything was immaculately clean and well looked after. As stated above, the hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful - some of the best I have encountered anywhere in the world. Many thanks to them. Located just 150m from Rome's main (Termini) railway station, it is extremely convenient for all transport needs - metro, buses, hop-on/hop-off bus tours, Leonard-da-Vinci Express (from airport) etc. I will definitely be using this hotel in the future. Highly recommended.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel - willl definately stay again!\u201d", "Author": "cazzy79431", "ReviewID": "UR117968630", "Content": "We were backpacking so the proximity to the station was a bonus! I was expecting it too be a little rough around the edges as I got such a good price for it but we were over the moon when we arrived! Fantastic friendly receptionists! Our room was on the first floor above a cafe which i was a little worried about as it was a very noisy street too but once the sound proof windows are closed we were very comfortable indeed! Clean and simple bathroom. Tasty breakfast which can be eaten on the roof terrace or in the cafe and served by a lovely Italian lady! There's a small supermarket opposite it aswell which was handy and it's in a great location to walk and find amazing bars and restaurants! Fantastic hotel overall and will definately book again!", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cPretty good hotel\u201d", "Author": "solskjaer12", "ReviewID": "UR117057218", "Content": "We were here for 3 nights and we liked the hotel very much. It is located about a 2 minute walk from the main train station. The room was pretty spacious but was a little dark due to the use of yellow lights. The elevator was very small and would only fit 2 people with luggages. We had to leave our keys each time we left the hotel so it was one less thing to worry about losing. The staff are very friendly and speak pretty decent English, and one of them even remembered us and was ready with our key when we walked into the lobby. You get 2 hours of free wi-fi and anything above that would cost you 1 Euro/hour which is a pretty decent price. We found a loophole in that the 2 hours need not be consecutive, so we just used it sparingly and logged off once we were done each time. We managed to use the 2 hours over the 3 nights that we were there. There is a 2 Euro per person per night tourism fee due at check out.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Letterkenny, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA good low budget hotel, centrally placed\u201d", "Author": "IrishRover82", "ReviewID": "UR114242551", "Content": "No frills, no flounces just a clean, comfortable hotel right beside the Termini with links to airport and the two Metro lines.

The young man who was working the desk when we arrived was very helpful and pleasant. When a street vendor seriously harrassed my sister and I as we walked outside, the gentleman chased him off and made sure that he did not bother us further. He also suggested several good places for dinner that evening. The rooms were small, but this is not unexpected in Europe. Ours opened to a courtyard and it was soothing to fall asleep to the sounds of a restaurant (talking, dishes clinking, etc. ) Our traveling companion's room opened to the street and they said it was quite noisy, but nothing few earplugs couldn't solve. You might want to request a back of the hotel room, though. The bathroom was very generously sized, with a jacuzzi tub and bidet. They included several complimentary toiletries. Both room and hotel were extremely clean. The night porter was an amusingly crochety older man who didn't speak English, but he taught me how to say our room number in Italian. :) Good breakfast in a pleasant courtyard. Nice hotel in a very convenient area for reasonable price.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, clean and excellent location\u201d", "Author": "leicestermancunian", "ReviewID": "UR86231721", "Content": "A couple of minutes from termini so a doddle to get anywhere.

After 30 mins of sign language and 2 phonecalls to an english speaker, a woman arrived with double bed sheets, pushed the 2 beds together an hey presto there was our double bed for the next 3 nights. Breakfast was pointless and should be avoided if possible, fresh orange juice is diluted etc. The hotel has soundproof doors but not soundproof windows so if you are a light sleeper take ear plugs.

Although the area is not exactly uptown it was a brilliant location for those who love sight-seeing and adventure as it is central. The hotel was beautifully clean and tidy. It was really worth the money, more like a four star than a three star. Not or those who get annoyed by slow lifts though! if you don't, then this is the hotel for you! It also has some interesting charcters. My favorite guy was the Roman who can speak english, spanish, french and japanese! that was pretty impressive.

The rooms were ok. Not great and not bad. The shower was small but good water. The drain did clog and the shower overflowed. It was very loud outside all night but we experienced that everywhere in Italy. Decent sized room and AC worked great. Breakfast in the morning was fine. Decent little restaurants in the area, but be careful at night. Didnt have any issues but can see that you could. 2 blocks to train station and to both subway lines.
