We all stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, and then again for another night before flying back home. We chose to stay the first 4 nights in the same room as last year which we highly recommend; the 'Double De Luxe Soppalco' room (please see our previous review for a more detailed review for this room), and booked the 'Junior Suite Capella' for our last night. Sadly, although we requested and received confirmation that the 'Capella' room was available we were informed upon arrival that this was no longer the case due to a honeymoon couple extending their stay. Fair enough we thought, they were on their honeymoon after all, and we were given the suite next door, we cannot remember the suite's name but it was room number 202. We weren't very impressed with this room, the size was very generous, decoration was very nice and the balcony over-looking the canal was beautiful but the bathroom was tiny in comparison to the one in the cheaper 'Double De Luxe Soppalco' room, and it only had a shower. The biggest problem with this suite however is that the wall which separates it and the 'Capella' suite next to it is paper thin. One can safely assume that the 'Capella' suite suffers the same problem, and whilst we would love to spend a night in that suite to appreciate the painted ceiling we cannot honestly recommend either of them because of this, especially as the excellent 'Double De Luxe Soppalco' room does not have this problem and is cheaper! Our fellow travelling couples chose to spend their stay in the 'Economy' and 'Classic' rooms, both of which we found to be a good enough size for those on a budget particularly as the 'Economy' room they stayed in also overlooked the canal. A good improvement over our first say here back in 2010 was the overall cleanliness of the rooms, if you look at our first review we scored 4 out of 5 for the cleanliness whereas we can now comfortably give it a 5 out of 5. Another plus was that the coffee offered during the morning breakfast buffet was much better! No idea if the hotel management read these reviews but if they do then thank you for listening to your customers! :) PS: We are going to be in Venice again in February 2012 and would have stayed here again but sadly there is no availability so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to reluctantly book elsewhere!", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel and Staff\u201d", "Author": "nscementer", "ReviewID": "UR120957847", "Content": "We stayed in a junior suite with a painted ceiling.

The hotel was fairly easy to find and is mid-way betweeen two Vaparetto stops, making it accessible, even when dragging suitcases. Upon arrival, we were quickly checked in and the staff insisted on carrying our luggage up the 37 steps to the second floor. There is no lift, but there was a standard chair lift for those who cannot manage the stairs. The room was lovely, spacious and great value. We stayed in one of the junior suites, which contained two twin beds pushed together and a chaise lounge made into a very comfortable bed. The floors were original, and came with the charm of period details. There were also two chairs, a desk and a little coffee table in the room. The views from the room where nothing special, but I did not travel to Venice to see it through a window! Breakfast was standard continental, but the staff was very attentive and made specialty coffees for the guests, including cappuchinos with little smiley faces. The staff was also available to make dining reservations and recommendations, which was greatly appreciated. It takes about 5 minutes to walk to the two closest Vaporetto stops and from there you can access anywhere in the city in short time. It is also great just to be able to walk out of the hotel and stroll along the streets.

We booked a standard double room and it was lovely, wasn't sure what to expect as most reviewers recommend getting a suite but as we were on a bit of a budget opted for the standard room (we had the room where the bed is reflected in the antique mirror). The room was really nice, it overlooked a courtyard and the window was pretty high up so you had to stand on the bed to see out but the room itself was good, the bed and pillows comfortable and the bathroom was modern and clean with fresh towels daily. The hotel itself is situated just off the busy Strata Nova and once you cross the bridge to get to the hotel its so quiet and peaceful, you don't hear a sound so get a really good nights sleep after a busy day sightseeing. Some people have stated that its about half an hours walk to St. Mark's Square but we estimate 15-20 and you pass so many beautiful streets and squares and canals that you probably don't rush so it could take longer if your taking your time. But the hotel is quite central so we found it ideal. Breakfast was more than we expected with bacon, eggs, toast, cereal, fresh fruit, yoghurts, pastries and bread. Teas, coffees and juices all set in a small but elegant dining area. The hotel staff are outstanding and so friendly and helpful. You'll get a map on arrival and their knowledge is very good. We even had a bit of a history lesson from the night receptionist who told us the history of the building and Vendramin who owned the house. Be careful when ordering in restaurants, the food may appear quite reasonable but we sometimes got charged a service charge and a tax charge on top of your bill. Also the drinks are really expensive and 'bump up' your bill. e.g. 2 coffees 8 Euros and Spritz (local orange coloured drink) 5 Euros. We found it cheaper to order a litre/half litre of the house red at around 7 Euros for half a litre.

Well, it did not disappoint! The best part about the hotel is its size -- I am pretty sure the concierge said that the hotel only had 11 rooms (maybe it was 14)... needless to say, the hotel never felt crowded or commercial -- it really felt romantic and intimate. The staff there were so great, they have to be mentioned in the review; upon check in, we were given a map and given details about getting around the city to see the important sites. In a place like Venice, that information was ultra-valuable because it is so vastly different from any normal city, with twists and turns and dead-ends. The standard room was large enough to be comfortable, with a nice bathroom. Everything in our room was spotless... the bed was large, there was a nice desk in room and an in-room safe and free wireless internet. Another great perk is that it is only 4 vaporetto stops from where the buses let you off so it is very convenient for getting to after long travel, and it is easy to get to the train station afterwards for departures around Italy. Our only negative feedback was that the bed was large but not overly comfortable -- the mattress was a bit stiff and the pillows were not overly soft either... but after walking all around Venice all day the softness of the bed isn't really that critical to deep sleeping! Lastly, breakfast was standard, good coffee and lots of continental fare that is standard around Italy. I can assure any readers I am not providing positive feedback for discounted services (which is always a worry of mine) -- my wife and I were thoroughly impressed and will most definitely be staying there again should we be so lucky to return to Venice some day.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "TravelTHM", "ReviewID": "UR117976997", "Content": "This is a great find in Venice (and I have stayed twice - July 2010/ April 2011).

In fact, it was a U-shaped room, with a slender 3-meter walkway, leading to another slender 1.8-meter walkway, that led to where the bed was, and the bed took up most of the space in the sleeping area (you have to imagine that one of the arms of the U is thick enough to put a bed!). Also, the rooms were shaped in a 3D jigsaw pattern. So the bathroom from 103 seemed to be inside the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153U\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd portion of our room 104. The walls were thin. So, this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pleasant in the mornings. I could smell the cologne of the man in 103. And we can hear foot steps over head. Our bathroom and shower space were small. In fact, my husband and I both kept banging are arms on the shower door while showering. The room itself could have used a paint job. There were splotchy places on the wall in one corner. The antique mirror was rusty with black spots everywhere. The high ceiling was pleasant to look at with its wooden beams. But, while admiring the beams I saw some dust and cobwebs. Two small rugs on the floor on either side of the bed were old and worn out. The room doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look half as clean as on the website. I slept in long pajamas because the bedspread was worn out and the room just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem clean to me.

A water-bus stop was relatively nearby\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to get around Venice once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been on the water-buses a couple of times. Close proximity to a very well stocked Billa grocery store was also a huge plus. The grocery store has prepared foods and salads you can eat in your room if you want to save some money. It can get expensive eating in restaurants for lunch and dinner. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give the staff 4-stars, the location 4-stars, but the room itself only 1-star, leading to a 2-star rating. I believe Hotel Ca Vendramin should post correct room images on their website so they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mislead their potential guests.

This was a special occasional, and I wanted to treat my partner to something out of the ordinary, and Vendramin excelled in every respect. Front Desk service was always prompt and friendly, and included a *great* map of the city gratis. (Never underestimate the value of a good map in Venice!!) Our junior suite (\"Cappella\") had a large bay window and Juliet-style balcony opening onto the small canal fronting the west face of the building, with a view toward the church yard and bell tower beyond. Listening to the waterways come to life each morning was a memorable pleasure. As for other features, common spaces were nicely appointed, breakfasts were ample and high quality, and the hotel's provision of a desktop PC with internet access was an added bonus. For those coming from the airport, the reasonably economical but still scenic 'Alilaguna' waterbus worked quite well for us. Best to double check schedules/routes, but we used Linea ARANCIO (Orange Line) toward Rialto, disembarked at Madonna Dell'Orto and enjoyed the ~10 min walk southeastward along Strada Nova to the turnoff for the hotel, which is located another two minutes' walk off this major pedestrian thoroughfare. (Note: As cautioned in prior reviews, beware inaccurate directions to this hotel on some mapping programs--the hotel's website provides a coarse but accurate map.) Since our departure point was Venice's cruise terminal, we enjoyed this location a bit off the most heavily beaten path, which afforded nice opportunities for explorations on walks to/from San Marco etc. So assuming you're prepared to make the investment for a trip to this, one of the world's most beautiful and renowned cities, and looking for a botique-style hotel with good service and many artistic touches, I would certainly recommend Hotel Ca'Vendramin.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGood all around, but maybe a bit overpriced.\u201d", "Author": "redfury", "ReviewID": "UR35496498", "Content": "We booked this hotel at the train station upon arrival and we were told that 120 Euros was a great deal for this hotel.

Although it's not one of the top-10 hotels according to the popularity, Ca' Vendramin and its staff did not disappoint me. For the highlight of the last day of my trip I booked a suite for 360 euros and found it very spacious as well elegantly decorated. The suite has two balconies facing a quiet small canal and is equipped 2 LCD TVs and a bathroom with jacuzzi. And the ceiling of the suite is very exquisite. The staff of this hotel were welcoming and friendly, especially the porter was very hepful to inform me about the bus connection to the airport after he had heard my request for a watertaxi the next day. and then tow of the staff patiently searched the timetable of the bus for me. And another good thing is that there is a free internet point in the luxurious lounging area just outside the suites. Still, however, there was one shortage bothered me: the AC of the suite was quite loud during the night. But in Northern Italy Settember is a little bit chilled in the nights , this may not a problem if the window is opened. If the suite cost less than 250 euros, I'd give it the highest score - but since the hotel is in Venice,", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLive in style at Ca' Vendramin\u201d", "Author": "stargazer28", "ReviewID": "UR10168024", "Content": "A very beautiful palazzo tucked away from the hurly-burly with excellent staff.

We had booked the basic room which was small but decorated nicely in the traditional Venetian fashion and the AC worked great. The bed was turned down each day for us and the bathroom even provided Q tips which was a nice surprise. Slippers were also included. The breakfast was included and was more then crossiants and cheese.. they actually had eggs, which didnt matter to me but my boyfriend was thrilled. The location was perfect for us.. not right in the main tourist area but a short walk away.. although we did manage to get lost at least 2 times a day just because Venice's streets and waterways are very tricky.. but its all part if its charm.

Location wise it was perfect. My husband and I like to walk a lot (or atleast I do and he comes along for the ride) and it was in the middle of all the districts so that we could really explore Venice and get out of the touristy hoardes. About a 10-15 minute walk to St. Marks, but more importantly if you want to get lost, stroll and see all the different districts it's about 10 minutes to the Rialto Bridge, 10 minutes to the Jewish Ghetto, 15 minutes to the train station, all by foot! Plus if you want to go to the fish market and don't feel like walking there is a .50 Euro Traghetto \"a block\" away that will take you across the canal in 1 minute. From the airport you can take the bus to the main station in Piazella Roma and then the Vaporetto to the stop Ca' Doro which is less than a 5 minute walk. Don't wait on the ticket line at the airport there is a machine right next to the bus stop. Water taxi's to me are overrated and not necessary as are Gondola's. If you want to get the boat experience at night, walk to St. Marks square at night, listen to the outdoor music and then then take a Vaporetto back to the hotel for like 12Euros sit in the front and enjoy the view. Anyway, back to the hotel. The location is very safe, it's off the main street so that there is no noise, it's close to lots of restaurants and bars if you want to enjoy Italian Tapas from place to place. The room is definately small. We stayed in a classic junior. The bed takes up most of the room you have a litlte bit of space on each side to walk and then the bathroom which is a good size and very clean. Despite how small it was the room was perfect for resting before dinner and getting a good night's sleep. What more do you really need! They could use an extra shelf to put your toiletries on in the bathroom, but it was really no big deal. Our hotel was on the first floor right next to the main desk and we never heard anything or were bothered by any noise. There is even a supermarket near the hotel to buy water for your trips around town. Breafast if fine, exactly what you need some cereal, breads, meats, coffee etc. The coffee was very good. Everyone was helpful, they provided us with a great map which you need in Venice and they also had the internet for free which was a nice bonus. All in all I would highly recommend this place.
