The food was delicious, the drinks were constantly served, the servers were polite and made you feel like a guest in their home, the entire place itself was beautiful and Victorian like complimentary valet for all the guests, complimentary honeymoon suite with champagne and breakfast in bed in the morning, and soooo much more! But the best thing was Monique. She is the wedding coordinator for the Maple Manor Hotel and she was completely wonderful! Everything was very smooth and every detail was taken cared of. I am such worry wart and im always wanting to make sure everyone is having a good time, but Monique let me let loose and enjoy my own wedding. She had everything down \"to a T\" and that is something that you can't imagine having without. This place is amazing and the price is also extremely affordable since I didnt have a lot to work with.

The food was amazing (many guests said it was the best wedding food they had ever had!) and the bar staff definitely kept the tables clear of empty glasses as the reception continued through the evening. My husband and I stayed in the bridal suite that evening, and our bridal party stayed in the remaing rooms. The hotel is small, so we reserved all the rooms in order to make things more private (where as in a large hotel, random guests could easily peak in on your special day). In the morning we all had a great breakfast and had a moment to relax before we all departed. The Maple Manor is a lovely Victoria-era home that still has much of it's original decor...it was the service combined with the classic, unique look of the building that made our wedding perfect.

I received so many compliments, from friends and family, all saying what a beautiful wedding (the outdoor courtyard was intimate & elagant) it was and how much fun the reception was. The buffet went over almost like a sit down dinner, with cocktails and music.... all in one place, making it so much more enjoyable for all involved! Our immediate family stayed in the hotel Friday and Saturday night, and there was an incredible breakfast (for about 10 of us) served in the dinning room on Sunday morning.

We used the entire space of the house and courtyards to celebrate and dance the night away (which of course FLEW by).

It is a unique experience at Maple Manor, due to the size the setting is intimate and allowed us to spend time with all of our 150 guests (which is rare from what I've heard).

Before I send any reviews or further opinions I wanted to give the opportunity for a response and compensation on our stay November 29, 2008. We were in suite 6. Upon arrival we had to find someone to ask about how to check in. We were told the room was unlocked which was different not having to check in but was fine. I kinda thought it was pretty cool except those things should be told before we arrive so as to not wander around looking for which room was ours. At first look I thought the room was pretty nice. We brought our bags in and I started looking around. The bath had several long black hairs in it. GROSS. I admit I have a very big thing about other peoples hair, but anybody would have been shocked. We decided to turn on the fireplace. After a bit of tinkering with it my husband was able to get it on. Instructions would have been nice. We go to turn on the TV. Remote doesn't work properly. We then try the TV in the bathroom...only the DVD function would work. We were told there would be a bottle of champagne upon arrival, (in the fridge I was told), but it was nowhere to be found. I go to the phone on the bedside and try to call down. The phone was nothing but static and it wouldn't let me dial out. I use the phone in the bathroom. I tell them about the TV and champagne. The champagne showed up but after getting back from dinner at your restaurant next door, which was also far below what I expected, still no TV. My husband goes to pour the champagne and I guess it may not be that big of deal but even our champagne glasses didn't match each other. Next morning, we get our breakfast. The toast was so cold and the butter so hard it wouldn't even spread. After it was delivered we had another knock and they handed us the bacon that was forgotten. Well they could of just saved the trip it was so burnt and gross. This was our 1st anniversary and I am so disappointed in every aspect. Dinner, which I don't think you have any control over, was barely average. For the cost of it I had much higher expectations. My husband found a small black hair in the cherry jubilee but at that point we were just ready to leave. The overall feeling of our night, especially with the money we spent, was that nobody really cared how our stay was. We have stayed at $100 rooms that had better service and were much cleaner. I was really looking forward to our stay hoping for something different that we could try and make a tradition for our marriage. I can't stress enough how upset and disappointed I am. I will be waiting for your response. I waited a day and sent the email again asking for a response. I was told the email was sent to the manager and he would contact me. I waited another day and I called. Friday I was called by the manager and he was quite rude and I was basiclly told that we just didn't know how to work a TV and everyone else was happy. They offered a gift certificate for another night. Why would I want to stay there again even if it's free?
