The hotel is an excellent quality property located close to Sabiha Gokcen airport and attached to the large Viaport shopping mall complex. The drive to/from Ataturk Airport can be 60-90 minutes depending on bridge traffic so budget accordingly. Facilities are international standard as is to be expected of a Crowne Plaza. Wireless internet is free and reasonably fast but has a convoluted login process that the front desk will explain. The only issue with the stay was that one of our group was charged for items he didn't consume from the mini-bar and the front desk staff refused to remove them from the bill until the manager got involved. It was sorted out in the end but it left a slightly poor impression of what was otherwise an excellent stay.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cSmart hotel - expensive food & drinks\u201d", "Author": "gabsterUK", "ReviewID": "UR126133728", "Content": "Hotel is beautiful - everything is of a high quality - rooms are well equipped and elegant.

The major issue I had at the hotel this stay is that they now do not allow outside food or beverage to be brought into the hotel. Imagine my surprise when I entered the hotel after shopping in the mall with a bag of chips and a pop only to learn that outside food was not allowed in the hotel or the room (the chips and pop in the mini-bar is allowed). I was instructed by security to go to reception before going to my room. I went there and was told that even the packaged food that I had purchased to take home as gifts were not allowed in my room and that I should bring everything I had down to reception and they would hold it for me until I checked-out. Initially I thought they were joking but they were serious. I saw one guest that was publicly embarrassed by the staff about the food they had brought into the hotel. I attempted to contact management about the policy but have yet to obtain a response. The above issue turned a great stay into an irritation.

First, the good: My room on the second floor was very spacious, bright with a large comfortable king-size bed and well-appointed bathroom with two showers, one walk-in and one in the bath. A decent sized LCD TV (that I didn't actually use) and a large window overlooking the shopping outlets. Breakfast was excellent with a large slection of fresh meats, cheeses, fruit, olives, many types of bread, breakfast pastries and cereals. There were a few chefs in the dining area with some hot food but as I never sampled them, I couldn't comment on that. I used room service a few times in the evening and the food was okay. Not great but certainly not bad. The service was a mixed bag - most of the hotel staff would give you a hello/good morning and a smile. A few didn't and almost seemed to begrudge you being there.. perhaps they were having a bad day at the time, whatever. The location is good or bad depending what you want to do - for my purposes it was very convenient and the position of the hotel towering over a large outlets shopping centre with food court was quite nice. However, if you are using this hotel as a base of touring Istanbul, I wouldn't call it convenient with a taxi fare of up to 80TL to get to the most popular tourist areas on the European side (although it's possible to do this cheaply with a 10TL taxi to Sabiha Gokcen airport and then a 12TL Havas bus to Taksim - just be aware it's about an hour's ride). My final positive note is regarding the fitness centre -the equipment is top notch with just about every type you could want and many of the machines (rowing and treadmills of which there were plenty) have large touch screen interfaces into which you can plug your iPod/iPhone and play music and even watch movies through). Now for the bad and I apologize if this sounds like a rant in places: I travel a lot - I've stayed in many hotels (i usually try and stay in ICHG hotels for the points but there were no nearby options here) and I have a fairly typical routine when staying away. One of the first things I usualy do is to try and secure an iron & ironing board to iron all my shirts and any other clothing that can be ironed - my packing isn't the worst but I still find that my clothing rarely survives sans-wrinkles when travelling. As I didn't arrive at the hotel until very late (after 2am), I left it until next morning. However, when I called down to housekeeping in the morning and asked for an iron, I was told there were none available (they only have one for all guests apparently!) and they'd be happy to iron my shirts for me (for a fee of course). Now, I'm perfectly capable of ironing my own shirts and I have never - not once - had an issue like this before. Of course, having little choice (as my travel iron had also died), I submitted two shirts to housekeeping. On the evening of the 3rd day, I did get an iron/board which i then used to iron everything assuming the iron would be removed next day for another guest (if they really do have just the one). It wasn't and in fact remained in my room for the rest of the week - I just hope there wasn't some other poor guest needing an iron during that time. Next up.. during my stay, I spent one of the weekend days in my room catching up with some documentation. As such, around lunchtime, I dedcided to pop down to the convenience store for a couple of cans of soft drink and a bag of Doritos. On my return back to the hotel, the doorman asked to check the carrier bag and on seeing the contents said firmly \"FORBIDDEN!\" I thought he was playing some kind of joke but he went in and got the girl from the health spa out who spoke slightly better english and she explained that food and drink are not allowed to be brought into the hotel. Hotel policy (which isn't anywhere on the website or on any literature in the room by the way). Again, I've never experienced this before anywhere - I could understand it if I were trying to bring in, say - a big pizza or MacDonalds, but a packet of crisps and can of diet coke? Ridiculous. Then there's the noise. As I said previously, my room was comfortable. However, despite the website promising sound proof windows, there's quite a bit of noise coming in from the nearby highway as well as any loud music from the shopping centre. Even if the windows were properly soundproofed, the ocassional banging and (what sounded like drilling) from within the hotel coupled with the late night club music (way past midnight were maddening at times. There were also a few small niggles.. firstly, the walk-in shower had a tendency to leak water all over the rest of the bathroom floor.. not sure if this is supposed to happen (smooth shiny floor with no obvious drain so I suspected not) but it took a while to drain so I ended up using the one in the bath. Also, the WiFi was a little temperamental - I almost always had a signal but having a signal didin't necessarily mean you'd have any kind of connection to any sites - sometimes you;d get a slow or non-moving loading bar that you just had to wait out. Then when accessing some sites, I'd be presented with a page that seemed to suggest this site was banned (Youtube and a few others). Later on in the week, some of these sites were accessible again then next day not. Oh and don't bother looking for the outdoor pool. At the time of writing, it's not finished and won't be till next year/2011 (despite what it says on the official hotel website).
