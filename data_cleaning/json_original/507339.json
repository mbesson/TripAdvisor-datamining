Seeing us stagger in and our evident sleep depravation, the manager very kindly said he would have our rooms made up early (4 hours ahead of the agreed 2pm check in) so we could rest. We parked the car in the back alley (the hotel has a few allocated parks but there is also on street parking) and took a walk down to the beach (ie. about 15m across the road) while we waited. Venice On The Beach is in a very laid back stretch of the promenade. Far enough away from the noise and chaos of the main drag to be peaceful, yet close enough to walk to anywhere of interest. The rooms are small but very clean and the beds are VERY comfortable. There is no air-conditioning, but you can open the windows for the sea breeze and there is a ceiling fan and heater. There are 2 courtyard areas so that you can enjoy the privacy of the hotel outside your room. One is a great spot on the roof, the other is a fantastic long courtyard looking across the promenade to the water. I highly recommend walking up the the convenience store, grabbing a 6 pack of Sierra Nervada and some beer nuts and sitting in the courtyard to watch the sunset (and the people go past!).

This is the reason why we chose to stay 3 nights at Venice On The Beach though there was one warning that I was apprehensive of before we arrived (and which I will take more seriously into account going forward): despite a very high average rating, this hotel presented a significant \"tail\" risk, i.e. there was a disproportionately large number of reviewers that were downright pi5sed off after visiting the hotel. But knowing that Americans can often be very or even unfairly critical, I gave the benefit of the doubt and booked the hotel. With a hindsight, we would have definitely avoided staying at the hotel and would have spent a fraction more if needed to stay somewhere else in the area. I'm not giving 1 star, but 2 only because it is obvious that the owner(s) have invested some money in the place. But as a recent negative reviewer pointed out, it is questionable if all that money has been spent on the right things: very good mattresses (a positive), huge LCD TV (some trouble in getting it work, too) in a very small room - was it really needed?; good and noise-reducing carpeting in the corridors and stairs and nice roof terrace and courtyard. Unfortunately, most of it seems money spent too early as here are the major troubles we encountered while staying in room 7 (which someone had specifically suggested to avoid by all means in an earlier review): (a) both the doors to the corridor and bathroom had gaps of an inch from the bottom of the door to the floor, a consequence of which was very bright light coming into the room from the corridor overnight: (b) the bathroom was a joke: apart from the shower cabin, sink, toilet and a mirror facing the toilet rather than the sink there was nothing else, i.e. no hangers for towels, no shelfs/racks to put one's toiletries on, no hair dryer - I can see from photos that other rooms looked better in this sense, so why all rooms are not consistent?; (c) no noise reduction materials/methods used in constructing the rooms: the floors and walls are very thin; we could hear everyone talking in the corridor, the top floor was loudly squeaking,TV and even snoring easily heard from the room above; (d) the room is apparently cleaned up only on request, so issues of cleanliness arise - in fact, one night there was a hot argument between a customer and the manager that the room wasn't cleaned properly upon the check-in; (e) the fact is that Venice as such is very shady in places and someone had remarked in an earlier review on the safety issues, i.e. that there was no-one supervising in the hotel during the night though the area does attract strange folk after the sun-set; unfortunately, we had to experience this darker side of Venice as the trunk of our (rental) car was nastily scratched one night while parked in the hotel's off-street parking lot - it could have only been a hooligan, nothing else... a CCTV/other deterrent might have been a better investment than huge LCDs? All in all, I would definitely agree with yet another reviewer to look for somewhere else if you are looking for some actual hotel services. The hotel is not expensive, but still expensive for what it does (or doesn't) offer. It is most definitely not a boutique hotel. The manager himself seemed to be a nice bloke, but I again have to agree that being right on the beach is not sufficient for offering good value - I would have paid more for staying a block or two off the coast in a really good hotel.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thornton Cleveleys, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFab views cramped room\u201d", "Author": "Honeybun51", "ReviewID": "UR120505953", "Content": "We stayed here for 1 night in June before returning to the UK.

It reminded us of a bed and breakfast more than a hotel but that didn't bother us one bit, in fact, we really enjoy the B&B feel to it; very comforting and accommodating. This place is literally on the beach. It has a private patio in front as well as a private roof top for sunbathing or just watching the passing by.

NOT ENOUGH PARKING!\u201d", "Author": "Eric8199", "ReviewID": "UR114586892", "Content": "My wife and I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Venice on the Beach Hotel in Venice Beach, and I must say that this was arguably the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I believe that Trip Advisor rates this hotel at two stars, and I think that\u2019s over-generous. But since I\u2019m fair, let\u2019s start with the good. The hotel is located right on Venice Beach, very near the pier and within close walking distance to all the sidewalk shops. It\u2019s a great location. The bed, despite looking like the frame has been around since the 1920s, was extremely comfortable, even though it squeaked with every single little movement, to the point that you could hardly breathe without waking yourself up. That\u2019s about where the good ends. I\u2019ve noticed that no one on here has complained about parking. Well, there are, I believe, 8-10 parking spaces at the hotel, which apparently are not enough spaces to accommodate all of the guests. My wife and I arrived at about 12:30 for our stay. Checkin wasn\u2019t until 3, but we figured we would see if we could get in early, as hotels generally are able to accommodate this. We went into the \u201chotel,\u201d that is after we found it (we drove by the first time, because it looks like a regular apartment building), and no one was at the counter. We looked down the halls, checked upstairs, and it seemed there was no one in the entire building. There was a number on the counter to call, so we called it and got an answering machine. I stated that we were at the hotel and were going to walk around, and we were hoping we could check in. We then left and walked out on the pier. We decided to then go grab our stuff and walk down the beach. When we came back to the hotel, there was a maid in the hallway. I asked her if she could check us in, and she graciously did so. She said maybe two words to us the entire time she did this. She gave us a parking pass, not saying a word about it. The room was dinky, with no carpeting, just tile. The bathroom is very small and disconnected from the teeny, tiny shower. As I already stated, the bed was very old looking, and had holes in the sheets, comforter, pillow cases, etc. It also creaked with every move. There was a nice wide screen TV with DirecTV, but the picture was fuzzy, and the universal remote worked when it wanted to. Despite this, we were happy with the location, and figured we\u2019d tough it out for the night. Later in the evening, we returned from dinner to find all the parking spaces full. I was confused, because we had a parking pass, so I figured there must be another place around the corner or something where we could park. My wife went in and spoke to the manager, who happened to be there this time, and asked where we were supposed to park. He came out with a map and told us that if we \u201cexercised some patience,\u201d we could find a spot on one of the other streets either a block or two away. We were very nice to this point, but I was extremely annoyed that my $140 a night did not include a parking space, and I was not told this until about 8 p.m. that night. We drove around for I believe two hours trying to find a spot, meanwhile missing the sunset that we both wanted to see. We then went back to the hotel and I went in to speak to the manager. He was no where to be found. I again went upstairs and checked all the hallways. I knocked on the \u201cmanager\u201d door, where it sounded like there was a TV going, and no one answered. I went to my car, still not parked, very upset, and again called the hotel. He answered, and I said I was talking to someone earlier about parking and he tells me \u201cI\u2019m the only one you\u2019ll ever talk to here.\u201d At this point, I see him at the front door of the hotel, so I hang up and go talk to him. I told him he needs to give me some better advice for parking because we cannot find a space. He again tells me that we need to \u201cexercise patience.\u201d I told him that I no longer wanted to stay at his hotel, and would like at least a partial refund so I could find another place to stay. He said \u201cthat\u2019s your choice\u201d but informed me that he had \u201cbeen holding the room for a while,\u201d therefore I was getting nothing back. At this point I was irate. We drove around for another half hour and finally found a spot approximately one mile away from the hotel. We then had to walk back to the hotel through dark alleys when I had just read Venice Beach may not be the safest after dark. When we arrived back at the hotel, we were greeted with a snide remark from him. When I left the next morning, I told him that I thought they (at this point I was again reminded that he is the only person there that I would speak to, there is no \u201cthey\u201d) should tell people that parking is limited. I said the parking pass implied that we had a space, and that isn\u2019t the case. He shrugged me off and informed me that $140 a night is a great rate for a beachside hotel and apparently felt that was good enough reason for his poor service. The information I was given stated that the staff would do anything to make your stay enjoyable. They did nothing for me, except treat me badly. I did not expect a refund, I mostly expected an apology and the admittance that they should have informed me there were more parking passes than spaces. In addition, there was no air conditioning in the room. During the evening, we needed to have the windows open to keep cool. At around 4 or 5 a.m., trucks began driving up and down the street, waking us up every five minutes. In addition, you could hear water running from other rooms all night, and any time someone walked overhead, the entire building creaked. I saw a photo on here someone posted of their great view of the beach. Our room overlooked the alley/road behind the hotel, though I believe my room was the last available when I reserved it, so again, it wasn\u2019t a big deal. The roof patio is nice, though there are no chairs or tables, only uncomfortable benches. It\u2019s kind of a waste of space, as it\u2019s useless without chairs, though if you fly in, you probably won\u2019t have any with you. We will not return to this hotel, and I suggest that if you plan to park a car there, or get any sort of actual service, you do not either.

He charged full payment of my booking in day the of my arrival (30th Nov) from my credit card account without asking me !!! I asked him next day how do we proceed with payment as I was leaving hotel very early in the morning (they do not have 24h reception). He said not to worry about it he will let me know later on. That was the last time I saw the guy. He didn't call me or sent SMS or email or leave any note in my room so I left the payment as cash (+ left I $60 as tip which was stupid as I didn't really get any service there) in my room with a hand written note and I called him in the office hours next day and asked if everything is fine with that. He didn't tell me on the phone he charged the room with my credit card as well, I noticed that afterwards from my credit card bill. I requested twice to get refund as I paid the room twice, but never get any reply back to my emails !!! About his helpfulness: I asked if he could arrange me drive from Universal studios to Honda Center (Anaheim, Orange County) during the time I was on guided L.A tour. We said he will take a look at it and will let me know... well he didn't of course. And I asked if he could arrange me a taxi to LAX airport at 0530am next morning, surprise surprise he didn't, so I walked to cafe nearby (half a mile) with my heavy bags and was happy to see they were just opened, and they helped me by calling a cab, otherwise I might have missed my flight to Las Vegas !", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "NewWanderer76", "ReviewID": "UR67500866", "Content": "This is a very small hotel so if you are entertaining grand visions of big establishments or lot of services, this isn't for you.

The room was not made up for us between our first and second nights, which didn't really matter to us, but which one might expect of a hotel rated as this one is. We were on the main floor and noticed that screens on several of the windows were either missing or damaged. If we left our windows open, as we wanted to do both for fresh air and to hear the sound of the waves breaking on the beach, we had a bit of a feeling of uneasiness that there was nothing to secure the louvered blinds or sliding windows from being opened from the outside. That said, there was never an issue. The pastries left for guest use did not seem to get rotated and we found one near the bottom of the pile that was mouldy, probably as it had been there for some time. We also found the walls to be rather thin as we could hear guests in adjoining rooms and the hallway very clearly. We very much liked the patio out front and alongside the hotel. It was a great place to sit and relax, read and people watch. The rooftop deck was a bit of a disappointment. It had only some stark wood benches and it appeared not to have been cleaned in some time. There was an overflowing ashtray, empty beer bottle and other bits of debris that appeared to have been there for a while. With a good cleaning and a few lounge chairs, this would have been another great place to spend some time.

The few downsides were at the night time there were only limited spaces outside the hotel so if you wasn't there early on you would have to find alternate parking which could be a real pain. The room we were in had a plug next to the bed where all the plaster had come away and was barely hanging in to the wall, the mattress was so creaky that it could wake you up from the noise if you moved on your side in the night and it was often quite noisy in the mornings with doors banging, people walking down the stairs etc. The roof terrace was fantastic but just wasn't fully utilised (couple of sun loungers up there would have been brilliant).

Unfortunately, the hotel is on the beach. That said, there is only enough parking for 9 cars. If you return to the hotel when all the lots are full, you will need to look for street parking which is easier said than done depending on time of day. Because of a nearby property a few feet away, I was able to clearly hear the occupants entering and leaving the premises from my ground-floor room. The wall outlet in the room was hanging by its wire and was inoperable. I had to use the one in the bathroom which was situated between the sink and the toilet. Fortunately, I did not have to recharge my shaver; otherwise, there was nowhere to rest it. In the mornings, I had some coffee which was brewed using household coffeemaker, but passed on the pre-packaged danish pastries. I am recommending this hotel due to its location as long as you don't require more than a place to sleep, If you have a rental and plan to return late in the evening, I strongly suggest getting a cab and leave the car on the hotel premises.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "kraemstein", "ReviewID": "UR38078901", "Content": "We stayed here in Sep 2008.

We wanted to be near enough to LAX to not worry about traffic slowing us down when it was time to catch our mid-morning flight, but not so close we'd hear planes all the time. We'd never been to Venice Beach before, so we didn't know how weird and crazy the atmosphere is. Venice on The Beach Hotel is far enough away from that notorious section of the boardwalk that we felt very safe, even walking at night up a block and around the corner where there are shops, restaurants and bars. That said, security is in place on the exterior of the property, but not always in use (key pads on locked gates, but gates easy to open from outside or not shut). The doors to guest rooms have key pads as well, which is very handy - no key to worry about. The rooms are not large (it's a \"boutique\" hotel, which, it turns out, means \"small\"), and there are only 17 of them. We had the one room that had more than one bed, and unfortunately it did not face the beach. The street out front is more an alley, and we did hear traffic noise, but we're both pretty serious sleepers so it didn't bother us much. And you're active at the beach, so falling asleep is sure easy if you're exhausted! Parking was no problem for us, but we may have been lucky because there are not as many parking spaces as there are rooms. I almost marked \"Cleanliness\" a 4 instead of 5, but taking into account we were at a beach, things are not spotless - and the housekeeping staff was excellent. They were courteous and friendly. \"Rooms\" got a 4 just because of the size - our bathroom was pretty small with no room to put toiletries (pedestal sink, no vanity). The beds and pillows are very comfortable. There is a flagstone patio with tables and chairs on the back and side of the building (the only designated smoking area is on the side patio) and a rooftop deck that has room for improvement - but with the view, who cares about the Astroturf flooring or inadequate seating?! Greg is the proprietor, and he is fantastic. Very friendly, and it's clear that he loves what he does.

Again, don't really care. -There are only about 6 parking spots available. If they're full, you have to go park a block or 2 away (still free). No biggie there. The ugly: -No insulation between rooms and hallways. When someone's in the hall, you know it. We got woken up every morning at 6am by other people just walking around and chatting. -No security. Venice beach is not the best neighborhood at night (though it has gotten better) so this made us a little uncomfortable. There's no one at the front desk, the main doors are locked with a code you're given, but they're windowed doors so not exactly Fort Knox. -Also the rooms are locked with combination locks (which beep quite loudly, see insulation note). Not a big deal, but Greg, the manager, is quite cavalier about giving you your code, announcing it loudly. Not sure how often the codes are rotated either. -The bathroom door is windowed, so anyone sitting on the bed can see into the whole bathroom. Not a big deal except when I'm doing my \"business\" where I'd rather be private. -the bathroom had a weird smell to it... I dismissed it as bleach, but it lingered -Greg, though a nice guy, is not always on site and he seems to be the only employee other than the maid. -We had to pay in full at check-in The unacceptable: Cockroaches!

Just down the hall was a desk with a computer with free internet access for use by the guests, and a small table with coffee, tea, and in the morning, OJ. For breakfast and snacks we kept food in the 'fridge in our room. The hotel's terrace faces palm trees, the beach, and the walkway in between, and a rooftop that is perfect for watching sunsets. The manager was friendly, professional, and seemingly always available.

It's best for travelers who like to stay in little inns, guest houses, motels, and nicer hostels and who seek out a fun adventure (rather than travelers who seek the consistency of moderate to pricey chain hotels). For what it is, Venice on the Beach is definitely a #4, which is why I ranked it as such, but I myself was surprised when I drove up to it because the reviews on TripAdvisor made it sound like it was a different kind of establishment. Instead it's very \"down home\" with some nice features. Just for context, I am a female business traveler who travels frequently and solo. While I usually stay in mid-range business hotel chains (Hyatt, Hilton group, Starwood group, etc.), , in my personal travel I like high-end hotels and resorts as well as artsy, cool little places off the beaten path. The really positive things about Venice on the Beach: great location right on the beach, warm and friendly staff, laid back and independent feel, good wireless, comfortable bed and pillows, soft, fresh white linens, rooms conveniently appointed, two great outdoor public areas to hang out which look directly out onto the beautiful beach where many people are jogging, walking their dogs, and enjoying the beach. Despite the action, it is relatively quiet. Less appealing things about it: The feel is definitely that of an older motel that has a fresh coat of paint (without having stripped the old paint first) and new windows and bathroom fixtures. There was some nice effort made, but the finishes and workmanship are a bit rough. As a solo female traveler, I would not have felt comfortable walking around the area at night, but I had a car. There are a few parking spaces in front of the building that are first come, first served. I didn't have trouble parking when I returned after dinner, but reportedly it is harder to find parking in the winter. I don't know what I would have done if all the parking spots were taken as street parking is very restricted around that area. My room was small but had a big window looking directly out on the beach (which I paid extra for but was worth it). The window had pretty white wood shutters. The bed was comfortable with fresh white cotton linens. The rest of the furniture (desk, nightstand) was white laminate that was peeling or stained in some areas. There was a small fridge and microwave in the room. Ceramic tile floor, small bathroom with new fixtures and a ceramic tile shower. Generally clean but because the redecorating was done roughly, the overall feeling is new finishes in a worn context. On the other hand, I fell asleep and woke up to the sound of the ocean right outside my window. Although I heard other guests when they were in public areas, my night itself was quiet and peaceful. I did not eat the continental breakfast in the morning, but there are packaged pastries, coffee, and tea set out. The staff was welcoming, accommodating, and warm. Well located for beach, restaurants, major highways, Venice, Santa Monica, and Marina del Rey.
