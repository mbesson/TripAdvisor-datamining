We decided to just leave our bags and check in later but were then advised that we could have a room at no extra charge and check in then and there, for which we were really grateful. The room itself was fine; clean and comfortable, like any regular hotel room. Although we had requested a bay view, our room had a view over buildings but, at that point, we were just too tired to argue. Staff were efficient but the hotel lacked the warmth that makes you really feel welcome. The extra taxes and charges do add up so be aware of this when planning your trip. WiFi was not cheap either with their \"special offer\" adding an extra $17 per day to our bill. Connections dropped out frequently. Location was good; just a short walk to Robertson Quay and a good walk to Clarke Quay with their extensive selections of restaurants . The walkway leading to these locations runs alongside the river and is free of vehicles which makes it both safe and pleasant and we enjoyed srolling back to the hotel after our evening meal. While in Singapore, we had the Jungle Breakfast at The zoo, in the presence of a company of orangutan. Sentosa was a full day of fun (don't miss the typhoon experience at the Maritime Museum); Changi Chapel and Museum were fascinating and thought provoking and the Chinatown tour and Trishaw ride was a laugh.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore", "Title": "\u201cImpressive!\u201d", "Author": "vikasmohan12", "ReviewID": "UR128176531", "Content": "Thanks to my frequent travels, a run of the mill standard 5 star hotel does not excite me much!

On two other occasions I pre-ordered a car; once it was 15 minutes late, on the other occasion it failed to arrive and the Concierge ended up driving me into town in the Hotel minibus. There is no MRT station nearby. Staff - especially in the lobby restaurant were consistently surly and unhelpful; the Concierge desk was frequently unmanned. During my second stay my room key card needed replacement 3 times in 4 nights, and on every occasion I had to go downstairs, be accompanied back to my room by a condescending Receptionist like a naughty schoolboy, be \"shown\" how to use the keycard, recoil in horror at the unexpected conclusion that it didn't work, get dragged back downstairs again and grudgingly given a replacement, accompanied by the patronising admonishment to keep it away from my mobile phone.

This was my first time to Singapore so I wasn't sure about the location or the hotel. In the end everything turned out to be great. The hotel is a bit away from the center of the city (including areas like Beach Road, Orchard Road etc) so if you are thinking of catching the SMRT (Singapore Mass Rapid Transit) subway then the nearest station is Tiong Bahru which is quite a walking distance. Also if this is your first time in Singapore, getting taxis sometimes can be a pain especially on a Monday morning. The taxi queue on Monday's was especially brutal around 7am - 8am, so call ahead to the taxi company instead of waiting in line. I got the executive club room which is what I would recommend if you are on a business trip. There is an executive lounge on the 29th floor and it serves breakfast, snacks in the afternoon and evening, plus you can check out instead of going down from the executive club floor. The executive room gets you free breakfast in the executive club lounge or the buffet downstairs, free internet and two pieces of laundry along with all the non-alcoholic drinks from the minibar. The use of swimming pool and the fitness club is also included in the room rate. The room service was average with parata, chicken rice, cheesecake, fudge cake and banana split being the highlights (yes, I have a sweet tooth). There is an Italian restaurant Pontini in the hotel which is really good. I tried the Pasta e Fagioli soup which was okay but the lasagna was truly exquisite. The rooms were relatively small but for Singapore they were average size. Rooms were clean and the hotel overall was tidy. The service was excellent with everyone chipping in to create a great atmosphere. The hotel is relatively close to Zion hawker center, Great World city mall and the exquisite Five Star Chicken & Rice which are all walking distance.

The location of this hotel, for those who like to vary their eating places and access to shopping without the expense of Orchard Road, is ideal. It is within walking distance along the river bank to Robertson Quay, Clarke Quay and if you like to walk a little further Boat Quay and Marina Bay. From the Fullerton Hotel or through the shopping centre at Marina Bay Sands you can watch the \"light Show\" most nights at 8.30pm. China Town is close by and for the best bargains get a taxi for 7 Sing Dollars to Bugis, everything from clothes to electronics. A Tiger beer at Bugis or Little India costs one third compared to Orchard Road. (Cost of a Tiger beer 3 to 4 Sing Dollars Orchard Road 12 to 14 Sing Dollars). The same applies for snacks or food. For the hotel itself, good prices are obtainable as packages but you will have to enquire for availability. The staff are very polite and always greet you by name, even on the first day. Rooms vary, hence my opening remark. If you are on a Club Floor, Check-in is on the 29th Floor at the Club Lounge, which offers complimentary breakfast 7am to 10.30am, free soft drinks and coffee/tea all day and free Cocktails/drinks with canape's from 6 to 8pm. The staff in the Club Lounge are outstanding with a real wish to assist. We found the Club rooms a little jaded and a few items not working as they should. The worst thing was the heavy sliding doors to the wardrobes which tend to \"bang\" so you can hear your neighbours quite clearly. The beds were very firm and are probably at the end of their useful life. It was noted that rooms on the 5th and 6th floors were better appointed and of course handy for the swimming pool which is also on the 6th floor. The swimming pool is rather disappointing being rather small and shallow (ideal for children) and service at the Poolside Bar is disappointing. Snacks and drinks are available but they have to be delivered from the \"Room Service\" area and the waiting times vary. The choice of restaurants is very good, Chinese, Italian, Western and Eastern buffet being available every day and night. The quality of food is excellent. Be careful when ordering a Gin and Tonic Water or Tonic water on it's own - you may end up with Soda Water in your drink. This is a misunderstanding not an intention to deceive, just ask for Tonic and not Tonic Water.

Also, our tv did not work as the transmitter was missing and we had to ask it to be mended. I had let the hotel know in advance that we were on our honeymoon, but they had not arranged anything special in the room - not even a bar of chocolate or a bowl of flowers.. A minus point comes also from the fact that in front of the hotel there are only the \"luxury taxis\" in a queue, and you end up paying a lot more driving them than taking a normal cab although there is nothing special about them taxis...! The location of the hotel is not too great, it is a 20-minute walk from the closest metro station. If you wish to stay in a Millenniun hotel, I would highly recommend the sister hotel Studio M which has a better location, much nicer rooms and a much nicer pool area. The pool area of Grand Copthorne is quite small, and what is worse is that there are two fountains by the pool, and the wind blows the water from the fountains to the sun chairs, so there are very few seats that you can actually sit on and sunbathe on if you do not want to get soaking wet! And what comes to sleep quality: the beds are lovely, very comfy. But the sound proofing is not too good, you can hear every noise in the corridoor!

We had no issues with the checking-in, as everything was handled quite professionally and very quickly. Our room was located at Level 18, which was halfway up the building (it has 30 floors), and as such, it offered a good view of the brownish-looking Singapore River and the Raffles Place financial district in the distance. However, the room itself was a bit on the small side, although it was quite complete and came with a large King-sized bed together with LCD TV and usual writing desk. Toilet was also a bit cramped, mainly due to the wardrobe located on the same side and taking up a chunk of real estate space, resulting in there being no bathtub and just a shower stand instead. The Hotel did place a bottle of Mumm's champagne as well as a nice chocolate cake (both at my request) in the room as a small celebratory item, since it was both me and my wife's birthdays! One other bad thing is for the price we paid (SGD184++ per night), there was no free WiFi or broadband internet in the room and it was chargeable! Since most people now travel with either a notebook or iPad / iPod touch, there is a need to be able to check their urgent matters via the Internet. As such, I don't understand why there is a need to pay for access, and at quite high rates as well (SGD1.00 per minute, as well as one for 24-hours access)! Furthermore, when we asked the staff at reception for the WiFi password in the lobby, they said that this was chargeable as well, which is just too much! The location of the Hotel was at the Riverside, near Havelock Road, which probably explains their slightly lower prices for a 5-star. We were fortunate to have driven to Singapore as there is no way we could have walked the 15 minutes to Clarke Quay MRT station, without getting drenched or sweaty (it was raining throughout our stay in SG). It did help that the hotel provided a regular shuttle service to the Paragon Mall in Orchard Road, and there is also an abundance of taxis at the doorstep. Furthermore, the Great World City shopping complex is within 5 minutes walk and had, among others, a McDonald's outlet (our place for a supper!) as well as Marks & Spencer and a Golden Village cinema. Well, in short, what I can say is that for the price we paid, the Grand Copthorne is an affordable option for those traveling to Singapore, compared with the more expensive properties on Orchard Road. Of course, you must expect tired legs and sweaty shirts when trying to get to the nearest MRT station and slight inconvenience to checking emails, due to spotty Internet access!", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBet thing about the hotel is its exec lounge.\u201d", "Author": "Vnehru", "ReviewID": "UR121834468", "Content": "Nice hotel.

Nearly all of the hotels are mainly set up for the business crowd, and serviced apartments, while very good, are very expensive - with some having a long minimum stay. La Residenza is a group of serviced apartments located on the 5th and 6th floors of the Grand Copthorne, and I'm very pleased that we found out about them. To get the less positive out of the way, the pool area is small and rather unimaginative. If you have young children, note that there is no paddling pool - just a few steps down into the main pool, with the main pool being 1.2 meters deep. The pool towels were not reliably replenished during the day. On the upside, the pool isn't that heavily used anyway, and we often had the use of it to ourselves. The hotel is in a rather picturesque location on the Singapore river, and you can take a river taxi from just outside the hotel if you prefer. It's quite a long walk to the MRT, but the hotel puts on a regular shuttle to Orchard Road. This leaves promptly, but take care to arrive early at the bus stop when returning to the hotel, as the bus doesn't keep reliably to the timetable, and often arrives about 10 minutes early at Orchard Road. The apartments are of a modern design, thoughtfully equipped with fittings and furnishings of a high standard. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have slept in at a hotel, and there is no noise from outside or from other rooms, despite being very close to Zouk, one of Singapore's premier nightspots. The staff are, without exception, friendly and very efficient. If I had to single out a particular department for praise it would be housekeeping, who managed to meet even a couple of unusual requests. However, the reception, concierge and restaurant staff were all very good indeed. Rooms are cleaned daily to a very high standard, with a nice bonus of several complimentary water bottles being left in the kitchen each day. The restaurant, Brio's, is quite good, and well priced for such an establishment. While it is possible to get better, the quality and quantity of food was very reasonable for the price.

We did not have the opportunity to eat any other meal at the hotel. Housekeeping was good and quietly efficient. They never cribbed to bring extra towels, pillows or sheets. The main impression one gets of the lobby is a constant crowd with large noisy groups of people waiting to check in or check out. It is a very well located hotel with a couple of malls close by. It was very easy to hail a taxi to get to Orchard Road ro anywhere else.

The location is great, even though the MRT station is a bit far (closest is clarke quay, about a 10 minute walk), but as taxis are cheap in Singapore most visitiors dont take the MRT a lot. And even if you do, the walk is along the beautiful river lined with cafees, bars and restaurants. Walking along the Singapore river from Marina Bay all the way up to Robertson Quay is the most amazing walk which anyone in Singapore should do at some point! The service at the hotel was great, everyone are super helpful and quick. The rooms are not huge (space is very expensive in Singapore, so rooms are usually not gigantic!), but it was big enough for the two of us and the furniture and bathroom were up to date (the soaps smell amazing!)! We were on the 16th floor and had a great view of the area and we could see the river all the way down to the CBD and the Marina Bay Sands. The outside dining area at the hotel is also beautiul, with gazebos and lights and theres a little specialty shop right across the river which sells all the essentials! There are restaurants along the river as well as all over Boat and Clarke Quay, which is just a quick walk away. Clarke Quay is also the main bar and club area in Singapore, so after a night out you can walk back and avoid the midnight taxi charges :) .

We have stayed in quite a few five star hotels and, despite some negative reviews on Tripadvisor, this is most definately a five star hotel. In fact, we both agreed that overall it was the best hotel experience that we've ever had. When planning our trip we wanted to stay five star all the way but on a fairly tight budget. The Grand Copthorne was by far the most affordable of the hotels that we considered staying at. So affordable in fact we paid the extra to upgrade to an Executive Club room - probably the best decision that I made when planning our holiday. Upon arrival we were greeted at our taxi by Ian the Duty Manager, who personally escorted us up to the 29th floor Executive Club reception desk. Check in was swift and efficient then we were shown to our room, also on the 29th floor. The room was just terrific, having a recent upgrade but retaining lots of character and charm. The marble bathroom, with seperate shower and bath was sparkling. But the view over the Singapore River all the way to Marina Bay took our breath away. The room contained all the facilities you would expect of a five star hotel, the bathroom toiletries were lovely, the airconditioning was set just rght, and the TV had 20+ channels, both asian and english speaking cable channels. The king size bed was comfortable and the room was very quiet - we never heard another door slam or shower running in another room. Staying at the Executive Club was wonderful. The breakfasts in the club were ala carte with buffet cereals, breads, cheeses, fruits etc, but also had the choice to dine at Cafe Brio's which had an extensive & delicious array of eastern and western breakfast dishes. The Club had a daily afternoon tea consisting of sandwiches and rolls, cheeses, and other nibblies. But in the evening from 6pm - 8pm the canapes and cocktails were wonderful. We had the absolute best Singapore Slings each night, as well as ice cold beer and quality wines and spirits. And the canapes were plentiful & absolutely delicious. The service from all of the staff was wonderful, from a cheery \"Hello Mr & Mrs .....\" each time we got out of the lift on our floor, to efficient & friendly service in the Club, to the cleaners, and the doormen who always were on hand to open the taxi doors for us. The pool and jacuzzi were a good size, great temperature and had a convenient pool bar. We did not use the fitness room, but it was well equipped. The location of the hotel is sensational. Some reviewers have complained about the location but we loved it. The 15 minute stroll to Clarke Quay was a daily (sometimes twice daily) highlight for us. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service to get you to the major tourist locations, but we did not use it because taxis were always readily available and very inexpensive. Another highlight of the location was the Great World Shopping Centre, just a block or two away. It was terrific to shop with the locals, rather than the glitzy malls in the tourist strip, and the food court there was a treat.

I stayed for nine nights! I had read about the reviews on this site before hand and had prepped my expectations for an average hotel. But, to my surprise, I had one of the beautifully renovated rooms overlooking the Singapore river. The furnishings are contemporary modern. The bed was ohhh... so.. comfortable! And, the bath (actually shower) was nicely done. The best part of the Copthorne is that the temperature setting in the room is just right - not too cold and not too warm. Many hotels that i walk into have the setting too cold for myself; but, at the Copthorne the temperature is perfect I did not have to adjust a thing. The gym in the hotel is excellent too. They had various exercise equipment to get a good workout, and everything is in working order. The swimming pool is right next door, and so once done with the gym, one could hop on into the pool to relax. I think one of the nicest features of the hotel is that it is on the Singapore River, and to walk along the path up to Clark Quay is so beautiful and romantic. My only gripe about the hotel is that the free shuttle service provided operates once every hour and that the stopping points are limited to a few locations. In the morning, if the shuttle is too packed with passengers from its previous pickup point, one may find himself stranded waiting for the next shuttle bus that arrives an hour later or availing himself to a taxi.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cBest bed in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "camak", "ReviewID": "UR105347375", "Content": "We only stayed here for one night during our stop over back home.

There is a large lobby with check in and concierge, but there are no seats in the lobby. The room was very clean, comfortable and stylish. The only downside was that it was compact. The bathroom looked as if it had been newly remodeled. It had a shower but no tub, which I don't consider a problem. Our room did not include the buffet breakfast, so on that I cannot comment. However, we had two excellent meals at \"Portini\", the hotel's Italian restaurant, which is a beautiful space. In regard to one review about the room service tray not being collected, I had no problem. The hotel requests that you dial the \"one touch\" button on the phone to request tray pick up, and then it is promptly collected. The fitness center is small with two treadmills and other machines, but it has large windows overlooking the pool and condos next door, which provided a pleasant view. The hotel is not in the downtown business district, unlike many other hotels in Singapore. It is in a neighborhood with modern condos on one side of the street and HDB flats across the streets. I liked the fact that when I went out, I saw local residents out and about, waiting for the bus, etc. Also, it was a nice area in which to run. One shopping mall, \"Great World City\" was a 5 minute walk down the road. There is a famous nightclub, Zouk, next to the hotel. We had to walk about 15 minutes to get to a subway stop or Chinatown and 20 minutes through a nice residential neighborhood to get to Orchard Road shops. Cabs were readily available, except once when we needed one early Sunday morning.

The location is great for a stroll along the river to Clarke Quay and the riverfront restaurants and a quick taxi ride to Chinatown and there is a free shuttle bus to Orchard road. We asked the hotel's free shuttle bus driver if he could drop us at a location close to Little India and he was most obliging even though it was not an official stop.

Standing more than 29 stories tall, and yet this mammoth building does not even shine in comparison to the buildings in the business district of Singapore, which its glorious structures. Nevertheless, the Grand Copthorne is a lovely hotel to stay at. It's large enough to lose your way around within it. Although, that is not true when you walk out of the hotel. The hotel has a shopping centre, which isn't extremely impressive and a coffee shop, which serves a delightful breakfast buffet, that one will not want to miss. The staff here, although polite, don't lend a feeling of warmth, which perhaps is the norm in a business-like hotel. The rooms are spacious. Remember, if you're a smoker, always opt for a room on the smoking floors. Singapore is extremely strict when it comes to these ground rules and offenders are fined very seriously. There's a good chance that you might not have the best view if you're a smoker, and if you really want a room on a higher floor with a magnificent view of the waterfront and most of Singapore's sights, you'll have to worry about taking a long elevator ride to step outside the hotel for a smoke. Singapore as a city has good signage - for roads, directions and important landmarks. It is also known as a 'real fine place'. The city has levied fines on urinating in lift, flower picking, spitting, chewing gum, smoking, not flushing, bird-feeding and garbage dumping, among several more. So, it's essential for one to be on their best behaviour. The city is also known for its inconsistent weather. If it rains while you're there, spend the evening (and even night) walking the waterfront at Fullerton, perhaps, enjoy a coffee at the Starbucks there while walking towards the impressive landmark of Singapore - the Merlion. If you're an enthusiastic shopper - head to Orchard Street for the best in clothes and to Mustafa, the 24-hour mall in Little India (known as Serangoon Road) for some of the best deals in electronics.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok", "Title": "\u201cDreadful hotel\u201d", "Author": "KobinBangkok", "ReviewID": "UR68537840", "Content": "This has to be one of the very worst so-called luxury hotels I have ever had the misfortune to stay in.

We have found it to be a comfortable and pleasant establishment in which to stay. Whilst the rooms are certainly not luxurious, they are well appointed and well maintained. It would be a good idea to request a river view room on one of the higher floors. The views from such a room are both spectacular and interesting. Try to avoid a room on the other side of the building. The view from those rooms is rather dull and uninspiring. One also needs to be wary about the size of the room that you may be allocated. Because the building is an irregular shape, some of the rooms are large whilst others are quite small. Friends travelling with us on our last visit, were given a room that was small and cramped and really not much bigger than a broom cupboard, whilst our room, right next door was large and comfortable. You should try to ensure that you get your buffet breakfast in your tariff. The range and quality of food available at the buffet breakfast (served in a dining area adjacent to the hotel\u2019s main foyer) is outstanding. Service at breakfast is usually efficient and friendly. The hotel has an adequately equipped gymnasium and the swimming pool area is pleasant enough without being outstanding. In relation to amenities, the biggest plus for this hotel is its location immediately adjacent to the Singapore River. There is a very pleasant dining and promenading area between the hotel and the river. Some reviewers have been critical of the location of this hotel. We, however, have found it to be ideal. Sure, it is a bit off the beaten tourist path, but its location allows for a pleasant 10 minute stroll along the river to Boat Quay and Clarke Quay. Five minutes\u2019 walk in the opposite direction is the large and well appointed Great World Shopping Centre. Other tourist and shopping attractions can be easily accessed by water taxis, cheap car taxis and a range of shuttle buses, most of which are free. The general standard of the service in the hotel is quite good. A particular strength is the service provided at the concierge desk. The staff operating this desk provided outstanding service. They were helpful, friendly and extremely efficient. The staff at the travel and touring desk located in the foyer were also helpful and efficient. The bell staff were also exceptionally helpful in dealing with our luggage and in organizing taxis and other transfers. We have found the reception desk staff to be efficient in dealing with both check-in and check-out. However, the reception staff need to be better trained in the art of being friendly and welcoming.

By no means a quiet hotel, being located next to the mega popular club Zouk, and seemingly popular with huge tour groups (particularly from India, at least when we were there). Not quite the middle of town, but transport is plentiful and quick. Overall, we enjoyed the room very much, but the ABYSMAL service standards marred the experience somewhat \u2013 see reservation and breakfast sections below. Reservation Experience \u2013 Shockingly bad! We booked online followed by a phone call to doubly make sure that we got what we wanted, and were assured nothing would go wrong. However, upon check-in, wrong rooms were still allocated (non-smoking, twin beds etc) and eventually we had to make compromises as they had reserved the wrong type of rooms for us. In addition, the receptionist (an Indian gentleman) was highly rude and condescending, even as we were trying to help the hotel deal with their own mistake in our booking. Bottom score for this. Room \u2013 Must have been a refurbished room as everything looked slick and new. Cleanliness top notch, and amenities like bathrobes and slippers were nice. Immensely comfy beds (though on the soft side) were a huge plus point, and the TV was large with a good selection of pay and free channels. Very happy!! Bathroom \u2013 A tad small with no bathtub, but perfectly adequate and no bruised elbows/knees in the shower cubicle. Room Service \u2013 We only ordered a soup, but it came nicely presented with many bread rolls, water and full setting. Promptly too. Breakfast \u2013 Another major downside to this hotel. Packed to the gills, the restaurant struggled to keep food on the counter, and we were forced to make do with whatever was left. Food was mediocre, 3-star quality at best. Atrocious service here as well (perhaps due to the large crowd). We were allocated a table but when we returned with food, found that it had been given to another couple. When queried, the waitress replied \u201cYou took so long to take your food so I didn\u2019t know if you were coming back!\u201d Huh??? After our first round, we went back to the buffet table for refills and juice (barely 3 minutes), and when we returned, our table had been cleared and re-set once again! Efficiency is no excuse, as there were countless other tables that were left uncleared for our entire stay in the restaurant! In summary, this is a hotel for those who are only interested in the extremely comfortable room, as we are, and who can tolerate all other sorts of nonsense (shocking service, crowds, some noise in the hallways).", "Date": "November 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cWatch Booking rate!\u201d", "Author": "SANTACLAUS1", "ReviewID": "UR47812151", "Content": "Average Hotel certainly not 5*.

It's situated on a busy street (Havelock Rd) with the nearest shopping mall (Great World City) 2 large blocks away. This does not sound like much, but you'll still want a (cheap) taxi in wet/humid conditions, in which case you might as well cab it to the Orchard Road shops. It's a reasonably new hotel (9-10 years old) so standard rooms are small, and views not spectacular unless you're on the highest floors. Ask for larger rooms which have a brighter feel (e.g those ending in 04). The hotel backs onto the Singapore river, a very narrow but pleasantly landscaped channel with walkways but again, there's nothing noteworthy within walking distance. The surrounding buildings are mostly hotels of lower (3*) standard with some construction work on one side of the hotel (condominiums rising everywhere); late at night the area just outside the hotel entrance is infested with teens hanging out near the extremely popular 'Zouk' disco, so access to the hotel is by room key in the small hours of the morning; Restaurants are ok (Pontini is one of the better Italian restaurants); the conference floor on level 4 is always buzzing with exhibitors; Coffee shop / pastry counter in lobby; Breakfast buffet has a good selection; Maserati showroom just next door add some panache. More on the rooms: comments: standard rooms are not large; beds good; aircon works (3 fan settings & thermostat); bathroom has all the basics but again quite cramped for a 4* hotel; cleaners do an acceptable job, but could have more attention to detail. I found myself using a bathmat to seal off the rather large gap underneath the door, to stop draughts and to shut out noise (piped music in corridors is audible inside the room at night and can be a little irritating).

The hotel is situated on the bank of the river and we received everything we expected from this class of hotel. We stayed 4 nights, May 14-18, check in and out, fast and efficient. However some comments that do not detract from the hotel, but could go a long way to making things ever better. Smile, oh dear what has happened to the smiles, during the fours days it was hard to find any staff member with a smile on their face. I know it's Singapore and hot, but a smile goes a long way to making guests feel even better about their stay in your hotel. We booked the breakfast package and it was value for money, 4 days at Australian dollars $705 all inclusive. During our research throught the various sites, including direct with the hotel, the rates fluctuated between A$705 and $A1050 so look around. The breakfast selection is great, something for everyone, and even when eating late there is still a good selection to be had. One point to be made is the egg chefs, there is only one cooking point for fresh cooked eggs and at peak time this can cause a wait, and there is a reluctance of the chefs to want to cook anything other than omelets. If you ask for scrambled or fried eggs, you are directed to the warmers where the pre cooked eggs are slowly going cold. Stand your ground, state you want freshly cooked eggs and it will be done, but not with a smile. Our room was on the 19th floor and abutted the construction work going on next door to the hotel and at 7am each morning the whine of machinery started up, not overly intrusive, but audible nevertheless, also the dull beat of music can be heard from the night club down below in the early hours of the morning. Suggestions are to ask for a room away from the construction site and all will be fine. The room itself was fine, mattress a little firmer than we like, but acceptable, small bathroom, but everything included, large shower, hot water with great pressure. Flatscreen TV, plenty of station choices and free internet access. The hotel is situated away from the main shopping areas and it's a 19 minute stroll to Clarke Quay underground station, 25-30 minutes to Orchard Road. Note, strolling is as fast as one wants to go in the heat of Singapore, anything more than a stroll is considered exercise and that can be done once you arrive home.There is a free hotel courtesy bus through the day, as well as taxis to get you around. There is a small shopping centre about 5 minutes from the hotel with a good array of shops and eating places, there is also a small hawker centre in the flats opposite the hotel where local food is hot, tasty and cheap. Eating within the hotel is expensive as expected in this class of hotel, however the eateries in the Clarke Quay area start just 10 minutes stroll away. Costs at some of the eateries are more expensive than the hotel so it pays to check the menu before sitting down. A well appointed hotel, clean and efficiently run, value for money if you find the right rate, and well recommended. We would stay here next trip.

The bathroom was nothing special, but our main problem was my very tall husband had trouble fitting under the over bath shower. This would have been ok for a night or two, but as we were there for a week we decided to upgrade to a Club Deluxe room. Best decision ever!! We were given a tour of two rooms to choose from! And chose a large room on floor 29 with fantastic views over Singapore and the river. The bathroom was huge with a separate large shower. In fact the only \"problem \" we had was that I found the mattress too hard in the new room. No problem - they swapped the mattress from the old room! We loved the use of the Club lounge for breakfast and evening drinks and fantastic canapes. Non alcoholic drinks in the minibar were \"free\" as were all day refreshments in the club lounge. We made use of the two pieces of complimentary laundry. The extra cost for Club rooms is definitely worth it for a more comfortable stay. The staff were all so friendly, efficient and helpful. We ate in the restaurant a couple of nights and the food was excellent but expensive. All the public areas were calm, cool and relaxing. The only downside was the pool area which, when we stayed there is completely overlooked by a very noisy building site next door and is also completely in the shade in the afternoon. Location wise was no problem for us. It may be slightly out of the centre, but taxis are very cheap and plentiful and the bus stop outside also takes you to Orchard Rd or to the Marina area.

I got a face cloth and wiped the wall where the mould was, and sure it enough, it came off onto the white face cloth, and now the white face cloth had a streak of dark green on it. I was disgusted. I took my suitcases back down and informed reception of this room which was clearly in violation of a health code. She didn't seem apologetic, but acted like she expected someone to complain. She gave me two new keys. I went to the room and the first thing I inspected was the bathroom. Much to my delight the bathroom was really nice, and sparkling!

He advised what's there, is all I can have. coffee, Orange Juice or Pineapple Juice. I asked him to please check with someone else, and sure enough someone came with Apple Juice. I had to repeat this dance every morning. As a Canadian, I couldn't get over the cost of the pop in the Mini-Bar. Something like $10 USD/CAD. I could not believe this, however I heard Singapore was expensive so I figured the mini-bar would be as much. Instead we walked down to a store, under some apartments, and got some pop to put in the mini-bar to keep cool. Upon check out we noticed a charge for pop from the mini-bar! I brought this to the attention of the reception girl, who, after 10 minutes, decided to remove the charge!.

There were a few mistakes from a customer service point of view but I do think everyone genuinely wanted to help. We arrived at 7.00am and were immediately given a complementary drink. Although the policy is that you cannot have your room until 2.00pm the lady said she would find a room by 8.00am. We were actually upgraded to the top floor. Fantastic, a room really early overlooking the city. All going well except a few minor issues. When we got to the room there was no bed for my daughter. A quick call sorted this out and an elderly lady was sent up with a bed. Why they didn\u2019t send someone else I don\u2019t know. So with that ironed out all was well. Well until 5.00am the following morning when we were told to pack up and move rooms. When my wife questioned this we were told it was because the early room was an upgrade just for one night. The first we heard. So we packed up, and then at 6.00am got a call to say unpack and you can stay there. A good resolution but where was the communication. Once we got over this the rest of the holiday was first class. The room was comfortable, and newly fitted. The hotel was immaculate throughout. We never used the restaurant as eating out in Singapore can be so cheap. The swimming pool was great too. It\u2019s on the sixth floor and is a reasonable size although it can get busy. The Jacuzzi isn\u2019t too bad but not that bubbly. There is some construction accross the road but that never really disturbed us.

It was entirely too crowded and the decor felt like something from the 1970's. The tiny bed had a nice cotton duvet, but the carpet was worn and stained, as were the chair cushions. The furniture was old and chipped and it was a bit depressing. I did like the soft lighting though - plenty of lamps, which always makes me happy. The AC was good and cold too, the way I like it. But an Executive room??? I think not. My room overlooked the river and a massive construction site. The walls were very thin and the hotel reminded me of my stay at the M Hotel in Singapore, which like the Copthorne, is part of the Millennium Group of hotels. The decent sized bathroom was more contemporary, had good lighting and nice amenities. The 26th floor hallway felt much like the room, stained, old and in need of refurbishment. As sad as the room was, the buffet meals served in the hotel's restaurant were very good. I'm not generally a fan of buffets, but I was impressed with this one, particularly the assortment of fresh salads.

The bathroom had a separate shower (unlike previous review below), bath with shower attachments, etc. Decent array of toiletries (razor, toothbrush, etc). The rooms must all differ slightly in configuration. I agree with the review below that the electricity does shut off when you remove the key card, but that is the same for many hotels I've experienced in Europe and Australia. The air conditioning does keep going, so the room was always a good temperature. There is a port at the writing desk for broadband and two electricity points, but could do with more given the amount of gadgets we seem to have (2 laptops, mobile phones, etc), let alone wanting to boil the kettle for tea/coffee. With regard to the tea and coffee complaints made in earlier reviews, yes there are only 2 of everything provided, but we found that housekeeping was more than happy to supply us with more. On the night we arrived we rang and requested extra supplies and proper milk. These were sent up very quickly and with no fuss (or charge). Housekeeping came both morning and evening and replenished and refreshed the rooms as required. As per previous review there was the free broadband provided in the room (although you have to go through the process of signing up to a plan - we didn't get charged) although I'm not sure if the freebie was only for a short time. We used the laundry service nearly every day taking advantage of the 2 free pieces. Also free soft drinks and juice from the minibar. The best part of the stay at the hotel was the facility of the executive club lounge on level 29 and the service we received from the wonderful staff that worked there ( thank you Lydia, Johnathon, Jaya, Delilah, Lydia, Al-Zafik, Yousif and Himirami). Breakfast is included for Club room and is served in the lounge from about 7 till 10 every morning. The buffet selection isn't huge, but there was a choice of British, European and Asian plus the ability to order the usual eggs, bacon, sausage, tomato and hash browns. There never seemed to be more than half a dozen people in at a time, so a nice relaxed atmosphere. Tea, coffee, juice and soft drinks are available throughout the day (FOC) and there are complimentary drinks and hors d'oeuvres from 6pm to 8pm. There was one evening we were so tired from sight seeing that we ended up snacking out on the hors d'oeuvres as a light supper. Yes the hotel is slightly further out (but so are Mirimar, Furama Riverfront, Holiday Inn which were all next door or across the road), but a taxi up to Orchard Road was about S$5 and there is a free shuttle bus running between these hotels, Orchard Rd and Clark Quay MRT. The hotel is right on the river and you can walk along and across the foot bridge to Robinson Quay (8-10 mins) and Clarke Quay (15 mins) for lunch or dinner. If you want a taxi then you never had to wait long at the door before one arrives. I found the business service center well organised and very efficient. I don't know if I would have enjoyed the hotel as much had we not been in a club room. The staff in the Executive Club Lounge were wonderful dealing with all our little requests (eg the milk, band aids, etc) and making us feel very welcome.

I had read the reviews on this site before going, so to be honest my expectations were not very high >> I was pleasantly surprised. We had a club room on the 30th floor, the views were interesting but unfortunately there was a building site next to the Hotel but it wasn't too noisy (however, I must add that it's difficult to avoid building sites as Singapore is full of them, everywhere you look you are surrounded by them). The executive club really made staying at the hotel worthwhile as you recieve lot's of little perks (see previous review, evening alcoholic drinks 6-8pm, breakfast, laundry service/ limit 2 piece per day and so on). The services was extra good, in many ways, check-in and out super quick and efficient, we also had a late check out (only until 1 pm) on request as we had an evening flight, we ended up coming back to the hotel and having a swim and shower before going to the airport. No problem for the Hotel to hold your luggage. The hotel decor is pretty average and the room wasn't that spacious but it was very clean and comfortable. Location and current facilities are probably the downside to this hotel, it's a 20 min walk to the closest MRT, but I must add it's a very pleasant walk on the riverside pathway so easy to find plently of bars and restaurants in that area, Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay. We actually walked home from the Esplanade Theatres (giant durians) which took a little over 40 mins and it was a good way to walk off our dinner. Take some good walking shoes. Taxis are so reasonable (about $4/5 singapore to get up to orchard rd, $20 dollars from the airport) that it doesn't really matter. I walked alot, used buses (once I got the hang of it, make sure you have small change as they don't give change), used the MRT, tried the Hotel shuttle but it was a real milk run and took over 20mins to get to orchard rd which usually takes 5 mins), I did discover another free shuttle which goes from Great World City straight to Orchard rd/ Orchard MRT and back again. Great World City is a few mins walk from the hotel and is a good shopping centre with a great food court downstairs and some nice restaurants and shops too. Go out of the Hotel and turn right, cross the rd and walk down. A free shuttle goes ever 20 mins or so from there.

We had dinner in the restaurant before our flight - it was a thai buffet and was delicious, again with wonderful array of food. We noticed that many local people eat at the hotel which is a good recommendation.

The television included BBC World, which was nice, and the room has a radio alarm clock (useful for 88.9 FM, which is the BBC World Service). I found the room rather cold, and the thermostat on the air conditioning didn't appear to do much. But the room was nice, the bathroom very good, and, you know... yawn...

This hotel has problems: Location is quite poor. If you are a tourist you are not close to Orchard Road (a taxi ride, which is not ideal). If you're in business, you are in no man's land. In other words, location is poor. Rooms are small and not well decorated. They are old Bathrooms are also quite small. Worse still, my room (and we had 2) had a powerful smell, and were not well cleaned. Prices: It is expensive for the location, and the quality of the rooms. Facilities. Average pool and fitness centre. Nothing great. Breakfast OK, but generally not included in your rate. My advice? For the same money, you may do better elsewhere.

With the river view room on the non-smoking floor, there is no such advantage about it. When I first step into the room, my gosh! I felt like this room was held a party all night long. All the cigarette smells in the room really got on my nerve. I have to call the front desk, see if I can change the room. Unfortunately, we checked in quite early while other guests probably still sleeping, so there was no room available. I asked for the air-refresher instead. Quickly the house keeping came with a spray bottle of air-refresher. The room suddenly smells nicer. The room is great for business people who want comfort in a small space, but I would suggest the other way to romance-oriented couple.

Initial check in seemed to falter as we were told there were no double rooms available and we had been allocated a twin however the sight of my face must have prompted the receptionist as she offered us double room in the next band up, i think it was up from superior to superior plus, yes we had to pay a small surcharge but it was only a few pounds more per night and it WAS the start of the holiday...we were totally taken aback by the size of the room on the 14th floor with its views down the river towards the heart of the city.Any calls to room service for items such as an iron, extra condiments were dealt with rapidly...why do hotels only give you 2 or 3 pots of milk??!! Breakfasts which were included in our rate were filling and set us up for the day and the hotels position was such that it was a mere 10 minute walk along the riverside to get to hotspots like clarke quay and boat quay. we used the concierge for a couple of trips out, the night safari and sentosa island, yes we know we could have done it cheaper ourselves but this was a semi relaxed trip and prices were ok. Daily paper was delivered and laundry facility good, don\"t bother with the internet via tv..it takes too long and the business centre seemed a bit pricy for internet access..better to find somewhere outside. we didn\"t even get to see the pool area. Overall we really enjoyed the Waterfront and would return, it seemed to be placed well for access to various areas like orchard road and little india..there were always taxis available in the hotel and they were not particularly expensive, staff were courteous and helpful and we didn\"t experience problems that others have complained of or are we just not as picky??", "Date": "January 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - would recommend\u201d", "Author": "AmershamSouthWales", "ReviewID": "UR6647000", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront from 14th January 2007.
