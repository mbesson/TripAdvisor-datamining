There is a knob on both sides of the bed that I have heard from some of the reviews that it is adjustable to make it firmer or softer if you need it.

The hotel was recommened as it was close to the wedding venue and affordable. It was a place to sleep, and that was fine, but the trip could've been better. The directions on the website stated to exit the I-15 at Rancho Bernardo Drive. We figured that you must be able to see the hotel from the freeway, which you can, if you're heading north, which we were not. Also, the hotel is not located on Rancho Bernardo Drive, but Bernardo Center Drive...did I mention that every street in this town has the word Bernardo in it? Good thing we had GPS in our phones. The Hilton is located in the same center as a spinal rehabilitation/hospital place, and some restaurants. After a nine hour drive, we just wanted to put our things down and get a late dinner...except the check in parking was blocked by Hilton shuttles, left unattended. We trudged up to check in, and the woman was nice, but not helpful. After telling us our room was located in \"the middle of the hotel,\" she told us we could park \"anywhere.\" Mind you, this hotel is in a complex with other businesses, so after being reminded of that, she suddenly remembered that Hilton parking was \"that way,\" with a friendly point. These spots are very small and close together, so I would not park directly next to another car unless you must. After getting to our room, I realized we would need a late check out, as the wedding didn't start until three. When asked if we could have a late check out, the clerk answered, \".....ummmmmm.....\" and twirled her hair. I asked if we could leave at two, and she said, \"Yeah, that could work. Two!\" and that was that. No note on the computer, no reprogramming my key, nothing. The room itself was fine. The carpet was a bit stained, but the beds were clean and I slept fine. The walls were thin, but our neighbors were quiet (I actually feared that we may have bothered them, instead). Busy wedding morning, and we came back to our room to change. Except our key wouldn't let us back in the hotel. Because we had a late check out, but no one made a notation of it. Back to the front desk, where we asked for a new key. Didn't ask our names, didn't ask for ID, just reprogrammed the key. Finally, time to check out. But, alas, we had already checked out. At noon.

We came to San Diego to go to the Zoo and Sea World and to visit Old Town so we were just expecting a clean hotel with a pool, near Sea World and the Zoo with nice hotel service. So, this hotel is nice if you're not looking to be pampered or treated like a queen/king. We are from Canada and hadn't been to San Diego before but we brought our GPS with us - but still, we had a HARD time finding the hotel (really SMALL hotel sign). It's tucked in behind a surgery center and a few buffet restaurants. It was an asian man that checked us in and I'm not sure if he was rude or I was just expecting a little better service but he didn't greet us at all and rolled his eyes when we told him we parked in front of the hotel because we were waiting to ask where we had to park and if we had to pay for parking. Then when I told him it was our honeymoon he was didn't say anything - most people say 'congratulations' or something of the sort. It was a little disappointing traveling 3 days from Northern B.C. Canada all the way to San Diego, California, USA and having a bad experience with just checking in. The hotel is for the most part clean - a few things I noticed were; the pool needs to treated and cleaned for sure, the back of our hotel room door is covered in something sticky like someone spilled pop or something and didn't clean it off afterward, and lots of stains on the carpets. The hotel does have a restaurant in it - the first night we stayed we ordered dinner through room service and the food was SO good and the lady that dropped it off was a sweetheart. We had breakfast a few times there and again the food was amazing but the service was alright - the ladies seem to gossip or talk amongst themselves more then they talk to you. Basically, our overall experience of this hotel was average or 'alright' - we're not hard-to-please-people and weren't expecting a lot but the service wasn't so great. However, there were a few people, we noticed, that went out of their way to do a few things for us or help us with something we were unsure of. The location of the hotel is poor. The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable and the balcony is nice. Also, just for people to be aware - this hotel is a tournament hotel... I read a review about that but thought we should be okay, there shouldn't be a team staying here the 4 days we are there BUT I think it was two soccer teams that stayed here and ran up and down the hallways during the day. So if you're looking for quiet during the day - I would say find a different place. We, however, were gone most of the day so it didn't bother us until the late evenings but they were quiet at night. Also, the first morning we were here, we noticed a newspaper that someone had slid underneath our door and we thought it was a sweet but turns out, you pay for it - they charge it to your credit card. I guess it says in FINE PRINT on your paper that comes with the door key. I would stay here again if I got better service the next time. A few things I recommend to people wanting to travel to San Diego and possibly stay at this hotel are rent a vehicle through ALAMO - their service was absolutely over-the-top. We paid in advance a small regular car and they upgraded us to a nicer one for nothing and the gentleman that helped us seemed genuine and honest and excited to see us. It was nice. Also, I HIGHLY recommend going out for a nice dinner at Carver's SteakHouse, it's just down the road from the hotel and it was the BEST service we have ever had ANYWHERE. Absolutely amazing. So much so that our waiter talked with us for a few mins and got to know us and when he found out it was our honeymoon - he ordered a dessert for us in the shape of a heart. So beautiful. And the food, oh my goodness... SO GOOOD. We asked our waiter if we could leave our rental car at the restaurant so we could have a few drinks and he said it wouldn't be a problem but when we were ready to go.. we would've had to wait over an hour for a taxi so he got his assistant to drive us back to our hotel. He was very sweet. This restaurant is truly amazing. Again, our overall experience with the hotel was average - nothing special which is disappointing because it is a chain hotel of the Hilton Hotels. There were a few people that really stood out to us in a good way and a few in a bad way. I would recommend this place to friends if they were looking for a place to just sleep and not have to interact with the people that work here too much.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cHouse hunting trip.

Certainly after reading some of the reviews the staff has the ability to touch some of their guests. My rooms was a suite and extremely large. There was a comfortable work station and wired internet only. The work station was at the opposite end of the very large suite, so there was no checking emails in bed. Room was equipped with a small fridge, microwave, coffee maker, 11/2 baths. The furniture in the living area was in good shape. The room and bathrooms were very clean. The bed was a disappointment for a HGI. Many of the Hilton properties have been upgrading their beds but not here. The bed was fine, but not what I was hoping for. There were a couple of other problems, the auto closing bathroom doors can be an annoyance until I figured out my shoe would stop it, the bathroom sink drain ran real slow. The room was located so I got great deal of noise from the freeway and it was not a peaceful rest. The morning breakfast staff was attentive and the food was very good.

I agree with reviewers that it may not be the best choice if you are thinking of spending all your time downtown, but if you are going to be in Rancho Bernardo anyways (we were there for family) or to see the Wild Animal Park, it is a good choice. But; I downgraded the hotel, however, based upon a poor job of cleaning the toilet before we got there in one of the two rooms.

We were in San Diego for a week & needed a place for two nights before moving to Coronado for a business conference. Knew the Rancho Bernardo area as we had been several times before to visit family. We had a car & wanted to explore the coast on up to Laguna Beach. This location suited us for the short term. All that being said..... If you are coming to San Diego to tour San Diego I would not stay in this location. It is far from the tourist action as in Sea World, Old Town, Coronado, Balboa Park etc.... This hotel is better suited for the business traveler, large groups, or someone with reason to be in the Rancho Bernardo area. The hotel was a typical Hilton Garden Inn. The lobby was bright & attractive with several seating areas. The rooms were new & fresh. Nice size bathroom. Friendly staff The downside was the NOISE! Very loud place to be. The freeway noise was terrible. We could not see the freeway from our room as our room faced an apartment complex. Even with the buffer of another building the noise was horrible. In the past I have lived close to an airport as well as a freeway & the noise never bothered me. In this location the freeway noise was loud & constant to the point of bothersome. As far as restaurants, the hotel has their own restaurant. There are two chain restaurants in the same complex. Souplantation & Stir Fresh (a Mongolian Restaurant). We ate at Stir Fresh and enjoyed it. Overall we liked the Hilton Garden Inn.

The hotel is smack-dab right against a huge freeway, and even having a room away from the freeway side didn't help much. During our weeklong stay, the housekeeping staff were incredibly noisy, talking and even routinely yelling up and down the hallways at all hours (including at 7 am, waking up everyone within earshot). The location is remote from most things you'd want to do in San Diego (we grew up there and go back frequently). It's nearly an hour from La Jolla, 45 minutes (depending on traffic) from downtown. The suburban neighborhood is about what you'd expect -- shopping malls, chain restaurants, lots of big parking lots. It's also a very hot, inland location -- averaging 10-15 degrees hotter than the coastal areas.
