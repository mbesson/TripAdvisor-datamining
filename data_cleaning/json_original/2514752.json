Check-in was quick in the wood-toned lobby area. Despite a heat-wave in mid-March, the famous rooftop bar was not open yet. The hallways were decorated with Paris scenery and dark hues. Room size was good by Paris standards and the renovations were quite clever in their use of space, especially in the bathroom area. The colour theme was red, bordering on \u201cbordello light\u201d. The double-bed was two singles pushed together and was very hard. I requested extra pillows but still woke up with a crick in my neck (but there was a pillow menu, so I could have ordered a harder pillow). The flat-screen TV in our room did not work and the service man was unable to fix it so we had to move rooms. It was a very quick process and our second room was identical to the first, just two floors up. Both rooms were very warm as the air-conditioning had not been turned on yet. Despite having to open the windows, it was relatively quiet. The bathroom was at the end of the room behind two sets of curtains. It contained a huge tub and separate shower cubicle and tiny toilet cubicle. Shower strength was poor to average and for someone 5\u2019 10 \u00bd, it was quite claustrophobic. However, the bathroom area did contain two sinks, which is very handy for couples. Amenities were those annoying green/friendly pouches. The closet contained bathrobes, slippers, iron and even an umbrella. The hotel left lovely French sweets on the pillows and the room had lots of nice touches. The breakfast area / restaurant was very calm and was a mixture of older, wealthy couples on holiday and French businessman conducting power breakfasts. The service was a little slow, but the food quality overall was good (although was partner was disappointed with the quality of the sausages). I personally prefer more modern hotels, but my partner leans towards old-world charm. By North American standards 3 \u00bd stars. This nice property was much more expensive than our other Paris hotel, but then it is like comparing apples and oranges.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat room & view!\u201d", "Author": "Patsy2652", "ReviewID": "UR125608101", "Content": "Friendly welcoming staff.

It is not often that I say \u201cnever again\u201d but Terrass is one of those places where I won\u2019t be back. This is as close to a \"one\" star as I have been with a hotel. If you are still interested in staying at Terrass, the least expensive way to get there from CDG airport is via the RER B line, connecting to the number 2 Metro line and exiting at Blanche station which is a short 5 minute walk to the hotel. This will run you \u20ac9.75 one way which is about 20-25% of the cost of a taxi from CDG. The rooms are quite small, and the bathroom is very small. The \u201cdouble\u201d bed was two twin beds pushed together with a gap in between the two beds. My room had light that was coming in through the drapes, it wasn\u2019t until night two that I realized that there was a set of external shutters that could be lowered to block the light. The room I was given was the room that one of my co-workers had the day before. He moved out since there was a mouse or equivalent that was running up and down across the ceiling in this room. He demanded a new room, and was given a new room. Sadly, the management gave me his old room, not realizing that we knew each other. This, I came to realize, is the level of service that one can expect at Terrass. In addition to the mouse in the room, the small bar in the lobby with a fireplace also had a mouse dash across the carpet. We don\u2019t know if it came from my room or not\u2026.and I won\u2019t be going back to find out! The conference rooms were extremely cold, resulting in a number of space heaters brought in to try and fix the problem\u2026.the rooms on the other hand, were quite hot. Food left a LOT to be desired, and I would never voluntarily eat at the hotel itself. Thank goodness it is on a street with lots of shops and restaurants, and conveniently located across from the hotel is a pizza parlor which will saved several of us during our visit. Don\u2019t bother with room service at night since there apparently are only two items that you can order\u2026there was quite a discussion among us as to whether there was a functioning kitchen at the hotel. Service levels in general are quite low, the bartender claims to be doing both bar service and room service which \u201cmight\u201d explain why the bartender is sometimes hard to find. If you are looking for a gym, try a different hotel. On the surface, this is not as bad as a hotel as our experience, but given the cumulative bad things, overall service, two mice and lack of good quality food, combined with high prices I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone. And, this comes from someone who has previously written about the fact that finding a good reasonably priced hotel in Paris is a difficult thing to do. Save your money, save yourself some grief and stay away from Terrass.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN", "Title": "\u201cTerrass hotel, Paris\u201d", "Author": "mugsyNashville_TN", "ReviewID": "UR123710166", "Content": "This December was our third trip to Paris.

The room was comfortable and beautifully decorated, if a little on the small side (presumably a Parisian trait). The nearest metro station is a 7-10 minute walk and there's a public bike depot right outside the front door (you can almost freewheel down to the banks of the Seine if that's your thing, although I wouldn't recommend the uphill cycle back). We visited the Moulin de la Galette on New Year's eve and the restaurant is short walk away. Unfortunately, we didn't find the staff particularly friendly. Any time we sought advice, we were generally treated dismissively and a little rudely. Also, when checking-in, we were led to believe that breakfast was included. It wasn't.

He wanted it to be really special and romantic for me so he booked a junior suite at this hotel and asked for roses to be put on the bed as a surprise and requested a nice room, red if possible to look romantic and offered to pay whatever was neccessary extra. We were so excited to see the room as we'd heard such great things. Check in was meant to be at 2 pm so we walked around Paris to pass the time. We then went to the hotel just after 2 pm and went to check in. The person at the desk told us our room won't be ready till 3pm so we should come back. He didnt apologize for the delay or offer us a drink he just said its not ready and should be ready at 3. Oh but he also said our junior suite had been upgraded to an executive suite which cheered us up a bit. We were so disappointed and had just wanted to go up and relax after just arriving in paris and walking around all morning. As we were leaving I went outside and my boyfriend ran back to confirm that the flowers would be put on the bed as a surprise for me as he requested and the desk clerk confirmed this. So we went out for a while and came back at three. The room was still not ready. We waited a while longer and heard nothing. Then the staff switched and growing impatient as it was nearly 4pm my boyfriend asked if our room was ready. The new desk clerk gave us our key straight away and then we asked for our luggage. We expected them to bring it up but they just gave it to us and went back to work. Not very professional considering how good the hotels meant to be. They should have offered to show us to our room. When we opened the door to the room i was sooooo dissapointed and so was my boyfriend. Not only were the flowers not there, but the room was ORANGE. I hate orange and it was all over the room the walls were covered in orange the bed spread and all the decorations. It was awful. My boyfriend was so upset that there were no flowers to make it romantic. Also, despite them bragging about the eiffel tower view from the window what was worse was the view of the graveyard which was much closer than the eiffel tower literally just below us. We asked if they had another room available in another colour and they said no and when my boyfriend asked aobut the flowers they said there was a mistake and there were none. They also said if we wanted to switch rooms we need to downgrade to a junior suite and they said it so rudely and kept saying we upgraded you to an executive suite as if to say we should be grateful and not complain about anything. I would have been happy if things had gone to plan. Since the call about the orange room the staff were very rude and didn't help us with anything. I would not stay at the hotel again and think that they really ought to change the colour scheme in some of the rooms and try and be a bit more courteous and respectful to guests. The room was clean but nothing special the bathroom was also plain and nothing special. Needs to be made a little more luxiourious if their going to call it an executive suite.

They did give us a glass of champagne on the terrace with a lovely view as way of compensation but if we'd paid ourselves it would have cost 31 euros and the restaurant is fully booked so you can't just pop up there ! The problems were primarily with breakfast and the retaurant management and his staff - a joke ! We waited for half an hour for hot food and kept being told it would be ready in 5 mins. No tables were cleared so you sit looking at other customers half eaten food. If you want tea then make sure you ask for breakfast tea as they brought Earl Grey on every occasion. They only provide one or two milk portions in the rooms for tea and coffee so ask for more upfront if you'd like at least two cups each a day. If you like coffee with cold milk make sure you ask as they always bring hot milk and did so on one occasion in a jug with no lid and a broken spout. They also brought us cold milk in a jug that had congealed milk in it and made me feel sick. The poached eggs are cooked in vinegar so tasted very bad. The scrambled eggs were luke warm at best. The bacon is very fatty. The electricity broke down in our room twice and we had to be moved before we had spent one night but had unpacked all our things ! The concierge was very helpful and helped us move and then recommended a restaurant for us to eat in. Don't follow the advice as it was the most expensive restarurant we tried during our 3 night stay 65 euros for two mussels and chips and 3 pints of beer. If you are on a budget but want good food thats cheap we recommend going to Flunch which is part of the castorama complex on the way to the place de clichy metro.We had two roast chicken, chips and veg , one dessert and two glasses of beer and one coffee for 16 euros ( thats for both of us not each !! ) Not a great setting but fills a hole cheaply. We also had a lovely meal over looking the Notre Dame and paid less than the 65 euros we paid on the first night ! Alcohol is very expensive in Paris at at least 7 euros per pint of beer ! The cheapest we found was 1.75 euros in McDonalds. We also experienced the maid coming in to our room without knocking at 8.30am one morning and seeing us in bed so ensure you always put the do not disturb sign up even early !! We were in a room next to the service door and they squeak terribly so every morning we heard squeaks and couldn't sleep. You can also hear other peoples shower and baths as if they are in your room.

Upon arrival we took a taxi from the airport to the hotel and a I as checking in, I lowered my briefcase adjacent to my feet to fill out the hotel requested paperwork. Within a minute, my briefcase was grabbed and the thieves ran right out the front door. That theft cost me virtually all of my cash, three credits cards, my passport, camera, laptop, frequent traveler cards, phone cards, all my prescriptions, the list goes on. I had just bought the briefcase made of exotic KUDU while in Africa during my world cup visit. The ensuing collateral damage between visits to the police station to fill out police reports (3 hours), US Embassy twice (8 hours) a confrontation with the hotel summoned taxi driver, loss of funds and time had a devasting affect on my planned 5 days to celebrate, sight see and shop for my daughters birthday. Needless to say it did not help that both of the automatic sliding doors (entrance and foyer) were left in the open position, which aided the culprits int heir quick escape. After my episode, the doors were never left open again during my stay, when questioned the staff said they open them periodically to air out the hotel????? Here's where it gets worse, the General Manager, Mehdi [--]was completely unresponsive, I requested multiple times daily to meet and discuss the bad situation in which the theft had left me, especially since I was there to celebrate my daughters birthday and stuck post theft with only one credit card and a few hundred dollars that happened to be in my pocket at the time of the theft. My loss in total was more the $12,000, it's hard to put a price tag on the loss of two days and the interruption of this planned experience with a loved family member for such an important life experience. I made daily requests for the next 5 days to meet the GM - [--] only to be told he was in meeting after meeting and put off each day, as he came and went avoiding my open time requests to meet. I did look at the security footage, and sure enough the two culprits came into the hotel as I was checking in and waited unnoticed for the chance to grab the briefcase. This apparently is not the first time this has happened at this hotel and the area definitely dictates front door security. Previously I had stayed at the Ritz-Carlton and believe me it is well worth the extra money, because a situation like this would have never happened or if it did they would have stepped up and ensured I was handled with care and attention that a tough situation like this one required. Having traveled most of my adult life for work and pleasure, this is the most blatant disregard for the customer I have ever seen, heard or experienced. I own many retail company's and customer service and satisfaction are the corner stones of our success The bottom line is this hotel and its leadership will do nothing for you if you have a problem, and only value your money not you as the customer. The Assistant Manager did agree to pay for my cab ride to the US Embassy the following morning but upon arrival they neglected to tell the cab driver they would pay for my fair. The lack of english skills resulted in me getting into a confrontation upon arrival, as he expected me to pay, could not speak \"english\" and decided that grabbing my wrist, breaking my watch and ripping my bag was how we would handle me telling him the Hotel was responsible to pay for my ride. To top it off, he then went to the police and they attempted to arrest me upon leaving the embassy. Even this second episode did not allow me the chance to meet with management. They simply said they forgot to tell the taxi driver when I called the hotel from my US phone with the police ready to take me in. Management said we will reimburse you upon return. In all fairness Louis and Daniele did their best to help a bad situation during my stay in their roles of doorman and concierge, however, I would strongly request that you DO NOT stay at this hotel. I have traveled much of the world, stayed at literally thousands of hotels and never in my life have I been so put off and disrespected as I was by the leadership of this hotel.

After several unsuccesfful attempts to stay at the Hotel Terrass in Montmartre, I was finally able to secure a room for 4 nights on a short business trip from June 29th through the 3rd of July. The hotel exceeded all of my expectations, both from a business and pleasure perspective. Each of the comments in reviews about the lovely concierge, Danielle, are \"spot on.\" She graciously assisted in recommending restaurants, giving accurate directions to the Metro, La Moulin de la Galette and Restaurant La Chammarre behind Sacre Coeur, and advising that 'you must see the Musee Nissim de Camondo by the Parc Monceau if you intend upon visiting the Musee Jacquemart-Andre. And the Parc Monceau is the most \"Parissienne\" of all.!\" Armed with brochures she supplied, I metroed about Paris on my only free afternoon. She was right again! When a last minute change in business plans took me back to London for a day, she deftly jumped online, and then decided I'd have a better selection of Eurostar fares and travel class availability by walking a short 2 blocks to the SCNF offices on Rue Lepis two blocks away. She was absolutely correct, and accordingly my client and I saved 200 Euros each on a business premier ticket. The Diapason Terrace Restaurant was also booked several months in advance, but on a Tuesday night at 10 o'clock there is usually room for a single. After sitting at a pub table sipping Pelligrino water and a delicious sauvignon blanc, a table replete with commanding view of the Parisian sky line and Tour Eiffel opened, and I was promptly transferred. Each course was beautifully prepared, and the patient staff directed my French appropriately where needed, and in \"Anglais\" when a perplexed look crossed my face. My quiet room on the rear \"jardin\" side of the hotel muted all traffic sounds. I slept peacefully on my very comfortable queen-sized bed each night.

Apart from a large wardrobe there was no-where else to store any of your things in the room, bedside cabinates were just covered tables with no draws. Handy. Staff were pleasant and friendly, no problem communicating, English was was spoken. The bed was quite hard, kept waking up with pins and needles!

You get to see lots of nice architecture and get a feel for the city whilst walking so would recommend the stroll.

That evening we enjoyed a superb meal in Le Basilica restaurant (out of the hotel, turn left and at the end of the road on your left) wonderful 3 course meal for 22 euro (or chose individually priced meals) great staff, food and service.

Our trip was planned by a French travel coach in Michigan; she evidently booked us \"the best room in the hotel\". It was room 802, on the top floor. The elevator goes only up to 7th floor, then you climb this cute curving staircase to the upper floor, where there are only two rooms. Our room was on the small side, and was elongated, BUT the whole wall facing the city was all large glass panels with two glass doors. We had a small terrace with a table and two chairs & lots of plants. Our view was unobstructed, and overlooked Paris, directly at the Eiffel Tower in the distance (not too far away, though). Down below was a very old cemetary with masoleums; very interesting but not creepy or scary. We could actually lay in bed every night, and watch the Eiffel tower all lit up- beautiful! The windows had really cool automatic metal rolling shades on the outside that rolled down at the press of a bedside button. Negatives about the hotel: the air conditioning did not work well. We could feel some slight cool air blowing, but not enought. We left the terrace doors open to get cool air in, but lots of street noise at night made it hard to sleep. Luckily (?), it turned cooler, so we didn't need the A/C. The maids did a mediocre job of cleaning; didn't replace shower gel when empty, and one day, we didn't have any washcloths. Place was never vacuumed during our entire stay. We ate at the Le Diapason restaurant on the 7th floor terrace on our first night. We had a reservation at 7:30pm (when they opened); the girl greeting us acted angry that we were there, and we were ignored for the first few minutes. We were seated with a view over Paris, but it was not as nice as the view from our own room. The service was poor and unattentive, and the food was just average; not the amazing meals we had eaten so far while in France. We did not eat any other meals there; we bought french pastries at the nearby boulangeries and ate them on our terrace for breakfast, and ate at nearby cafes for lunch. We found a WONDERFUL cafe at the end of the block behing the Terrass Hotel: it is called Le Basilic, and the food there was just as good as some of the fancy restaurants we had eaten at. We went there several times; I highly recommend the scallops with risotto. There were several markets nearby that we bought Evian water and Pepsi from & kept in our hotel room refrigerator, instead of paying their crazy mini-bar prices. On checkout, we came downstairs at 10am and told staff that our luggage needed to be brought down for our 10:30 taxi. Our taxi arrived at 10:25; no luggage yet, even though we had reminded them 3 times. Finally, with the taxi meter still running, our luggage was loaded at 10:45. The bellman looked surprised when we did not tip him this time; after all the taxi meter was already at 13 euros, and we did not want to reward him for this poor service. All in all, we would stay there again (only in room 802).

If you stay there, ask for Luis - there isn\u2019t a thing he can\u2019t help with. Check out went well and I have to say we were sorry to leave the place.

The only downside was that the air-con wasn't working. No mention of this as we checked in nor a note in the room, we were told by reception when we asked that it wasn't working and wouldn't be for a month. This could have been dealt with better (i.e a note in the room \"Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9, air-cons not working, but please have a drink on us in the bar this evening\").

Take a look at night, the whole of Paris is lit up before your eyes and on every hour the Eiffel Tour sparkles brilliantly for 5 mins, don't forget your bottle of wine or Champagne, sit back and enjoy the amazing view. We stayed in room 619 which had a partial view of yet another building and slight view of Paris. However the room was bright and clean, a little on the small side but the bathroom well made up for it, beautifully tiled with large bath, separate tiled semi circular shower and double sinks and fabulous towels. As it was Easter they did provide a chocolate souvenir presented in a beautiful box, thought at first it was a fridge magnet displaying the Eiffel Tower but the smell of chocolate gave it away. The hotel staff where very pleasant and helpful. We booked a table at the Le Diapason Restaurant within hotel and was pleasantly surprised and full after a delicious meal and dessert. The staff were very attentive and a two course meal for two with wine and coffee came to 77 Euros, which I thought was fair.

We stayed for two nights just last week and found the hotel to be very nice, and in a great location. We had room #801, one of two on the very top floor (you have to walk up a small circular staircase to get there) - it was a cozy, bright room with a terrific view of the Eiffel Tower and looking down on the Cemeterie Montmarte. We felt like we had a special room in the attic! As others recommended, I emailed the hotel to confirm the reservation, noting the special occasions (my bday and our 20th wedding anniversary) and asked for a view room; they responded a few days later granting that request. Unfortunately it was too windy to enjoy dinner on the terrass, which looked lovely (on the 7th floor with a sweeping view), and we didn't have breakfast at the hotel either, so can't comment on the food. There is a great patisserie just down the street on the same block as the hotel that had excellent pastries and baguette sandwiches. Yum, I'm still thinking about the almond pain au chocolate. We found a great restaurant up on the hill \"Le Relaise de Butte\" - one of the better meals we had in Paris all week! The only part of our experience that seems to differ from others is the service/friendliness of staff. We were checked in a very business like manner, there were other guests being handled so we were basically just handed our key (the bellman helped with the luggage). After that, every time we entered or left the hotel the front desk staff were heads-down working at their desks and never looked up or greeted us in any way, even when the lobby was empty. When my husband went down for a recommendation for my birthday dinner, asking for a nice restaurant, they directed us to two different bars down the street. We walked by both and it was clearly a bar scene - no food was even being served! The front door area was still under construction, it is supposed to be done in the next few days, it was no issue at all. However, when we asked about the internet, we were told that the WiFi doesn't work on the 8th floor and since they were having trouble with the cabled internet access they would only charge us 6 Euro to use the WiFi in the lobby (rather than complimentary per the other reviewer) instead of the usual 22/day!!! We came across a great little street on our last morning, wish we found it sooner - it's about 2 blocks up the side street (St. Joseph?) - turn right and you will find a few blocks of great produce, butcher, patisseries/chocolate shops, fabulous cheese shop - everything you would need to put together a delicious picnic!! One more thing - just this past month the City of Paris has installed over 10,000 \"rental bikes\" in stations around the city. You pay for a day/week/month pass from a kiosk, get a card, and use it to unlock a bike that you can use and then return to any other location. There are two brand-new stations just outside the door of the Terrass. Montmarte is pretty hilly but what a great option!

We had dinner in the hotel restaurant on the first night of our 4 night stay. The food was fabulous if a little expensive. We decided that we would economise on our lunches out and eat in the hotel restaurant every evening. We attempted to book for the next evening and were told that they were full for the next two evenings and closed on Sundays. This was not actually true. they closed for three evenings. So we were staying in a 4* hotel but unable to eat there in the evenings. We had booked for breakfast, and, after reading reviews here I was interested to see if we would be offered a cooked breakfast. The earlier comments were correct. It seems to be a closely guarded secret that a cooked meal is available. We were told 'it's a buffet'. I said \"actually we would prefer a cooked breakfast\". This was immediately agreed to. I asked for bacon scrambled eggs and tomatoes. They had run out of bacon (9.15 a.m.) but offered sausages instead. The food was beautifully cooked and presented. The weekend morning staff were very obliging but again no offer of cooked food was made, but quickly provided when we asked for it.They ran out of bacon on Monday too. How strange to do that twice in four days, but the sausages were an excellent replacement. Food was very disappointing in the other places nearby. We were not told that the hotel restaurant sometimes opens for lunch. If we had known we could have had a leisurely lunch after checking out while we waited for the time for our eurostar journey back. Instead we sat at a pavement cafe in a torrential thunderstorm eating Italian food. There is no way of walking into the restaurant at the moment without leaving the building and coming back in a door further down the road because work is being done to the passageway through. Monmarte in general was very dirty and down at heel. It is 20 years since we last visited and we won't bother to go back again. The staff were 'mixed' some very nice and really helpful 'Nicholas' and the female staff particularly, but most of the male staff were very 'Parisien' in thier attitudes(and not in a good way). Generally the hotel was good but little things could have made it better. Our luggage was stored for us after we checked out but it was filthy when it was brought back to us.

We booked the trip through Expedia.com and had chosen this hotel based primarily on the positive reviews we had read on this website and others, recommendations from previous travellers and the hotel's reputation. We definately weren't disappointed! A truly amazing hotel, beautifully located and quite a gem to find! Room - We had originally booked a standard double room for bed only but I emailed the hotel a few days before the trip to confirm the reservation. The manager got back to me within an hour and offered a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite for the special occasion. This was by far the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in, extremely spacious with air conditioning, mood lighting, stylish furnishings and the bathroom came complete with a steam shower which was truly appreciated after a tiring day's sightseeing! We did see a standard room on passing and can honestly say it was very very small. Try and get a junior suite if you are able to as it is worth it for the space and luxury. Breakfast - Again, the general consensus of the the hotel reviews on this and many other websites was to avoid the breakfast (which was very pricey) so we opted to find fresh croissants and orange juice from the many patisseries in the local area and took them back to the hotel. Hotel staff - The reception staff weren't exactly welcoming but polite enough - I am told this is typical of many french hotels. However, the porters and concierge were very warm and friendly, going out of their way to help us at every opportunity. Area - Montmartre is one of the most beautiful neighbourhoods in Paris, full of gorgeous patisseries, boulangeries, wine cellars and more. The vilage itself is very busy, full of locals and has a very typical french feel. The Sacre Coeur is a short walk from the hotel on the Montmartre Hill and definately worth a visit for one of the highest, most spectacular views of the city. Check-out - Our experience of the hotel until check out had been of a very high standard. However, it was tainted slightly on receiving a bill for the room and so we had to show our paperwork to prove it had already been paid for even though we'd given them this on check-in. On the bill there was also E50 euro's for items taken from the mini-bar. My boyfriend and I had not touched the mini-bar but their quickness of withdrawing the items did smack a bit of a try-on. Be careful for this as it has been mentioned in previous reviews. Value - On the whole, it was great value for the Eurostar. The Eurostar was by far the quickest, most pleasant way to travel and I would definately recommend this to anyone taking a short trip to Paris for it saves a lot of time and check-in is very quick and efficient.", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich", "Title": "\u201cGlad we chose the Terrass Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "NorwichJackal", "ReviewID": "UR7833561", "Content": "My fiance and I decided to go to Paris for the first time, in May this year for a week to celebrate my birthday. I spent hours on the internet looking at reviews and prices of hotels and finally chose the Terrass Hotel. I did not once regret it and would recommend the hotel to anyone going to Paris. OK, first of all, I think its fair to get some basics out of the way with! I read quite a few reviews from other people who have stayed in Paris stating that the size of the rooms are small. This is a known fact for Paris and therefore I do not think its fair to mark this hotel down for that reason. The same goes for price as anywhere in Paris is expensive compared to UK hotels. Having never been to Paris before, we were keen to chose somewhere which was clean, good value for money, easy to get to and was close to all the main attractions. It was on this basis we chose the Terrass Hotel and it did not dissappoint on any of these fronts. We booked 5 nights here for a standard double room and it cost us \u00a3650. In other reviews on this site, we read that requesting an outward view beforehand was a good idea. I decided to do this and e-mailed the hotel directly asking for an outward facing room, with a view of the Eiffell Tower. In less than 24 hours I received a reponse stating that my request had been granted and sure enough when we arrived, our room was as promised. My communication with the staff both via e-mail and face to face was excellent, they were always happy to help and give advice. The room itself was nicely furnished, clean and in a good condition. You could tell that the room had seen better days and had not recently been refurbished but this did not detract from the fact that is was of a good quality. From reading reviews about Paris hotels in general, the Terrass Hotel was no different to any other when it came to the bathroom. Yes, it was small, yes, there was no shower curtain, but what do you expect, it is Paris! The bathroom was spotless and towels, etc were replaced on a daily basis along with the room being cleaned. One word of warning is the size of the bath. I am 5ft 9 ins tall and struggled to move around in the bath as it was very small. Normally I would shower but there was no hook on the wall for the shower head (which again I think tends to be a trend in Paris!). If you are someone that likes your showers and are quite tall, it may be worthwhile checking this out before you book! The location of the hotel was fine. The nearest Metro was about a 10 mins walk away and the airport was about a 25 mins drive. On the subject of the airport, we booked a shuttle in advance to transport us, this cost us just over \u00a350. In hindsight, we probably would've saved money doing this by taxi but the shuttle was very efficient and gave us peace of mind. I would recommend not eating in the hotel restaurant considering the cost as many local restaurants/shops can be found nearby which are cheaper. We visited all sites and had a great time. We would recommend Paris to anyone and do highly rate this hotel. I did see some negative reviews of the Terrass but did not experience anything of this nature in my stay there.

The hotel staff were very welcoming, particularly the Consiege who spoke impeccable English and was very helpful, finding us a good restaurant and giving us a written introduction which secured a good table and excellent service on a busy Saturday night. The room was very clean, spacious, and had a good sized bathroom. We would probably select a superior room if we visited again as the view across Paris is wonderful (I went up to the Terrass - which is used as a restaurant in summer - the views are breathtaking and you can pick out all the major sites: Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, Des Invalides, etc). Breakfast was a buffet with a useful selection of cheeses, meats, breads, jams and conserves, and of course croissants and pain au chocolat. Freshly squeezed juices and copious amounts of coffee gave us a good start to the day. I would be loath to pay Euro 18 - 20 for this breakfast, and agree with a previous review that you could walk along the street to the Boulangerie and pick up croissants etc for breakfast to eat in your room. There are tea/coffee facilities in the rooms, with a small kettle, mug and sachets of tea and coffee - ask at reception for more cream they have a drawer full! The lasting memory of the Terrass will be the dinner we ate there (our Valentine treat). The food was wonderful - we selected the Euro 35 menu and expected only three courses - but the food kept coming, with dainty choux pastries whilst we were chosing, a delicious pumpkin appetiser, then on to the first course which was a beautifully cooked fresh pasta for me and the foie gras for him. This was followed by an interesting presentation of John Dory in batter in a light almost merange sauce for me and the veal - with a wonderfully light sauce for him. In between courses we we then offered home-made marshmallow and a beautifully presented caramel whilst we selected from the sweet menu. The Trilogy of extra light creme brulee was excellent. We staggered upstairs afterwards and will try to lose the extra pounds later! Total cost with wine was Euro 100 and well worth it too. The chef is excellent and should be congratulated on the presentation and content of all dishes. Nearby are some interesting bistro's - again you can ask for a recommendation from reception or go your own way - walk down to Abbesses and look at the interesting Art Deco Metro, then wander round this area and choose a bistro - we paid around Euro 60 for a wonderful three course meal - no need to pay any more here. La Terrass is very close to buses and the Metro (either Blanche or Place de Clichy - and even Abbesses if you don't want to walk up the hill). Take time to explore the bohemian area of Montmatre, and the nearby cemetery. The hotel is very close to the Moulin Rouge - just down the hill, buy your tickets on line and early (or again ask at reception they just may be able to help you - no guarantees though). All-in-all a very memorable experience, and one that we will certainly repeat - although next time we will use Eurostar rather than fly as the Gare de Nord is so close to the hotel - only a couple of stops away on the Metro.

After extensively searching Tripadvisor hotel reviews I liked the look of this hotel. I booked via Eurostar package (the best rate for this hotel). I initially upgraded from a standard room to a superior room and had requested a room with a view, but was told on arrival that the superior rooms were on the courtyard side of the hotel. So if you do want a room with a view be aware of this. However, I was not dissappointed with the room. It was gorgeous, albeit smaller than I had expected from the pictures but still elegant, clean and a little piece of luxury. Our room (double) had a magnificant bathroom that could be accessed from either side of the room with a bath, separate shower and two sinks. Our friends had a twin room on a different floor, again very tastefully decorated, with a corner bath. Both rooms had products, clean towels, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, tea/coffee making facilities (if your English/Irish dont add milk to the tea, its better without, or better still take a couple of teabags with you), lovely little touches all round to make your stay pleasant and comfortable. The staff were excellent and couldnt be more helpful. We needed to get to the other side of Paris for an excursion and as it was a wet friday night we needed a taxi. They fell over themselves trying to get us a taxi, three phones dialling and even had someone in the street trying to hail a taxi. Now thats what I call service. Breakfast! Expensive if not included. We chose to have breakfast on the Sunday as we were returning early, 18 euros, be aware that this price includes cooked eggs (whichever way you want them) it is not very clear that you can order from the waitress and it is included, we helped ourselves to the buffet and ordered scrambled eggs and bacon. My friend had omelette. If you do not want breakfast dont order just tea, 5 euros!! The hotal reception is quite grand and has internet access if your interested in that. The bar is very expensive!!!!!! The location suited us, its not far from the Moulin Rouge or the Sacre Coeur. We loved it as our fist time in Paris, and if you want style/comfort than the Terrass is definately worth the 4 stars.

We took a room on the second floor, which afforded no view. With the benefit of hindsight, and the other reviews on here, perhaps we would have requested a better room. That said, on Arc weekend, our choice may have been more restricted. The room was very clean, and of quite a high standard. We were pleased with the level of accomodation. We booked via 'Hotels Direct' and did so on the basis of board and \"full cooked breakfast\". The only element of the breakfast that was cooked was the provision of eggs \"fried, scrambled or boiled\". This information, akin to a state secret, was only elicited after an enquiry of staff, and an observation of others. This was not a problem, and in truth the breakfast fayre was adequate, but \"full cooked breakfast\" signifies something rather different to those of Irish, English or American origin. Given the number of restaurants and bars in Montmartre/Sacre Couer, the Hotel Restaurant was extremely expensive, and we did not use it during our stay. We did stray into the bar on one evening only, but a cognac and a gin and tonic at a total cost of 21 Euros was enough to persuade us that better value was to be had elsewhere. The minibar in the room looked tempting enough, but considering that a 3 cl bottle of cognac would have cost us 7 Euro, as opposed to a 20 cl bottle (same brand) for Euro 4.50 at a shop directly over the road, this was not a facility we used either. Thestaff were unfailingly polite, and room cleaning was excellent, but on checkout, the receptionist did attempt to charge us for minibar items. The quickness of withdrawal when we challenged this smacked of a \"try on\", but this was a minor issue. All in all, the Terrass was worthy of it's 4 star rating, but we would shop around (and perhaps demand more) if staying in that sector of Paris again.", "Date": "October 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, ENGLAND", "Title": "\u201cNice but Dim!!\u201d", "Author": "FIRESTONE", "ReviewID": "UR5826184", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from 11 September, and booked via Eurostar.

This restaurant was one of the highlights of our European trip, and made an amazing last night. 3) The view! 4) Location is great if you want to be in Montmarte. Personally, we liked the location of our other hotel much better (Hotel de Varenne, in the 7th) My only complaint is that this hotel is extremely over priced. Not only are the rooms extremely expensive (even in the off season), but it seems that at every corner they\u2019re trying to gouge you for money. Every other hotel that we stayed at in Europe had included breakfast. In the room there was a door hanger for ordering breakfast. It allowed you to select coffee of tea, Orange or grapefruit juice, etc. Then there was a section below that included other breakfast options, with prices that you could pay for to include in your breakfast. Since the prices were high, we just stayed with the continental breakfast: Two coffees, Two orange juices, and a couple of small croissants. Upon checkout, the lady informed me that this breakfast was 18E each! 40E for a continental breakfast! That\u2019s like $60 Canadian\u2026wow\u2026that\u2019s what I mean by \u2018sour taste\u2019.

The hotel has recently been refurbished, all the rooms are individually designed but with a general theme, which tends to be a bit chintzy. The arrangement of the bathrooms in some rooms can be idiosyncratic, but again clean modern and characterful. The new restaurant is great and during the summer you can also eat on the open terrace on the top floor, which has fabulous views over Paris. The hotel has a range of rooms, which do vary greatly in size, the ones at the front are very large and have the great view of Paris, the ones at the back can be quite small (although not unusually so) and look over the rooftops of Montmartre. I think this view has just as much character, but I can see how you could be disappointed if you were expecting the panoramic view, so I\u2019d ask to see the room first. Strangely the prices don\u2019t seem to reflect the size of room. We have also stayed there as a family, and the suites are great; they have siding doors dividing them into a bedroom and living room.
