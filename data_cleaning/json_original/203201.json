The lobby and dining areas were much more updated, however, and we enjoyed the breakfast selection, (although eggs anywhere in Italy are not the same) The location is a block from the main train and bus station, so getting around the city is ideal from here, plus you are on one of the main avenues with many destinations within a nice walk.

Make sure you get a refurbished room! The first room I had was so depressing that I just wanted to leave, it was so small I could barely fit inside. I am not a large person by any means but the bed was so tiny I could hardly turn over. The only saving grace was the roof top bar where we had a fantastic lunch (though I mainly remember to champagne). I was very nervous knowing I was coming back to stay here in a couple of days time that I nearly booked another hotel. Thankfully when I checked back in I got an upgrade! What a difference, this room was nearly 5 times the size with a large double bed. What a difference this upgrade made, well worth doing if you get the option. Breakfast is good, however be aware that this hotel caters for a lot of tour groups so if you have an early or urgent depature you night want to get to the restaurant early.

Check-in was pleasant. Originally were offered a 6th floor room facing a small street, but after I mentioned my requests at booking time for an 8th floor room they offered me a viewing of both the 6th and 8th floor rooms. The 8th floor room had large french windows with a bit of a view of roof tops, so we took that. Room size was large with high ceilings with broad corridors and lobby on each floor for a European hotel. It got pretty warm during the daytime in the room with the sun coming in the morning thru the french windows, but we were mostly out during daytime. My wife felt this was somewhat of an issue, although by midnight it was cool enough to need sheets to cover ourselved during sleep. The cot supplied for our 21 month old boy was a bit quaint and small with metal railings without padding, fortunately he didnt bang his head on it during the stay! He really enjoyed running in the long corridors on our floor daily, mainly people free when we had him out. The breakfast was average with good cappucino out of a machine being the highlight. Breakfast room however was a very pleasant traditionally done up place with a lot of character, so were the lobby areas on the ground floor with a touch of grandness. I read a couple of reviews about the hotel being dated, but I think they missed the point of deliberately traditional decor - facilities were all up to date and well maintained as was the building itself, although a number of older features from the date of the original build were carefully preserved. Staff in the breakfast room were always smiley and friendly; at reception were always polite and answered questions reasonably clearly in English although not always smiley. Highlight was piedmont style beef stew with potatoes on the roof top restaurant with view of the city on our first night - a touch on the expensive side, but was delicious. Another highlight was the room cleaning service, which was daily and excellent. Other highlights appreciated were the bathroom facilities including bidet. Although we had a bath in ours, I felt I re-discovered the pleasures of showing with their excellent fixed shower, and had only one bath. Also the free wi-fi was appreciated, we used it on my wife's iphone, although we had to get a new password every couple of days. We ate 3 nights in 2 restaurants in a nearby street with good food in one and average to good food in the other, both at reasonable prices (\u20ac40 approx for 2 with house wine or beer included). Main negative was the city tax at the end of the stay: \u20ac30 was charged - we were not made aware of this by the commercial hotel booking site we used which implied all charges were paid for, and the hotel itself made us aware of this at the time of check out and not before. Worth spending for one dinner on the top floor restaurant, with night lights of Rome to look over - only dont expect to see any of the monuments lit up as too many surrounding buildings around the monuments to catch a glimpse from this area.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean and comfortable with great views from the bar on floor 10\u201d", "Author": "Skier0", "ReviewID": "UR127944571", "Content": "We checked into this hotel having left another hotel which we had been booked into by a travel company, and spent 2 nights enjoying the comfort and spaciousness of the Mediterraneo.

The double room was nice and clean, but the bed very hard. Warm and cold water were connected incorrectly, but it was not a big deal. To shower required a bit of gymnastic. There was a shower in the bath tub, but the problem was that the shower head was mounted on the wall without a house and it was placed a 160 cm up on the wall. I am 170 cm and with the bathtub being vaulted on the sides I had to bend backwards with bent knees to get my hair under the shower. We were laughing trying to imagine someone much taller do the same thing. Breakfast was okay for us and probably more so for someone who loves bread. We would have preferred if they had had fresh sliced fruits They did have a fruit basket though. The cleaning of the room consisted of pulling up our cover (not making the bed) and changing the hand towels in the bathroom. We did not care, but still... we booked this hotel through Agoda and payed 208 euro per night.

The hotel is right across the street from Termini Station the main train station in Rome so getting to and from the Airport was easy and more affordable than a taxi. Bus, metro and trolley stops are all right across the street. You might think there would be lots of noise in the room but the windows are double plated so noise is not an issue. Air conditioning worked well. Breakfast was really good with breads, cereals, cold meats, cheeses, scrambled eggs, bacaon and more. The lobby is large and there is free wifi as well as computers to use in the lobby. Lots of good restaruants to eat at around the area...again not really an area with charm but still very good food. If the hotel has a downside its the beds...they are hard. Pillows are good but the mattresses are hard so if you are very particular about soft mattresses then this isn't the place for you. One recommendation. If you are going to do bus tours around the city use the Green Line Tour company. We used 2 different companies and liked Green Line better. They were more organized, with newer buses, and right accross the street from the hotel.

The hotel is in an ideal location...2 blocks from Roma Termini. The hotel is rated as a 4 star..but it certainly is not a 4 star by North American standards.

So if you're in a hurry...you will likely need to take the stairs which we were required to do on a number of occasions. This hotel has 10 stories and we were on the 5th floor. The first time we used the shower...the water went up to our calves because the drain was plugged. The hand towels...are not really towels..they are more like a thin dish cloth...and if you're looking for a face cloth...forget it, there are none. I called downstairs to ask for a disposable razor, as I forgot mine. Even though they advertise the fact that they will provide you with disposable razors, shaving cream, toothbrush, toothpaste etc...if you have forgotten them, I was told by the front desk that I could buy those things across the street. After a lengthy conversation..they finally agreed to bring one up to my room. As we were on business, we needed to iron some clothes and asked for an iron and ironing board...something I expect from a 4 star hotel. We were told that irons were not allowed in the room because \"it may blow up\"..I can only assume they were referring to the circuit breakers. We were told that if we needed something ironed..they had staff to do it for a fee. There is no way I was willing to pay someone to iron a pair of pants...something I do on a regular basis. The roof terrace restaurant only has 4 tables to accommodate people that want a drink at the end of the night....it's a lovely view but you certainly pay for it. The buffet breakfast is average.

The gym included a treadmill and multi-weight machine. Elevators are slow; on one occasion the door opened on the 6th floor and would not shut for an unknown reason. Cons: Rates seemed high if you don't have an Italian speaker who can negotiate a better deal. No tourist sights in immediate vicinity. Bed was not particularly comfortable. The desk was a bit difficult to use since it was a wooden fold-out. There were limited outlets and the internet required constant attention with entering access codes.

Perhaps I should have done some research regarding my dinner choices, but my opinion is that any reasonably priced restaurants in Rome are really pretty lousy. 3 slices of pizza with sausage (hot dog slices) and 2 ice teas priced out at 28 Euro in a place around the corner from the hotel. So beware of the tourist oriented snack bars and restaurants. Really a step down after our stay in Paris.

Because we were in a group of about 40 people, our check in was with our group leader, not the front desk, so I can't say anything about that. The location is great - just a block from the Termini station and on Via Cavour. Easy walking distance to several sights and there are lots of restaurant options close by. Oh, and I have to say that while other reviewers said there were \"shady\" people hanging around the hotel - we never encountered anyone even close to \"shady.\" Let's start with the lobby. Very impressive! Lots and lots of marble...and a very large sitting area with chairs and couches. There is also a bar on this level (never got anything there) and the breakfast area (I'll get back to that.) Our room was 403 and all I can say is \"blah.\" While they were clean and well maintained, they just didn't have any life or personality to them. The best part was the bathroom...which looked to be newly remodeled. It was very nice - but a shame they haven't put any effort into updating the sleeping area. We had a \"king\" bed - so two beds pushed together - and it was hard. I thought it was terrible, my boyfriend thought it was fine. Linens were a tad scratchy to me. There was about three feet on each side of the bed and I'd say about 5 feet at the end of the bed. There are, 2 nightstands and a desk and chair - as well as a built-in closet in the room. I took a few pics with my phone, so they aren't that great, but I'll include them. I went down to see my mom's single room and yowza....that was SMALL!! A postage stamp may be a little big bigger than those rooms! Other than the grand lobby and the updated bathroom, they have updated the staircases - YES, the staircases....with this lovely tile. Not sure why money was spent there and not in the rooms, but it does make the time you're going down the steps more enjoyable (with sarcasm.) The breakfast room was an okay size, but was always very full. Options were the usual...lots of breads, pastries and cereals, coffee and juices, meats and cheeses, as well as eggs and bacon for the hot option. The staff was kind enough to get me a to-go box one morning when I was running late and had to catch my bus. They let me take a few croissants with me, which I thought was really nice. One of the best features of this hotel is the lovely rooftop bar/restaurant. We didn't eat up there (others in the group did and said it was good) but we did go up and have a drink and take some photos. Though we didn't have a problem with this, several people in our group said that they called the front desk (or stopped by) and requested a wake-up call. Many didn't receive them and one said it came an hour later than they requested. So beware....

The only sad thing was that we had two french doors with balconies, only they had a metal covering 3/4 of the way down as a safety feature. The light still was able to shine through, but it is sad that they can no longer be used for what they were originally intended for. It would have been nice to cuddle on the balcony and enjoy the signts of Rome. Breakfast was included with our room and we were happy to see a nice spread of european breads, hard boiled eggs, cold cuts, fruit etc. They also had a very cool cappuccino machine.

The Mediterraneo is just 1.5 blocks from the main Metro station (called Termini) where one can catch both Metro lines (they cross here) and a taxi at the taxi stand. The neighborhood was fine right up until I got back to my room each night at 11 PM - not crowded late at night but it always appeared perfectly safe. The hotel room for two people was larger than many European hotels that I have stayed in, with a double bed, a couple of large chairs and a desk. The bedspread was a classic. I was impressed that the room was always kept very clean. My room on the eighth floor had nice clean polished hardwood floors. The bathroom was fine with a well functioning shower. The room came with a very good buffet breakfast in the back of the lobby level. It included a Cappuccino machine and fresh Italian bread plus the usual basic foods, such as scrambled eggs, bacon, hard boiled eggs, cheeses, deli meats, great fresh fruit, and juice. There is a rooftop restaurant with a live singer in the evening. The restaurant has a nice view. I ordered plain food not on the menu and it tasted pretty plain. Although the lobby seemed a bit old and run down, the rooms were recently updated - dark in color, with the necessary features, including modern air conditioning which could get down to 69 degrees. Efficient wireless internet is available, but expensive. The room contained a small safe. It was great that I had a refrigerator in the room. The television set had only a single English station - CNN - but many stations in other languages. The only definite minus was the long wait each time we asked the bell staff to hail a taxi. After a few days we realized it was faster to walk to the Metro station and get one in the taxi line. The front desk staff were slow but pleasant. The check in process seemed old fashioned but in a good way. Shopping around the hotel was OK, but not great. There were not many elegant stores nearby. If you walk out the door and go about four blocks to the right, you will see Buffetti on the other side of the street, which is a stylish office supply store with nice Italian leather office materials. Ask the staff for directions to the nearest large grocery store, which is about six blocks away and is a completely stocked store in the basement of an office building. The hotel is great for Metro travel but if you want to hang out in the charming historic district, then expect to walk about 30 minutes or take a taxi each time you want to get there. The Rome Metros are very easy to navigate and you can go from the main station near the hotel to the Coliseum or to the Spanish Steps or the Vatican by Metro. This is a very nice hotel and I would probably stay here again because of its central location near the main Metro station and because it has everything most travelers need, including a nice breakfast.", "Date": "September 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cVery good - would stay again\u201d", "Author": "cpyoon", "ReviewID": "UR19585383", "Content": "We were warned that European hotels aren't quite the same as those in North America.

The room's have safes and stocked fridge but we took out their items and put in our own groceries and my sensitive films. Bathrooms nice with tub/shower and own hair dryer and soap/caps/shampoo/shoe shine. Nitpicks:Termini area is dirty and homeless sleep on sidewalk at night, pickpockets that aim for the elderly and unwary, traffic noise outside all windows until about 11pm and starting at 6am, room was deodorized to cover previous smokers before but was gone after a few hours and not an issue because no matter what you do you'll suck cigarette smoke before the day is over (I guarantee!) because almost everybody in Italy smokes for some reason, TV barely functional and only CNN was available in english. Walls are pretty thin but not in every room from what I gathered from cleaning staff -pretty much hit or miss on this one. We picked this for price and location convenience to Termini for access to Fiumicino. It's 10min from Colliseum by foot and about 1.5mi worst case to the furthest of all other sites which is good because subway (Metro) doesn't run through the city - only the buses and taxis do. Buses are your friend - learn about them before you go and expect heavy commuter crowds at 5pm. I shoot pictures day and night and never felt unsafe in the streets - even with homeless people around the Termini at 2am in the morning (keep in mind that if anybody should worry it should be me because I carry and use about $11K in professional gear). The lobby is beautiful and my daughter asked if we were in Bill Gate's hotel because it was very nice :o). Car rental companies inside Termini made easy access for us picking up and dropping off our rental. I wouldn't stay here if you are accustomed to paying $400-$500 nightly for a hotel or if you think a Motel 6 for $59 is too expensive because this isn't your style. It's more for everybody else in between and the prices for booking should be checked online and at the hotel for best rate. I would stay here again but others may opt for a location slightly closer to Vatican side of town if they don't like walking or public transportation.

We went checking other hotel but I felt most welcomed here even though it is big hotel. Finally, location was super convenient!! Roma city itself is very easy to walk everywhere, so, in the morning, start to walk from the hotel, and when you get tired of walking around, just step on to the bus or subway to go back to the hotel. I usually don't like getting on the bus in unfamiliar land because it is confusing about destination, but in this case I loved it because most buses go back to the central station, there are many bus stations through out the Roma city conveniently located around sightseeing area that is sometime located far from a subway station (ex, Pantheon) and the hotel was closest to the station. Also, you can enjoy the view while riding. Less walking distance compared to getting on the subway even thought the subway entrance is a block away. You will appreciate it after the long sightseeing walk. A Internet spot (1/2 hour is 1 Euro) was 1 block away, Snack stores were half block away.

Thanks for letting us know!! We were then woken at 7am the next morning by workmen hammering away at the wall next to our room, when we complained about this to the reception they told us they were unaware of any work being carried out in the building but would try to find out and ask them to stop. The work stopped for precisely the time it took us to get back to sleep and then started again!! We then made another complaint and asked to be moved - they moved us to a room right next to the hotel lifts, at which point we decided to give up on sleeping and go to breakfast. The breakfast selection looked pretty standard for an Italian hotel but after piling some scrambled eggs onto the plate we found that it was cold and inedible. The next day we tried to order a snack from room service and were told that the only room service that was available was ham and cheese toasted sandwich - i asked for just cheese but apparently this was too much trouble. We said yes anyway and it took 50 minutes to be delivered to the room. We then asked for a taxi to take us to our reservations and were told it would be along in 20 minutes. We asked them to cancel this so we could make our own way as we were running slightly late for our dinner reservations and hailed a cab outside the hotel - we were then stopped form getting in the taxi as they would not cancel the taxi that would be along in 20 minutes!!

It was totally gross and unacceptable. So I packed and asked for an adjustment in my rate and a change in rooms. The woman at the front desk was incredulous and said that she would have to send someone to confirm the problem, but that there would be no adjustment in my rate. When I pressed her for a different room, she gave me the key to the room next door immediately. My new room was a smoker's room (I'm a non-smoker), but the bathroom was dry and appeared to be of a more recent vintage, so I decided that living with the stale cigarette smell would be more prudent than throwing the dice again for another bathroom.

There is a computer with free internet available. Also, you have a great view of St. Peter's Basilica from the Rooftop Garden Bar.
