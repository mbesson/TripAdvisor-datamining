It was very convenient to stay in the same hotel, but I was disappointed with the overall standard of the hotel. The food was very good & reasonably priced. The hotel is close to both an s-bann train station and a bus stop that goes into the part of the city tourists want to visit, so its location isn't a disaster. It is quite far from the airport - over 30 euros in a taxi. They were also very willing to allow late check out (4pm) if the room wasn't booked for the following night. The rooms didn't have an electric kettle - despite having an area designed for this. There were also no complementary toiletries - a large bottle of shampoo was in the shower and liquid soap next to the basin (but no soap in the shower). I felt this was rather cheap given the over 100 euros per night charge. Breakfast was a comprehensive buffet, but as a vegetarian I was somewhat surprised that the hot food consisted of scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs and then lots of bacon & sausages - no tomatoes, no mushrooms, no potatoes or baked beans even! The other major let-down was the internet - 3 euros per hour that was billed directly to your room. My frustration is that there was no timer provided, nor did it automatically cut off after 1 hour, so if you didn't watch the time VERY carefully you would easily end up being charged an extra 3 euro. Of course this also meant that you can't use your \"hour\" in pieces - once you login, your 3 euros is gone, even if you are online for just 10 minutes. Internet was provided via a cable in your room or wifi (same price) in the lobby area.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGood convention hotel\u201d", "Author": "Indy_traveler-111", "ReviewID": "UR124754565", "Content": "This was my second stay at this property in about two years.

The reason I left was twofold - 1. the bed was like a brick (all the beds in the hotel are the same when I asked) 2. I was traveling to the center of town to go to museums and eat so thought I might as well save my money and commute to Estrel rather than from Estrel. The hotel is near Somnalee station. This is on the S41-S42 S-bahn lines but not directly connected to the airports or the centre of Berlin. To get here you have the change at Treptower or Ostkreusz. Somnalee station has its issues - there are 2 exits - there is no sign to the Estrel Hotel on the platform or anywhere (you need the North exit). Upon reaching the street, I passed a number of men smoking and drinking. I turned around to find them harassing 2 female conference attendees who had just got off the same train. I walked back and escorted the ladies by the men who continued to make offense remarks and sounds. One of the ladies was particularly shaken. The hotel is not far away, you turn under the railway and walk 150m east over a river and turn left. There is no pedestrian crossing so its a game of chicken getting across the busy road. Once at the hotel, the entry way has a covered entrance but unfortunately this is aligned so that if you step out from it, you risk death under the wheels of a taxi! There is also the added charm of people smoking right at the entrance. The check in was routine. The room was large and quiet. Shower and storage OK. The bed was hard, very hard. I remade the bed with a blanket/comforter from house keeping to try and soften it. The food was schizophrenic. The conference food (?from caterer) was actually very good. I went to eat dinner the first night and this was really disappointing. I ordered a soup (OK) but the schnitizel was grossly over cooked and the edges were inedible. I mentioned this to the server in English and German and he just smiled at me and shrugged. There alcohol selection and pricing was good. I anaesthetised myself with a glass of Spanish red and called a friend, who was heading the Quasimodo's jazz club near Zoo Garten station. I wrapped up against rain and cold and headed back to the station. The same group of men are playing spin the bottle mit Polizei, I skirted them. I got to the club earlier than expected and walked the area, looking at hotel options. As I had a business meeting next day, I took my sore back and luggage with me and checked into another place.

If there is ever another convention that I must attend here you can be sure as hell I will not be staying at this crap hole.

The hotel is very large but manages to keep a friendly feel. There are several wings, with up to 18 floors. I had a single (twin) room, which was clean and pleasant, on floor 12 of wing 2. Not too large, and nothing special, with simple modern furniture and the usual facilities. However, there is no safe and there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. There was a mini-bar, but no complimentary water. Also, this was not automatically re-stocked during my 3-night stay, and I ran out of bottled water on the last day (but there is a shop in the main atrium where this is sold at half the price). There was a hairdryer in the bathroom, but the liquid soap by the sink and liquid body wash/shampoo with conditioner were nothing special, so I was glad I'd taken my own. Unfortunately, my air conditioning didn't work, and some other delegates in my wing made the same comment. The hotel was quite warm, so the window in my room stayed open for the duration. There were plenty of electrical sockets available, and internet access (not wireless) was \u20ac3 per hour or \u20ac24 for 24 hours in the room. It was easy to set up and convenient. The breakfast areas in the main atrium were never too busy, and there is a very good choice. The staff were friendly and efficient.

I travelled with my wife who was a delegate at a conference. We paid extra for a larger room with more facilities. What these 'extra' facilities were we could not tell. The room was clean but very bare and only furnished with very basic cheap furniture First thing I noticed - NO ROOM SAFE - nowhere to keep a laptop or other valuables. The reception staff said we could keep valuables in the reception safe - just imagine 1000 delegates all trying to keep their laptops in one safe. In addition the hotel specifically stated that no resposibility would be taken for any valuables not in the hotel safe. The beds were adequate but the pillows were paper-thin - I needed three which were equal to one normal pillow. The towels were so thin and worn - a bit like trying to dry yourself on tissue paper. There were no normal toiletries - shampoo/conditioner /bar of soap. etc. even water for taking tablets had to be paid for at expensive minibar prices The sink plug did not retain water because it did not fit. The shower head was broken and hanging loose. There is no facility in the room to make a cup of tea or coffee - and there is no room service. There are no spa or swimming facilities. Food and drink are extremely expensive (the bar prices doubled during the period of the conference) At checkout they tried to charge us for using PayTV and argued with us to the point of shouting - quite disgraceful behaviour. They claimed that everybody tries to pretend that PayTV was not used. I know that it was not used at any time we were in the room - perhaps the management need to investigate their staff or their PayTV software. The location of the hotel is in a very undesirable area - you would not dream of going for a walkabout at night or even during the day. Security was nonexistent - anybody could enter the building and go anywhere to any floor in the hotel. The conference organisers had described this hotel as being an award winning hotel - somebody must be joking! Anyone thinking of staying at this hotel I would recommend to reconsider - there are far better and cheaper hotels in the centre of Berlin. e.g. 'The Swissotol' in the centre which is excellent in every way I hope this review may help anyone to avoid the experiences we encountered.", "Date": "November 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cSimply the Best!\u201d", "Author": "bobsmith465", "ReviewID": "UR21173967", "Content": "The Estrel is simply my favorite hotel.

The breakfast was excellent and in comfortable surroundings with items restocked by friendly staff. As a general comment regarding all our 9 hotels, the pillows were always so thin, or were so soft they ended up thin, that we always requested extras. They were delivered promptly at the Estrel. After long journey we were disappointed to see there was no tea making facilities in the room (this was the same in 8 out of the 9 hotels we used). Considering the hotel was massive I was surprised that it did not have a large gym and swimming pool. The isolated position of the hotel outside town means you do not have convenient access to the city for a stroll or to sample the nightlife in the evenings. This was not quite so important for older people, like myself, who only stopped 2 nights after tiring days of sightseeing. However, I would not stay here for a longer holiday. We did travel back to the hotel on the U-Bahn on one day and found it quite easy with one change required.
