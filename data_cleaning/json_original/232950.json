We had the Red Room, which faces the water (not the Grand Canal, but darn close) with a wonderful, long balcony. It's a suite, and was plenty big enough for the 4 of us (2 kids slept togeter in the sofa bed). You are a 5 minute walk from San Marcos and there is a vaparatto stop right in front of the hotel. The hotel also has it's own dock, so very easy getting to/from airport or train station as water taxi can take you right to the hotel door--a real plus! The front desk staff was extremely helpful with restaurant recommendations, reservations, directions, sightseeing tips. Breakfast each morning, included in the rate, was lovely, adn we also received a free glass of Prosecco in the bar :) It's not cheap, but then again, nothing in Venice is! It was great just to be able to relax and watch it all go by from the balcony.

This was our first time to Venice and since we had only a short time there, I wanted a hotel that was near all the sights. I researched a lot of hotels and I am so glad that I selected this hotel. From the moment we arrived by boat from the airport, the service was excellent. The staff was very helpful, provided us with a map and suggestions on where to eat and how to get around. Our room was very nice with a separate sitting area, large bathroom and the room was very clean. They gave us a complimentary cocktail which we enjoyed on the rooftop terrace. There is an incredible view on the terrace and in the warm weather it must be nice to sit outside and relax. The hotel provides you with an excellent breakfast of eggs, cereals, rolls, meats, juices, pastries and coffee. The hotel also provides a complimentary shuttle to Murano, the glass factory where you watch them make the glass and then you can walk around the town. The hotel suggested that we also see Burano and told us how to use the water taxi. It was a nice trip and very easy to do.This hotel is about 2 blocks from San Marco, so you can walk everywhere. Venice is a beautiful city and this is a great hotel.

The hotel is an old building on the Grand Canal near the Vaporetto station. As such it is ideally positioned for St Marks Square and transport. There is noise from the large numbers of tourists going from the boats to the centre but this dies down around 9 pm. However, the rooms although large have small bathrooms which are in some need of refurbishment. The room maid failed to replace shampoo etc on 3 of 4 days and did not replace towels on one day. This was resolved with a word at the desk. The public areas have gone beyond being typical of a Venice palazzio to dowdy and having stayed in other Venice hotels of a similar grade, the hotel is in need of an update whilst maintaining the character. Breakfast is in 2 small rooms and on the days we were there, the pleasant staff could not keep up with the guests. Tables were uncleared, the bread and other food ran out and the 2 rooms were completely full. The restaurant is on the top floor and on the 2 occasions we went up there it was empty. There is really no pretence that this is meant to be a quality restaurant as it appears to available only to guests.

The room was tidied while we were at dinner, sweets and a card with the weather forecast for the following day left on our pillows. The breakfast buffet was excellent, extensive and constantly replenished. Temperatures in February can be chilly, but the heating system was easily adjusted to either heat or cool the room. Locanda Vivaldi is centrally located on Riva Degli Schiavoni, four minutes walk from the Piazza San Marco . We walked to a restaurant near the Rialto in 15 minutes and to another near the Arsenale in five. We tried other good restaurants in the little streets behind the hotel. Opposite is the San Zaccaria water bus stop. Room 209 has a view of the lagoon, overlooks Riva Dei Greci\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional Venetian apartments and provides a fascinating glimpse of the comings and goings of the carabinieri from the police station opposite. Fans of Donna Leon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s books will realise that the Questura is further up this canal. At this time of year the streets empty quickly in the evenings and nights were noise free. From around six Venice begins to waken up. Water buses and other boats come and go with varying degrees of noise.

It is indeed noisy on the front but the view is worth it. We couldn't have air con switched on ( I asked but it had to be controlled by the reception?) so the second night we slept with the window closed and the shutters down. This was probably not a bad thing as we were bitten by Mosquitos in the room (found and killed). I only mention this (not the hotels fault of course!)as I would never have thought to travel with repellent/bite stuff at the end of October and want to pass on the info.

I went into the kitchen and saw a gaggia Machine and realised that one has to ask for an espresso to get a decent cup in the morning which we did. The staff are all very pleasant but I think they should throw another person at the breakfast room to improve service which was unbelievably slow eg our hot drinks didn't arrive until we had finished breakfast on both mornings. The room was clean, bathroom compact but clean and well stocked, good towels /heated rails etc. We enjoyed our complimentary Bellini watching the sun go down on our first night.

The airconditioning is used perhaps for one minute in each five therefore the guests are very uncomfortable as the cooling settings are probably incorrectly programmed. One member of staff is responsible for taking orders, bringing those orders to the table and then clearing them.

It was getting hot, cold, hot, cold, etc. We spoke with the front desk and they were happy to try to fix it, switch rooms anything we wanted, they were very accomodating. Next, the A/C - it was awful! Having just come from Florence, our A/C there was terrific, here is was lousy. The first two of three nights we slept with the window open, it was cooler outside, than in - except, it was very humid. This defeated the point of the blackout shade in the morning. The last day they offered a fan to us, which was helpful, but we should have gotten it earlier. Apparently, the A/C there does not dehimidify the rooms so we were cooler, yet still sticky. Our main contact Simone was very helpful in trying to accomdate us any way he could, he was really trying - the night guy barely spoke English, was on the phone most of the time and did not really care about helping or doing much of anything else, other than talking on the phone. When we had a late night issue, he was so unhelpful, I actually went to the hotel next door for some assistance - they were very accomodating. The breakfast was very nice.

Not a big deal as the room itself is nicely appointed with a good selection of hot and cold food in the buffet (this was one of the rare hotels in Italy that actually served \"toast\"!) As for the rooms, we booked a standard \"double\" through Expedia. I found it fairly pricey considering how tiny the room actually is. And unlike most other hotels we stayed at in Italy, a \"double\" here does not have a king bed but actually has a double which is even smaller than a queen. The bathroom had only a small standup shower that was quite \"tight\" and I'm only 5'9 and of average build. Someone who was taller or bigger than me would truly have a tough time in there!

It was so romantic to arrive by side canal and dismbark onto the hotel's private jetty. The only surprise was to find a carabineri station on the other side of the canal!

Breakfast was fine, and the service (from a bloke who doubled as the hotel's porter during the rest of the day) kind and attentive.

Venice is everything we could have expected and more. Just walk and walk ... then when you need to get back to the hotel, find a water bus.

My wife was irate that she would be staring at thousands of people. The hotel moved us to a very small room on the floor above. The room was the size of our master bathroom at home. We paid 420 Euros, which is $621 per night at today's exchange rate. I asked if the rate would be lower because this was a smaller room, but was told it was in the same category becuase this is a \"16th Century Villa and all the rooms are different\". The bottom line is if you want to stay in Venice be prepared to pay double most other major cities in the world for smaller rooms or do not expect to have a view of anything. Either you pay $1,000 per night or more for a room with a view in a luxury hotel or you downgrade to a two or three star hotel with no view if you are on a budget. The hotel includes breakfast but most flights to the US leave early in the morning, so you will not be able to use the breakfast when you leave.

It is actually a 4-star quality hotel as opposed to the other one I tried the last time. This was my second hotel on this trip after one night in an ant-infested hotel on the Grand Canal. I stayed in the Vivaldi for 6 nights and did not encounter any major problems. The shower was tiny and I cannot imagine how big people can use it but it was always spotless so I didn't mind bumping my arms on clean walls now and again. I did report that the water went hot and cold over and over again during showers and it was never fixed but it was summer so the cold water did not bother me too much. I heard guests from 101 and 102 had the same problems. Air conditioning was my #1 priority and my room was good. Other guests at breakfast told me that they had hot rooms which would have killed me but room 110 was good and cool. A family with 2 rooms had to change from one of their rooms during their stay because of the a/c. The hot room for them was 104. (I took notes at the time.) About the rooftop terrace, great place for a drink and to enjoy the view. I have no idea how a previous reviewer could have stayed in the Vivaldi and NOT known that it was up there as there were signs in a few places directing people to it and the desk staff mentioned it twice and then the guy who helped me to my room, showed me the terrace as well. (There is NO WAY that they freshly squeezed the orange juice that I was served up there though!) I do agree with the same reviewer that they over-charge for the internet. The manager response to that review was typical. It is NOT normal in the hotel world to fleece your guests for internet use but it is normal in Venice to fleece all 10 million visitors as much as possible during their time there. It's almost 8 dollars (U.S) an hour for guests to use the internet in the lobby. It wasn't exactly worth the mosquito bites I got while sitting there. That rate is \"normal\" for internet cafes in the city. Hotels should offer it for free to paying guests otherwise it is just another internet cafe. I found that 2 out of 3 men at the concierge desk were very helpful. Claudio and Danielle were the 2 nice ones. The other man worked days and he was pretty indifferent, not very helpful and not easily approachable. He completely misdirected me for a day-trip to Chioggia and I am 100% sure that he did so because he could not be bothered at that time to help me. He was always busy with something on the computer and only gave quick answers. Claudio gave me detailed directions to Chioggia later on that same day and it entailed 3 modes of transport as opposed to the one way that the other man told me. He is also pretty typical of service in Venice so I was not too bothered by his attitude and approach to poor customer service.

Without any prompting from us, he rang the taxi office, made enquiries about what was happening &, when he received an unsatisfactory answer, made a fresh booking elsewhere. That's service !

We had a comfortable, clean, room with a side canal view.

Good variety at breakfast and very helpful staff. View from roof terrace is wonderful. As for Venice itself. We had 7 day Venice Travel cards which we used a lot, - a must. We try to find reasonable local eating places when in foreign cities. Venice defeated us some days. However Osteria da Baco, in a street somewhere behind the Hotel Danieli, has fresh homemade sandwiches, and other snacks, reasonably priced. We had good food in Trattoria Sara on Sz Greci, just before a bridge. We were not automatically given the tourist menu, displayed outside, when we sat down, we had to ask for it. We also enjoyed a pizzeria, Al Vecio Canton, in narrow streets at the end of Calle Rota.

Check in was very quick and our luggage was taken up to our room for us. The receptionist spoke excellent English and gave us a map of Venice, pointing out all of the major tourist attractions. I had emailed the hotel a few days prior to arrival requesting a twin room with a view. I was told that I would have to chose one or the other as all rooms with views contained double beds only. We chose to go with the twin room expecting to have a room at the back overlooking a courtyard as told to us so we were very pleasantly surprised to be told on arrival that they were now able to accomodate us in a twin room overlooking the side canal along with views towards the lagoon - very beautiful! The room was not particulary large but was very beautifully decorated and had a seating area. The bathroom was spotless and had a sauna shower which was very nice. It took a while to work out how to use the sauna but when we did get it working it was superb. The only complaint we had with the room was that the air conditioning was not adequate to cool the room sufficiently, it was 35 degrees each day. We did report it and were told that somebody would look at it but we are not sure if they did or not, it certainly didn't improve during our visit! Breakfast selection was superb with plenty of choices with both a hot and cold selection and a very efficient waitress supplying hot drinks. Reception staff were very helpful and when I asked them to make a telephone call on my behalf confirming a tour I had booked independantly, they were more than happy to do it. Location of this hotel could not have been better, we were 3 or 4 min walk from St Marks Square where you could hop on to a number of waterbuses to take you all over Venice.

St. Mark's is just a bridge or two away! Everyone at the hotel was delightful - from the front desk to the bellman to the managers to the breakfast staff. They handled all my luggage, re-keyed my room immediately when my key de-magnitized one morning and even held my suitcases for about 6 hours AFTER I checked out so I could wander around the city before my train left for Perugia.

The bed was extremely comfortable, the room looked out over a gorgeous courtyard with flowers and stained-glass windows and a canal off to one side, the bathroom was impeccably clean and large with lots of counterspace, and the furnishings were traditionally Venetian (I got the room shown on the website with the pink interior).

The rooms are beautiful - the extra touches like slippers, bathrobes and bath salts (good after a long day of walking) are wonderful. The rooms are temperature controlled, with control panels next to the bed. The cleaning staff do a great job - everything felt and was spotless. The room had a safe, and wardrobes, it was everything you needed, and more. The hotel has a lift, though hotel staff did bring our bags to our room. The hotel itself is 3 blocks (or two canal bridges) away from Piazzo San Marco - so you can never get lost. The breakfast is lovely, fresh fruit, cereals, pastries, cakes, meats and cheeses etc - the coffee is to be lamented, but I think it stood out as everything else was so good.

Although noisy during the day, at night it was quiet. We had pre-arranged via email with the hotel to reserve a \"Secret tour\" in English of the Doge's Palace (as recommended by others on Trip Advisor who had visited Venice) and the hotel was very accommodating in providing that help for us emailing us with our confirmation number. They also made provisions for us to have a water taxi meet us at the airport to transport us to their own dock! Expensive but very worth it (since we saw so many people lugging luggage up and down the canal bridges to get to their hotels!!) We were taking a cruise from Venice and they made arrangements for a water taxi to take us directly to the ship which made the transfer of luggage extremely easy.
