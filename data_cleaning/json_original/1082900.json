{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great value I stayed at Comfort Shirakawa between 12-14th of April 2008 and paid their standard rate which is 8.200 Yen (80 USD) per night including taxes and breakfast which is great value for money. The location is in a residential area just outside the very centre but you are no more than a few stops on the subway from the very heart of Ginza. And access to the subway (nearest station is Kiyosumi-Shirakawa) is very easy, the entrance is just 10 meters from the door of the hotel. The hotels sells discounted 1- and 2-day passes for the subway, just beware to get a pass that works on both subway companies (Toei and Tokyo Metro). Access from Tokyo Narita Airport was also very easy, take the Limousine bus to the T-CAT station (3000 Yen) and walk for 5-10 minutes and you are there. The staff if very friendly (like anyone else in Tokyo), their English is so-so but they are more than happy to fulfil any request. The room is quite small but that is common for most Tokyo hotels. The bed is rock-hard but that seems to be the case for most hotels as well. I must admit, it was rock hard but by no means uncomfortable. The bathroom is small with a small bathtub and a toilet equipped with a number of Japanese gadgets that you\u9225\u6a92l just have to try out. There is free WiFi in the room and a fridge for putting beverages and other stuff in. The room was very quiet so I slept very well. If you want some great take away food, exit the hotel and turn left. On the next corner across the intersection there is a small place that sells just great food for no money at all. Just around the corner of the hotel there is a supermarket (the one with two floors) that is just great, pick up all the stuff you need. Breakfast was nothing exciting but gives you a basic filling with coffee, bread, some cereals and not to forget the rice balls. Conclusion: good hotel that gives you some great value and the location is perfect with the subway metres away. A very strong 4 is my overall verdict.", "Date": "Apr 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR208316010", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Coffe_N"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel for Tokyo Area I occasionally go to Tokyo to watch sumo wresting tournaments. There are few hotels in the immediate area of the Ryogoku Kokugikan (Sumo Stadium) and my usual digs in Shinjuku is too far by train for these long tournament days. I discovered this hotel while searching around on TripAdvisor, and was very pleased with the experience.As other reviewers point out this hotel has typically small business size rooms, with the big plastic prefab bathroom. A shock for first time travelers to Tokyo but the cost savings over the Hilton/Prince/Cerulean type hotels is substantial. I visited during very cold winter weather. Hotel was warm and comfortable, no cold window drafts. Staff was competent and friendly, and the free continental breakfast and onsite laundromat were additional plusses.The adjacent subway station gives easy access to all of Tokyo as well as good connection to direct Narita airport trains. And only 5 minutes from the sumo stadium!", "Date": "Apr 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR724361703", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JimmyMc"}, {"Content": "Strongly recommend this hotel Great location.

The service was good. Some receptionists couldn't speak english fluently but they did try their best to speak to us in english. The room itself is very comfortable. The bed was comfortable and the blanket was really soft and fluffy. The amenities given were also sufficient. It included toothbrush set, shaver, soap and shampoo.

Agree completely with the previous reviewers. Single rooms are tiny but have every little gadget possible including LCD TV, wifi, electronic toilet, etc. They also will loan you an ethernet adapter if you prefer to connect via LAN at 100 Mbps. Very clean, very modern and very convenient. There's a convenience store on the ground floor of the building and the Kiyosumi-Shirakawa subway station is about 15 FEET from the hotel entrance. It's a very new station so there are escalators all the way from the street to the platforms! I have never stayed in a more convenient hotel anywhere in the world than this one. While it would be nice to have a clothes closed and a few drawers in the room, the convenience and features, not to mention the low rates, more than offset that.", "Date": "Feb 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR671469104", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "1bob"}, {"Content": "Fabulous at a nice price       High tech bathroom ;-)", "Date": "Dec 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR919833107", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "caproberts"}, {"Content": "Excellent! Stayed in this hotel several times in September 2005 and February 2006.The hotel is located adjacent to a subway station entrance (Kiyosumi-Shirakawa station on the Hanzomon line). It is brand new, everything is very clean and works. The hotel offers free WiFi Internet, a free Internet PC in the lobby and a free breakfast. Rooms are on the small size (as in any other Comfort hotel).There are vending machines for drinks and a coin-operated laundromat.It is a business hotel and does not offer a lot of facilities, but for just sleeping and using the Internet it offers an excellent value for money.

My daughter and I truly loved this hotel. The hotel is spic and span. From the walls, to the carpet to its curtains. Well, the hotel is new that is why.

Take two subway lines: the Marunouchi line one stop to Otemachi and switch to the Hanzomon line for three stops to Kiyosumi Shirakawa station...hotel is about 15 feet from subway exit B1...cost is 160 yen.Not much in the immediate area of the hotel (go out to dinner elsewhere), but convenience to other areas of Tokyo and the proximity to the subway makes up for this.Rooms are quite small with an even smaller bathroom, but rooms do inlcude a number of features including flat penel television, an air purifier, and a humidifier. Hotel also has free wireless internet access and free continental breakast (modest with few choices). Hotel is clean and relatively new.At 7,200 yen per night (less than $70) for a single, a very good value if you are in Tokyo for something other than a hotel experience. For those looking to pay more (but remain on budget) and stay in a more vibrant neighborhood, consider the Dai Ichi Hotel Annex near Shinbashi Station and walking distance to the Ginza.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR902411513", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066449-d1082900-r15185422-Comfort_Hotel_Tokyo_Kiyosumi_Shirakawa-Koto_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1082900", "Price": "$91"}}
