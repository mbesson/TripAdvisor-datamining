Shower/WC was very small but clean and no mold here. Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment. The breakfast area is lovely and the lady working there very friendly but the selection was not of a high quality. We have had much better bread rolls in other hotels in Berlin earlier, and the cold cuts were poor quality. Juices and fruit salad were good. I would definitely recommend this hotel as the location is great but it's weakest point is the quality of breakfast.

Very centrally located, this hotel is very comfortable for couple and family tourists alike. We arrived from Berlin Tegel airport and took the directions from their website; the X9 to the Zoo and then the U2 from the Zoo Bahn to Witenberg platz. From there, it\u2019s barely a 2 min walk down to the hotel. We arrived early 9:30 am, with reservations, but unannounced about our early arrival. At first the receptionist said that we couldn\u2019t check-in until 12:00 noon so we were going to proceed with the check-in process and leave our luggage with them. She then asked us to wait at the small breakfast area and offered us coffee while she said that she would check on the availability of our room. By the time we were done with our coffees, in 30 mins our room was ready in one of the upper floors. The building is very old but the rooms are refurbished. Some of the architecture can still be seen inside the room on the roof etc. The room itself was small but we expected that it would be the case by European standards. The bathroom was small but spotless which is very important to my husband. Happy husband, happy me. We got a rate without breakfast when we booked it but later changed our mind to have breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast was EUR 9 and not too elaborate. With the exception of the eggs, there wasn\u2019t any hot breakfast. The receptionist also booked the city tour for us on the BBS hop-on-hop-off tour which was very good (very good and working-condition personal headphones); as well as personally took care of all our needs (including free plug adaptor for our stay). The TV does not have any English channels with the exception of BBC and CNN. Note to those with heavy luggage, the lift runs at the mezzanine levels and not to the actual floors; but this is definitely not a show-stopper. The hotel is within walking distance to several restaurants and very centrally located for tourists and for those interested in shopping. Practically every attraction is accessible via the underground network and one can get a day-fare or sorts to cover everything on bus and U-bahn. Berlin is a city with plenty of history and we would have loved to stay here longer and enjoy the local attraction. I would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone; the biggest advantage is their helpful and smiling staff and the fact that it is located in the centre but still away from the hustle and bustle. Centrally located and good for short-term stay and tourism only.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOver family friendly but not gay friendly\u201d", "Author": "operamuso", "ReviewID": "UR105778095", "Content": "I chose this hotel for the gay Easter Leather meeting in Berlin for it's perfect location, reasonable prices and free WiFi.

Load of shops around: Ka De We (expensive), designer, Nike, Adidas, Wertheim (affordable) and nice eateries (especially 'Paydos' just around corner in Platz from hotel - steak great!). Checked in at 23.30 without any problem. Friendly welcome - better mood than mine. Room on 1st floor very comfortable, spotlessly clean, tea/coffee supplies adequate. Smallish bathroom but ideal for two. Shower lovely and hot. Towels changed daily and room kept very clean. Airconditioning unit very useful. Breakfast plentiful with good coffee. Lovely ambience, especially as the four days we were there the sun never seemed to stop shining. Free use of PC and Wireless network (charge) available. Overall we could not have wished for a nicer and friendlier place to stay and would not hesitate to return.", "Date": "September 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

This is the famous shopping area of Berlin with the KaDeWe right next door, so there is plenty to do after the other attractions close for the day. Plus, with a metro stop right outside the hotel, you can easily be anywhere in the city in just a matter of minutes. We were also pleased with the size of the room and that they provided a crib for our baby daughter. Our favorite part was the beautiful breakfast room where we had a relaxing start to every morning. This hotel is the perfect blend of old charm and modern rooms. We were very pleased with our experience and highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "December 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for shopping\u201d", "Author": "TravellingCat", "ReviewID": "UR4219527", "Content": "I stayed here with my boyfriend 3 nights in December, 2005. We reserved double room through Internet and the reservation was ok. Room was large and spacious. I especially loved the high ceiling. Very simple equipments, there was only tv and couple of tables and beds, bathroom and safe. I think the rating was 3 stars. The hotel has no lift. Breakfast was free and there was plenty to choose from. Coffee especially was excellent! I think the best part was the location. Department store KaDeWe and the biggest shopping street was just right around the corner. Metro station was also very near. The staff was friendly and when we checked out, they let us storage our luggage there for a couple of hours. The lady at the reception was very friendly and she spoke very good english. They also call you a cab if you need one. This was appr. 110 euros per night, so it isn't the cheapest one, but if you plan to do some heavy shopping, then this hotel would be a very good choice.", "Date": "December 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cgreat don't pay double the price for less\u201d", "Author": "ebarav", "ReviewID": "UR3936977", "Content": "Great hotel , clean friendly great location.
