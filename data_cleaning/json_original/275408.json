I booked on a third party web site, a double room, and when I went up to the room it was a twin...not impressed I told them that I would leave, as this was not what I had booked. At first the receptionist said it was ok, then after we got all our bags ready to leave, she said that her head office told her that we needed to pay one night anyway, just because we checked in!!! Not having any of that I asked to speak to the headoffice, and while the receptionist never passed them on to me, she discussed it again with them, and after a lenghty conversation we were given permission to leave without a charge... Not knowing that this was a chain, I mistakenly booked another of their hotels, which was again erroneously displaying a double room...obviously when I went there and realised it belonged to the same group, I was not expecting a double...in fact, despite the reservation confirming one, they did not have any, they said that the whole chain did not provide double rooms (?!)...I enquired if I could cancel our second night, and was replied 'no, I don't know if I can do that...but you can try with the receptionist on duty tomorrow...' I did not bother cancelling or attempting to cancel, as I would have ruined our holiday even more...we decided to stay the 2 nights...just to find out on our return from ourday in Amsterdam that the key did not work, and the room had not been cleaned. the receptionist said that we were only booked for 1 night 'but I don't know why...'I explained that I had tried cancelling the previous night, but that the receptionsit could not do it...anyway, we had to move to a clean room, as the cleaning lady had gone home by then. The following day, at check out, I told them that my room was prepaid, as per e-bookers confirmation... this quite sour receptionist said that we must pay now...she gave me the bill and it was about \u00c2\u00a380 more expensive than what I had on my confirmation...by now nothing about this hotel surprised me...I accepted to pay, and obviously once back, i noticed that I had been charged twice! Once correctly by the web site and another time (overcharged) by the hotel....what a shame...having sent them a complaint, I was not surprised either that no response was received, and that I actually had to phone them from London to get their attention! By the way, no refund yet... Avoid this hotel if you can, because their massive disorganisation can cost you a lot of trouble...shame, becasue the hotel itself is quite pleasant.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cDecent stay but a bit far from the centre of Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "snarfley", "ReviewID": "UR53582910", "Content": "I stayed here for a night after flying in from North America before heading to a conference in The Hague the next day. For my purposes, having been here twice before (and knowing I'd return two weeks later), it was fine. Not too difficult to find the right bus and get here - public transportation in the Netherlands is no problem and the bus driver was helpful. But if I were here to see Amsterdam, I would not stay here. Yes, the rooms were fine, but the location makes it a bit difficult to see Amsterdam. If money is an issue and you don't mind a bit of a commute, this is a good choice. If you're trying to see as much as possible in a few days, you may want to look elsewhere. I ate in the restaurant downstairs which was fairly expensive (nice Caesar salad) as there were no other obvious options nearby. Central Amsterdam is obviously more expensive but you're paying for the location.", "Date": "January 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hastings", "Title": "\u201cSimple yet affective\u201d", "Author": "Samandhishols", "ReviewID": "UR33651199", "Content": "Hotels nice and clean, staff were nice and helpful.

Fortunately we had a car, otherwise we'd have had to rely on buses to get to the city. The downside of course was that my boyfriend couldn't drink and it does take a good 15-20 minutes to get to the city centre. The hotel itself was ok but I wasn't very impressed with our room. It was clean, but crawling with ants. I watched them scuttle into my bags and clothes which wasn't very pleasant! The lighting in the room is poor. There were no lights at all in one half of the room so we were searching around in our suitcases in the dark. All in all I'd say this hotel is ok but not at all convenient for Amsterdam city centre.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel, great staff..\u201d", "Author": "mousanon", "ReviewID": "UR5370977", "Content": "This is a nice hotel.
