We were very pleased to find it very easily from the main bus station, on a really pretty canal. We were greeted by a very friendly lady who spoke good english and soon found it to be a really lovely family run hotel. It is very reasonably priced for Venice and it is not far from the main attractions, we like to walk around to take in the sights anyway but it is only 20min walk from St Mark's Square and many other pretty sights. The restaurants around Santa Croce were much nicer, more local and cheaper too! I don't know what people are complaining about or what people expect - the family were very welcoming and the rooms very clean. We stayed in room 12 at the top and although tt wasn't the biggest room i've stayed in, what do you need a big room for when you're exploring all day!!! I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return when we go back to Venice - it is a beautiful place.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Budget Option\u201d", "Author": "Dufflepod", "ReviewID": "UR125218403", "Content": "Stayed here 6 years ago.

I can recommend Bacareto Da Lele, a tiny bar literally around the corner ( turn right out of the hotel) for a cheap glass of wine or spritz served with tasty rolls or cicheti in the evening.

Ideally I didn't want to sleep in a dorm with others and it was not easy to find a cheap single room, but this hotel had it. The location is fantastic, very near to Piazalle Roma bus station and having arrived after the sky turned dark, finding the hotel was not hard at all. True, it was far from the main attractions but actually walking to San Marco only took me 30 minutes, not a big deal for me. Being away also means lower price; I especially like how it was near to the San Margherita Square, which was a student hang out area with cheaper food. The interior is cosy and clean. My room is on the 3rd floor with no elevator but it doesn't matter for me as I travel lightly. I didn't get the room with the canal view but that's fine too since I'm out all day. I got a double bed for a single room all by myself! The toilet was complete as well. But I especially appreciate the free WiFi in the room: very fast connection, and great for a quick research before heading out! Staff speaks good English and are friendly too. One day the toilet light did not work and they fixed it promptly after I told them. Restaurant next door's breakfast was decent, nothing special but good enough for me, I'm not a luxury traveler after all and breakfast provided means at least I don't need to hunt for something to eat with a hungry stomach. Further down the hotel there is a pastry shop that sells a good variety of pastries if the breakfast is not enough, and it is featured in my LonelyPlanet guide too. Overall, great little hotel, wouldn't really mind to stay there again! p/s: They received a certificate from Trip Advisor as one of the better hotels too!

I was all set to write a nice review by the evening of my first day's stay which is when someone at the front desk (Let's call him Guy#1) decided to have some fun with our passports. Earlier in the day we had handed over our passports to another guy (Guy#2) at the front desk for safekeeping (BAD idea, we should have kept it with us). When we came back at night, Guy#1 tells us he can't find our passports and that front desk is not supposed to hold on to them. He makes a show of searching and spoke to someone on the phone for a while in italian (maybe he wanted to get Guy#2 in trouble) I'm in panic mode because we are leaving tomorrow from Venice. Guy#1 says get some sleep, you'll have it tomorrow. I didn't understand how, but the next morning, the manager was at the front desk and we told him our problem. He immediately made some calls, we could hear him next door screaming and yelling at someone (at Guy#1, I guess) after which Guy#1 comes back, takes our passports from the front desk MAIN drawer (!!!) and sheepishly hands it over to us. I'm giddy with anger and relief by now when I realize they were at the front desk the whole time!! Maybe what we had was a random experience, but we're never going back there.

Although, I wouldn't have changed having the canal view for anything. The walls of the hotel were also a little thin and we could hear the room next door's tv on quite late.

The hotel is not luxurious like the Sofitel round the corner, but it is spotlessly clean and the staff are welcoming and pleasantly unobtrusive. As we arrived quite late on our first evening (10:30 p.m), we tried our luck at the adjoining Ribo' restaurant, and had a lovely meal in their secluded garden, despite the fact that we arrived just after their normal serving hours. The service was as charming as the place itself, and the prices incredibly reasonable for Venice - another advantage to being off the beaten track. In fact the Ribo' is the place where guests have their breakfast, which is included in the price of the room, and is perfectly adequate to start the day off, even if the first morning's coffee was slightly too watered down for our 'ristretto' loving tastes. All in all a fantastic option for people on a tighter budget, or even for those who are not looking for luxury. It's clean, quiet, well-situated and welcoming.

However, when we arrived at the hotel they couldn't find our booking and it transpired that although their booking office had sent us an email confirmation, they had not put it into their booking system. Despite this, the hotel staff failed to apologise and left us standing around for around 40 minutes whilst they called their sister hotels deciding which rooms to offer us instead. They finally offered us a room at their sister B&B Locanda Salieri, promising us that we would have a canal view & that the rooms & location were much better. When we arrived at the other hotel Locanda Salieri, we were told that oh no, there were no rooms available with a canal view. So, it's not clear who was lying - the staff at San Samuele or the staff at Locanda Salieri. We were very disappointed with the location because we wanted to be near San Marco, not the train station. This meant that we spent much more time travelling to and from the hotel than we would otherwise have needed to. The receptionist was so unhelfpul and basically kept changing his story whenever we challenged his answers. We wanted to negotiate a discount but the receptionist refused to let us speak to the manager and kept telling us that it wasn't his business because we made the booking at the other hotel - even though the hotels are sister hotels and share a booking office. Finally he actually called the manager in front of us but refused to let us speak to her and then he pretended he couldn't find the number to call her again. When we negotiated a discount with the manager on the phone, the receptionist refused to put it in writing. Eventually we forced him to write the new rate down on the booking sheet in front of us. However, he wrote this in pencil. When we came back down the next morning there was a new member of staff on reception and she told us that we had to change rooms for the second night (despite the fact we'd been told we'd be in the same room for 2 nights) and we noticed that the price for our room was written down as the full price again. When we challenged her, she said that oh, there was no price written there so she didn't know about the discount, which means that the receptionist the night before had rubbed out the price we had agreed! Fortunately the new receptionist agreed to change it back to the price we had agreed. In the evening, we got back to the hotel to find that rather than moving us to a similar room, they had moved us to a cell-like room with one small, high window, cobwebs on the ceiling and by the bed, and a cupboard by the bed full of cleaning products which wouldn't shut properly. The room stank of smoke. We were obviously furious that they had moved us to such an awful room - perhaps this was because we had demanded a discount?? So, we then negotiated a further discount with a new receptionist but frankly would rather have moved to a different hotel if we weren't so exhausted. I would be very wary of making bookings with either of these hotels - their booking system is clearly in chaos and their customer service is dreaful. They told us so many lies and it should be said that i'm fluent in Italian and so probably picked up on a lot more that was being said than non-Italian speakers would have. The receptionist at Locanda Salieri also told us that in order to give us a room, they rang up and cancelled a different guest who was about to arrive, and so it's pretty clear that they are very unreliable and do not honour bookings.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cthe strategic traveller stop in venice-perfecto\u201d", "Author": "messagero", "ReviewID": "UR30235937", "Content": "from the airport or train, you can maximise your time in `venice by staying here. why spend a hour struggling through crowds with your suitcase, when you can throw it in the door of this perfectly located, amazingly priced and sparkling clean little one star treasure? you are then free to travel, light explore the city, for pleasure or for business and be able to make a very easy connection for departure. i have used this hotel for over a year for various trips and last time it was so perfect i decided to share it with trip advisor. i have seen a lot of one stars in venice- no comparison-some are downright scary, trust me, this is a good spot.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blaine, Washington", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly room, perfect location\u201d", "Author": "gypsygirl1925", "ReviewID": "UR28581303", "Content": "I stayed here two nights and didn't want to leave.

The gondolas regularly went by with accordion players and vocalists adding to the ambience. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was decent size but the lighting was not good.

Also the size of the room will be small, in some cases very small unless paying 400+ euros a night, then you can get a reasonable size room. The Salieri is very close to the bus terminus [pizzale Roma] and vaperetto [public water taxi's] less than 10 minutes walk, over 2 bridges. the Locanda is by a canal and has a small reception area [tiny] up some stairs are the rooms, so if you have difficulty in walking up stairs this is not for you. our room was on the first floor which was a normal size room for venice. very clean. small bathroom with shower, toilet and bidet. good hot water from the shower. we were bed and breakfast. breakfast was held in the next door ribo restaurant. this had a very large garden patio at the back. buffet breakfast with a hot choice. plenty of variety to start the walking day. The staff were very friendly at both the locanda and restaurant. we had dinner at the restaurant on one of our evenings.
