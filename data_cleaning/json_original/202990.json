{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Paris is perfect! We just returned from an 18 day trip through Europe. Spent two days in Firenze at the Paris Hotel. The hotel was in a perfect location in the city centre. Walking distance to the train station and all of the museums, churches, etc. Our room was on right on Via dei Banchi, so if we looked left we saw Piazza del Duomo and to the right was Piazza Santa Maria Novella. The staff was excellent and provided perfect recommendations. They were all so eager to help; Front desk, bell desk, maids, parking, breakfast staff....everyone. We were only there for two days but I think we managed to meet and enjoy service from everyone who worked there.This is an old world Tuscan building with history so rich you can feel it. The art throughout the hotel was very impressive and provided the perfect atmosphere, especially for those looking for classic Florence charm. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend, especially given the price/value ratio... a bargain.Three bits of Advice: 1) This hotel is located on a one-way street (heading toward SM Novella). If you drive, know your route to the hotel and park right in front. Let them park your car.2) This hotel, like most in Europe, have few power outlets. Ask the staff to borrow an extension cord if you have more than one device to charge at night, i.e. PDA, Phone, laptop, etc. 3) Let the staff handle your bags. Even though there is a lift, you have stairs and steps to navigate for some of the rooms and if you over pack like most people do, then you should take advantage of the great service and let the pros handle the bags.", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR697645600", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "osguru"}, {"Content": "Disappointing While touring through Italy, we were told that we would love Florence. We did not love Florence and we believe that it was because of our hotel. Our room was not reaady on arrival, so we were asked to put our luggage in a room off the lobby.

It appeared old and in need of a makeover. Our room was quite large and the bathroom had been udpated and it was also large, but the windows are single pane glass and the street noise was constant all night long.We were happy that we only were booked in for one night.

If you are traveling with a car, this is a pain to get to. Hotel does not give you very good directions on the phone; especially since half of Florence is being renovated. Had to park at the train station and then walk to the hotel to find out how we could get the car to the hotel. (In person the front desk gives you good directions with the help of a city map.) View from our room was of the Duomo which was very nice. Until night fall came....Very noisy with traffic late into the night and picking up again well before sunrise. Could hear garbage collection, store gates being opened and closed and carabinieri/ambulances all night - - even though we were on the top floor. A/C worked well. Bathroom was very small. Bed in our room was horrible, needs to be replaced badly. The building has a lot of character to it but some areas (like the beds) need updating. Breakfast was ok; served in a very nice room.

There is no restaurant or bar at the Paris as there are many better alternatives in the streets around. You get a big breakfast, large clean rooms and excellent service. The building is an old palazzo (merchants house) which has loads of character.It does have a downside though. Even with double glazing and air-con, Florence is all around you from the twice daily ringing of the church bells, to the over enthusiastic carabinieri roaring through the streets at full throttle, to the nightly bin collection outside. Luckily we were so tired from our full days in Florence we barely noticed.So if you want to be insulated from the real Florence outside try one of the business class hotels elsewhere but the Paris will always be one of our favourite hotels.", "Date": "Sep 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR384773753", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Galloglaigh"}, {"Content": "Elegant Booked through Venere.com.

I think maybe that was down to pot luck rather than anything else though as the hotel used to be a palazzo so no two rooms are the same.Other reviews have said the traffic noise from the surrounding streets was terrible and yes, it wasn't great but it was nowhere near loud enough to keep us awake.

Pros:The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, breakfast was good (the breakfast room is absolutely gorgeous), and the hotel itself has a lot of charm. The location can't be beat. It's very close to the train station (an easy walk, even with luggage) and literally just down the street from the Duomo. This street did seem to have a lot of the cheaper hotels (it's certainly not the most attractive area in town), but Florence is so small that the area between there and the more expensive areas is less than 1/2 mile. Cons: As others have noted, the room was much smaller than the pictures on the website. It was small, even by Italian standards. It was the smallest room we stayed in during our trip (but also, this was the least expensive hotel we stayed in). The elevator was dodgy, and so was the internet connection.All in all, we enjoyed our stay. It was a clean comfortable room and we got a good night's sleep, which is what a hotel is for after all.

My daughter, my best friend, and I just returned from a week in Florence. I absolutely do not know where to begin with my praise for this beautiful hotel  its staff! We were visiting my other daughter who is a student at the Rucellai Institute. My husband was unable to accompany us, so I was more than a little homesick. But, no need to worry. From the second we entered the lobby, we were treated as Royalty! (It didn't hurt that my husband's family hails from Gubbio, Tuscany  our surname was instantly recognized by Francesco at the desk!)We arrived at the hotel a full hour before check-in, but our room was ready. We had booked a twin superior for 3 people. The room was absolutely breathtaking. It was huge! We had a lovely view of the Bell Tower  the Dome. The decor  furnishings were beautiful as well. There was a print of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus on one of the walls (one of my all-time favorites!). The bathroom was marble. I loved the towel warmers. When my daughter saw how beautiful the room was, she asked if she could stay with us instead of at her apartment. I asked at the front desk if that was ok  to please charge me the extra $20 per night for her. Not only did they let her stay with us free of charge, but I also had the feeling that they kept an eye out on both of my daughters (20  21).Our itenerary was that we would stay at the Hotel Paris from Monday night thru Thursday night, check out Friday morning, travel to Venice  Verona on the weekend  stay in Verona Friday  Saturday nights. We had no where to stay Sunday night  also nowhere to store our luggage while we were in Verona. We were going to stay at my daughter's apartment, but that didn't work out. We checked at the desk to see if they had any rooms for us upon our return to Florence Sunday night, but the fellow told us they were booked solid. However, he said it was fine if we left our luggage there (even though we were checked out!). He suggested that we keep checking, though, which we did  Francesco did come up with a room for us for Sunday night! We were ecstatic!!!The trip to Verona was fun, but I sure missed the luxury of Florence  the hotel! When we returned to Florence, the gentleman at the desk whipped out a hotel brochure to show us our new room. Well, it was none other than the Presidential Suite! I thought he was joking ... he wasn't! OMG ... the room was so beautiful. It felt as though we were staying in a museum. They charged us for a regular room. It was their present to the princesses. Unbelievable. Frescoes; antiques; wall niches; fireplace; beautiful art, rugs, chandelier, lamps; etc. And, the beds .... so comfortable. The bathroom was a beautiful shade of cherry red, mosaic floor. Breathtaking.Besides the beauty of the hotel itself, I have never met a staff that was more accommodating. They helped us in so many ways ... from dinner reservations to train reservations, etc. When we asked directions to the travel agent, the young man actually walked us all the way there! Our plane for home was leaving Florence Airport at 6:40 a.m. Monday. The girl at the desk (Cara) left 3 breakfast bags for us (gratis) ... how thoughtful is that?I could go on  on with my praises. Rest assured that the next time I visit Florence (can't wait for that!), I certainly know where I'll be staying!

My husband and I just returned from Florence. We stayed at the Paris and loved it. The hotel is an old palace, so the placement of the rooms can be a little odd.

I was excited that our bathroom had a bathtub so that I could soak my tired legs!! The staff was terrifc. They graciously made reservations for us to the Uffizi and the Accademia (same day service, no less!), offered suggestions for restaurants, and called us taxi's. All with a smile! The breakfast was great--very Italian with cappaccino and espresso to order, American coffee, croissants and other sweets, fruit, yogurt, meat, cheese, bread, and cereal.The hotel is located within two blocks of the train and bus stations, but there was no noise. It's about three blocks from the Duomo.The only negative is the street noise. Our first room faced the street and we were hot so we had to open the windows (no air conditioning).

We had a great view of San Lorenzo and could also see the Duomo clearly.

The only negative comment is that there was a significant amount of street noise (despite the fact that we closed the window  shutters).

Within easy walking distance from the station (it would have been easier if we'd set off in the right direction to start with) it is also a few yards away from the Duomo and a short stroll from almost everything else you will want to see. Judging from other reviews no two rooms in the place are alike, hardly surprising when it's converted from a sixteenth century palace. We had no complaints about ours - large with an impressively high ceiling, antique wooden furniture giving great character, huge windows from which the San Lorenzo church could be seen over the rooftops and a massive and supremely comfortable bed. The bathroom was small with only a shower, no bathtub but everything clean and inviting, large warm towels provided. The only problem we had was a failure in the hot water supply for the last couple of days (not just us, the whole hotel) - it seemed to have been fixed but was then cold again the following day. We also had a fair amount of noise from the street below, inevitable in a city centre setting I guess and something you rapidly adjust to after the first night.The breakfasts lived up to the rave reviews from others and if you make the most of them you could comfortably manage without lunch (not that we did, but we do overindulge on holiday and why not). I do think other reviewers have been a bit unfair on the restaurant opposite; gourmet dining it certainly isn't but the pizzas and pasta are excellent (so are the jugs of house wine), many Italians were eating there which is always a good sign, and as a convenient place to fall into on your first night to recover from the journey it would be hard to find better. In fact we liked it so much we went back on our last night as well and weren't disappointed.So overall, great location, fascinating place to stay, very comfortable and good value for money (particularly impressed by the telephone bill at the end - we had chatty phone calls back to the UK four nights running and paid less than five euros in total).

Amazingly, the laundry people don't go on vacation in Florence, and we were able to obtain clean clothes in just a few hours, get reservations for the Uffizi, and get recommended to the most charming delicious and cheap hosteria that you can imagine. Yes, the elevator was still not working, but after climbing endless stairs on my much surgered knees to the top floor we were rewarded with a large, lovely, light and well-decorated room with 20 foot ceilings, outstanding views, satellite TV, minibar, working AC, and a truly grand, modern and marvelous bathroom. Don't stay here if you're a Hilton type, but if you want charm, convenience and a real sense of history, stay in this wonderful, and very affordable ($150 Euros per night for three including a very satisfactory breakfast buffet in a glorious vaulted 16th C. room). We had to tear ourselves away and would go back in a second.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR385060053", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not for me.

It took 125 stairs to get to our room on the 3rd floor. Once we'd made the climb, the room was lovely (and very large), and as one might expect in a small hotel like this, the staff remembered us and handed us the correct room key whenever we came in without having to be asked. What soured our opinion was that upon arrival, we were notified that our rate would be higher because it did not include taxes. We spoke with the manager, and he took offense to it as a pride issue, challenging us to prove him wrong. We did so, providing him a screen capture from our travel agent's reservation system that stated incl tax, prompting him to counter with an email from Utell's central reservation center that we were still incorrect. The extra $40 per night wasn't a big deal, but on principle alone, the affont to customer service is inexcusable. We were already paying over 200 Euros nightly, and despite the fact that the hotel rents rooms for much less than that, the manager suggested we were trying to rip him off by asking him to honor the rate on our reservation confirmation. There are plenty of nice hotels in the neighborhood to choose from. We were staying only 2 nights and chose not to look elsewhere, even though we should have.

This is a three star hotel, not a four star as somebody below misunderstood and we found it to be an excellent value. For those who don?t know, stars are awarded based on specific services provided and are not a guarantee of quality; it?s possible to find 3 star hotels that outshine 4 stars, etc.; everything depends on the personnel and the personnel at the Hotel Paris are outstanding.Breakfast selection was broad but could use some variety from day to day. This is not the right place to stay for somebody looking for slick, modern and sterile. It is the right place for people who appreciate well designed and reasonably well maintained older buildings that offer character and style that are sadly lacking in so many of today?s hotels. As with any hotel, you need to be careful in your booking arrangements if a particular type of room is necessary to meet your needs; their website provides views of several different types.
