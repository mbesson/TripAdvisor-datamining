We chose the hotel because we thought from previous reviews that it was a safe option and close enough to walk into town. Unfortunately, it was further out than we thought (both in terms of distance and character - i.e. it feels a bit like it's in the suburbs - being near one of the mainline traln stations). For example, there are no/very few decent restaurants nearby. The hotel is nice enough, with friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are clean, although not very spacious, to be honest. Whilst this is quite a personal comment, we felt that the hotel lacks character - the lobby, bar area, restaurant, rooms etc. In terms of locaton, it is 30 minutes walk to Placa Catalunya (at the top of the Rambla) and about an hour's walk to the Port. If you don't mind travelling into town by metro, the connections are good. The Sagrada Famlia is 5 stops away on 1 line, and the Rambla is 5 stops away on another. The metro station (Barcelona Sants) is 10 minutes walk door to door from the hotel. It may be a popular option for many - especially if you get a good deal staying there. And it is definitely very functional, pretty modern and clean. But next time we go to Barcelona, we'll probably go for somewhere closer to old town, Jaume or Barceloneta, with a bit more character.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "MALTA", "Title": "\u201cLovely stay\u201d", "Author": "MARIE B", "ReviewID": "UR127667030", "Content": "My husband and myself stayed at H10 ITACA from 3rd APRIL to 8th APRIL.

We had a really bad experience at the metro station - got our pockets picked (and it happened to many other people in the same coach, so I cannot stress this enough - be oh so careful if you're taking the metro), so we traveled only by taxi after that - taxis are easy to come by near the hotel, it takes about 7-10 minutes on average to downtown and costs under 10 euros. The breakfast is DELICIOUS! :) Also, I loved the toiletries - what a yummy smell! About the internet - while it is free, it's so slow and frustrating you can hardly use it at all in the rooms. They do provide two PCs for use in the front lobby, and we found that convenient enough to check our mail / Facebook etc while we were on holiday, but if you're planning on working and need hi-speed internet, then you may want to figure out some alternatives.

My wife and I, late 40s, experienced travellers, from Boston MA. Plusses: Very helpful and friendly front desk staff. They recommended excellent restaurants (Pexeirot, nearby; La Fonda del Port Olimpic, on the water several miles away), and were very responsive to some noise issues (baby constantly crying in room next door, rude young people talking and smoking in the hall outside our room at 3am). They moved us to a room away from the baby (hotel walls are quite thin and noise carries right through them), and spoke to the rude guests (as did I), who improved their behavior. Breakfast is good (though in our opinion not as outstanding as some have indicated in their reviews), and service friendly. Location was fine for us - near subway and train stations, a stop of the city tourist bus, and a large grocery store. Barcelona is quite large, and has many beautiful, wide boulevards. Our favorite attraction was the Conjunt Monumental de la Placa del Rei, just off Les Ramblas. It features a catwalk tour 'above' ruins of the old Roman city of Barcino - fascinating. The MNAC (National Museum), on the other hand, was a disappointment - but the building itself, and the views from it, are inspiring. The MNAC and Place Espanyol are a short walk from the hotel. The location felt safe to us as well, and we often walked in this area at night, and other areas of Barcelona, without incident. Free wireless access a big plus, though strength of signal and speed of access varied quite a bit. There are also two PCs in the lobby for guests, with a printer. The staff in the restaurant was also very friendly and efficient at breakfast each morning. Another excellent restaurant: Tragaluz, near the Diagonal subway station (Passatge de la Conceptio 5, 93-487-01-96). Our meal was terrific, and the restaurant is beautiful (as is Pexeirot, which also has a pianist every night). Keep in mind that folks eat late in Spain - many restaurants do not open until 8:30pm, and even then you'll likely be eating without many others until 9:00, 9:30 or even later. Negatives: Small rooms, uncomfortable (hard) beds (we found this to be the case in all 3 hotels we stayed at in Spain - each supposed to be rated 4 stars), and very thin walls that allow normal conversation - and lots more - to be easily heard in the next room. The noise from the street (front side of hotel) and a playground/common area (back side of hotel) could interfere with sleep if you like the window open. And the windows - the drapes are installed in such a a way that they interfere with the way the window opens, which was a bit of a pain. Overall, we liked the hotel, most especially because the staff was very helpful and friendly. Great rates at Otel.com ($107 US per night, inclusive of breakfast and all taxes). Watch out for the cab drivers. While we had several good ones, we had several who were obviously dismissive of US tourists, and one who outright tried to cheat us.

I was not disappointed. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the rooms clean and well maintained. There have been some reports about the variable shower temperature but I did not experience it in the four nights I stayed there. Maybe they have fixed the problem or maybe I was just lucky. A reviewer also complained about the noisy ventillation system but again I did not find this a problem. The hotel staff set the ventillation on maximum boost as a default but you can switch it to low so that your sleep is not disturbed. However, you will experience some road noise as the hotel is on a main road but the double glazing ensures that this is not a significant problem. The hotel provide a wonderful buffet breakfast but at 14 euros it is quite expensive. You could eat in a nearby cafe but I decided to splash out and didn't regret it. The food is of the highest calibre and is enough to keep you going for most of the day. I found the free access to the internet terminals quite useful where you could check your emails, the weather, timetables etc etc. And,you could stock up cheaply on supplies for the day from the supermarket right next door. This made the mini-bar rather superfluous. The location of this hotel is ideal if you are looking for somewhere away form the noise of the city centre and, dare I say it, the sort of guests who are likely to keep you awake all night. You could hear other guests, especially in the bathroom, but it was nothing to complain about. The location is also good if you are staying several nights and intend to take day trips to Stiges and Montserrat (both are worth it). Sants station is a stop for the Tourist Bus which costs 17 euros for one day and 21 euros for two days. As the tourist sites are well spaced apart, I would advise paying for this, especially if you are a first time visitor to Barcelona. Going independent, using the T tickets, is best done by those who know their way around. So, in conclusion, the H10 Itaca is an above average hotel which I thoroughly recommend. The only downside is that there is not much in the way of restaurants and entertainment in the area. However, it is easy to get into the city centre and then retreat to your hotel refuge at the end of the day. There is going to be a little walking involved (Sants station is 5 to 10 mins away) so if you are disabled or you are just plain lazy, you might prefer somewhere else. Also, if you are staying only a couple of nights you might find yourself better off at a city centre hotel like the H10 Universitat as you will want to see the main attractions quickly, but you must expect to pay a heavy price for this and your room is likely to be the size of a cupboard.", "Date": "July 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Garwood,New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3645006", "Content": "I just returned from a European vacation and my first stop was Barcelona.

The free internet is also a great advantage;the hotel has two terminals both of which were working when I was there. The public rooms are attractive. Several English language news papers available to read. The location of the hotel is good for someone who is staying in several days and plans to visit a variety of sights in Barcelona. There is so much to see in Barcelona and the city is spread out so you may well decide to make use of public transit. I thought that the metro and bus systems were both first rate. The Tarrargona metro stop on Line 3 is most convenient, and Line 5 stop is nearby too. I found the free bus map helpful too. The five day pass for public transit or the five day pass for public transit plus museum and shopping reductions (the latter called the \"Barcelona Card\") is a good buy. Also the hotel is walking distance to the main train station (Sants). The airport bus and train also arrives at the train station. However, if you are just staying in Barcelona for a couple nights and wish to concentrate your time in the Ramblas and the waterfront, you will find this location inconvenient. The hotel is located in an established community of apartment buildings. The neighborhood has several large grocery stores, and other shops and cafes. No big name restaurants nearby although there are several small places serving dinner. You may wish to take metro, bus, or taxi to more active areas for dinner. The back of the hotel faces a large courtyard and children's play area for the neighborhood. It is quiet after about 9pm. Before that time, you will hear the kids if your window is open, but closing the window shut out noise. There was a very soft mechanical sound in my room. I didn't notice it except when everything else was completely silent, and I couldn't identify its origin. I don't think it would matter to the average person, but very light sleepers might notice. My main complaint was that my room was small and there was no sitting chair just an uncomfortable desk chair. The bathroom was good size and well stocked.", "Date": "May 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery Good...but some small things to be wary of......\u201d", "Author": "Jabei", "ReviewID": "UR3395917", "Content": "I stayed at the Alimara Hotel a couple of years ago and really liked it. This time I wanted something a little closer to the centre. This website has never let me down and I booked the H10 based on reviews here.... First the good things...... CHAMPAGNE WELCOME.....it was very nice and a good end to our journey. ROOM ..... Was clean & tidy (although two singles pushed together does not make a double!!) BREAKFAST...Booked through the H10 website and got a good price including breakfast...Glad I did, it's the best buffet breakfast I have ever had...almost everything you could want in great quantity. FREE INTERNET ACCESS... Never really knew why people wanted this when on holiday, but it was very useful for trying to get bus times etc. also, a bank machine and big supermarket housed in the same building as the hotel. Now...the not so great things (not bad things!!!) to look out for if it is your first visit LOCATION....It is very close to the Metro & is only 15mins to Las Ramblas by underground (the best way to travel around) but don't expect to walk out of the hotel and see anything very nice around you. It's not a rough area but there is just nothing around....a few bars that didn't look great. ROOM.....Although clean as mentioned above, the hotel is on a pretty busy road and the traffic noise was non stop and quite audible with the windows shut. these are minor gripes and overall I would say the this and the Alimara where I stayed before are much the same...The Alimara has better rooms but this has better breakfast. I would definitley be happy to stay again but will probably stay somewhere else next time as I like to try somewhere different each time.", "Date": "April 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cNot bad but it's a bit of a walk\u201d", "Author": "kmstraveller", "ReviewID": "UR3372056", "Content": "We had chosen this hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor. Overall, our stay was okay. We got to barcelona at 10:00 AM and they let us check in early which was nice. THe hotel is about 5-7 minute walk from the closest subway station and since there's nothing particularly special about the street its on, it can seem like a pretty long and boring walk. There doesn't seem to be air conditioning in the rooms so I can't imagine what styaing here would be like in the middle of summer. We did like the fact that there was two computers with internet connections in the lobby. It's in a pretty quiet area. There's a groccery store about a block away which is good if you want to pick up some water or snacks cheaply. I think we paid about 160 US per night which isn't the best deal. For that money, I think I'd prefer to stay somewhere a little closer to the main tourist areas and even a little closer to a subway station.", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "iramcynyc", "ReviewID": "UR3338403", "Content": "Great hotel!

The worse part of my stay was having a room near the stairs, the noise of people coming and going at all hours kept me awake at times, also most of the rooms have wooden floors which do by there very nature make more noise the carpet when people walk on them. The hotels good points are that it has clean rooms (all mod cons) and very friendly staff. The breakfast was great and would recommend paying the extra to eat at the hotel. Bad points are the paper thin walls, and location if you have limited mobility.
