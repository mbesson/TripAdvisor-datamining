I couldn't open the safe to get my money. When the hotel sent someone up to check the lights and safe, he told me that the safe was broken. Someone from housekeeping had to come up and open the safe with a master key. In addition to that, when he opened the switchplate to see what was wrong with the light switch, he found NO WIRES behind the switch plate on the wall to turn the lights on or off. We wound up with a room that only had a shower and no tub, which was the reason I took the more expensive room when I booked the hotel. If that isn't enough, the second night we were there, we got up around 8:30 and went out to a museum. When we returned at 14:30, our room had STILL NOT BEEN MADE UP!! Again, I went down to the desk to complain, and finally at 16:30, the room was finally made up. When we left the hotel the third day, I asked the woman at the desk to please mail 3 post cards, Every card I mailed in Italy was deliveder with the exception of the three I gave to the woman at the desk at Boscolo. When I wrote to the hotel complaining after we returned to the states, the cards were finally mailed...three weeks AFTER we left. The hotel never even answered my e-mail in which I complained about our experience there. When we were at the hotel, I noticed a placcard behind the desk advertising cab service to the airport for 75 Euros. Outside the hotel is a taxi stand, and the fare to the airport is a fixed price...40 Euros!!

Disappointingly cost of drinks very expensive ( 22 Euros for a glass of wine and a liquer)-A 330 ml bottle of water from the hotel room cost 7 euros, however I am sure all of the hotels in this area charge this. There is a local daily tax which guests are required to additionally pay . We were charged 3 euros each however the ABTA company we booked with advised us the charge was 2 euros each per day. Advise to check such details upon arrival There is a supermarket near to the 'villa borghese park' underpass, at the top of the avenue- 29 cents for a 500 ml bottle of water. There is a taxi stand diagonally opposite hotel, the government has fixed taxi prices to Fumicino airport at 40 euros, not 70 euros as advertised at hotel reception. There is a bus which will take passengers single or return journey from airport to Termini train station in Rome for 8 euros each person each way ( 16 return ) ( 1 hour journey time each way), alternatively train costs 14-16 euros per person each way ( half hour journey time) Recommend to buy an underground 3 day pass (11 euros per person) or a Roma pass ( 22 euro per person). Find restaurants away from the tourists areas to avoid paying \u00a3120+ for an evening meal for two. Worth visiting the main tourist attractions . Vatican costs free to visit the church a wonderful experience. Sistine chapel and other museums in the vatican cost 15 euros so much to see.

We spent 10 days in this hotel. Our travel agent had built it up very high, as you wld expect for the price, and when we expressed our concerns over other trip advisor comments, she claimed they were untrue to that extent. HOWEVER, i must say right now, that this hotel is in NO WAY a four star superior by our standard. On initial impression the reception areas are fine, but on lugging our cases into the tiny elevators and arriving to our floor(6th) i was a little less impressed as the walls were for sure very shabby and in desperate need of a re-paint, room doors were like a yellow tar stain, door frames not on, door handles loose and ill fitting. On entrance to the room it was actually fine, except it was sooo hot, suffocatingly so we tried to put on the air conditioning to no avail. The reception said they not have air con working in the whole hotel, only the heating works at the moment and that our solution was to open the windows. Which we did, but it did not help much and we were faing the very busy Via Veneto road so it was very noisy all night. I phoned the reception, explaining i was pregnant and could not cope with this heat and asked for a fan which they did provide. The outside temp was lovely and to this day i have no idea why the room was so hot, all i can say is it must be their heating from below as we had our switched off. We were offered two other rooms but we refused as they were horrific, no natural light, floor to wall wood panelling, dark teak may i add(7th floor)! So we stayed with our original hot but somewhat modern room. Despite a restless sleep due to noise (open windows)and heat, the beds were quite comfortable. On waking we showered and went to breakfast. OH DEAR, for those who dont have it included unlike us DONT GO TO BREAKFAST!!!! it was the worst i have seen, and if u do choose to try the eggs and bacon, get early or they will be cold! I stuck to cereal, bread and a coffee. We did eat most times however for breaky. Via Veneto is a great location, i think one of the most pleasant we walked around, plenty of restaurants and close to a good few sights! This area is full of grand hotels. For dinner i would recommend gran caffe Roma which is the first as u walk down under a canopy, waiters are very friendly(unlike a lot of roman waiters) and the food lovely...the pasta with mushrooms was good and the steak excellent! A little further down was a good one which sells lots of seafood, i had the grilled salmon which was very nice also. There are numerous restaurants some are great, others not so. Back at the hotel the swimming pool although attractive looking, is so small you can barely swin alongside anyone else. The spa is in no way like a spa here. My partner and i both booked a massage for the same time, his older lady was fine, but my younger lass gently stroked my back for 55 euros for 30 mins, despite me asking her to be a little firmer. I would not stay at this hotel again purely due to the fact it was not as high a standard as it charges, and lack of things to do(i.e pool too small and tv only has CNN repeated) it cost 18 euro for to watch the english movie! By day of course you are out sightseeing and for dinner also, but some nights we just wanted to relax and found it hard within this hotel. As for the staff, breakfast staff not friendly at all, bar staff never around and always on their mobile phones when they are rarely seen, reception staff i have no complaints over.

The front desk people were rude to us and members of our group, one of our group asked for a new box of Kleenex and was told to use toilet paper (by the Front Desk Manager!). When you walk in the front lobby is beautiful and that is where it ends. Our room was in desperate need of attention, the bed was worn out and generally dirty. The bathroom was very dirty and in need of refreshing. Things like the tub was moldy and the tile was in bad condition. The shower...oh boy, look out you may get scalded as the water goes hot cold, hot cold, hot cold all the time the water is on. The bar was not staffed and would not have been worth having a drink there any way as the selection was very poor. The breakfast was okay but the staff was very un-friendly; my wife and I had an early departure so we wanted to get in right away to eat. We walked through the doors four minutes to 7:00AM and were told that \"we aren't open until 7:00\" and were not seated or asked if we needed anything to drink. As of this point I will never stay at the Boscolo chain of hotels again as they are not worthy of their price and are no better than a $25.00 hotel in America. Upon checkout they told me that I owed another 5 Euro for a bottle of water which neither my wife or I had. I told them that I would not pay for it and the woman behind the desk was very rude and disrespectful.The other members of our group had similar experiences and I'm sure will not be staying at any Boscolo's after this experience either.

The washroom was on the moldy side but if your vision's not 20/20, it's hardly noticeable. You will, however, notice the air conditioning. You can hear it working but don't expect to feel it. We stayed here for 5 nights and our room was never more than a degree or two cooler than the outdoor temperature ... and, yes, I had the thermostat at its coldest setting.

Service was superb, room was fantastic (with the largest bathroom I have seen ever), located very close to all amenities including outside restaurants, bars, shopping:) and sites, need walking shoes but what a beautiful city.
