We were absolutely glad with what we have. Breakfast was good: fresh bread, cucumbers, tomatoes, eggs, corn flakes, cheese, salami, olives, apples, tea, coffe, milk, natural yoghurt, cream-cheese, jam, honey, butter. For us - more than enough. You can always order there fresh juice or turkish coffe for a lowest price! View from the breakfast terras is better than at these photos! Staff is very, very friendly! Internet was ok in our room, atleast we watched movies online! The location couldn't be better - on the way to every direction: Sultanahmed (3 min), Eminonu (7 min), Divan Yolu street.

It's quick walk to either of two stops on the T1 (red) tram - you can connect to/from the M1 (blue) Metro line to the airport easily to/from this tram at Zeytinburnu station. If you want to venture into the hip-and-happening Galata district across the Golden Horn, it's an easy tram ride from either of the two nearby stops. The staff is very friendly and all speak English. If you're lucky enough to be there when the owner is around, he well delight you with tips and stories about the city. I stayed in one of the \"cheap\" rooms which I found to be perfectly fine for the budget traveler who's too old for hosteling. Small but with all the amenities you'd expect from a typical American motel room. I didn't care for the prayers that are blasted over loudspeakers several times of day being so loud in the room. But then again this is a district with some of the most historic mosques in the world so really every hotel in the area will experience this.

I was not interested in nightlife, other than walking and seeing the monuments illuminated at night.

We were there in the middle of a snow-filled week, certainly not the tourist season so maybe there is more nightlife in another season. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate. Our bathroom was chilly, but, to be fair I never complained about it so maybe there would have been an easy fix to the problem.

I coudn't believe how tiny the room was on arrival so we asked to be moved to a larger room, unfortunately the bigger rooms only have twin beds but decided to take it as it was much bigger. The air-con units in the rooms are from the 70's - they are so loud one can hardly sleep! The rooms are tiny with no space to move around at all! We managed to change our room to a bigger one facing the road. The breakfast buffet is very average with no fruit juice on offer, unless you request it, which is an additional cost. On receiving our bill we were charged in Euros!! Why when we are dealing in Turkish Lira. So we expected to may 2 Turkish Lira we were actually charged 2 Euros - big difference! Had we known we wouldn't have bought juice each morning, what a rip-off! On leaving our passports at reception on arrival, we popped out for lunch, on returning their was no-one at reception & our passports were lying on the counter!!! How irresponsible, anyone could have walked in & taken them. The internet connection in the room is virtually non-existant and continually disappears! We asked for our washing to be laundered & dried before departure, it arrived back in our room damp!! We had to quickly hang it all over the room in order to try and get it dry before packing it into our suitcases. The bathrooms seem to be back to back between rooms and must share ventilation as we were up all night listening to another guest vomiting, it felt like she was in our bathroom!!

They provided an excellent breakfast each morning on the upstairs terrace cafe. They had good coffee, fresh vegetables, cold cuts, yogurt, cereal, bread and of course olives. The breakfast hours are quite generous from 7:30 to 11. On our first morning on the terrace we met Abe who was most gracious in helping point out the different sites we shouldn't miss as well as showing us where the local supermarket and pharmacy was located. The rooms were quite clean and tidy as well as the reception area. The hotel provided for our initial transportation from the airport and called for an inexpensive shuttle back to the airport when we left. We stayed one week, then flew south for a week and came back for one night before our flight back home; the hotel staff secured one of our bags that we would not need for our trip south. WiFi internet is available, I was able to connect no problem during our first week, on our final night we were at the far end of the downstairs hallway and not able to connect to the internet, but it's a short walk to reception where you can connect in the sitting area, they actually provide a computer if you need. Laundry is available as well, they charge a nominal fee per load, not garment. The rooms are small as you would expect for the location and budget characteristic of the hotel. You can prepare by packing light and being very organized. There is a closet for you to unpack and keep your bags, a refrigerator with items for purchase and a small area to store your toiletries in the bathroom. The beds are very comfortable, there's cable tv but only a few stations and not much in English, we spent the time calling people using Skype on my smart phone. Since there is so much to see and do in Istanbul, you won't be spending much time in your room anyway. The hotel is practically in the center of everything to see in Sultanamet. It is on a quiet street a block from the busy tramway which will take you to all the big sites. There is a nice view of Aya Sophia from the hotel so you are very close to the Blue Mosque and Topkopi Palace as well, in fact the entrance gate to Topkopi Palace and the Archeological Museum is very very close and it's very easy to ride the tram to Beyoglu/Taksim. Plenty of restaurants in the area, Greens supermarket is very close, there's also a Starbucks if you walk up the tramway toward the Grand Bazaar.

Ideally situated a few minutes walk from all the main attractions, yet away from the hustle and bustle so a quiet nights sleep was possible ( apart from the early morning call to prayer but you would get that anywhere!) Breakfast as stated in earlier reviews was basic but by no means inedible. Probably would get a little fed up with it though if staying longer than a few days. Ask to see the church underneath the hotel...it is amazing!!! If you want to save a good deal of money on airport transfer take the train from the airport to zeytinburnu then pick up a tram to sultanahment....perfect and only worked out to \u00c2\u00a33.00 for my partner and I one way!!!

I can't comment on the hotel itself, but I can comment on the hoops required to book with them. I ended up getting a good rate with this hotel for one night on the way out of Istanbul, arriving from Cappadocia. I had read the reviews and was happy. It was short-lived. I originally called the hotel to make the reservation (well ahead of time) but after I provided my information, they insisted that I email them to make the reservation. Ok, so I emailed them all my information and they emailed me back to say everything was set. They requested that I email them once again to confirm confirm confirm the booking. So, I emailed them again to confirm my previous phone call and email. Things were starting to get complicated. About a week later, I receive a rather odd email suggesting that my initial email was not received properly, but that I did not have to take any action as it was still received. I should point out that in almost 10 years of using my hotmail account, I have never received such an email. Ok fine, but I decided to email them AGAIN anyway. The response I got said that they were fully booked. Curious. Annoying. I had initially received a special rate and the cinic in me wondered (as Istanbul became surprisingly abnormally busy while I was there and hotels filled up) whether a higher rate was quoted and paid by a walk-in guest. My paranoia was echoed by a few locals who explained to me that this was a somewhat common practice amongst some hotels--reservations made at lower discount rates dissappear if hotels fill up and full-rate rooms can be sold. Not that I can definitively say this was the case, but I question why, after a phone call and at least one email, they didn't at least try and get in touch with me before they gave my room away. Not even an email? Curious. At least they were very polite whilst I was being screwed over. Anyhow, just let this review serve as a warning to make sure you are triple-confirmed in stone before you leave for your travels. I had to waste about two hours trying to book another hotel, while I was traveling. Pain in the ash. The story ends well though--I got a room in the AND HOTEL which, in my opinion, has the most stunning patio and view of Istanbul. I would stay in the AND HOTEL just for the view of Sultanahmet. The service there was excellent and the location was right smack in the middle of Sultanahmet. A hearty breakfast was included, again with the awesome view.

It's located in a quiet alley/one-way street next to a small mosque. It's within walking distance to many attractions: Gulhane Park, Topkapi Palace, Classical Archaeological Museum, Ancient Oriental Works Museum, Aya Sofia (Hagia Sofia), the beautiful Sultan Ahmet Camii (Blue Mosque), and Basilica Cistern. The hotel seems like it's family run, and the owner is frequently around to greet guests and offer transportation or sightseeing advice. When you check in they request your passport to register with the police (which is standard procedure in Istanbul). The rooms are small but very clean and comfortable. Ours had a queen size bed with nightstands , a small table/cabinet, small refridgerator, large armoire with drawers inside, and a medium sized wall mounted television. There was also a large mirror and a large window overlooking the deck/breakfast area. The bathrooms are also very tiny, but clean and modern. Small pedestal sink with mirror, toilet, and shower only (no tub in our room, not sure about others). Shower had great water pressure and temp consistancy. It is very narrow so it may not be suitable for those with larger body types. Also note that there wasn't much space to put toiletries as there really wasn't any counterspace at all. Sounds pretty cramped doesn't it? If you're looking for a hotel to lounge around in for many hours of the day, this one probably won't be your first pick. We didn't want to be tempted to do this so this hotel was perfect, but we did feel relaxed and comfortable at the end of each day when we returned. Breakfast is included with the room and the patio/deck area where it is served is typical of the area and has gorgeous views both during the day and at night. You can see the Aya Sofia while drinking a cup of coffee. There is a glass enclosed indoor area where the buffet style breakfast is served and additional seating outside if you wish. It's a nice area to mingle with the owner and other guests! Breakfast is simple but filling. Coffee (instant), Tea, sweet rolls, crusty rolls, cheese, butter, jam, a few coldcuts, hot boiled eggs, olives,sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, and fruit are the usual selections. Some things to be aware of -throughout Istanbul the mosques sing out a call to prayer several times a day. This can be heard everywhere in the city but particularly in this area as there is a mosque directly next to the hotel. Some people found this bothersome, we found it rather beautiful and soothing. -the hotel offers transportation to and from the airport at a cost of 35euro. I believe it's cheaper to hire a taxi @ approx 20-25euro. Also some hotels charge the driver a fee if they call a taxi for you, which the driver will usually pass onto you. Don't have the hotel call for you, just step out to the main st where there will be plenty of taxi going by. -Hotel does not have an elevator. Only a small spiralling staircase. It would be unsuitable for disabled people, but they happily assist those who need bags carried to the rooms. Overall a very nice budget hotel in a perfect area to see \"old\" Istanbul.

From the moment we were picked up at the airport to the very moment we departed, the staff of the hotel was always courteous, kind and charming. I have only experienced this kind of service once before from a 5 Star hotel -- so it was refreshing to say the least. The hotel itself is much like many others in the Sultanahmet District -- small, cozy and charming. Rooms are nicely air conditioned (individualy controlled with remote) and extremely clean. A TV is in the room with remote, mini-bar stocked with beverages and a dresser to hang your clothes in. Tile flooring lays upon the ground, so be sure to bring some slippers, as the floor can get cold at night. The bed is very comfortable -- nice firm mattress with heavy duty blankets. The window is a bit tricky to understand at first, as it opens in two different directions -- so make sure you ask how to open & close them properly. The Maid service is wonderful and they do a great job cleaning the rooms... so remember to leave them one Turkish Lire on the bed room because they work hard! I don't know what they used to clean the floors, but whatever it is, it always smelled wonderful whenever we came back into the room after they cleaned it. :-) There is also wireless internet connection throughout all of the hotel, including your room. If you cannot get it to work, just ask if they can reboot the main computer and this will fix the problem. But just remember -- the ADSL service in Turkey is not very good, so do not expect ADSL speeds you typically get from the US -- because that just ain't gonna happen! ;-) One of the nicest things about this hotel is the terrace. It overlooks St. Sophia, and I kid you not, Eli Manning could cold throw a football onto the roof if he were here. The photos I took do not begin to justify how close St. Sophia really is to the terrace! The terrace also has many plants and is decorated very nicely. Breakfast is served on the terrace everyday and is your typical Turkish breakfast with bread, some deli meat, olives, boiled eggs, hot water, nescafe coffee, pudding cakes and cereal with milk. While this breakfast might be considered \"light\" to many Westerners, I assure you, it's enough to begin your day and allow you to really feast on the finer Turkish foods throughout the rest of your day as you hit the streets viewing the sights. :-) Now, as for the staff, all I can say is \"Wow!\" They are great and go above and beyond the call of duty. You will not feel like a guest in a hotel here -- but more like a guest in their home. They are all kind, speak very good English and all of them are extremely charming. When we first arrived, I mentioned to Abraham that I wanted to eat pancakes and if he could recommend a place for us to eat at. He actually got a recipe from his girlfriend and made them for us! It was great! Seriously, they go out of their way to make sure you're happy. He also drove us around town to find us some manufacturers of leather goods -- all on his own time! I am still blown away by the wonderful service this charming little hotel has to offer! If you have any questions at all about where to go -- just ask them! If you want to go bowling -- just ask! Well, actually, you might want to scrap that idea, as the bowling alley here in Istanbul is terrible! (Ha!) The bottom line, when staying in Istanbul, you must ask yourself one thing... would you rather be close to everything and stay in a hotel that treats you like a guest in their home? Or would you rather stay in a hotel that treats you in accordance to the amount you had paid? You can pay $200 per night and still not get the service we got from the Zeynep Hotel... sure, you might get a larger room and larger bathroom... but for the extra $120 per night, you can see a lot more of Istanbul, gain 40 pounds from eating great food and allow the Turkish people to \"Show you how to spend your money in their stores!\" Think about it!!! ;-)", "Date": "October 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cgood location\u201d", "Author": "pri", "ReviewID": "UR5890353", "Content": "I went to Zeynep Sultan Hotel in March this year with my family. We booked a room for three people. We received a room on ground floor which was rather small but nicely decorated and immaculately clean. It was still cold in March and we did have problems with the heating in the room at first. We called the staff to help us sort it out several times during the first few days who did finally managed to it on our day two. Our room window backed to another hotel and all we could see from it was another wall but the view from the rooftop terrace where we had breakfast in the morning was wonderfull. The breakfast itself was very nice too. My mother fell in love with their turkish coffee and we had to buy some for her to take home. Their honey, bread and olives stuffed with peppers are divine. I came to Istanbul with a very bad cough which I just could not shift but after couple of days there, it completely dissapeared. I am still convinced that this was something to do with consuming large quantities of honey there. The staff there were extremely friendly and helpfull. We also met the owner of the hotel Ibrahim who was kind enough to point us to some of the best attractions in the city. I did however find some of his comments a bit off putting. His comment to the prayer calls from the local mosques \"Enough already\" I found a bit disrespectfull. It was also contradictory as there is a chapel in the basement of the hotel. Another negative about the hotel was transport to the airport. From the airport we took a taxi which cost me approximately \u00c2\u00a310. Hotel's transport price to the airport was much more than that which I found quite unreasonable. We did not expect a free ride as we booked via Expedia but I did expect to pay around the same price as the local taxis. As far as Istanbul is concerned, ever since I came back , I have been talking about going back there. My family and I absolutely loved it. Staying in the Sultanahmet area felt like being transported back to the Ottoman period. The atmosphere in the city is amazing. Sitting in the garden in front of the Blue Mosque during lunch time prayer is very spiritually moving and enlightening. Views from the Topkapi palace are breathtaking.

Our room was not small, as it had an extra bed where we placed our luggage (we payed for a twin room). But even without this extra bed, I would have considered the room as good sized. I suppose that it depends on your standards. For me, and for the price I payed, a room with a wardrobe, a table to place the luggage, a TV and a large bed (and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever found in a hotel) is ok. I just heard the call to pray the first night (maybe I was so tired -and the bed was so comfortable- that I didn't hear anything the rest of nights!). The room and bathroom were spotless and the air conditioning worked perfectly (without noise). We could watch the spanish international channel, something we had not found in other hotels, and was nice to see the news in our mother tongue, as our english is poor.

The owner made a real point of mingling with the guests at breakfast and gave useful tips on how to organise your own outings rather than joining the organised cattle herds. The outside tables on the roof terrace are hugely popular with all breakfast guests but even when they're all taken, no problem - the guys will carry another table out for you! The room I stayed in was relatively small (that was fine as I was by myself), clean, air-conditioned and in a good state of repair. The bathroom was also small but plumbing worked perfectly (more than can be said of most British hotels!!!). Only minus point was the rather variable standard of cleaning. Towels weren't changed automatically (I guess you have to ask). Tip: do take some earplugs, as the hotel is right next to the Zeynep Sultan Mosque - calls to prayer start at 5.30am sharp!

Two weeks before arrival we reconfirmed our booking and were advised we could only get the twin room for 5 nights - and asked us nicely if we would agree to a 6th night at the neighbouring AND hotel - offering us complimentary pick up service (we did not book directly so were not entitled to it). We accepted - and upon arrival at Ataturk Airport, our driver was there to greet us upon (our late) arrival with a smile - a very nice man. On checking in we were advised that all nights would be at the Zeynep Sultan Hotel and once we saw our oom we were glad!. We booked a \"grande\" twin room on Venere for 6 nights. The room was large not grande - but not a problem. The hotel itself rates **+ , possibly *** by North American standards. The hotel offers limited amenities, these being the large breakfast room with terrace (think Super 8 but better and much cleaner) and free access to the Internet station. It is a new hotel 2 years old we were told - and looks it - in great shape. Our 3rd floor room, and the entire hotel is simply spotless - and in Istanbul this reason alone is good enough to stay here. Safety devices abound - with fire/smoke and security cameras every where - you are in good hands in this place. Our twin room had a 3rd bed that held our luggage and a small but adequate bathroom with shower. We looked at other rooms when they were being cleaned - and the hotels website portrays all rooms exactly as you will get them (no need for my pics to be posted here). The airconditioning worked VERY well - as did the TV, lighting etc. Very high tech systems. Bathroom was spotless, so much so I looked for mildew and found none, wondering how they could keep them so clean until I heard the cleaning lady one morning with her nose to the grind. Breakfast on the lovely terrace is typically Turkish - simple, light and adequate. Need a mid morning snack? Lots of great places for that!! The view from the breakfast terrace with the Zynep Sultan Mosque (from which the hotel gets its name next door) against the larger Hagia Sophia is particularly breathtaking. Service at the hotel was better than \"average\". We had laundry done, asked for restaurant recommendations etc. We also had the driver take us back to the airport at the exact time we wanted and we paid 20 Euros for that convenience and since we now had 5 large suitcases it was convenient to be dropped off at the right terminal door. The Owner was polite and tactful in approaching guests (my observation). Some guests seem to prefer to chat up the staff and Owner - while others like us are quiet and private. The Owner and staff are avialable to chat - you just need to make the effort to engage them - otherwise they remain respectfully aloof. At all times we were greeted with \"hellos\" and \"good mornings\" etc. As for the location - it is better than good - it is the best - bar none. The tram at Gulane Tram Station is 125 feet away - and takes you accross the Galata Bridge to the last stop on the tramline to directly connect on the funicular to Taksim Square. We used it every night! As for the Tokapi Palace and Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque - they are accross the street - no other hotel offers such convenience. Would we stay here again? In a heartbeat. If the hotel Owner is reading this - I would recommend you host a Raki Cocktail hour (1 complimentary drink) so guests can greet and meet on the great terrace in the early evenings before they go out dinner - & leran about Raki. The terrace is a great place and a cocktail hour may help create the \"boutique hotel\" feel. Pros: 1. great location to historic sites & tram to Taksim Square 2. clean (spotless) comfortable rooms, great beds and linens 3. great breakfast terrace, light but adequate breakfast, sit back and enjoy and evening drink before going out for dinner 4.

I was especially happy to see Duran as he is a shining example of Turkish hospitality as are the rest of the staff. Yes, the rooms are small, but so are most rooms in this price range, but they are immaculately clean and the location cannot be beat. Breakfast is not a full American breakfast or an elaborate buffet, but rather a Turkish breakfast. It is important to remember that most Turks just grab a pastry and some coffee or tea for breakfast and head off to work.

Our experiences in chronological order were as follows: 1. We were allocated a twin room (on the basis that all double rooms were apparently full) despite booking a double room over one month in advance; 2. The room we were allocated was so small that there was barely any floor space around the beds; 3. The 'breakfast' if you can even call it that consisted of little more than bread and two different varieties of cured meats - juice and water were provided upon request but at additional cost; 4. After returning to our room from doing some sightseeing on the second day and discovering that the room had been made up despite us having left the 'Do not disturb' sign on the door we were shocked to find that a strap on one of our bags had been completely torn away (we can only assume by the cleaning staff). Upon raising this issue with the Manager he stated that 'this was not possible' (a position that was later reitterated by the owner)and that it was in fact his word against ours; 5. Despite the fact that the package we booked for this hotel included a free transfer to the airport the Manager informed us that since our booking the hotel's policy had changed and that free transfers were only provided to guests staying for three nights or more (we stayed for two).

I think that something to bear in mind is that it is a 2 to 2\u00c2\u00bd star establishment which is not always clear, given the reviews and the position in tripadvisor (number 2 at the time we booked). Pros: -This hotel has character and is in a superb location within walking distance of all the main sights in the historical centre. -The room and the bathroom were very clean. -The room had some nice touches. -The young men at reception were extremely warm, friendly and helpful. Cons: - The room is very small, as is the bathroom. We were made to understand that we had one of the bigger rooms, so I imagine that the smaller ones could be very cramped. We specifically booked a La Grande Deluxe room through Venere so were somewhat disappointed. - The hospitality and friendliness of the owner is something that comes across quite strongly in most of the reviews. Our experience of this was quite different. We were booked in for a 6 night stay, and despite initiating conversation with the owner on 2 occasions, he never remembered us, nor greeted or talked to us in the same manner as he did with the other, predominantly American and European guests. We felt quite disheartened by this attitude. On the last two days of the holiday, after my husband spent time watching a football match with him and chatted to him, he warmed up and was friendly. However, overall I felt that we were in fact treated differently from the other customers, and felt that our race was key. I understand that different guests have different experience, but this was our experience. - The breakfast was very very basic, with no complimentary drinks other than tea or coffee, not even water or juice. - We had read on the website that the hotel offered a cash discount which we confirmed on arrival. On leaving we were told that this did not apply to us as we had not booked through the hotel directly. This was fine in itself, but created a logistical problem as we had gotten rid of our Turkish lira apart from the anticipated total. When paying we were a 3 lira short. We had stayed for a week, and this represented a miniscule amount of the total bill. The night manager insisted that the only option was for us to pay the difference in Euros which would have resulted in us receiving a massive amount of lira in change. Eventually we opted to put the additional amount on our credit card. In conclusion, the hotel is convenient and clean and represents good value for money if you have the correct expectations. However, if you are not white, do not expect the same level of interaction and attention that the other reviews have you believe.

There was not much of a selection of the breakfast contents.

Safe, Clean, Convenient, Friendly, Quiet and Comfortable are just the beginning adjectives. Here you are not just a room number, but more of an invited guest. Not a tourist, but a traveler. We spent four and a half glorious days discovering the city and the whole adventure was made sweeter by the time spent visiting with Ibraham and his nephew and staff. History and politics of the city, local customs, restaurants and must-do tours were all discussed at breakfast on the terrace each morning. Where to go, how to get there, \"wait a second, I'll show you,\" \"let me get you a taxi,\" \"when you are at the Topaki Palace, have lunch in its reastaurant. It's touristy, but the view is great and you are already there.\" It would be easy to continue singing the praises of this hotel, but why go on, I think you have the picture. Why would anyone want to stay anywhere else. Thanks Ibrahim.

The hotel has a near perfect location, in walking distance from all of the sights in Sultanahmet and the Bazaar district, and with easy access to taxis, trams and boats to get around all Istanbul and Bosphorus. In addition the staff is very friendly, and very helpful towards any questions you may have. The rooms are not big, but with more than enough room to be able to relax there after a long day of sightseeing. The standard is high; very clean rooms with TV, mini bar and air condition, there is free internet access and safe at your disposal, and the terrace on the roof is nice both for breakfast and for relaxing in the afternoon. All in all we had a brilliant holiday in Istanbul, much thanks to our nice stay at Zeynep Sultan!", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cRight place, right price, wonderful staff\u201d", "Author": "JM47York", "ReviewID": "UR5296820", "Content": "We have just returned from a splendid four night stay in this lovely city. We found this hotel through Trip Advisor and booked it as a result of the reviews. The owner, Ibrahim, his staff and hotel, more than live up to all that has been said in the other reviews. The location is ideal for the old city sights with Topkapi, St Sophia and the Blue Mosque in the immediate vicinity and the Grand Bazaar and Ferry Terminals a short walk away. The rooms are ideal for a short break, the breakfast sets one up for the day and is taken on a roof restaurant/balcony overlooking St Sophia, while Ibrahim and his team readily dispense excellent and helpful itinerary and directional advice. The customer care is superb and included, in our case, a member of staff walking us to the ferry to ensure we got on the correct boat for the Bosphorous cruise and unsolicited coffee and cake at 0500 prior to a very early departure. We are extremely satisfied customers who hope to visit again.", "Date": "June 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Broomfield, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBest value, clean and personable\u201d", "Author": "zeusreign", "ReviewID": "UR5055669", "Content": "I would agree with everything said. Simple but very clean and convenient. Free internet access too. My single room was smaller than my master bathroom at home but it was fine. The call to prayer was the only inconvenience that I can think of. The terrace views were great and the Owner always had good and honest suggestions of where to go for food, etc. If you get tired of the mosques go to Fener for Sunday Christian service. We were there when the Patriarch or the Orthodox church was there and not out visiting some other country and it was great. The Owner even gave us a ride. Very Nice!!
