The room was clean, the beds were made every day towels and soap changed daily. There is an elevator. The breakfast was exactly what they said a cup of coffee and a pastry. What is great about the hotel is its location. very close to Espainya circle where you can get the underground train to where ever you need in Barcelona. Also near by there is an internet cafe and some small shops where you can get bottled water and what ever else you need. Its not the Hilton but for about $80 a night for 2 two you can't beat it.

We arrived at the hotel to a woman at reception who was on the phone for 10 minutes laughing and joking and did not even acknowledge we were there. After finally checking in, a small old gentleman who could not speak any english took us up one floor to room 103, I put the key in the lock and it would not turn, after spending 5 minutes trying to open the obviously broken doorlock, we managed to gain entry. We tried the key again while the door was open, it still would not work, I suggested he got the master key, which he did, it still did not work, so I insisted on another room to him, we went to reception, explained to the woman on reception what had happened, I said I would like another room, she said \"ANOTHER ROOM!\" and tutted! and gave me the key to room 203. Very unhelpful staff who do not speak english at all. Breakfast, what a joke a cup of coffee and a croissant!! thats it! The rooms were grey tiled with cracks all over and very cold, the bathroom was the same. A very small tv with 6 spanish channels next to the ceiling! a dirty little wardrobe with one spare pillow with pen marks all over it. Its a good location for getting to the centre of the city, and thats all, I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel unless its the last one in Barcelona, and I have been to alot of European countries and Barcelona itself 4 times now and this was the worst hotel yet.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "indiana", "Title": "\u201coverpriced\u201d", "Author": "iindianadave", "ReviewID": "UR47762765", "Content": "This hotel is within walking of the Plaza De Espana.

I went to Barcelona for work to attend an industry event held at the Fira de Barcelona convention center and used some vacation time to extend my time there. The Hotel Climent is perfectly situated for getting to the convention center easily, taking under 5 minutes on foot to get there from the hotel. Since there\u2019s a subway station at the convention center as well, getting elsewhere in the city via public transportation is a cinch. It\u2019s also pretty inexpensive at 43 Euros per night in the off-season compared to many other hotels I researched. I had a single room and it was tiny. And I mean tiny. I didn\u2019t expect anything different having lived in and traveled around Europe before, but it may be a surprise to Americans who are used to hotel room sizes in the U.S., so be forewarned. In addition to a single bed, there was a wardrobe, a small desk and chair, and a miniscule TV mounted to the wall. The bathroom had a miniature tub with a handheld shower head, and a small window with frosted glass above the toilet. A large-ish window in the room itself looked out over the side street and it seemed to be single-paned, blocking out no noise from the street whatsoever. While towels and a small bar of soap were supplied, there were no other extras aside from an additional blanket in the wardrobe, which I made use of immediately since it got pretty cool at night, even for me and I\u2019m the type of person who likes a chilly room for sleeping. I was able to borrow a hair dryer by asking at the front desk since I had forgotten mine, but it appeared to be the only one they had to loan out, so bring your own travel dryer in case another guest borrows it before you get to it. Additionally, this hair dryer seemed to be on its last legs, making a distressing rattling sound when I used it. I\u2019m not sure it will survive much longer. In terms of entertainment, only a few channels are available for your television viewing pleasure, all in Spanish and most with very poor reception. There was no alarm clock in the room so my cell phone did double duty to get me out of bed in the mornings. There is no safe in the room, so I think your only option would be to ask the front desk to hold on to your valuables if you are concerned about theft. There is a closed circuit television monitoring system to allow the person at the front desk to see the open areas in the hotel, and during my extensive time on the couch in the lobby while working, it appeared that they did a great job of only allowing access to current guests, and I did not worry about anything getting stolen from my room. The room was clean when I arrived and was cleaned daily while I was out roaming the city. At the time of my stay in March, daytime temperatures were in the mid-50\u2019s and it got a bit brisk at night. Heat was provided by a single radiator in the room with a dial to adjust it up or down, though the range of adjustment was pretty small. There was no heating control in my room otherwise, and it appeared that it was all controlled centrally. I saw no vents to provide air conditioning in the summer, so my guess is that the windows are it when it comes to cooling down the room in warmer weather. The floors throughout the hotel are all tile, mostly in that industrial gray flecked pattern popular in municipal buildings and old schools. I went out and bought slippers on my second day there since I couldn\u2019t bear to walk around barefoot in the room, particularly in the mornings when the floor felt like a block of ice. I had no problems with hot water or the toilet. I did notice a distinct sewage-like smell that appeared to issue from the drains, which is frankly not uncommon in older European buildings. I don\u2019t think they were keen on including stink traps (a curved section in the piping below drains meant to trap water in order to block smells from the sewage system) in many of the older buildings throughout Europe. I almost always bring a small tinned candle when I travel and this helped greatly, along with plugging the drains at night before I went to bed and leaving the bathroom window open during the day when I was gone. The front desk is staffed 24/7 and I found that only one of them spoke English well enough to converse with and none spoke French at all. I speak French and a little bit of Spanish, though Catalan is well beyond my abilities. The one year of high school Spanish I took was sufficient to get me around for the most part, with many kind Spaniards taking pity on me and speaking more slowly and inserting some English when they realized my Spanish vocabulary was exceptionally limited. I had a Spanish/English dictionary and Spanish phrase book on my iPhone, to which I referred often, to help me out as well and I highly recommend bringing along similar tools if Spanish is not your forte. A small breakfast is included in the price of each room. This consists of a croissant or other similar pastry and a cup of espresso. While not much compared to what\u2019s offered in the U.S., it is entirely sufficient to kick off a day full of sight-seeing. Breakfast is served in a small room off the lobby set up like a simple bar with a few tables. I wouldn\u2019t recommend that you try to get breakfast somewhere else - save your hunger for later in the day to try some Spanish cuisine. Soda, bottled water, and other small food items are also sold at this small bar, but no full hot meals or anything. This bar is also open in the evening and seems to be a popular hang-out for locals to come watch soccer or movies among friends. They don\u2019t get too noisy, but keep this in mind if you are working in the lobby, which I did quite frequently since the hotel\u2019s WiFi network would not reach my room on the 5th floor. Speaking of the WiFi network, it may penetrate up one or 2 floors, but since it didn\u2019t got to my room, I spent many hours on the couch in the lobby working during the convention. The network was reasonably fast and I had no problems with it whatsoever. The network is password protected - just ask for it at the front desk when you arrive. There are no ethernet ports in the rooms, so this will be the only way to get a free internet connection in the hotel. There is a phone in each room, though there are no instruction cards or other information in the room to help you make a call, local or otherwise. I did not use the phone in my room at all so I cannot speak to the experience or prices - instead, I purchased a local SIM card from Phone House, a cell phone chain store, that was just a 7-minute walk from the hotel to use in my unlocked cell phone. All in all, I think the Hotel Climent is a great value if you go to Barcelona to see the sights, and particularly to attend any events at the Fira de Barcelona convention center. It\u2019s not the quietest nor is it anything close to being luxurious and is really best if you will spend most of your time outside of the room in Barcelona for work or pleasure. If I were going to Barcelona again for a convention at the Fira de Barcelona, I would definitely opt to stay there again if my company again imposed a strict budget on my expenses. If I were going to Barcelona again with someone else and planned to spend most of the time sight-seeing, I would also choose to stay there again. I would not choose to stay there again if I wanted to have a romantic getaway with my husband. I hope this review helps you!
