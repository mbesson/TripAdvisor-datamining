We had a one bedroom apartment. What a treat. Absolutely immaculate. Comes with Fridge (and small freezer), washing machine, CD/Radio system, tumble dryer, dishwasher, halogen oven/microwave,two ring halogen cooker, two flat screen TV's (lounge and bedroom) choice of channels a bit poor, usual news only, but plenty of buy it films and saucy ones too. Most importantly, bathroom was immaculate, good water pressure, plenty of hot water, and plenty of towels. Room service was every day, cleaned and freshened, bedding change every 3 days, but more often if requested.The apartment was spacious and tastefully decorated, air conditioning was efficient and virtually silent. So far So good. Front desk staff were very welcoming and helpful, multi-lingual, which really helps as I guess, like most Brits (to my shame), I hardly speak any other language than English. Not sure that the breakfast was value for money, it appeared to be 19euros a head, which we thought was a bit steep. So we never used the restaurant and as such cant make a comment on that. However, there is a couple of supermarkets within a couple of minutes where we just stocked up. the apartments building also had a small swimming pool and spa bath, and a sauna in the basement, all very clean. The apartments were close to Check Point Charlie just on the old eastern side of the Berlin Wall, and within a five minute walk of Stradmitte Underground train station. All other sites to see were really easily accessible using the public transport system, which we got the hang of in the first day. If we can do that, then anyone can, believe me. If your a sight seer, then get a \"Welcome to Berlin\" card, it costs around 36euros for 5 days, but means that all public transport is paid, and it also gives you a genuine 25% discount on virtually every paying sight, boat trip, walking tour, etc etc. We did two walking tours with \"Insider Tours\" (meets near Berlin Zoo, easy to find), absolutely recommend these costs about 12 euros with the discount, and lasts for about 4 - 6 hours. Along with all the other historical stuff on offer, well enjoy it, but leave some time to visit Berlin Zoo, you'll be glad you did. They have set it up in such a way, that you are virtually on the same level as the animals, without any intrusive fences etc to spoil the view.

It's the first time I've been let down by the recommendations. Let's start with the location. It's in a depressingly bleak street surrounded by crumbling high rises and right next to a main road. Cross the main road and the streets are nicer, as are the hotels. Why oh why didn't I stay there. The Adina itself was also a disappointment. I normally stay with them when travelling in Australia. I had high expectations which were not met: - We asked for a non smoking room but got smoking. - The surface of the cupboards had a thick layer of dust, so we had to clean it ourselves. - The kettle was full of grime and peeling plastic. We had to use a pot to boil our water. - The food in the Alto restaurant was very average. They try but fail at attempting Australian cuisine. Too fussy and stodgy. - Reception recommended the supermarket around the corner for groceries. Don't bother. Hardly any stock. Not even cereal. Walk an extra 5-10mins to Leipzigerstrasse (near Friedrichstrasse) to a bigger supermarket called Kaiser. On the positive, it forced us to look further afield for good food and coffee. The Barn on Augustrasse (near Hackeschermkt) serves beautiful coffee, cakes and light lunch. Very cool area, small cobbled streets. We also discovered a wonderful deli on Friedrichstrasse called Linder. Homemade cakes, salads, charcuterie etc to die for.

Flights to and from L/pool on Easyjet were excellent although parts of Speke and Schoenfeld Airport are in need of refurbishment. The Adina hotel is not! It's immaculate, modern and welcoming. The only thing it's missing is a jacuzzi in the 'spa' and a bath in our room , both would have helped rest our weary legs! The bar was cosy and reasonably priced The hotel is in a safe quiet location but within easy reach of most major sites. My favourites were the Jewish Museum ( need 3-4 hrs to do it justice), Gendarmenmarkt (Beautuiful square) , Hackesche Hoffe (the 8 courtyards are secreted way but are stunning) and the Reichststag. I'd not had confirmation back that we'd been given a tour slot for the visit to the parliament building (book it a week before you go) so we turned up 'blind', It was a great feeling to see our names on the list and be guided through the slick security, be handed free audio guides and entry to the glass dome (Like charlie and the choc factory but without the chocolate!). The dome is stunning and offers great views of the city Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, Topog of Terrors and the Holocaust museum are all must sees but it's easy to overdo the sightseeing and not take enough time out to relax and peoplewatch. The sony centre and Potsdamer Platz are worth a visit. It was extremely cold when were there so we took 'shelter' in the Ritz Carlton which is worth a visit if you want to see opulence! As is a vist to K De Werte dept store near Kurfurstendamm where the food hall and winter gardens on floors 6 and 7 are worth a vist if you are a foodie!

Nice shower, blow dryer.. literally the room had everything!! And the beds were amazingly comfortable as well. The only issue i would have would be the staff - While they were helpfull and very well mannered they weren't \"German-ly efficient\". I had ordered flowers and champagne upon arrival through e-mail which was acknowledged by them. they quoted the price 60 euro which i agreed. When we arrived (3 hours before check in) i asked about the flowers and they had no idea what i was talkin about so i we had to sort everything out again (while trying to discreetly fool the other half). I was told it would take an extra hour after check in to get this done. So paid with my debit card. We returned a half hour early as we were sweaty and tired from travelling all day. At the check in i asked why i had paid an extra 150 and was told it wasnt paid it was just reserved with for that amount. There was a lot of back and forward and i ended up giving them my card again and they tried to bill me a second time. I took my card back and rang my bank who explained the money is gone through to the hotel. I returned and explained what my bank had said and after repeating what was happening about 5 times the receptionist finally understood. This whole incident left me embarrassed and highly annoyed. We went to our room and were told the bags would be brought up and the flowers shortly after. after 45 mins there were still no sign of the bags. I got annoyed and went to walk out the door to bring the bags up myself and there was one of the staff standing there with flowers.. so that was the surprise ruined. She came in and placed the flowers on the table along with the champagne.. but only brought 1 glass and half the luggage.

Berlin is SUCH an amazing city (rivals Paris in my book) and our stay at this Adina only helped to enhance the experience. First of all, the location was perfect. It's between the Spittelmart and Stadmitte U-bahn stations, a 10 minute walk from either one. If you are coming from the airport make sure you have an up to date map. Ours was a bit out of date and we took the wrong trains, adding about an hour to our trip. But it's easy - S9 to Schonhauser Allee and U2 down to Spittelmart. Make sure you get out from the correct side of the station (check your map against the street exit markers on the station signs), stay on that side of the street (Leipzinger Strasse) and head straight down the street towards the Lidl. It's only a few minutes away. You'll pass a wonderful stone monument on your left so you'll know you are going the right way. Before you get to the Lidl there's a tall apartment building on the left, and open space with a small car park, and you will see the Adina sign in red on the 5 floor building building on the next street. Just make the left, walk past the apartment building, cross the street and you are there. Could not be easier. Check in was simple. The staff, as does most of the people we encountered in Berln, speak English. The lobby has two separate small lounge areas that are quite comfy and nicely decorated. Our room was simply fabulous. We stayed on the third floor, the smoking floor. The room had a full lounge area and then a separate bedroom (closing door and all!) The lounge area had a couch, desk, table for two to eat at, and then a kitchen which was better equipped than my own! It's an apartment hotel so it came complete with all dishes, glasses, mugs, pans for cooking, oven and hob, microwave and dishwasher! You could stay here for a very long time! The bedroom had a large comfy bed (a bit on the firm side but we like it that way) and the fully equipped bathroom was off the bedroom. The only thing that I can think of that the bathroom did not come with was a shower cap so bring your own. It did have washcloths, which you dont find in every hotel room in Europe. Oh yes, and a washer and dryer behind the door! The hotel has studios, 1 & 2 bedrooms and for a family I can not imagine a better place to stay. In fact we encountered a few families and anticipated that it would be noisy but it was one of the quietest places we've ever stayed! The room looked out over the inner courtyard, a great place to have that last glass of wine of the night before you trundle off upstairs exahausted from your day. They will also serve breakfast out there in the summer. We didn't have the breakfast but saw them setting up for the morning. On the corner of the hotel is the integrated restaurant ALTO. Not a huge menu but large enough. We had dinner there twice and was happy both times. The staff was friendly and efficient. My husband asked, offhandedly, the closing time of the leisure center and the waitress said she didnt know. We thanked her and thought nothing of it and had just planned to ask the front desk on the way out but she went off and found out for us. My only minor issue is that the drinks seemed to be a bit more pricey than at the restaurants and bars we'd been to during the stay but not outrageously so and to have a nice bar/restaurant, with three outside tables, in the hotel you are staying at is a plus so it balanced out. You can also take your drink out to the inner courtyard which we did most nights. I didn't venture down into the leisure center but the hubby was impressed. Lap pool, sauna, all the work out machines - he gave it the thumbs up. Oh and it closes at 10 (or was it 11 - sorry, don't recall!) As with most of the hotels we researched in Berlin, breakfast was not included and at 19 euros we thought it way too pricey for us. Two recommended alternatives - as you a full kitchen pop back to Leipzinger Strasse and head over to the Lidl for provisions. It actually has a few shops there in sort of mini mall and there's a bakery as well. If you want to be fully \"on vacation\" go across Leipzinger Strasse to the Irish Pub almost directly across the street. It's the closest place we found that does breakfast, and what a good breakfast it was!, for less than half the price of the one at the hotel. And if you are very lazy they serve it at least until about 1pm if not later. Also, the Irish waitress was just lovely and since she had been in Germany for 20 years we had a right old natter with her about how things used to be from her perspective. The price of our room, considering the location (could not be better), accomodation, services, etc was extremely good. We paid 95.20 euros for the first 3 nights and 87.50 for the last two nights. Now in another review I read the writer commented that they felt unsafe walking to the hotel at night. Personally, for me, I felt absolutely safe and we never had problem. It's a place where people live and they are out walking dogs, going for late dinners or drinks or just being about. There were no people just \"hanging around\", the buildings were not sad, depressing, dour as you might anticipate it being in the former GDR, and we walked back from our days out every night up to about 11pm and never, ever had a problem. The hotel is very well located for seeing the sights. You can either hop on the U-bahn, or more ideally, walk to a large number of sights. You find things even when you are aren't looking, like this amazing mural and memorial to the 17 June 1953 uprising which we just tripped across walking back from Potsdamer Platz along Leipzinger Strasse. I very much recommend the Adina Checkpoint Charlie and when we go back, which we must as 6 days was just not enough for this amazing city, I will go back to the Adina without hesitation.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIf you can afford to splash out a little bit, do it here!\u201d", "Author": "revel_in_this", "ReviewID": "UR114854890", "Content": "Beautiful hotel, massive rooms with everything you need, excellent location, free Internet in the lobby.

Our family was a group of three adults and had two apartments, Rooms 324 and 322.

I would say the apartments were done in Mid-Century Modern or maybe even Bauhaus style. Not an expert, so I could be wrong, but the apartments were tastefully furnished. Our apartment windows faced a lovely outdoor courtyard furnished with tables and chairs. The location was a very quiet and safe neighborhood in old East Berlin. A subway stop was nearby, as well as a small shopping strip that had a grocery, drug store, bakery, etc. Not a lot of shopping there but enough for your needs. And the subway will get you everywhere else...very centrally located for transportation. Berlin is more populous and spread out than you think from just looking at a map. The Adina seems to be somewhat far from the attractions, but not really since the subway is nearby. But being Berlin, you will walk your legs off, there's so much to see and do. Plan to spend an extra day here and take it a bit slower. We spent 3 days but should have planned at least 4. Also the Adina had a good wireless internet connection but only for 2 devices at a time [bad news if you have 2 iPhones, a Blackberry, an iPad and a laptop with you]. If you buy the internet subscription be aware that you can make a short subscription last a really long time if you log off. Not all of us knew that, so some of us had a subscription that lasted days and some of us paid and paid. [This is not always true at other hotels; some of them run the clock until it runs out.] We had requested non-smoking apartments but none were available when we checked in. Turns out there was no problem because there was really little smell in them. Also, while there is a washer and dryer some of the apartments, be aware that they don't operate entirely the same as American appliances. And the instructions are in German!

With another woman, when we asked about getting a tour, she simply said \"NEIN\" and went back to her business. The bright spot was a front desk staff member named Dirk, who was AWESOME.

The hotel is well situated for Berlin's museums and galleries and is only five minutes walk from the underground. We arrived early but were able to check in even though the advertised check in time is 2pm. The reception staff were all really helpful and had a high standard of English (compared to my mediocre German!). We stayed in a one bed apartment, which was a great size and very stylish. The hotel is in a boutique, modern style with lots of home comforts. There was a king size bed, flat screen TV in both the sitting room and bedroom, CD/MP3/Tuner plus a kitchenette with all the requisite equipment and utensils. You have to pay for internet access but I didn't think that was necessarily a bad thing. I work in digital media and spend my life on the internet so it was great to have an enforced break from it. We only connected on one evening in order to check out museums and galleries on the web. We used the pool/spa facilities on most evenings and found them to be very clean with plenty of robes and towels to hand. The sauna is a good size but wasn't busy anyway. Like the previous visitors, we also encountered the naked man but we are pretty free and easy about these things. I kept my bikini on but would have happily discarded it if there were others going down that route :-). As it was, we didn't encounter anyone else in the sauna during our stay so I wasn't sure what the accepted protocol was! We did read about a popular sauna in Berlin where it was compulsory to go naked so I don't think it's such a big deal in Germany. I actually think that's a good thing and personally wouldn't have felt threatened had I been alone in there (I'm female). There's even a section in the DDR museum that deals with the appeal of nude bathing in Berlin. The pool and spa pool were not busy but it was February after all. It might get a bit packed in the high season as the pool isn't that big. Also, there were very young children in there on one occasion so it was a little noisy and not relaxing. It would be great if it could be restricted to adults in the evening so it's more of a chill out space after a busy day of sightseeing. We are runners but decided to leave our trainers at home so didn't use the gym facilities. However, the gym looked very well equipped and wasn't busy at all. We ate twice in the restaurant, which was quiet due to the time of year. The service again was fabulous with friendly staff on both occasions. I had both pasta dishes, which were very tasty and my partner had the Aussie burger, which certainly was a feast! There were good Aussie wines to be had also due to the hotel group's Australian connections. The only criticism of the menu would be that there was only one vegetarian dish and it wasn't obvious from the menu that it was veggie. If you love meat, you'll be at home with the menu though. The desserts were very good too, which was true of all the desserts we had whilst in Berlin. We ate breakfast in our room most mornings, except for a rather fantastic breakfast in Gendarmenmarkt one day. We were able to purchase all we needed from the minimarket along Krausenstrasse or from the Lidl on the next street. Neither offer a particularly extensive range but are adequate for basics. It was great to have a leisurely start to each day before we set out around the city. I would highly recommend this hotel and thought it was great value for money. It was my second time in Berlin, the first time being in the early 90s so it has obviously changed quite a lot! It really is an amazing city and my partner who was there for the first time loved it. We'll definitely be returning soon and will probably stay at the new Adina Hackescher Markt hotel to experience a bit more of that district.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cOkay location, but great hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Pamanda", "ReviewID": "UR95859352", "Content": "I went to Berlin with my boyfriend to scope out the city for a potential job offer that I had. I had never been to Germany before, much less Berlin, and decided to stay in the part of the city known as Mitte - which is pretty much the center of town. Upon first glance, this hotel is located in a somewhat dodgy looking area (we arrived on a dreary rain soaked and incredibly windy day in February) but after wandering around a bit we discovered it was a quick walk to the UBahn (Subway) - about 5 minutes to the U2 or U6 line, and that it is also right near one of the big shopping streets, Freidrichstrasse (only about 5 minutes til you hit the street.) So while it seemed at first not to have too much around, it was not so far away from some more lively places. The hotel itself was beautiful. For about $130 a night we stayed in a HUGE room with a king sized bed and plenty of space to walk. The bathroom has a nice heated towel rack and a big tub, (I took a bath, which was great!) There was plenty of room for us both, and the little kitchenette was nice for storing some snacks and beer. I was disappointed there was no free internet in the room, or WiFi in the lobby - but they did have a computer for guests use 24/7. (I still think free WiFi in the lobby would be better, but did use the lobby computer more than a few times to look up directions or addresses, etc.) We also used the pool/jacuzzi facilities. The pool is rather small, but functional for swimming laps, and also a really nice touch in the middle of a city to have an indoor pool! The jacuzzi, again, was relatively small (I was in there with 3-4 strangers and there weren't enough hot bubbles to make the fact you were bathing with random people less obvious...) but it was nice to have as well. Then we were able to use the dry sauna which hit about 90 C (194 F) so it is not for the faint of heart! Again, it was so relaxing to sit in there after a long day of walking around. And the gym equipment, which I did not use, looked brand new and in really good condition. We had only one incident while staying at the hotel, which was infuriating to me, but the hotel did make up for it as quickly as possible. We had the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door to which I heard knocking on the door at 9:30 on Sunday morning and then heard the handle turn and the door open. I had to run up to the door to slam it shut before putting on a towel and checking to see who it was, \"Housekeeping\". I yelled that we had the Do Not Disturb Sign on the door for a reason and he apologized and quickly left. I told the front desk what happened and they were apologetic and when we came home later that night they had left us a bowl of fruit and two drink vouchers offering their apologies for the incident. This is does not affect my thoughts on the hotel, but I do think they might want to consider adding an additional lock that only the guest inside the room is able to open, because I felt uneasy that the do not disturb was not being respected by all staff, even when we were out of the room.

The Adina is set up as a hotel (with lobby, restaurant and reception) but the rooms are like apartments with a kitchen, living room, washer/dryer, and in our case, 2 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms. This arrangement is great for families wanting the best of both worlds. On the plus side, the rooms are modern, comfortable and spacious. There is a small indoor pool in the basement (also an exercise room, sauna and lukewarm jacuzzi). The location is very good...there is a metro station about a 3-minute walk away and it is also a very short walk to the Brandenburg Gate and Unter der Linden. An adequate if not overly impressive breakfast buffet is offered for 15 Euros/person. The hotel staff was (eventually) accommodating, if not particularly warm. And now for the minuses...speaking of warmth, the first apartment we were given had no working central heating, which we only discovered after unpacking the first night. We were initially told by the hotel employee sent up to check on the heat that it should come on in awhile and to be patient. When this didn't occur, we called the front desk again and were told that a space heater could be brought up and maintenance would look into the problem in the morning but that there were no other rooms to move us into at the moment. Since there was already a space heater sitting in the hallway of the apartment, it seemed like management was probably aware of this problem already. The temps were in the teens and it was obvious to us that a space heater wasn't going to be adequate to heat 2 bedrooms. it took another phone call (in which we had to voice our displeasure with the situation more forcefully) to get our room switched to another (which was identical to the one we were leaving except the central heat worked). We were brought the new keys, but there was no offer to help move our bags to the new room or any apology for the inconvenience. We also learned that the wifi service, which cost 15 Euros/Day, only covered one connection per room, so a family like ours with 3 laptops between us (I know, excessive perhaps but we were traveling with a 20 and 17-year old) had to share online time. The other hotels we stayed in during this trip offered free wifi with no limitations. So the bottom line here is that I would recommend the Adina to a family or group of travelers looking for that hard-to-find combination apartment/hotel in a very good Berlin location.

There are various restaurants all within a 10 minute walk of the hotel serving a varity of food types.

The room was spotless and the air conditioning was welcome (as were the windows that opened). The breakfast is more than adequate - salmon, eggs, sausages, fresh fruit, cereals, variety of breads/rolls, olives, cheeses - no need for lunch if you eat a late breakfast. The restaurant is great - a bit surprising to see kangaroo on the menu (it is an Australian chain) but the food was excellent and we had an excellent waitress. The hotel has a long stainless steel pool on the bottom floor but with a glass panel looking up into the courtyard it is not claustrophobic. There is a fitness room, sauna, as well. The pool area was spotless. The inner courtyard is wonderful in the hot summer - we brought out bottle of wine and sat and read before dinner. They also deliver drinks and food outside. We were very pleased with the staff who were very knowledgeable about the area. One tip, if you are interested in a unique tour of Berlin head to the little square in Old Part of East Berlin, along the canal near the Spree Restaurant and look for Rudi and his golf cart. His English is excellent and having lived his life in Berlin has countless stories to accompany the sites - well worth the cost of 5 Euros per person - the golf cart goes where the buses can't and he can stop at each site to explain it.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cSpacious, well designed rooms with a/c in a convenient location\u201d", "Author": "retiredtraveler70", "ReviewID": "UR75689344", "Content": "We had a two bedroom suite for three adults (my husband and myself and our college-aged son).

There is also an underground station located just around the corner from the hotel to take you to sights further away from the city centre.

All the major sights are located in the city centre (eg: Checkpoint Charlie, Berliner Dom, Brandenburg Gate, Holocaust Denkmal, Reichstag) and can be reached by walking from the hotel. Otherwise, if you're too tired or to reach sights further away, the most efficient way to travel is by U-Bahn (underground).

It is definitely worth your while to go to the Information desk at the Airport and buy your travel card and city tourist pass for the duration of your stay. They will give you the little red book with loads of information on all the sites and you will get discount on most attractions. They will also tell you how to get to the city centre in the shortest time. The Berlin tourist bus tour is definitely recommended - we got 5Euros discount pp with the little red book. We also did a boat trip which was enjoyable as it was very warm that weekend and we relaxed on the boat with a nice cold beer. All in all Berlin is a fantastic city and this hotel was a great find! We'll be going back to this hotel as there's so much more to see and do in Berlin.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "karin96", "ReviewID": "UR65308298", "Content": "My friend and i stayed at this hotel for 5 days and we had a great time! the location was great, the room was fantastic and the stuff were very friendy. most recomended!!", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cPerfect minimalistic design hotel in the middle of Mitte\u201d", "Author": "from_oslo_with_love", "ReviewID": "UR65192414", "Content": "Dont think I can find anything bad to say about this hotel.

We arrived at Tegel Airport and took the TXL bus to Unter Den Linden/Friedrichstrasse (2 .10 Euros each) and the hopped in a taxi to the hotel (about 5 Euros). The Hotel itself is situated in the old East Berlin, a stones throw from Checkpoint Charlie, a 5 minute walk to the Gendarmenmarkt and a 15 minute walk to the Brandenburg Gate. Although on first impressions the area seems quite run down, a quick walk around will soon allay that fear, the look being more about redevlopment that anything else. The Hotel itself is fantastic. On arrival we were given the key to our studio apartment. We had asked for a room on a high quiet floor and had been given a room on the ground floor overlooking the private Courtyard. We had asked for a high quiet room as we were concerned that the Hotel may get noisy in the evenings so we asked to be moved. The Hotel were glad to accomodate us and moved us to the top floor and upgraded us to a one bedroom apartment. The room itself was superb and we were glad of the upgrade (although the studio would have been adequate I would strongly recommend the one or two bedroom apartments). A small kitchen and lounge area with all the facilities you would need for a stay away, including dishasher and washing machine/tumble dryer with all cutlery etc, a large bathroom and bedroom with a safe for valuables. We needn't have worried about noise from the Hotel as despite it being full of guests we didn't hear a noise during all our stay. The leisure facilities we had to ourselves every time we went. There is a nice pool (about 10/15 Metres and made of stainless steel but perfect for lengths), Jacuzzi and Sauna with a reasonably well equipped gym. The staff were superb and the hotel bar and food perfectly reaosnable, although a steak can be quite priced at 24 Euros. The Hotel itself is absolutely spotless, as is Berlin as a whole. In short this is an absolutely superb hotel and a fantastically located base to explore Berlin from. In our opinion the old East Side is by far the best side. We bought a Step by Step guide to Berlin, which gives 14 walks around Berlin and it turned out to be a very good purchase, shpowing us parts of Berlin we would not otherwise have seen. In short if you are thinking about going to Berlin then do not hesitate to do so. It is a beautiful, historic place.

We flew with Ryan Air as their flights had good arrival and departure times for us from Edinburgh Airport and a reasonable price as well. We left on schedule and everything was good apart from the annoying tannoys every 5 minutes with some sort of sales pitch from the stewardess/ steward trying to sell everything from scratch cards to a device that smokers could use as a substitute for tobacco. I am a smoker myself but I can survive a couple of hrs without the need to spark up. We arrived at Adina Apartments @ 11.00am and from the outside the hotel looked very nice. Upon arriving at the front desk we were greeted by a smiling receptionist welcoming us to their hotel. Check-in was swift and our room was ready, so we headed straight up. Accomodation: It was a nice suprise to see that we were upgraged to a 1 Bedroom as I booked a Studio Apartment. The apartment was very clean, also nice and warm on a cold Feb day. Like previous posts describe, all utensils are there including restocking of dishwasher tablets and washing up liquid. Not to sure if they supply washing powder as we didn't require it. There is also wall mounted flat screens in the livingroom and bedroom. The only downside to that was there is only 1 Brittish channel \"BBC World News\". But for all the time we were in the apartment that was not a problem. Restaurant: We decided to eat here as this was the first night and I'm glad we did. Our meal was well presented and tasted fantastic. We sat down at our table and we were greeted by a very friendly & enthusiatic waitress called Yvonne. For starters/ Tapas I ordered Bruchetta with Parma Ham & Salad and my wife had Currywerst, which is sliced German pork Sausage drizzled with a sweet,slightly spiced curry sauce and thin fries. As we placed our starters we were given a plate of french bread and bowl of olive oil infused with chilli (MMMmmm). Next our main meal arrived which was Kangaroo Steak and Avocado and sliced Chillis. I have never tried Kangaroo before and found it to be fairly tender with a slight taste of Lamb, but very nice it was. My wife opted for Buffalo Steak with marinated Baby Onions & Sauted Potatos, Red Wine Jus. The steak was cooked to perfection. We never tried any sweets as we were too full. In the last post the author described the service slow. There were a few people eating at the same time as ourselves and everybody was catered for. We ate at the hotels restaurant a couple of times and found it to be a good experience. The prices were slightly higher than highstreet restaurants but remember it's a apartments come hotel facilties. Amenities: On our 2nd day we decided to go down to the pool area @ 4.00pm. At this time it was really quiet and had the whole place to ourselves. The gym is huge and has all equipment that a serious fitnress fanatic would require. The pool is slightly cold but when you get swimming you soon warm up. We also used the spa bath... wow, the jets are so powerfull that it gives you a really good massage. You can also request bathrobes from reception to use in the pool area. As I mentioned before we were greeted by Yvonne who runs the restaurant. We cannot fault her in anything she does. We mentioned to her that we would like to do some shopping but found Designer labels more expensive than UK. Off she went and came back with shopping centres on the outskirts of Berlin and directions on how to get there with all the train & bus numbers. May I say this was in between serving at the bar and being aware of customers needs. 5 stars to you. Overall we really liked this hotel and will definitely be back but next time with our children and we also met some very nice people staying there.

About the room: The first thing you have to do when you enter the room is put your keycard in a slot to turn on the electricity. The room is modern-looking with grey walls, red curtains, high ceilings, and a view that overlooks the courtyard (see pic). TVs in both the bedroom and living room. When pulled close, the bedroom blinds really block out the light for a noonday nap. There is a safe deposit box in bedroom closet- swipe your keycard and enter a code. Best feature, by far is the Kitchenette: oven, stovetop, refrigerator, microwave. Hot water/coffee maker, and dishwasher. The kitchenette sink is shallow and circular. the kitchen cupboards are amply stocked with dishes, pots/pans/spatulas, and a salt shaker.

Shower has good pressure, very hot water, and a large tub. soap/shampoo/conditioner/lotion and toothpaste provided, in case TSA is being strict. About the surroundings: Walk across the street to Lidl- reminded me of Grocery Outlet here in the states. Across the street (via pedestrian tunnel) and down one block is another, more organized, grocery store called Kaisers (see pic) Kaisers has a bakery, and one [store] brand of each item. This is where I got my Listerine. And Kinderschocolades. Another block down is the medical clinic and pharmacy. I hope you won't have to go there but it's nice to know it's so close. We tried the chinese restraunt next door to Lidl's and thought it tasted... like Chinese! There were a few germanized potato-chinese dishes, but otherwise, as you'd expect. tasty tiramasu ice cream. interesting mechanical self cleaning toilet in the ladies room. As the hotel website promises, we walked to Checkpoint Charlie, and the souvenir shops, Cafe Einstein, Starbucks, and the Gendarmanmarkt. Since we were visiting in December, the square was filled with tents vending Christmas gifts and treats. It was a quick walk to the U-bahn station (see pic) and the train system in Berlin is very easy to figure out, and will take you everywhere you want to go for a lot less than a taxi.

The room was very spacious with a fully equipped kitchenette, separate (and large) living area with plasma screen and a separate bedroom also with it's own plasma. There was in-room internet which was chargeable and I think it was a bit pricey. We went down to the bar for a drink to find it was happy hour (half price drinks). These have been outlawed in Scotland so it was a definite bonus! Martin the barman was very friendly and gave us some tips about what to do and where to go. The bar area is pretty cool although because the hotel was empty after the Berlin Wall celebrations the previous week there wasn't much atmosphere. Breakfast is served in the bar/restaurant and there's so much choice it was unbelievable. Try to get a deal that includes breakfast because if you don't it'll cost you 16 euros each which could put a serious dent in your budget. I booked through 1800.com and got a stonking deal. The waitress was as helpful and friendly as Martin and got out a map to show us how to get from the hotel to various sites like the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag etc. Both were a twenty minute walk away, so not far. Gallery Lafayette also has a store on F-strasse so you can be there in about 10 minutes. There are some restaurants around, and if you like sausages and food based around pig you'll be happy as a pig in [--].

The Adina Apartment Hotel sists on the former Easter Side(which frankly, now looks better and more modern than the old western one), right behind Checkpoint Charlie, and is nessled close to the beautifull new Gallerie Lafayette, and only about 10 minutes walk to Unter den Linden. The Franchuzische Strasse metro is close by, and the area is home to many great German, as well as Italian and Turkish restaurants. Eventhough the Adina finds itself within these convenient surroundings, it is immediately surrounded by remnants of the past, including an old school that in non-funcionable in front of it, as well as renovated apartment blacks to it's left. The school especially, has a very portentuous feel, and for people who were born behind the iron curtain like me, it brings back certain memories. The Adina has a beautiful courtyard that is floridly decorated with aesthetically pleasing armchairs in different fluid designs and pastel colors. The courtyard is also beautifully specless and pristine, and the windowns of the other rooms looking inside necessitate a wonderous contrast via their white-rimmed pains. The buildings interior courtyard shows it's true beauty, revealing the burnished multicolored brick patters on the facade, with a Victorian-like bathhouse feel to it. Interesting, however is how the building manages to maintain a ceaslessly modern exterior. The apartment rooms are all very high standard in terms of maintenance, as well as technology. The chic clean-lined furniture mixed with the pastel-colored carpeting, and the silver kitchen applicances; add a very urbane sophistication. The bathrooms are very well equipped and do not leave out any detail for the discerning hotel connosseur. The shower has many settings and always provides the right amount of water an temperature for any guest. Even-though this is a detail many overlook, one does not truly appreciate this convenience until one experiences it. The only fault is that many rooms have a view of looking into the courtyard, which does not provide one with a good view, or any view at all, even-though if one can appreciate finely burnished facade tapestry and beautifully clean atriums with bonsai trees and colorful furniture, like I do, this is the hotel for you. If you find yourself with a room that does overlook the street, this is not much of a view either, as there is a run-down GDR-era school in front of you, and apartment buildings to the side. There is also a pipe of somekind suspended in the air, like a gas pipe, or something. However, these are not criticisms, they simply give the traveller a real view into Berlin, one that will truly give you an idea of what it is, for what it is, the real thing, an untouched splendor. Also, even-though the restaurant downstairs only has a finite menu selection, it is decent, and the decor leaves nothing to chance. The pool downstairs, although small can also proved refreshing.

We arrived into Schonefeld airport which is a fairly nice airport and easy to find your way to the train station. Before you leave the main terminal building go to the tourist information desk on your right and buy a welcome pass, which basically covers all your travel for the time you\u2019re there, ours cost \u20ac34.50 each for 5 days. The good thing about getting it from the tourist information office is they give you a little red guide book which tells you all the museums you get discounts with when you show your welcome ticket\u2026. Well worth doing! You save at least 25% on all entry prices to museums. We took the S9 train to Fredrichstrasse and then the U bahn to Stadmitte. This will take you approximately an hour/1.5 hours, remember to validate your train ticket before travelling, little red box on platforms! Depending which exit you come out from the Stadmitte station you\u2019ll be directly at the street you need to go along (Kraussenstrasse). Look out for a fitness first gym banner on a building and Enterprise banner and take a left there. The hotel is approx 5 minutes walk from there and on your right hand side (There is another tube station called Spittelmarkt near the hotel, but in my opinion it wasn\u2019t as nice). The Adina hotel is fabulous and in my opinion in a fantastic location for all the must see tourist attractions! We arrived early and our studio room wasn\u2019t ready which wasn\u2019t a problem, but they then upgraded us to a 1 bed apartment which was ready. The apartment was brilliant and it was really nice having lots of space to chill out after a long day sightseeing! As people have said previously, it is literally 2 minutes from a Lidl store and another supermarket (Rossmans) which we used to stock up on snacks, drinks etc. Go out the hotel entrance through the car park at the block of flats and it is on your left on Leipziger Strasse, can\u2019t miss it. We had breakfast included in our rate, which was good, nice selection of cereals, fruit, yoghurts, breads, meats, cooked breakfast etc. Enough choice for everyone and meant that we didn\u2019t eat much the rest of the day! Also worth noting the hotel bar has a happy hour between 5.30-7 which is good for a quick drink on the way back to the room, the Reisling is pleasant as to is the Pilsner on draft. Didn\u2019t eat in the hotel restaurant at night so can\u2019t comment. The pool, jacuzzi and sauna was a brilliant addition and very nice after a long day sightseeing. A few of the previous reviews have said that the surrounding neighbourhood didn\u2019t feel particularly safe at night and was the prettiest, well to be honest it was one street back from a main road therefore there was no traffic noise, and we felt nothing but safe walking back late at night, and the surrounding buildings are just stereotypical of buildings of that era. Location \u2013 literally 5 minutes walk to Checkpoint Charlie and Topography of Terror, turn left out of hotel and take a left again when you get to Fredrichstrasse. You can also walk to the TV tower, Gendermanmarkt (which is very pretty), Jewish museum, Potstamer Platz, Holocaust museum, Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag (go early to avoid queues!) and Museum Island. It is quite a compact city in so many ways and very nice to walk around, if you didn\u2019t feel like walking there are tube stops near all the main attractions. A museum that doesn\u2019t seem to feature in many of the guide books (it\u2019s in the red Welcome book) is the Anne Frank museum which is located on Rosenthaler Strasse, to me this was my favourite museum and the 30minute video they play is very interesting, it\u2019s quite hard to find as it\u2019s up an alley, but worth the look! The holocaust museum was also worth a visit. We took the S9 train out to the Olympic stadium which was worth a visit if you have time, just check that there is no football on! We also took the tube up to KaDeWe which is a fab but expensivedepartment store, especially the food court on the top floor! Just up from the department store there is the Kaiser memorial church which remains after the war, quite an impressive building to see. Eating \u2013 there is a nice Italian restaurant called Lungomare located less than 5 minutes from the hotel, take a left out the entrance and walk along until Charlotten Strasse, it\u2019s on the corner. Maximillians is good, it is a traditional Bavarian restaurant, worth going to if you want to try the local delicacies! Its just of Fredrichstrasse, take a left from the hotel, when you get to Fredrichstrasse take a right, you\u2019ll see a Mini garage on your left, it\u2019s opposite. Another Bavarian restaurant that is very traditional is Lowenbrau which again is 5 minutes from the hotel. Go out past Lidl and take a left, you\u2019ll see it on the opposite side of the road, at a set of traffic lights, it\u2019s got a large blue sign. If like us your German isn\u2019t up to much they do have an English menu, you just have to ask for it, I get the impression it\u2019s not a very touristy place, which is kind of why we liked it! Amici\u2019s restaurant in Gendermanmarkt is a very nice reasonably priced Italian, located in a very pretty building, it\u2019s opposite the opera building. We went for dinner one night and a drink during the day another day, it always seemed busy which I take as a good sign! Seemed quite reasonable to me considering its nice location, 2 pizzas and 2 drinks \u20ac26. As you will probably tell we had a fantastic time in Berlin and would definitely use this chain of hotel again if we go back to Berlin or other cities where they have this chain!

To tell the truth we feel like living in our apartment in the centre of an extraordinary city (Berlin). Hotel is located in the borders of Mitte near Stadmitte station (700m) and is easy to get there from the airport in 40 minutes using a Bus and with only one change of metro. Although the neighbor seems a little solitary - dark at night, but never felt unsafe - it is so closed to the center (Mitte) and the sightseeing (Alexanderplatz, Checkpoint Charlie, Holocaust Memorial, Reichstag, Gendarmenmarkt, Museuminse) that it is really a very good located. The hotel courtyard, rest rooms and other public areas are stylish and welcoming but the swimming pool in the basement is too small (rather for children) and we felt rather uncomfortable over there. The staff was friendly, diacritical and spoke very good english. I have to complain because I emailed the hotel and received no response.

The street where the hotel is located is dark at night, but I never felt unsafe. 2. The hotel-booking page may be what Europeans expect but I found it too difficult to use and ultimately chose a different booking site. 3. I emailed the hotel twice and received no response. Now that that is out of the way, let me give you a few of the positives. The hotel is new and spotless. All common areas that we came in contact with, including the restaurant, lobby, restroom, and courtyard, were very well maintained. I booked what is called a studio room, which includes a refrigerator, a couple of electric burners, a microwave and necessary utensils. With the exception of the refrigerator, we used none of these. One might classify the room as ultra modern but it is functionally well designed and laid out. There were two flat-screen TV\u2019s. The bathroom was very efficient, with no tub but a large shower. The bed was hard, as I like it, and comfortable. The room was quite well insulated from outside road noise. When in use, the air conditioning and heat were virtually silent. In short, I was very pleased with the room. So, by now you have figured that I enjoyed the physical layout of the hotel. What made the Adena very special for us were the employees. We checked in rather early and were greeted pleasantly and immediately given our room rather than being told that check-in was not until later in the day. When we asked for directions, the staff was very patient and helpful. We asked for a particular restaurant (I would add that if you eat nowhere else in Berlin that you eat at one of Hasir\u2019s restaurants) and were given excellent directions. The restaurant staff and housekeeping staff were equally cordial and efficient. I was disappointed that the Adina had no nightlife of any sort or if it did, it came to an end before we returned to the hotel. Fear not, around the corner is the Marriott Courtyard, where late night meals and drinks were being served. The hotel is located very close to a number of underground stops, the closest being Stadmite. There are a number of shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance. So that you may better judge this review let me tell you a bit about myself. I travel for a living and have flown almost 7 million miles. Although not often, I have stayed at 5 star hotels in cities from Sydney to London, Rome, New York and San Francisco. Most of the time, when I travel in the US, I stay at either Marriott or Hilton properties. I would liken the Adina to a newer Marriott Courtyard or a Hilton Suites hotel in the US.", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "GordonandMichael", "ReviewID": "UR28497949", "Content": "We stayed at the Adina in Berlin in April for a 5-day City break.

Got there early from our flight and was met with the most gracious reception and was told our room was ready and we could check in. Beautiful cozy lobby with quite areas and a wonderful fireplace. Also a computer is available gratis in the lobby. Our room was just spectacular. Very chic, very comfortable and very quiet. The kitchen had everything you needed and also provided dish soap and tabs. It was nice having to buy only our food. Loved the closet with drawers and the bathroom was very nicely appointed. The best part was the washer and dryer. We were able to pack much more lightly. They also provided laundry tabs too! Everyone we had contact with was well trained,kind and very friendly. Loved the location short walk to Spittlemarkt and walkable to Stadtmitt which comes in handy. The market and the drugstore are right across the street. Got a great rate of 103e a night. I wish this chain was in more locations besides Germany--it would be our first choice.", "Date": "March 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "wiltshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat apartments - better than a hotel\u201d", "Author": "lost-artist", "ReviewID": "UR13806337", "Content": "I stayed here with my daughter for 3 nights and it was brilliant. Well designed modern apartments built to the usual excellent German standards. We had a studio, and had everything we needed. The staff are very friendly and helpful and speak perfect English. The location is good in the old East Berlin - not the prettiest - as there is a lot of development going on, but it felt very safe and is only 5 mins from the nearest tube station - Spittlemarkt, or Stadtmitte about 10 minutes. There is a Lidl supermarket 1 minute away if you want to self-cater. The studios have fridges, microwaves, hotplates and a dishwasher, washing machine and tumble drier. In addition the maid cleans the room everyday and does the washing up! Our rooms faced the inner courtyard which made them a little dark, but very quiet, no street noise at all. Other apartments face the street and may be a bit noisier. Having said that its a quiet street. Wireless internet cost about 40p per hour, but we had to buy a 12 hour card - get this from reception. We will be going back because 3 days wasn't enough to see everything, and we will stay at Adina.", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cWell designed accommodation in an improving area\u201d", "Author": "RS59", "ReviewID": "UR13605111", "Content": "Stayed for one night a couple of months after they opened. These apartments are very well designed. Our accommodation consisted of a bedroom plus good sized sitting/ eating/ kitchen area. The kitchen was very well equipped with microwave, fan oven and cooking rings. The design was very attractive with an Australian theme (aboriginal art and earthy colours). Staff were friendly and efficient. The immediate area is probably best described as improving, on one side is a derelict building on the other is a new block with a Marriott Courtyard. There is Lidl discount store and bakery in an old shopping mall 200m away and it felt a bit weird going from the designer hotel to run down mall for supplies and back again. We did an an interesting walk along Zimmerstrasse, two blocks away, which took us to Checkpoint Charlie then past a preserved section of the Berlin Wall to Potsdamer Platz. The leisure facilities are good with a 17m pool, although the water was cold so you had to keep moving, and a separate whirlpool and sauna. There is a fitness room but no sitting area.

The hotel is brand new, opened mid December 2007. One of the city\u2019s premier tourist attractions Checkpoint Charlie and the nearby underground station (Spittelmarkt, U-bahn line U2) are only five minutes away on foot. We stayed there for 3 days / 2 nights in a one bedroom apartment featuring a separate lounge and dining area, fully equipped kitchen with oven, stovetop, microwave, dishwasher and fridge/freezer, tea / coffee making facilities, mini bar, bathroom with bath / shower, individual washing machine and dryer, 2 hairdryers, iron & ironing board, there was an in room safe in the bedroom closet, 2 color TVs with select cable channels and in-house movies, individually controlled heating / cooling etc. The hotel also offers room service, dry cleaning and laundry service, baby sitting service and pantry service. Underground parking is available if you travel by car (charges apply). We booked via hotel website (check out [--]) and later on got a very nice e-mail back with detailed directions on how to get to the hotel from Tegel airport. Our room had a courtyard view and was on the 5th floor. The hotel also has a restaurant and caf\u00e9 on site but we didn\u2019t try it so no comments there, although it looked lovely and inviting in the evenings upon our return with candles flickering on the tables everywhere \u2013 even in the lobby \u2013 very romantic. Overall the hotel was quiet, clean and comfortable. It was nice to get away from the noisy city centre after a long day full of tourist must-sees and just get good nights sleep (although we did much more!). There\u2019s a fitness centre in the basement with sauna, pool, bubble bath and gym which can be used by all hotel guests (included in accommodation price). At the end of the first day we returned to our hotel apartment and relaxed in the sauna and bubble bath, and even took a dip in the swimming pool. Afterwards we watched an in-house movie (the price is 10 Euros per movie) and hit the bed (which was quite comfortable I must say; additional pillows, blankets and duvets are available as well as special pillows and duvets for allergic people). On the second night I was too tired to leave the room (apparently shopping can be very tiring!) so I just stayed in and took a long soothing bath in the brand new and perfectly clean bathroom, sipping cool German Riesling and planning our last day activities while my husband worked out in fitness centre\u2026 He said it was OK. There's no reason not to believe him as the gym is brand new and fully equiped, I saw it myself. We really loved staying at Adina. Had we taken our 2yrs old daughter with us, it\u2019d still have been as good. But we wanted a little romantic break from home so not this time :) If you choose to stay at Adina, you won\u2019t regret it.
