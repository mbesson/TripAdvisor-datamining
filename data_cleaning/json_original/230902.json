This hotel is great if you want to be in a quieter part of the city and close to the museums. Next time, i think personally i would just put what we spent on cabs towards getting a hotel in the heart of the city.

Chose the hotel as we did not want to be in the heart of Amsterdam as we like a quiet life in the evenings ! and the price was a lot cheaper. Two minutes walk to the tram stop, numbers 5 and 24 run into the centre and passed most of the other attractions so so easy to use. You can buy a 1hr ticket [2.60 euro] or a 24hr [7 euro] from the driver or hotel reception. We purchased a 72 hour ticket (15 euro each] this we purchased from the tourist information office at the Leidseplein. All you do is scan the card as you get on any tram and scan as you get off. The hotel reception will give you a tram map. The stops are shown clearly on electronic screens in the tram and are told to you in English as well so getting lost is very difficult !! The hotel itself is very comfortable and clean we had room 249 which looked as if it had been refurbished, the bathroom was very small but had a lovely hot shower. We had twin beds which are very comfortable and the hotel is very quiet through the night, so always got a good nights sleep. My only complaint with the room was the towels, they are so thin and the bath towels are to small. Breakfast was ok, a few pastries, and better quality juice would of been nice, there was a limited selection of cold meats, cheese, two cereals, bread, rolls, preserves, boiled eggs, yoghurt. not a great selection but enough to start the day off. Just around the corner is Beethoven straat a road with some nice varied shops including a small supermarket, delis, off licence, bakery, chocolate shop e.t.c, also an eetcafe, the Felicio which was a nice bar/cafe, we had a meal in Calzone a pizzeria, it was ok but not worth the money which was different to De Barone, the nearest restaurant to the hotel, the food here was lovely along with the service and ambiance. One place we would recommend you visit is the area known as Jordan, and if you go on a Saturday there is a great market, Noordermarkt, great food stalls and various other stalls. If you like the beer and fancy a trip to a small brewery to taste the beer and get a tour then take the trams 10 [get off at Hoogte Kadijk walk 100yds to the bridge and you will see the windmill the brewery is at the back of the windmill] or 14[ get off at Pontanusstraat) which arrives on the other side of the river to the 10 but again walk over the bridge to the windmill.

We liked the excellent location, in a quiet and pleasant neighbourhood away from the city centre. Access to the main cultural attractions and to the city centre, however, is easy by tram which stops about 150 meters away. With one exception we found the staff generally pleasant and helpful. We liked the attractive breakfast room, but though the breakfasts were adequate we thought it pretty woeful for a 4-star hotel to serve orange squash instead of orange juice and to have tinned fruit cocktail instead of fresh fruit salad. Also, a little more variety in the breakfast offer would have been nice. We liked the fact that complimentary tea and coffee were available in the bar area 24/7 - nice to relax there after a heavy day's sightseeing and mull over what we had visited. Lovely rooms, well furnished and with good ensuite facilities though some might find the layout of the rooms and the bathrooms a bit cramped. Over all we were pleased with the hotel and would certainly stay there again. If you plan on arriving by car be aware that though there is on street parking in the streets around the hotel, leaving your car there for the duration of your stay would be a very expensive option. Drop off your luggage at the hotel then park your car in the Park and Ride by the Olympic Stadium. A bargain at 8 Euros for each 24 hour period and your ticket includes the tram to and from the hotel. Final tip, for shopping or sightseeing, use public transport and buy a pass for as many days as you will be in the city. If you plan on doing a lot of museums and galleries, consider buying the Amsterdam Card which includes the pass for travel by all forms of public transport and free entry to all the museums as well as an inclusive canal tour.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cOk value for money, calm district\u201d", "Author": "akl7622", "ReviewID": "UR116431879", "Content": "Near tram and a small, nice shopping area.

Although the hotel is a bit far from the Main City of Amsterdam, public transportation from the Hotel is a just a stone's throw away. Also the musuem district is a couple of KMs away and is easily walkable. The staff was nice and very polite. They help in getting me a cab to the Airport in no time. The use of free Internet was an added bonus. The room was fine and clean and so was the entire hotel. The only negative was the elevator and this is the common complaint with many European Hotels.

The Delphi was a pleasant 15 minute walk from the RAI conference center. My wife accompanied me and hooked up with several other wives from the conference. We had a recently refurbished room on the second (European) floor with a shared balcony facing the courtyard. We saw up to four ringed parakeets at a time visiting a feeder at the apartment next door. We arrived at 9 AM and were given a room immediately. We were even treated to breakfast when we arrived. The breakfast room doubles as a bar for guests in the evenings, although is not used much. Just ask the desk clerk for drinks and he/she will take care of it. One night two fellows walked in the door and asked for drinks. The clerk asked if they were guests and they said yes. Then he requested their room numbers which they gave. He pointed out that the hotel had no rooms with those numbers and asked them to leave. We slept most evenings with the windows open, closing them at 7AM when the early flights began arriving at Schiphol. The room was clean, housekeeping was efficient, and staff was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was good, but unvarying over the nine mornings we were there. There are several good restaurants (mostly Italian) and shops on Bethovenstraat. However, I highly recommend La Falote, a little neighborhood restaurant run by Chef Peter Linden in the opposite direction. Walk past the tram stop and follow the main street until it comes to a T. Cross to the right and it is about 1/2 block on the right, about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. (Making a left at the T takes you to the museums). There is a Dag (daily) Menu for 10 euros. Chef Linden is young and very gregarious, hauling out his accordion both nights we visited. He also discourages smoking. Good, solid food with a local flavor. One negative comment. I discovered that the room safe was not fastened to anything. Maintenance did not get around to correcting the matter during my visit.

Apparently the hotel has gone through a long refurbishment, and I requested rooms in part of the hotel that had been finished. There were 6 of us in my party, and we booked 2 doubles and 1 twin. All our rooms were on the fourth floor. The twin room was the largest out of the three. The hotel is advertised as a four star, but I did not feel the double rooms were of a four star quality. They were both pretty small, and the bathroom was tiny. Our shower leaked quite badly, and there was not much leg room at all if you needed to sit down to use the toilet - knees were touching the wall!! As we really only used the hotel to sleep, this did not really bother us as the staff were friendly and the hotel was clean and tidy. Breakfast is typically Dutch serving only continental food. Morning rolls, toast, cereals, yoghurts, cheese, ham, boiled eggs. Good selection. No tea or coffee facilities in the room, but you can order complimentary tea and coffee at any time and it is brought to your room which I thought was a nice touch.

I asked the front desk about this and was advised that the hotel is undergoing a slow renovation (I assume so as not to disturb the guests). Bottom line, if you stay here, ask for a room on the 3rd floor or above. On another few notes, the hotel only offers a basic but good breakfast in the morning and other than that, has no restaurant. There is however, a great Italian trattoria called Dal Barone, just around the corner and down one block on the right. Great food and decent prices! In addition, for people not familiar with the layout of Amsterdam, this hotel is not located in the heart of the city, but rather about a 15 minute tram ride from Dam Square and 20 or so from the Central Station.
