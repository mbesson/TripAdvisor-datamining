My sister and I chose the hotel because it was close to Termini stations (5 minute walk) which was convenient for sightseeing. The staff on arrival were friendly, even helping us with our oversized backpacks, but their English was a little rusty (I understand I should expect everyone to speak English in Europe). Our room was what we needed for 2 nights - clean and with a comfy bed. It certainly wasn't anything special, actually a little small and we did have a trouble trying to get the key into the door each time (staff wern't very helpful with this). The hotel does have a lift but it was old, small and really slow so it was faster to climb up and down the stairs. The lady at reception was able to provide us with a map of Rome and directions to the nearest internet cafe (hotel internet charges were expensive and receptionist actually suggested internet cafe instead). It didnt feel too safe walking from Termini in the evenings, but it it only a quick walk and the streets are well lit. Upon check-out the staff were kind enough to hold our luggage for us until we returned from sightseeing and before jumping on the train to southern Italy.

My wife and I just spent a fantastic 3 days in Rome at the beginning of October 2011 staying at The Europa Hotel. Check in was very smooth and handled by Roberto who was very pleasant and willing to answer all our questions, in fact all the staff members were friendly and helpful, we also thought it was a very professional to see all the cleaning staff wearing uniforms.. Our room was not as big as North American hotels but large enough for us, we are in Europe. The bathroom was beautiful and very clean with lots of towels and a good supply of toiletries. We were on the first floor at the front of the hotel so we did not have to use the elevator and we normally carry our own bags.. The windows in the room were new so there was no noise from the street. The room had air conditioning and a mini bar you could store a few drinks. I like ice with my drinks all I had to do was ask and within a few minutes I had a bowl of ice. The breakfast room was a big surprise\u2026\u2026it was just beautiful and the selection of food was one of the best we had during our 17 day trip. As an added bonus the hotel has unlimited fast internet in the bar area. The location is great, only 2 short blocks from the Via Marsalla side of the Termini rail station. We felt very safe walking in the area at night, there is a mixture of hotels apartments and restaurants so there was always people walking around. This is a great base location to see the sights of rome with the metro, local buses and hop on hop of buses only a short 2 blocks away. Please take time to look at my pictures, they will tell the real story. Thank you Roberto and all the staff at The Europa Hotel, you made our trip to Rome so much more enjoyable.

I was looking around a good excuse to get myself out of this hole myself but there were no cockroaches around for me to justifying getting myself that room at the Westin Excelsior. I have seem a lot of bad room around the world but at $130 USD/night, I expect something a bit more decent.

The good thing about this hotel is the location. It's only 2 blocks walk from the main train station (Termini), the South African girl (who speaks perfect english) at the front desk is really helpful and there is a laundry/internet cafe across the road.

An Easy Jet bus called Terravision took us straight to the station from Campiano airport for a small fee (buy a return ticket there and then if you can). All the streets in this area are in a grid system with dozens and dozens of hotels so make sure you have an accurate map to find the hotel. The entrance has a large canopy over it which may help you find it easier. Night time around Termini can be slightly unsavoury - drunks, down and outs etc. but don't let that put you off as the hotel, although close to the station, does not suffer from these problems. Staff on the whole were friendly although one male receptionist would scarcely look at us. I think he may be in the wrong job! Night receptionist could not explain to us how to use our hotel room safe. He gave us instructions in Italian but that didn't really help. Room was fine. Adequate size, clean and comfortable. Colour TV and air conditioning worked well. No shower curtain in the bathroom which meant the bathroom flooded every time the shower was used. This may be an Italian thing as I've heard this elsewhere. Breakfast room was not too inspiring (set in the basement with no natural light) and selection of food not great but adequate. Although you can walk to a lot of sights from the hotel it is downhill most of the way which means its uphill on the way back up! I'm fit but the combination of the heat and walking can be a real killer. If you're going in the summer I strongly recommend using the buses or metro. You can buy an all day city ticket for both for about \u00a32 or \u00a33. Bargain. Get these at the wee shops out the front of Termini at the end of the covered walkway. The guys in these will tell you what number to take. Just a word of warning about the metro underground. It officially shuts at 11.30pm but that depends where you are on the network. I would use 10.45pm at the latest as a guide if you want to get back to Termini. Please be very careful crossing the streets. I know someone who was knocked down the first time he crossed a street outside Termini. Saw pickpockets in action as well at the Pantheon. Use a rucksack with padlocks! Also don't be fooled by guys dressed as Gladiators etc. at the main sights. They'll charge 20 Euros for taking a photo of you with your own camera.

(The latter had three levels of shopping and surprisingly it had Mango, United Colours of Benetton , Nike and loads of perfumeries and eating places. The Carbineiri and the clergy ate there and it is a bussling place ). The Hotel was very clean and a the staff were multi-lingual and helpful. It is basic and a two star plus in our opinion.
