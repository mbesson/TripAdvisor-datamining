I would have liked better lightning since the rooms are rather dark, and some shampoo and conditioner considering it is a four star hotel. Apart from this I found the room very comfortable. The staff was very helpful even before arrival when I sent some queries. Check in and check out were easily processed. They also arranged for out transportation back to the airport and though we were told to wait for four minutes, after a minute the taxi arrived. The breakfast though not extensive was good. Hotel is also very close to the metro and there are a number of shops close by, much cheaper then the ones found in the center. A drawback was however Internet access.

So Glad I booked this hotel - very different in style to what we've stayed in before. Staff very pleasant and helpful - not as some people have said in some reviews I've read - I do wonder what some people expect. Treat the staff nicely and they will help in whatever way they can. Breakfast very simple but more than enough to set you up for the day - the usual cheese, ham and pastries but all very nice and fresh. Dining/bar area is on the 4th floor roof terrace - only views of rooftops and the Basilica Dome but very relaxing. Room very comfortable and they provided earplugs possibly because of sirens or traffic noise but we had no problem with that as after all the walking we were too tired to notice any noise and possibly the padded walls in the rooms also stopped the noise. We were pleasantly surprised at how close the hotel was to the attractions. Hotel very near to Vatican (300 mtrs) a short walk brought you to the Castel Sant Angelo and the river Tiber. A commentated river cruise costs about \u20ac15 but this is a 24hr ticket and you can hop on and off the boat at its landing stages. Also go into the Castel it costs \u20ac7 but is well worth it for the views. The Vatican is free to enter although you can pay to walk up the 400+ steps to the roof and walk around there - its too hot up there! Wednesday is the day to go if you want to hear the pope do his weekly prayer thing but probably too many bodies around for that. Places to go for ice cream best by far is the Old Bridge gelataria by the Vatican Museum - huge scoops for a minimal price. For good coffee and sandwiches visit Castroni's on Via Ottaviano they also sell a fantastic range of foods and wines, sweets and their own blend of coffee specially ground for you. For an evening meal try Sorpasso in Via Properzio (very near to the hotel) the staff are very friendly and the menu is fantastic - prices again are very reasonable (\u20ac4 for a glass of good organic wine) nice tapas served to you as well. A fantastic city to visit but beware of scams and pickpockets - one scam is a driver pulls up on the sidewalk asking directions (in our case - the sistine chapel) he will be very friendly and strike up a conversation telling you he works for Armani and shows a catalogue and because you've been friendly he will offer a gift - we declined as we knew the scam but what normally happens is he will then ask for some money for petrol as he will probably run out of fuel and then he will turn nasty.

The down side are the amenities. The rooms are dimly lit, dingy and noisy. Our two windows were narrow slits of light, akin to a correctional facility. The hotel definitely tries to market its edginess with the rampant \"ALL things Orange\" decorating campaign as well as the quirky metro-chic furniture and accessories.

Air Conditioning was excellent (perhaps the narrow windows retained the cold air). Internet is not free but the charge is minimal.

Our double room had a corner jacuzzi bath rather than a shower, but it was fine. The triple room had a double bed, and a small single bed which was acceptable. Proper bath and shower in this room. I had read a few negative comments on Tripadvisor about this hotel and chose it mainly for the location just a few minutes walk from the Vatican. Cost was reasonable for a major city. For some reason the receptionist could not explain American passport holders get a special rate if they pay in cash on arrival. This suited the three American members of our group who got their triple room slightly cheaper than our double. One thing I did not like about the rooms was the carpets, which appeared a little grubby. Breakfast is served on the roof terrace, which is a great way to start the day. The lady there is very friendly and helpful. One issue I raised was that the buffet ran out of some things quite early.

The restaurant was a tad pricey but worth it as the food was really really good! Also an absolutely fantastic thing that the manager did was (as it was my girfriends birthday and valentines day two days before) to buy a chocolate cake laced with ameretto and a bunch of roses in a vase on request via email to the manager from me. The manager emailed me all the information I needed about the holiday. The beautiful rooms are very chic as the hotel website explains, we stayed in room 308 (junior suite) this was fantastic with great views of the main street and a bath in the bedroom (I know it sounds wierd but it is definately a highlight!). you are hit with a faint orange aroma as you walk in and the bathroom also has this fresh scent. The rooms are cleaned thouroughly everyday and our bed clothes were folded neatly for when we came back from a great day out. There is a safe, tv with sky, a mini fridge and electric window shutters operated with a button by the bed to reduce the amount of movement you have to make :). The shower in the bathroom is very good! The vatican is literally across a square outside, but the hotel is conveniantly just tucked within a main street so the tourist don't pile down your road just normal everyday traffic. the main city centre is a bit of a walk but when you are sightseeing and talking you really don't notice.

(scooters or bikes are available on request but we did'nt bother) The metro is a bit of a walk up a high street across the square outside the hotel (not too far) and this is how we got to the Colloseum for just 1 euro each way!

The room was thoughtfully designed, with motion sensor lights in the closets, a toilet and bedet, effective black out shades and extra pillows. The breakfast is decent. We ate dinner in the restaurant, which officially opened after our trip. The owner was delightful, and the food was good after a long day of walking. I also liked that this hotel touts itself as a green hotel that actually seems to be. If you hang your used towels up, they do not take them and wash them anyway. When we put ours on the floor, they took them as promised. The staff downstairs was extremely helpful and accomodating, and the location could not be better. We were steps from the Vatican and a short walk from many of Rome's other attractions. Because this is a more residential area, there are many great markets to buy snacks for the room, like salami and cheese, and the in-room fridge has extra space. Some pointers if you visit. This is a budget hotel. They do not provide toiletries other than pump soap. Take your own toiletries. They do not provide wireless internet, but a terminal is available in the lobby for 2 euro for 30 minutes.

Take your own travel IPod adaptor and travel speakers or other means of generating music if you must have it.

The hotel is very well located. It's a 2 minute walk from the Vatican and about 5 minutes from a ottaviano metro station. From the metro it's only 5 minutes to most of the other major sites. The hotel seems brand new, I'd guess it's only been open for a couple of months. They've gone for a very modern look. Everything is sleek, the colour scheme is white, grey with highlights of orange. It almost feels like a boutique hotel but falls short on that front. During our stay, the hotel seemed very quiet, we only saw 3 other guests. I stayed in a normal room (they have double rooms and suites). The size was ok, maybe a bit on the small side. It is nicely decorated, the bed is nice and has a very large (faux?) leather headboard. The room has air conditioning (the type that sits below the window) and it is remote controlled). There is a nice small LCD TV that has Italian Sky TV. Most channels are Italian but there are English ones. Some of the channels are multi-lingual, if you click the 'i' button you can change the language. The room has a small mini-bar, the prices were reasonable. If you look at my photos I've included the price list. The walls in the room are canvas material. This really helps with the soundproofing. I didn't hear a noise from any other guests whilst I was there. Though unfortunately I did hear alot of noise from the traffic. I stayed in room 103 on the first floor, even thought it doesn''t face onto the road the traffic noise was very annoying. Shutting the blind help but we only figured out how to do this on our last day! (there's a button next to the bed). The bathroom is small but nice. There is a bidet which is always a bonus. The shampoo/hand cream is orange scented which was a nice touch. Our room had a bath with a shower overhead. The bath has glass sliding doors which kept the bathroom nice and dry. Our rate included breakfast which is served on the top floor between 7:30 and 10:00. The was very good, there were cakes, cereal, yoghurts, croissants, toast etc... The coffee was also nice (they'll make many varieties using a proper coffee machine). The breakfast room is pretty small though and only has a few tables, this wasn't a problem as there were so few guests staying in the hotel. In the summer I think they put extra tables on the room patio. The views from the breakfast room are very good. You can see over the rooftops and the dome of St. Peters. The hotel apparently offers wireless internet but I failed to pick up the signal for it. There is an internet station downstairs but I didn't use it. The staff all seemed nice enough, they spoke English well and upon request recommended a nice Pizzeria in the city. One thing that did concern me is that there is no luggage room. For a modern hotel this seems stupid. When we checked out we had to leave our bags behind the computer desk. This was open for anyone to take. I didn't like this but had no other choice. The bags were always in sight of the receptionist but I'd much prefer them to be locked in a room. Nothing was taken. One other problem with this hotel is the lack of literature. There is nothing to tell you about the hotel. There was no 'do not disturb' sign, no information on how to use the pay movies. No information on the services. I could find no mention of the breakfast room and it's location. In the room there was a strange small flashing green light next to the door. If you pushed the button on the panel it would change to orange. Push it again and it went to red. Push it again and it'd go off. I have no idea whatsoever what this was for! Also it's not obvious that the blind is electrical. It's only by randomly pushing a button that I figured it out. All in all I liked the hotel I paid \u20ac78 a night which is a good price. The other hotels in this price band were all located near the Termini. I'd advise against booking a hotel there as it seemed a dodgy area. Many unsavoury looking people seem to hang around the streets near the Termin at night. If they could make a luggage room, and sort out a little book with useful information it would make a big difference. I would stay at the hotel again. Forgive the quality of some of the photos, my camera isn't the best! I just tried to post as many as I could because there are currently no photos of the hotel on tripadvisor.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Service\u201d", "Author": "AmiGermany", "ReviewID": "UR12145891", "Content": "We had awful service while we stayed in December 07. We did not know how to get from the hotel to the airport, and the front desk \"girl\"...there was not a person that worked at the desk the four days we stayed there older than 25.,,,said that we should just check the internet ourselves. I told her that I would think that a hotel would know exactly how to get to the airport considering it's a hotel in one of the biggest cities in the world. She then told me to just look it up myself and that she couldn't help me. Then you have to pay 2 euros for 30 minutes of internet use, 3 euros for one hour, and 10 euros for 24 hours. The problem with that was that it was NEVER advertised liked that on their website. Also, the room to eat breakfast in was tiny, and the girl that works there doesn't speak English and my wife was only allowed one coffee per breakfast. It was very crowded and there was nowhere to sit. However, saying all that the rooms were very clean, and the flat screen tv and sky was a bonus. The location is also great right by the metro and the vatican. The service has a LOT to be desired and people working there just didn't seem like they knew what they were doing.

Down sides were no hotel bar (although it may be different in summer - not sure) and also did not offer iron/ironing board (although this was also case in other Italy hotel) and also did not have a international adaptor we could borrow.
