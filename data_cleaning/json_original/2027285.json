It is a quiet neighborhood with little or no tourist attractions nearby, however there are many shopping centers a few kilometers from the hotel. The rooms we got were cosy and by all standards comfortable, there are however really small rooms, too.. The breakfast (included) was delicious!

For those purposes, the hotel was absolutely amazing. The shuttle took 10 minutes to get there from the airport. The guy at the front desk was very nice and spoke excellent English; check-in was a breeze. The room was smaller-size, but spotless and newly renovated, with a large comfortable bed. The bathroom was also very clean with a great shower which had good water pressure and temperature, which many times is a problem while travelling. The hotel is situation on a kind of hill, so we got a view of the surrounding neighborhood through a large window. Our wake-up call came on time. Our flight back was earlier than their breakfast, so the Air Boss even packed our breakfast to go! It was just a bologna and cheese sandwich with a juice box, but it was still very considerate. I took 1 star off for the location, which is in a quiet residential/warehouse neighborhood. It felt safe but there's absolutely nothing around. For our purposes the hotel was excellent, but it's not a good base for exploring Istanbul.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kaunas, Lithuania", "Title": "\u201cIt depends on the room you get\u201d", "Author": "Angelelis", "ReviewID": "UR126632973", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel twice in January 2012. The first time when I stayed there, I paid for the room. It was a double room on the 1st floor. The room was clean. The internet was pretty fast. However, since the lobby was only 1 floor down, the noise from the reception was heard all the time during the night. The other time I stayed there was due to my flight cancellation. The airline I was supposed to travel with put us into the same hotel. However, I wasn't as lucky as the 1st time I had stayed here. I got a single room one floor down the reception. The room was too small and very cold. The noise from the reception was heard as well. It was impossible to use the internet... I had to go to the lobby when I wanted to use it. However, the lobby was very cold since it was winter and the door kept on opening and closing.

The rooms are clean and basic. The curtains do not fit the windows meaning light floods in from 600hrs, no water, tea or coffee is available in the rooms. The Hotel itself is built directly underneath the flight path and the noise from the aircraft is unbelievable (approx every 4 mins an aircraft flies overhead at very low altitude). The views from the room consist of a lorry park and dirty river! No Wifi available. Food was terrible and breakfast should only be attempted if you close to starving. The staff however were very friendly and approachable, and whilst they were not able to make the radical changes necessary to make this a half decent place to stay, I have to give credit for their attempts. Istanbul offers some amazing accommodation........... Air Boss Hotel is not one of those.

As a result we were accommodated at the Air Boss hotel compliments of Turkish Airlines. Although it was inconvenient we love Istanbul and decided to take advantage of the visit. This new hotel is located approximately 4 miles from Ataturk airport and a 20 minute taxi ride to the old town. The hotel is modern and offers basic amenities. We were given a room on the second floor which, although small, was spotlessly clean and comfortable. A full breakfast, consisting of a combination of Western and Turkish food, is served buffet style next to the small reception area on the main floor. It was generous but poor. Service in the restaurant also left a lot to be desired. However the receptionists and hotel manager were particularly helpful and friendly. When we arrived we had minor difficulties with both the television and Wifi in our room. The manager came to our room soon after our call and resolved the television issue but said it might take awhile to fix the Wifi. He then offered us the use of his personal computer until the Wifi problem was fixed! We didn't accept but the offer left a good impression of the manager's commitment to service. Next morning he also called a taxi and wrote specific directions to the hotel in case the taxi driver had difficulty finding it on the return trip. This proved valuable as even with written directions our taxi driver made several wrong turns before finally arriving at the Air Boss. The receptionist also allowed us to use the hotel computer. She then navigated the Turkish Airline website (not easy), showed us how to select airline seats and then printed our boarding passes for the flight home. This was really quite helpful as it could only be done online and not by telephone. Next day we were able to bypass the lengthy lineup and proceed to security. While the Air Boss is a basic hotel and its location isn't good if one wants to be close to Istanbul's main attractions, it is close to the airport and offers clean, comfortable accommodations and good service for an overnight stay. Kudos to the manager and reception staff!", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFair business hotel but nothing special, would not recommend it\u201d", "Author": "J9cas", "ReviewID": "UR99340257", "Content": "This hotel is ok for its EUR 79 per night rooms but located in a terrible neighbourhood - don't go out and don't even bother to look outside.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Air Boss Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2027285-Reviews-Air_Boss_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$77 - $104*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Teyfik Bey Mah.
