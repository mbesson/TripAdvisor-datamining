The beds hard as a rock. TV an old, small screen CRT type with limited channels. Lighting from grandma\u2019s house. I had to unscrew one bulb because the wall light and bed light were on same switch. A kitchenette but all supplies locked up, not even a glass to use. Air-conditioning was an old nosy window shaker and to use it you had to leave open the curtains letting in the street light outside and the view of the neighbouring apartment dwellers across the ally. The bathroom very basic. Cheap toiletries, cheap toilet paper, NO Kleenex tissues anywhere in room. Small thin towels. Exhaust fan that was tied to light switch and made hearing impossible. I could go on but you get the idea. Worth $50 maybe, NOT $250! Then they screwed up my credit card by double billing the security and not communicating to night audit that a cash deposit had been made. Despite a number of pleas and providing the forums to be signed off it took an additional 42 days after staying there to get the credit hold of $328 removed from my card.

The clerk was very friendly and answered any questions we had. The elevator is very secure (must scan your room key before elevator moves). The room was clean and we had wrapped plastic & styrofoam cups & coffee (coffee pot of course). We thought that having disposable cups were a great idea as I had watched a program of TV not long before on the amount of germs (not properly washed) being left on glass cups & glasses in hotel/motel rooms.

I went into the hotel a few days before my stay to make sure that my reservation was all in place. The fellow at the front desk was not able to find my reservation. The hotel manager left and came back with a copy of my booking, saying that it was all good. I had booked a King size bed for 3 nights. Upon arrival the first night, (it was almost 1am) I was informed that my reservation had been cancelled. I had not been contacted or notified. The fellow at the front desk said that he put me in a room of equal value which was 2 Double beds. I went into the room, and in the bathroom there was no basket with soap or facecloths, shampoo or lotion, no cups. I was then woken up at 10:45 the next morning (when I had a reservation for 3 nights) because somebody else had that specific room booked for early the next day. Why not just put me in a room that I would not have been disturbed in? I went down to the front desk to check out, and was notified by an older asian fellow that he was sorry for the inconvenience, but would provide me with a key for a King size room for the next 2 nights. A key card was provided at that time. When I came back that night, the room that was assigned to me, was again 2 Double beds. After being promised a King size bed this was not Kosher. The room itself was not clean. The far bed had a shelf at the foot for luggage, the back of the shelf was missing a strip that had been broken off, and was laying on the first bed. The room did not look like it had been vaccuumed by the bedside table. The bathroom was missing a bath mat for the floor, and the 2 cups. The bathtub and sink also had a green film from the nickel content in the water. Under the bathroom sink was dirty, some kind of a dried brown stain. I notified the front desk person of these problems and they took down a list, they advised me it would be passed on to the manager. I left the next morning and came back for the 3rd night. The bathtub and sink still had the green film, the cups were still missing in the bathroom. The brown stain under the sink was still there. There was a bathmat this time, the broken off board from the luggage rack had been removed, but the floor by the bedside table had still not been vaccuumed. A lightbulb in the entranceway was burnt out. Also various parts of the room were dusty (the headboards, the t.v.) The window ledge in the room was also a brown color, when it was supposed to be a pink that matched the rest of the room, but it was so dirty it did not just wipe right off. When I voiced my complaint to the manager when I was checking out, he could not be bothered to even come down to the front desk, and took my complaints over the phone. His excuse for me not getting the room that I had booked, was that there was a leak. The fellow working the front desk the next morning had promised me a King size bed and had downright lied to me. The manager said that it was because the room was not available, but that was no excuse for being lied to. I was also advised that the reason there was a green film in the tubs and sinks was not because the cleaning ladies were not doing their jobs, but because the brand of cleaning product that they used, was not as efficient as the previous one. However, I was able to wipe off some of the green film with nothing more than a kleenex and some water. For all of my inconvenience, I was only given a 10% discount on my second night, which totalled all of about $14. My total before the discount was $410 and after was $395.71. Not sufficient enough for all the mistakes and the general uncleanliness of the room. Not to mention a very pushy and rude older lady at the front desk, who is insistent upon making everything that happens part of her business, even if she has nothing to do with it.", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cTerrible hotel.. avoid this one\u201d", "Author": "seacamel", "ReviewID": "UR8218646", "Content": "We had a wedding recently in Vancouver BC.

It is well located - On Robson St in the midst of many restaurants, a few blocks from several internet cafes ($1 for 1/2 hr), and 1/2 block from the #5 Robson St bus. People at the front desk were not particularly friendly. The lobby looks a bit rundown. The room would be very small but for the \"suite\" aspect - an alcove with a kitchen area and a small table and chairs. No luggage racks. There were no dishes in the kitchen, but I think you can pay extra and get them. We paid $99 Canadian per night during the week and $119 C on Sat. night.This is expensive but everything in Vancouver is expensive (food is much more than in Chicago, for example, in comparable places). The room was clean. The bathroom was small but not tiny. Bed was reasonably firm. They need more lights for reading. It was hard to read in the room. I thought of going out and buying a higher watt bulb. The tv had the most stations of any we stayed at in our 3 week trip. There is a laundry room in the basement which costs C$4 to wash and C$2 to dry. However, it is only available to hotel guests from 6:30p.m. to 11 p.m. You need to take a bus to most locations.
