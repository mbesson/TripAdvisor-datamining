As such, I have stayed numerous times at J.W. Marriott, which is located a short ride from the Dubai International Airport. If you get charged over/more than 50 UAE durhams (local currency), you've been jipped... the ride is anywhere between 30 & 50 durhams... depending on the time of travel due to Dubai traffic. Once you arrive to J.W. Marriott, you'd think you're entering a palace, and not a hotel. The foyer is grand, as is this hotel... you'll find plenty of entertainment; whether you're in Dubai for pleasure or business, this hotel will accomodate your needs. Gym, pool, spa, restaurants (in-house), coffee shops,... and if you're into some shopping, you have two immediate options: one is the adjacent local shopping mall, or as the other option is the shopping mall literally across the street from Marriott. Obviously, being in Dubai, you'd expect luxury et all... well, this hotel is at the high end, and may certainly have you feel like a king/queen for the duration of your stay. Staff is pretty helpful; although at times, you'd definitely have to struggle a bit due to language barrier; even though all of the staff is english speaking, english is not their first language and most of them are not fluent; so, there ya have it... For some, this may be a bit pricey hotel,... and especially since you do not get the full spectrum of services; e.g. you have to pay for the internet connection??? Seriously??? At this day and age??? C'mon Marriott,... for the amount of money you make a day, you can certainly afford to add internet connection as a complimentary service for all of your guests. Regarding Dubai itself, well... there's people that love it, and there's people that hate it... I am with the latter group... I have never liked it, do not, and will never like it... it is bottom line heartless, soulless, artificial whatever you might wanna call it... city, hmmm... I don't think so. But, never you mind all of that; back to J.W. Marriott: the rooms are comfortable; very spacious, with a huge flat screen tv, and a large bathroom... bed is great... you will get your rest,... your \"five minutes\" of peace and quiet,... Bottom line, I recommend this hotel for all people passing through Dubai, and not wanting to stay at the horrible-terrible airport hotel...

Our general impression of the hotel was that it needs a renovation or at least replacement of furniture in rooms, reception, outlets etc. It's an old hotel and you can tell. We had dinner in the Bamboo Lagoon which served a buffer with various Asian dishes. The food was ok, not fantastic. There was a 'Valentines package' on offer at the healthclub which included a 60min full-body massage, 30 min facial and 30% discount in any restaurant in the hotel for AED 350 in total. Worth doing if you decide to stay in for an evening. Overall we enjoyed our stay, but mainly because we had a good deal via the Marriott Vacations Club.

JW Marriott being a trusted name world wide and I holding a membership in it, opted it for my family stay but to my utter surprise, the 5 star hotel cares the least for those guests who arrive here by group bookings. My bookings were made through North Tours, Dubai and the day I arrived in Dubai i.e 27th Jan 12, they started cheating us. The immigration and Retina scan process took 2-3 hrs and even when they had been informed for a late pick up from airport, North Tours just turn their back shedding away from responsibility. Even the hotel didnt care to check about our late arrivals. The room booked through North Tour was sub standard and inspite of shedding a heavy amount I was denied of the basic Tea-Coffee maker facility in the deluxe room. The room was in a bad shape with unattractive interiors and maintenance demanding bathrooms. While I was not happy with the room stay, on the other hand North Tour made it worse by their indifferent and arrogant attitude. The drivers just give a call on their way to the guest and if the phone remains unanswered for any reason, they just leave the guest unpicked on the pretext of Guest not shown up, while they actually do not wait in the hotel lobby. My desert safari trip was ruined by these people. The representative from North Tours Mr Chandra Singh Rathore states blankly\" Either you feel Good or bad about it, we cant help\". Since the booking was made through North Tour, Marriott doesnt even care to investigate the problems and cater to the needs of the guest. I am terribly upset with both the North Tour and hotel.

Pool is located on the rooftop and is nice. Flight path from airport gives you a good look at the underbellies of aircraft taking off in the near distance. Service at pool is good and friendly. Service in Executive Club for the most part is not up to par to other JW's. No one asked to take breakfast egg order and almost everyday had to search for someone to take our order. Best service came from a trainee named Jessica who was there on an externship from The Netherlands. Atmosphere is very loud. Not so much due to guests, (though the acoustics are poor and the room gets loud), but due to the fact that the staff makes a lot of noise banging dishes, clinking glasses, etc. when they set up and take down at breakfast and cocktail times. It is hard to hold a meeting with the noise and then they vacuum and clean the room during business hours. Couldn't this be done when the lounge is closed?

I was here waiting for a few days waiting for a flight home during the volcanic ash thing. Hadn't been to Dubai in a couple of years, and always used to stay at the Intercontinental at the Creek. On the face of it, this place was up to that standard, but realised it wasn't quite. Rooms are lovely. The one I had was huge, very nicely furnished/decorated, and had everything I could need. However, I was on the Exec Floor due to Marriott frequent stay card. However, I expect the rooms are in general pretty good. The hotel is built around a huge indoor courtyard which is quite a sight. You can sit in there and have a coffee/snack/meeting, and it has a huge glass domed roof which really makes you feel like you're outdoors without the heat/breeze. Very impressive, and looks great fromt the lifts which look onto it a you go up to your room. There are many restaurants at the hotel itself - about a dozen - but be warned, quality varies enormously and all are VERY pricey. In fact, my impression is this place lures you in with rates comparable to similar hotels (not extortionate, to be fair, for the type and quality of hotel) but then really stings you for all the extras. I mean REALLY stings you - how about \u00a320 ($30) a **day** for internet! Yes, $30 a day. This is a constant gripe in nearly all my hotel reviews: paying for internet access at all; how come hotels charge us for this essentially fixed-cost item? Answer: because they can. Why don't they charge extra for running water and lighting? One day this will seem as unacceptable as smoking on planes. Anyway, back to those restaurants. All are in very nice surroundings. A couple of them are really good - JW's steak house and the Lebanese restaurant especially. The former is superb, but particularly extortionate though. Really expensive. Like $150 for my meal - a beer, a main course steak with potatoes and veg, and a singe glass of wine. On my own. However, the Market Place restauruant was particulalry disappointing. It only has (very high-priced) all-inclusive all-you-can-eat-and-drink packages, but the food choice is not what it could be at the price (starting at about \u00a350 ($75) a head). In fact, the food isn't very good at all. The Intercontinental on the Creek is attached to a mall complex where there is another restaurtant on the same theme (choose your raw ingredints like in a market and get them cooked in front of you) also called - no coincidence, I'm sure - the Market Place, which is much, much better than this one. And I don't believe it was anywhere near as expensive. That one is highly recommended if still there. My theory is that all the restaurants in this JW are so expensive because the location of the hotel (unless you need to be near the airport, and it's not even really that near) is not good at all. It's not near anything, and certainly not in any of the hotspots of Dubai. There's no view of anything from anywhere. You can easily and cheaply get about in cabs in Dubai, but I suspect the hotel relies on people on business not venturing out and choosing to eat in, and charging accordingly. Heallth club is very good. Service in general if you need anything is VERY fast and efficient.

The standard of service was second to none; the check in staff, restaurant and pool staff all made us feel very welcome. The bed was probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and the steak in the JW Steakhouse was definitely the best I've ever had. Lets start with our arrival; the hotel is close to the airport (the only negative of this hotel is its location as mentioned in other reviews), so we got there about 30 mins after we stepped off the plane thanks in part to Emirates super fast new terminal. This meant that we were in our room and able to shower after an overnight flight within 45 mins of landing. The instant cool of the air conditioned (vast) lobby was most welcome. The very friendly receptionist noticed from my passport that is was my birthday and when I cheekily asked if there may be an upgrade available, she was more than happy to accommodate and we were upgraded to a suite. Not a bad start. After getting settled in the room, we were brought fresh fruit and juice as well as ice and water, before heading up to the fantastic roof top swimming pool. It was about 45 degrees when we were there but there were shaded areas and the pool was a good temperature. The staff at the pool also kept coming round with cold towels and (more!) fresh fruit. In the evening we ate in the JW Steakhouse and I honestly had the best steak of my life - the Wagyu Ribeye was like butter in the mouth. My girlfriend had the steak selection of rump, sirloin and fillet and this too was fantastic. It wasn't cheap (about \u00a3150 for 2 mains, wine and coffee) but the Wagyu itself was \u00a350!, and it was still fantastic value for the quality of food. I ate in the Al Mahatma restaurant in the Burj a couple of years ago and this was much better. Whilst the location wasn't ideal, the city cabs are very cheap and it's only about \u00a310 to Jumeirah where most of the other hotels and restaurants we visited were located. Warning - make sure you take a city cab (yellow with a taxi sign), as the private taxis say they are the same price but are about double for the same ride in a marginally nicer car. We visited the Atlantis hotel for the Aquaventure (good value in the summer and even cheaper (150 Dhs) after 3pm until 6pm - we found this enough time). I probably would have been disappointed if I'd paid the full price of 300 Dhs. We also went to Jumeirah beach - ok but to be honest there are better things to do in Dubai - and in the summer the sea was like a bath! One thing I strongly recommend is a visit to the Dubai Mall and the Burj Dubai - it's quite something to see the world's tallest tower next to the world's largest shopping mall, in front of the world's biggest fountain - think Bellagio x 10 - the light and sound show is amazing and runs about every 20 mins. As we had a very late flight (3am) the hotel were happy to hold our bags and provide us with beach towels until we left. Loved Dubai even more this time round, largely due to our choice of hotel.

Its very close to the airport though, but there are closer hotels, some of which are on the airport, so its location has no real upsides, if you want to stay at the airport for a night... stay on the airport, if you want to stay in Dubai, stay in Dubai proper, yes? Well no, actually, and this comes down to one fact... laughably cheap and plentiful taxis! Before we go on, a short explanation about the Dubai cab system. Firstly the standing charge, thats \u00a34 from the airport and \u00a31 from the streets. The fare thereafter is about 33p per mile! With no charge for waiting time, which is just as well, the roads are packed and vary between dead stop (which can last a long time) and murderously fast. Driving in Dubai is a nightmare, heck you take your life in your hands merely crossing the road (Tip. dont jaywalk... unless you want to be turned to jam, motorists neither give nor expect any quarter in their relentless war of movement... or frequently, non-movement!) No mercy is shown here, the uncertain hire car jockey should expect relentless abuse. But with cabs so cheap, why hire a car and suffer? The citycabs are invariably relatively new airconditioned Toyotas painted beige with different coloured roofs depending upon the company that operates the licence. Nonetheless do be aware that alongside the citycabs exist private cabs. These are generally more luxurious, Lexus or BMW... or alternatively peoplecarriers with larger capacities... but also more expensive, expect to pay about 50p a mile where fitted with a meter, otherwise fix a price before getting in. The Hotel porters are unfairly accused of summoning private cabs but I dont think thats so. Mostly a citycab is dropping someone off at the hotel so you use those, but where momentarily that isn't the case the porter will go out into the roads and flag down the first cab. I saw private cabs waiting near the hotel on many occasions to pull in. If you want a citycab make that clear to the porter. Dubai itself is is a sprawling urban metropolis, a semi-independent citystate in the UAE, so wherever you stay you'll only be close to what you're near, and that wont be anything like everything... if you see what I mean! The JW is close to none of the touristy bits... but the airport... yet for less than \u00a35 in one of the municipality airconditioned cabs you'll get anywhere around this sprawling city. The cost of cabs is so cheap that the JW becomes a hotel to consider... And well worth considering it is! All the rooms are sumptuously furnished with the fab Marriot bed. The buffet breakfasts are astonishing in their breadth of choice. The swimming pool area on the top of the hotel is a haven of tranquility from the dusty, busy streets below. The JW has a huge number of restaurants on the premises not to mention a similar number in the mall connected to the hotel. Food choices hence abound. Service throughout the hotel is faultlessly good but a special mention must go to the JW Steakhouse, wonderful service, great surroundings and the Chateaubriand steak is not to be missed. Others have commented how fab the JW steakhouse is and I can only concur. No other restaurant in Dubai stood up to it, not even the Burj Al Arab... yes we did eat there and pass on this hint, if you want to go to the top you need to book afternoon tea, not that it'll be anything like those from Claridges... but you will at least get the view from the top of the Burj. The Burj is in fact about 25km from the Hotel so the cab is about \u00a310 each way... As I said, cabs are laughably cheap!! Now whilst cabs are cheap, booze, I am afraid, is not. Expect to pay \u00a37 for 330ml beer and since alcohol can only be sold in hotel bars, you'll not avoid that punishment whenever you drink out. Off licence alcohol, if you can find it is apparently hideously expensive... and from what I read unavailable to tourists (officially a \"dry\" city, only non residents can drink alcohol and only in hotel bars, or from off licences where the purchaser needs the licence!). My advice... pick up a slab of cans from the duty free arrivals hall at Dubai International, if you're arriving by Emirates its next to the baggage reclaim. Still expensive, but not murderous, the personal allowance is 24x330ml cans which cost \u00a319. Put them into the hotelroom fridge and at least you have the daytime drinks covered. AND in May, you will be in your room during the daytime, as the temperature is unbelievably hot. We would get up at 6 or 7am, go to the pool and sunbathe for a few hours, come in for breakfast at 10 and then siesta in our room or go to airconditioned areas till 2 or 3pm when we'd go to the beach, or venture out into the non airconditioned sights and souks. I know many have written stating that Dubai is no longer the bargain palace it was, but with the exception of alcohol and hotel food, Dubai ranges from relatively inexpensive to bonkers cheap when you leave behind the main tourist trails. Do note, getting to the beach is a cab ride so definitely, if you're planning going for the beach all day, every day, I'd suggest you stay at the hotels around Jumeriah, although you'll then miss out on Dubai... aha, choices, choices! Next, what to do? Well, a big recommendation this one... definitely do the Desert Safari, its an experience of a lifetime, and one you wont forget. Do beware, on the desert safaris you do get what you pay for. Ours cost a relatively expensive 250aed per person, booked via concierge, but the driver was a consummate expert and took the dunes on much more adventurously than most others, the jeep was at the higher end of the market and made the ride much better for faster acceleration, he also took part in a \"dune rally\" at the end, rather than heading straight for the road as most did. Do it, you'll not regret it! Also do go on the evening boat trip. This one shouldn't be booked with the conceirge, they'll recommend a hideoudsly expensive cruise. Just go down to the waterfront on the evening you want to go at about 7.30pm. Walk past the boats and the owners will reduce their prices for your business, since some leave at 8pm and others at 8.30, you do need to start meandering around at 7.30pm. Our trip included all food and unlimited booze for half the cost of the hotel recommendation... and was absoloutely excellent! Lastly, the Souks are another must. Walk around, drink in the atmosphere and get haggling! You'll walk away with a bargain and a great afternoon/evenings entertainment! So, finally, returning to the hotel... all in all, great sized rooms, fab public areas, direct airconditioned walking connection to a good mall (the bureaux de change at the mall offers excellent rates, so change your sterling there) and a wonderful rooftop swimming pool with attentive staff, and scrupulous cleanliness definitely deserves its 5 stars... No its not Claridges, or any of the opulent 5 star palaces, but neither does it charge like them. This hotel is a full on, solid 5 star experience, and with some astonishing roomrates makes it a value proposition as a base to expore and immerse yourself into the city.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alwaysmidair", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Staff, Brilliant services\u201d", "Author": "HiFlyerDee", "ReviewID": "UR31610736", "Content": "I frequently keep travelling to Dubai on one nighters, and this hotel provided me the best stay so far.The staff are exceptionally warm and eager to help, the location of the hotel is conveniently close from the airport, and yet also close to malls and other attractions.The hotel also provides a free coach service to one of the biggest malls around - City Centre.

There is also a sofa, 2 chairs, coffee table, magazine rack, desk, TV stand/TV (nice, but not a flat panel LCD/plasma). Standard mini-bar with HIGH prices (you can buy up to 4 bottles of alcohol at the Arrivals Dubai Duty Free; take advantage of it, if you wish). There is an in-room safe and a nice selection of amenities (robe, nice towels, toiletries, etc). Room was comfortable, but a bit dated; looks like the same furnishings as in 2000. Get an interior room that overlooks the indoor atrium; great view of the area around some of the restaurants and it beats a street view. The hotel is about 15 minutes from the airport, depending on traffic (which is awful). If you stay on the executive floor, there is a complimentary pick-up/drop-off service from/to the airport (a nice Mercedes sedan). The driver meets you on the lower level of the arrival terminal, just prior to immigration control. The location is OK, not great. It's connected to a small shopping center (Hamrain Center), and relatively close to some other shopping. But a bit of a ride from the main shopping areas (but taxis are relatevely cheap). Service was good; housekeeping kept the place nice and the folks at the executive floor desk were helpful. The executive floor lounge is nicely furnished and has a decent breakfast buffet, heavy hors d'oeuvres at night, snacks and coffee(cappuccino) and sodas throughout the day and complimentary 'name brand' cocktails in the evening. Service in the lounge was excellent. There is complimentary wi-fi service in the executive lounge, and two internet capable computers and a printer in the executive floor business center. There are several good restaurants. The Steak House may be the best in town, and the German restaurant is very good. We ate at the Italian restaurant (same area as the Steak House); romantic setting and good food. About the only negatives about the hotel: - no coffee maker in the room. A small point, as there is coffee, etc., in the lounge. But not great for those of us who like a cup of Joe before showering. - in-room internet access is 100 dirhams/day (about $27 USD). Again, there is wi-fi in the lounge, but why charge an excessive rate in a premium room? Overall, I would recommend the hotel, especially if you qualify for a discount rate.

The hotel is less than 10 minutes from the airport (about $15 Dirham\u2019s to the airport, $25 Dirham\u2019s leaving the airport) which is great because the traffic in Dubai in the morning and evening is horrendous. Upon entering the hotel at 11:00 pm to check-in the lobby is grand and well appointed. I had reserved four rooms at the hotel for myself and others in my party. Check-in was routine. I was upgraded to a suite on the second floor room 275. Upon entering the room there was a big living room with bedroom off to one side. I stay in Marriott\u2019s over 100 nights per year\u2026.this room needs to be updated. The furniture in this room was old\u2026and has seen many better days. The bedroom was a standard Marriott King bedroom\u2026.nothing fancy about it. Internet service will run you about $30 U.S dollars a day\u2026.its free in the Concierge lounge if you have access. The real fun began my first night. Room 275 sits over a small group of restaurants. Karaoke or the bad live band played until 12:30 a.m. Cigar and cigarette smoke made its way into the air-conditioning system to my room every night\u2026..so turning it off early in the evening was a must. I requested to be moved my first and second mornings there because of the noise and smoke\u2026.they said they would see what they could do\u2026.nobody called me back\u2026or even had a note on my account that I had asked. The band played every night\u2026and there are only so many times you can listen to Brown-eyed-girl and Beach Boys before you grow sick of it. I tried breakfast two mornings in the Concierge lounge\u2026pretty disappointing\u2026.just cheese, fruit and pastries. The Market Place restaurant in the hotel isn\u2019t much better either. The ethnic food was interesting to try\u2026but they don\u2019t know how to cook the simplest things like eggs\u2026.and the service once they sat you down was spotty\u2026.don\u2019t expect coffee refills. Went to the pseudo Starbucks to get a cup of coffee at 9:50 am one morning and was told by the girl behind the counter that she was going on break and to come back later. Ate dinner at the Hofbrauhaus in the hotel one night with my group and we had a good time. Great beer and the food was ok. The hotel has a great health club on the top floor. Squash courts, free weights, Cardio room, sauna and steam room\u2026.its all there. The roof top pool is very nice as well. There is plenty of seating in the sun or out\u2026and the attendants up there walk you to a seat and even open the umbrella for you. There is a bar and food service there as well. I had lunch at the Grand Hyatt in Dubai one afternoon which I believe is a 7 star hotel\u2026.it was amazing hotel to say the least. You can\u2019t compare the two hotels even a little. I wouldn\u2019t say the JW Marriott in Dubai is anything special; in fact it\u2019s a disappointment. I have stayed at JW and regular Marriott\u2019s over the years and I feel this hotel does not meet many of the above-average standards you expect from a JW. My bill was around $2700 U.S. dollars for just one room\u2026.for all four rooms over $14,000. When we go back to Dubai, we will most definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt the JW Marriott isn\u2019t worth the price.", "Date": "November 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manama, Bahrain", "Title": "\u201cAlways a good bet\u201d", "Author": "baliblue", "ReviewID": "UR10053270", "Content": "I have stayed at The JW a few times, and it use to be my hotel of choice in Dubai; however the prices went up and the budget doen't always cover the extra cost.

If you are looking for something close to the airport then its perfect for you. Beautiful rooms with great beds, very good dining and a modest but relaxing pool area. If you like Asian food I recommend the Bamboo Lounge. About 60 USD for all you can eat and drink (including alcoholic beverages). The sports bar Champs is good for a quick bite. It didn't go the steak restaurant but it looked very upscale. There are obviously better hotels in Dubai but I would, without a doubt, stay at the JW again. P.S.

This was our first time in Dubai. The hotel is less than 5km from the airport and a 15-20minute drive depending on the traffic, about 9USD. The rooms are very nice, pretty much your typical JW business hotel. Great comfortable beds, our room faced the airport runways, so obviously no view. The windows are double glazed so you never heard any street/airport noise. However the hallways were not so quiet. Beware of weekend stays, the hotel has alot of weddings. It is connected to the Hamarain shopping center, which has a food court and 2 levels of shops. There is no coffee in the room like the US Marriotts have, the Vienna Cafe in the lobby has a nice selection of coffee and pastries. We ate in Cucina the Italian restaurant and had excellent pizza. Also had dinner at Bamboo Lagoon, which is a buffet with various cooking stations of Asian type foods and a fabulous desset assortment. Prices vary with or without alcohol in all the hotel restaurants. The hotel offers a fabulous deal if you want to spend a day at the beach. You can book with the lobby concierge the day before and for 21USD we received transportation (private BMW sedan) to the Jumeriah beach area (Le Meridien hotel) given a gift bag with assorted items to use at the beach. You are dropped off at 1000 and picked us at 1600. We were given cold lavender towels and cold Perrier water for our drive back, (A regular taxi ride is about 25USD oneway) so this is quite a bargain. The JW is in a crummy location, so if you want to get away for the day, would highly recommend this day trip. Also the hotel offers 1/2 and 3/4 day rates due to the large percentage of late night flight departures. We checked out before 1900 and were only charged a half day. Nice touch. I personally found the fitness room small, and the roof top pool okay, can get crowded quickly. The staff are great and anticpate your needs. My only negative comment is on a personal level, smoking is allowed just about everywhere. Smoking/non-smoking sections in restaurants are in theory only. Do not like to eat my meals with second hand smoke, other than the that and the poor location, this JW is a great place to stay, just wish it was on the beach.", "Date": "August 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuwait", "Title": "\u201cA cockroach on my sleeping pillow\u201d", "Author": "Abdulrazaq", "ReviewID": "UR8032910", "Content": "I just came back to my country last Friday from Dubai, and I stayed in JW Marriott Hotel Dubai, and I wish I hadn't, can you imagine what I found on my sleeping pillow, a cockroach.
