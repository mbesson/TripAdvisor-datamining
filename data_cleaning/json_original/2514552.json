Apparently this is one of 8 \"sister\" hotels in the area which explains other people's posts about being moved from one hotel to another. I would describe this hotel as a glorified hostel. It was clean but very basic, a tiny bedroom with thin walls and even tinier beds. I have no problem sleeping in a single bed but these beds were child-sized and I was at risk of falling out each time I turned! The worst thing was the temperature of the bedroom; it was absolutely freezing. When we arrived in the room the 2 windows were wide open. We closed the windows and went out for dinner. When we arrived back at about 11pm the room was still very cold and neither of the radiators were working. I called down to reception at about 11.45pm and was told that the heating would be coming on in ten minutes. It didn't. It was a long, chilly, uncomfortable night made worse by the noises coming from next door through paper-thin walls and the fear of falling out of the cot-sized bed. The room was still cold the next morning so we had a quick shower and got out of there. We didn't even bother with breakfast.

The housekeeping was a different matter, sometimes they didn\u00b4t leave new towels (ran out), and they came in despite I\u00b4d told them not to.
