{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Peaceful but fun We stayed at Gawana in early July. We have two children aged 15 and 8 and we all love snorkelling, which was the attraction of this resort.Firstly, West Bali is a long, long way from Ubud, Denpasar and Kuta. In time, culture and climate. Our driver must have taken us on a scenic route as it took us over 5 hours from Ubud, dodging chickens, mopeds and dogs all the way. The landscape got drier and warmer after we passed over the central mountains in low cloud. Very dramatic. Our sense of fatigue disappeared as we reached gawana as it truly is an oasis. The views are to die for and the architecture of Lumbungs and low bungalows is sympathetic and unique.The Gawana is obviously not new place. Many of the fittings, fixtures and fabric are a bit tired, but this just adds to the charm. It's not the 'four seasons' but that's a good thing. We had two Lumbung suites, but in reality we only used one as they are easily big enough for four. Facilities in the suites are a bit basic but we were there for the snorkelling so we didn't really care. There is a games room, reminiscent of 50's holiday camps and a single on site restaurant. Eating out isn't really an option as the nearest village is very small and not set up for tourists but to my surprise and delight the restaurant was excellent. The chef really knew what he was doing and his creations would not have been out of place in 5 star horels in Singapore or Hong Kong. The tuna tataki was incredible.Snorkelling and diving takes place at the nearby coral reef and is simply wonderful. The gawana has it's own dive centre and we were kitted out by Anya (an ex-pat German) in excellent wet suits an gear. We were also provide with a guide, a boat and pilot and lunch. All fabulous.There has to be some down points though. West Bali is quite Muslim and I was awakened by the call to prayer at 4 am and the accompanying cockerel calls. The hotel also made a mistake with our booking and there was a prolonged negotiation to get it fixed. For obvious reasons this place attracts honeymooners and we were the only family there. if it wasn't for the Japanese scuba divers we would have felt like real goosberries!", "Date": "Jul 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR597157326", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Dunblane"}, {"Content": "Paradise found! Wonderfully landscaped property in relatively remote northwestern part of the island (Taman Nasional Bali Barat). Much less touristy than Lovina, and definitely not a place to party or surf like Kuta and no huge resort style complex like Nusa Dua or Jimbaran. If you like nature at its best, surrounded by tranquility, facing a calm bay, opportunities to row and dive, in an intimate setting far from modern civilization, but still accompanied by attentive, knowledgeable staff who respects privacy, then this is the place for you. No television in rooms. CD players for music only. Hard to find if you are driving, unless you are adventurous. Amazing adaptation of the indigenous architecture, and very tasteful incorporation of modern amenities into the bungalows. We stayed at both the Lumbung suites (inspired by traditional structures) and the Mangrove suites (only 2 available). We prefer the Lumbung for its unique design and mezzanine bed. Our parents like the Mangrove for its single floor plan with indoor-outdoor bath featuring a large soak tub fed with hot water from a nearby spring. Dinner at the poolside restaurant was fine, not excellent, and expensive for Indonesian standard, but as expected in an establishment this calibre. There are not many dining options around the area, and we prefer to enjoy the property, so we were glad to dine onsite. Good wine called Hatten Aga, especially the white, cultivated from a local winery. The best feature besides the suites are the infinity swimming pool and the pier, very relaxing and quiet. Picturesque nature abound. Check out the pictures. We will definitely return!", "Date": "May 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR286536647", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "NigellaCB"}, {"Content": "Great hotel, Best service, Very nice Grouns. :( no beach.       same", "Date": "Apr 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR924372102", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "tynert2"}, {"Content": "Peaceful paradise My wife booked this hotel, one of four we stayed in on our Bali trip. It's 4.5 hours from the airport - if you travel up in the evening, you miss the opportunity to visit some under-visited and interesting sites on the way. It's way up in the North West of Bali in the national park - great for wildlife, onshore and underwater. The resort arranged reasonably priced transfers with a knowledgeable driver. It is peaceful and beautiful. We stayed in one of the two suites with private outdoor gardens and it's big plunge pool/jacuzzi fed by a natural volcanic hotspring was a real treat. There were only two other guests at the resort when we were there. The staff are friendly, gentle and helpful. The swimming pool has a view to die for. It was a great option for us as I could dive (slightly wacky, but very knowledgeable guides, especially for Secret Bay) while my wife used the spa and went bird watching and jungle trekking. The restaurant food was unexceptional, except on the night when we booked a special meal via the chef and it was outstanding. Perfect for couples, honeymooners, and divers wanting something special: absolutely zero nightlife so ideal if you want a peaceful, special retreat. Maybe because we went in the rainy season we got a special deal, but we thought it was exceptional value for money.", "Date": "Apr 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR371069499", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MontySturdeeMount"}, {"Content": "Paradise on Earth       Jetty of Menjangan Island", "Date": "Aug 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR408301369", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "seign001"}, {"Content": "Wonderful resort Excelent location in a tiny bay near Menjangan Island and Bali Barat National Park in the north of Bali All rooms are big gawana Balines traditional cottages.
