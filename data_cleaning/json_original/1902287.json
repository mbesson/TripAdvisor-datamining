Our room was on the 1st floor with double bed, bathroom with full bath, sink and bidet. FREE Wi Fi in the room. Hairdryer and safety deposit box. Constant hot water and radiators in the bedroom and bathroom. Breakfast available for 5 euro extra but we preferred the Fantasy Pizza Cafe a short walk away for a hearty low priced breakfast. Helpful staff gave us a map. No curfew as you have your own key with code. There was a fridge at reception where you could get cool drinks if you wanted. Vacate room 11:00 and leave your luggage by reception safely. We would go back there again at the rates we paid which were on special offer for February (when it snowed!). For airport transfer we used an airport shuttle service (driver with 7 passengers). Price was 15 euro per person airport to hotel.

The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from Termini station which was great. If you wanted to walk into the centre (Pantheon, Trevi Fountain area) it took about 20 minutes, but you could also get the metro from Termini if you wanted. There is a great little cafe just next door to the right as you come out of the hotel which did great Cappuccinos and pastries in the morning and cheap! The receptionist Lillian was really helpful, gave us a map and pointed out areas of interest. Our room was really cold so I asked for extra blankets and when we came back Lillian had got us a heater which we were so happy with. She was always willing and able to help us with any issues. The room was basic but clean, couldn't really fault anything for the price we paid. Security was good, you have codes to enter to get into the main door and the living area after hours. Overall, would recommend to people who don't want luxury but somewhere clean and comfortable to stay.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cvery friendly and helpful low budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Evelyn_travelling", "ReviewID": "UR119759014", "Content": "Walking distance to Termini (Rome's main train station) and therefore all other forms of transport and destinations, the hotel location is hard to beat.

Aside from the very budget friendly room rates that are hard to find in Rome, it was the friendliness of the reception staff that made our stay truly pleasurable.

Compared to what I saw in the other ones, the prices I heared, Alexis came out the best. Don't expect a hotel with silver cutlery, a breakfast-buffet and an elevator boy, for this kind of travelling you will need a slightly bigger budget in Rome.

First of all, the location of the hotel is great, just 2 minutes from the Termini Train Station. When you enter you find the reception desk directly on your left. The decoration is perfect for a 2-star hotel, not very modern but doesn't seem old either. Our room was perfect. Small TV, as somebody else mentioned before in his comment, but who comes to Rome to watch TV? My only problem was that the soap in the bathroom was very liquid, they added a lot of water to it so we had to buy some. As for the service, the receptionist girl was incredibly friendly and sweet, she made us feel at home. Honestly, I prefer to stay at 2-star hotels with this kind of service than to go to a hotel with 200 rooms where you're just a small piece of a huge \"factory\" and they couldn't care less about you personally. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel to everybody!", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Girona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cA 1 star establishment, not worth the money\u201d", "Author": "johno.franklin", "ReviewID": "UR107414862", "Content": "Unfortunately, Hotel Alexis again proves that finding a good hotel in Rome for a reasonable price is near impossible. This still is no excuse for the sub standard condition of the hotel. It is closer to a one star accommodation. Our room, per definition of size, was reasonable, but the bed was old and offered little support, the lighting was basic exposed bulbs (also in the bathroom) and the private toilet facilities basic. Bring your own soap and shampoo. There was a TV, although it was more for 'window dressing'. The location was at the end of a long and dark corridoor, leaving questions regarding fire safety (no illuminating exit signs along the way at all). The room was clean, given, but there was not much to clean. The old state of the furnishings and bedding does however mean you can hide a lot. The staff were competent and helpful where required, only we did witness fellow hotel guests being turned away from breakfast when they had arrived 5 minutes before it was said to close. We had to help argue for their case, and they were allowed to have breakfast afterall. On that note, although breakfast is included it is meager and very limited. Cordial drink, a small tart, and chocolate croissants in plastic wrappers with expiration dates leading into 3 years from now. The only positive thing I can say is the hotel was secure, and they did offer free wifi access throughout, although this is something becoming far more commonplace in all hotels and even b&bs. Hotel Alexis is a one star hotel. Although it's location is good, and the staff competent, it lacks basic management and investment in the rooms. I would not stay here again and would recommend others against staying also.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot a good choice at all\u201d", "Author": "Canuckconfucious", "ReviewID": "UR105571221", "Content": "The hotel is located in the heart of Rome but that is worth nothing because the hotel is not worth it's money.
