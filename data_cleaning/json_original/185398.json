The 'kitchen' was actually a fridge, kettle, microwave, and a hot plate that didn't work. There were bowls and cutlery, but no pans or cooking utensils. Sort of defeats the purpose of having a kitchen. PROS Good location, in the 'better' part of Mexico City. Subway is just under a 10 minute walk away. Lots of pay TV channels. Free internet. Gym was pretty good-free weights, several cardio machines. CONS The kitchen was pretty crappy. Our room key wouldn't work and was replaced 3 or 4 times, and still wouldn't work. We ran up and down between the lobby and our room. Eventually they gave us one that worked, but it took a while-and no leg work from the staff.

Not so clean, but a good location, nice hotel for the price. However, I got really upset there.

I arrived there, showed the ad printed proof, argued with the rude staff, spent an hour calling Expedia from a street phone because they did not offer me their phone. Therefore, I would not recommend it. False advertisement to get more clients is forbidden and Expedia should not corroborate with this. After arguing with Expedia and the hotel for one hour, I gave up. Tips: You have to go to Teotihuacan. It is even better than Chit Zen-Itza in Cancun. The Museum of Anthropology is great. There is a park in front of the Museum which is nice to walk around and see the castle and there is a zoo there. The city has lots of things to see.
