The rooms are comfortable and clean; the stoves might be a little dated, but we were on vacation - I wasn't doing any cooking. Breakfast is great with a good selection to meet anyone's needs. Several evenings a week they also have a \"manager's reception\" which is basically a light dinner buffet. We had dinner plans the nights we were there, but we happened to notice that they served meat lasagna & veggie lasagna one night and veggie and meat chili another night. They also serve salad, bread, veggies, beer and wine.

The hotel is close and convenient to downtown and port. This particular Residence Inn is set up as a condensed apartment complex, with several two-story buildings with a limited number of rooms in each building, We passed a jacuzzi/spa between our room and the lobby/breakfast area. As with other Residence Inns there were barbecue areas. The parking was ample. Check-in was a bit goofy. We asked for an upstairs room, but ended up in a downstairs unit. We were tired at the time, so we did not go back. It turned out to be fine, as the people in the room upstairs were relatively quiet. The room itself was clean and a decent size, but the layout was a bit odd. When you enter the room, there is a convertible sofa directly in front of you. There is a small table/desk on the left, adjacent to the door. The kitchen and dining area is to the right. You walk throught the living area to get to the bedroom. A short passage way with a closet takes you from the bedroom to the bathroom. A nice touch is that the sink/vanity is separate from the bathtub/toilet. There were plenty of towels and toiletries. The bed was comfortable and the area was quiet. While the hotel is right off the freeway this property, and the buildings that make up the hotel, are set back from the street, away from freeway and road noise. The buffet breakfast was above average, including scrambled eggs, sausage, pancakes (as well as the waffle makers), toast/bagels/english muffins/muffins, juice, coffee/tea, milk, hot/cold cereal, yogurt and plenty of fresh fruit.

The kitchen had a full refrigerator, stove and oven, microwave and dish washer. Parking is complimentary, and we had no problem finding a stall near our unit, whether we came in at 5pm or 11pm. A big plus that we liked was the complimentary hot breakfast every morning. The menu changes from day to day, but it's no continental breakfast. It's a full hot meal including food items such as pancakes, link sausage, scrambled eggs, to name a few. If you are there on Monday-Wednesday, they serve a complimentary dinner to guests. We stayed on a Monday night, and was treated to chicken, corn and potato wedges. I wasn't expecting a full meal to be served. Vons and CVS are both a quick drive away and the freeway entrances and exits are very near and accessible. This was an excellent stay since we wanted to be outside of the downtown area, but still be centrally close to the main attractions, such as Sea World (15 minutes away), and San Diego Zoo Safari Park (35 minutes away).

All doors are outside and we had to go up stairs to our front door. Our room was in a center building so there was no parking nearby. I required walking into the interior walkways. No big deal, but something that does make getting luggage in an out a bit more difficult. Our room (apartment) had a living room with a TV and a couch with a fold out bed, kitchen area with frig, stove, oven and microwave, a master bedroom with a king size bed, TV, desk and a bathroom, and an upstairs loft bedroom with a queen size bed, TV and a bathroom. Obviously plenty of room for the four of us. Both kids had their own room and TV. Everything looked real clean. The beds were a little hard, but not bad. No wireless internet in the rooms, only a wired connection. A little limiting, but okay. Each day, if would bring up a screen where you had to sign up. You can pay for multiple day access or just select the one day free option. The only bad thing is you have to do that every day if you want the free access. The laundry room is up in the main office building. Machines worked well. Seems cost was $1.25 per cycle. They have a miniature tennis court and a basketball goal. The pool seemed well used, but we did not have a chance to use it. Breakfast was okay. Not too much variety, but the quality was pretty good. Three or four hot items along with normal bagels, toast and two waffle makers. They have orange and apple juice as well as a soft drink dispenser. Breakfast can get pretty crowded. We had to sit outside at tables a couple of days. Seems the later you go, the more crowded. The location is not bad at all. It is only about 15 minutes from downtown and most major attractions.

While some have mentioned that the social hour buffet selections aren't the most healthy - they are *free* after all, and, during our stay at least, there was always salad and raw vegies available. These buffet selections, supplemented by fruit, vegies, ect.. purchased at the local grocery provided several dinners for our family after a busy day at the zoo or seaworld.

Parking was easy and the spots wide enough to easily accommodate larger vehicles such as SUVs, minivans, etc. The free breakfast buffet included both hot items (scrambled eggs, potatoes, make-your-own waffle, etc.) and cold items (cereal, bagels, fruit, etc.).

We absolutely loved it. We put our children (8, 5, 2) in the King Bedroom which had its own bathroom. We were able to close their door and have the rest of the place to ourselves at night. Our room was an upstairs loft (queen) with another bathroom. We ended up making many of our meals in the kitchen and the maid service always loaded and unloaded our dishwasher for us. We ate a hot breakfast every morning in the lobby and felt they had a nice selection (waffles, bagels, eggs, muffins, etc) We also enjoyed the food and drinks in the lobby on the week nights. Despite the fact that it was only in the 60's out, the pool was so warm that we went in it every day. We had it to ourselves which the kids loved. When our kids saw the room, they said, \"We rented a house??\" to tell you how big it was. I can't think of any complaints. We actually liked the location. It was very easy to get on the freeway from there and only about 15 minutes to the zoo or the ocean.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "DaphneMelbourne", "ReviewID": "UR13539187", "Content": "The worst thing about this hotel would have to be the location. You are not exactly close to any of the attractions but situtated in what seemed like an industrial zone. The hotel is also closely situated to some kind of airport or base and you can hear jets/planes overhead most of the time. I'm not usually bothered by noise but this was really loud. We were told over the phone prior to booking that the hotel was very close to tourist attractions such as seaworld and the san diego zoo and that a cab would cost about $10-15. We later discovered the cab would cost closer to $50 each way. You can catch public transport but to get to the zoo for example you might need to take 3 buses and it will probably take you well over an hour. On the upside the staff were very very helpful. Probably among the most helpful and pleasant staff we have ever come across. The rooms are quite nice, clean and spacious though it might be time to update the bathrooms and the bathroom amenities. Food is not great but its free- well it was when we were there. The hotel offers free drinks and internet access which was nice.

Both BRs had full baths. TV and phone in each. Rooms were spotless and updated. Hi-speed internet connections in King BR (with desk). \"Kitchenette\" was effectively a full kitchen with diswasher, oven, stove, refrig, microwave. Eating area was a marble countertop with seating for 2-4. Living room had TV, phone, small desk, sofa & two chairs. The suite was new, super clean, and well-maintained.

Didn't check out the fitness center, but there was also a heated pool and a hot tub on premises that were in good shape.

The good: The place is clean, rooms very nice and spacious, well-equiped and the maids very good. The staff I had contact with were very nice. There is quick access to 163 to Mission Valley, downtown and the beaches, the latter being accessible also by traveling on boulevards east and thus avoiding the highways. The bad: I asked for a quiet room and was put in an upstairs room at the very end of the linear set of buildings. The staff person said there had never been a complaint about noise. However, at 4:30 to 5:00 a.m. the very first morning I was awakened by REFUSE ofr RECYCLING CENTER dump trucks which were no more than thirty yards away from the back of the hotel! This continued every day. But for sleeping aids and earplugs it would have driven me crazy. Perhaps sound sleepers would not be bothered, but I was. Second, the last night a group of ne'erdowells decided to party in the room virtually adjacent to mine upstairs and have people in an out, apparently planning to do it all night. I felt ill at ease for my safety as these folks were talking trash and about their drug use, and hanging out right in front of my door. At one point I barricaded the door with the couch for security. I called the desk at 11:30 and they assured me that they were taking care of it. I called again later and was assured that police were coming to evict them, but of course it wasn't a priority call. Therefore I asked for another room at 12:30 a.m. since it was obvious I would never get any sleep. They were happy to comply and upgraded me. However, staff admitted that they realized these guys had a party planned when they checked in and had warned them against it, all to no avail. Hopefully this was a rare occasion, but not one I want to experience again. I was concerned that these guys would retaliate when they figured out who had complained, or damage my car, but none of that happened. I was smart enough not to confront them myself. So, this is a pretty nice place, just be prepared to ask for a room not close to the dumping center, or be a sound sleeper.

We had a two-bedroom suite, #122, right next to the pool which was very convenient. Our room was ready upon arrival. It's challenging lugging a 40-pound suitcase up the stairs, so be prepared if that's not something you want to do. You'll have to do it again to get to the second floor. The unit was nice - the downstairs bathroom fan didn't work so it was a little steamy after a shower. The beds were comfortable and the unit was furnished to make your stay convenient. One day our kids left the do not disturb magnet on the door so housekeeping didn't make up the room, but they did leave a bag of clean towels outside the door which was a nice gesture. The pool was cleaned daily and the water was incredibly warm, great for those of us who aren't into a freezing pool in the summer - it felt fabulous. An adequate number of lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas made a place for everyone. A hot tub is also available. The breakfast was not bad - we typically stay at Embassy Suites so we're spoiled by their made-to-order items and huge selection. All in all, however, the Residence Inn was pretty good. It can get busy in the morning but the staff does their best to keep up. Free papers and the Today Show in the lobby give the place a homey touch. The convenience store off the lobby was great when the kids wanted a small Ben and Jerry's ice cream snack. The afternoon snacks are fine - popcorn is good but don't expect mixed drinks, just beer, wine and sodas. As most reviewers write, this location is very convenient to a number of places and is easy to find right off of 163.
