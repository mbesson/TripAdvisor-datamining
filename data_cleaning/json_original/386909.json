Charming decor. Problems: * Breakfast lady seemed nice but didn't speak one word of English. Not one word (I find that surprising in a hotel used mainly by foreigners). The breakfast food was just okay, no concept of Cafe Americano. * The elevator can only be accessed after climbing many stairs (with your suitcases when you show up). * The location is close to the train station but not that close -- we walked from the train and found it hard because the sidewalks were in terrible condition and I couldn't roll the suitcase most of the way. The taxi drivers wouldn't drive us to the hotel because they said it was too close. But yet it's pretty far (maybe a third of a mile or so) and the streets aren't well marked there. * Also on location, we love to walk and did walk several times to the main area where there are things you'd want to see (fountains, Forum, plazas), but it was a long walk (maybe two miles). There are many hotels located much closer. * The internet connection is cumbersome and unreliable. You need not only a password, but to log into some proxy server -- the result is that I only had internet for five minutes of a three day stay. * The television is entirely in Italian, no English channels, and late night there are inappropriate shows on, unblocked.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cdont miss this gem - recommended\u201d", "Author": "Larry-Pattie", "ReviewID": "UR116715097", "Content": "son traveled from US to Rome to visit girlfriend studying in Florence. she trained down to meet him to spend weekend in Rome.

We couldn't fault the service, either from the desk or in the breakfast room. We ordered champagne and snacks on arrival - pricey, perhaps, at 50 euros, but what a treat. We spent our first afternoon on a sunny balcony drinking Mumms and nibbling pistachios, parmesan and dried cranberries, all carefully prepared by the receptionist. With honey. Excellent. Finally we dragged ourselves away and went to the Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain, both about 20 minutes' (at most) walk away. The hotel was in a good position, 10 minutes' walk from the Termini station, on a bus route, ten minutes or less from Republica and within ten minutes of Via Veneto and Villa Borghese park. It's on the third floor of a building and not well signed but if you've mapped it beforehand you know where to look and find it quite easily. A quaint old-fashioned lift - metal doors, two sets to open and close - takes you up the three floors and is definitely necessary if you're carrying luggage. The reception is airy and pretty. Our room was a superior room, hence the flower-filled balcony looking out onto a quieter back street. It had air-conditioning (which we didn't need) and a ceiling fan, which we definitely needed. In our superior room we had a bath as well as a shower, but not all rooms had that There was also a safe in the room, hairdryer and excellent minibar, very reasonably priced e.g. 4 euros for a mini bottle of Prosecco. Ordinary wine and beer was less. Water was one euro, which is nice if you want it chilled, and cheaper than from the outdoor food stalls, but the tap water was fine too and tasted great. . We topped up our bottles daily, or from fountains around the city. Breakfast were served from 7 to 10 and were excellent - continental but as much as you wanted - rolls, croissants, choice of coffees or teas, fresh juice if you asked for oranges to be squeezed and also pineapple juice chilled from the carton. Cheeses, meats, yogurts, cereals ... We had agreat start to every day. Another nice touch - you were able to use the hotel laptop for free, for an hour, daily, which we made use of twice in our 5 day break.

Not easy to find, as others have pointed out, but if you have the address and look for the name of the hotel on the door of the building (think: visitng a friend in Rome), it's not an issue. I took the long way from Termini on foot (you want to head for Via Goito straight out of the station) so it was a bit of a trek with bags. The rooms are typical for the region, I think: sparse, clean, a little dark. Mine (Bluebells) was tiny. The room itself was quiet - facing a shaftway, so definitely no ambience; the problem was the thin walls. I could not only hear people as they walked down the hall and opened and closed their rooms, but every hallway conversation, not to mention the loud yawner next door, was like I was right there with them. So if your neighbours are considerate, you're in luck but if you happen to visit the same time as a drunken group of party-hounds, you're probably in for a long night. The location is OK. I found it convenient for proximity to Termini, and if you enjoy walking you can stroll around, but will probably have to take a cab at night, it's a bit of a hike at the end of a long day.

I'm giving the Hotel Lilium my highest rating to date, because I loved it when we were there, and after a few months have passed, I still love it. When we first arrived, I was a little leery of the location, and the fact that we had to walk up a short flight of steps to get to the neat little elevator. However, Alessandro, who was a tremendous help, welcomed us warmly. He carried our very heavy luggage up the steps to the elevator, and the next thing we knew, our bags were in our room. Our room was small, but suited our needs just fine. It had a small bacony, and we took advantage of it many times. The bathroom was more than adequate. There was a wonderful Breakfast Room, and we got there early enough in the mornings to get a table with an outstanding view. Fresh squeezed orange juice and many cappuccinos accompanied our complimentary breakfast of meats, cheeses, and cereals. Not all the staff were fluent in English, but very friendly, and communication was not an issue. So, the room was clean (made up every day), the food was wonderful, the staff were friendly and attentive. Now, what was really neat was how close we were to so many sites. We could walk to nearly everything we wanted to see. There were a few times when we pushed our limits and opted to take a bus back. The bus stops just about right at the hotel, and even when we took the wrong bus once we only had to walk 2 blocks. There were 2 taxi rides, but they were suggested by our wonderful guide Francesca. We went to the Colosseum and to the Vatican by taxi, but when she departed, we walked back checking out all the details on our way.

I don\u2019t want to mislead anyone by providing too many good or bad opinions about this hotel, so I will just try to present the facts as best I can. We chose this hotel because my wife wanted to visit the Borghese museum and gardens and it was a short walk to that location. We also looked for a hotel that was in a price range that we would choose if traveling at home. We paid 133 Euros per night for the room. By American standards, that is probably about 50% higher than I would expect to pay for a hotel of similar quality at home. I have no idea whether the price was good or bad for Rome, but we did look at a number of places on the Internet and we read a lot of reviews before we chose this one. The neighborhood was convenient for restaurants and transportation. We were disappointed in the amount of graffiti on the walls of all the buildings in the area. It would appear that there are a lot of people here that have no pride. The hotel is on the third or fourth story of a large building and could be difficult to find. I don\u2019t remember seeing the name of the hotel displayed anyplace on the front of the building. I printed out photos of the building that I found on the Internet so I could show them to the taxi drivers. They helped on several occasions when we hired taxis to return to the hotel. All you see from the street are two very large wooden doors with an arch above them. The name of the hotel is listed on a directory on the right side of the doors. Press the button and they will buzz open the doors. A few minutes after we pressed the bell, one of the desk clerks showed up to help us with our bags. We were happy for the help. The bags must be carried up one story to where the elevator starts. Then two trips were necessary to get the bags and us up to the hotel, as the elevator is very small. Once we arrived at the hotel lobby, we were very graciously checked into our room and the clerk again took our bags to our room and showed us how to use the controllers for the air conditioner, fan, and TV. The room also has a motorized blind that comes down on the outside of the patio doors to block off the sun on bright days in case one wants to nap during the day. He showed us the controls that were located behind one of the drapes on the right side of the glass doors. There was a lovely little balcony outside the doors with a small table and two chairs where two people could enjoy a drink surrounded by plants and flowers. The room was quite small by modern American standards. It appeared to actually be smaller than a typical cruise ship cabin. The bed was close to the floor, so it was not possible to put our bags underneath it. That caused the room to feel even smaller and congested. There was a fan over the bed and an air conditioner high up on the wall over the bathroom door. The TV was also mounted high on the wall to the left of the bathroom door. There was a refrigerator and a small vanity table, but the table had no mirror to assist women with their makeup. There was a small closet that was just adequate for our needs. Reading lamps and nightstands were on either side of the bed and the lights were adequate. There was also a light over the entry door and another one high above one corner of the room. The lighting was good. The bath was small, but had everything required except storage space for personal items. A very small shelf above the sink was all that was available for shaving gear, etc. The shower had a fiberglass enclosure with two sliding doors that both closed on a corner. They were somewhat difficult to open and close, but after working with them, the chore got easier. There appeared to be a towel warmer on one wall, but I was unable to figure out how it worked. Warm towels would have been a nice touch. They supplied soap, shampoo, etc. I did not understand why the soap was in the shape of a golf ball, but it seemed to do its job. Whenever we needed help or directions, there was always somebody available at the front desk to assist us and they always did so graciously. They have wireless laptops that can be borrowed for an hour at a time for Internet use and we did that on several occasions to send email home. They worked well. The hotel has a continental breakfast that is included in the price. I usually like a more substantial breakfast when I am traveling, but I was very impressed with the quality of the continental breakfast. I started with a sandwich made with a very fresh roll, sliced ham and Swiss cheese. It was no less than wonderful. With it I had the best pineapple juice that I have ever tasted and cappuccino coffee made to order. They had an enormous coffeemaker and the lady working in the breakfast room offered us about 6 kinds of brew including American coffee. The only drawback was that the cups were only about half full and several cups were required to get a normal American helping. She was always happy to brew up another cup for us. After finishing my breakfast sandwich, I discovered that they had croissants on another counter that I had not noticed before. I decided to try one and it was outstanding. I have never had one that good in my entire life. I filled it with Austrian Johannes berry jam that was one of about 10 different jams offered in small, individual jars. I followed that with another croissant with another kind of jam. It was heaven. Each day, I tried a different kind of jam. They were all excellent. My mouth is watering as I write this. The entire hotel was kept in spotless condition, especially the floors which were cleaned daily and gleamed. The birds in a corner of the breakfast area added a homey touch and the flower arrangement at the front desk was gorgeous. We felt that the owners of this hotel did everything they could to make our stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. When we were ready to leave we needed transportation to Fiumicino (near the airport) where we were going to spend our last night before flying home. Somewhere I had read that the hotel could arrange for a car and driver to take us there at a rate less costly and more comfortable than a taxi. The desk clerk made a call for us and we got a very nice car to take us to the other hotel. It took over an hour to get there and the total cost was 40 Euros. I had read that we could pay far more than this amount for the same ride, so considered this to be a bargain. We were extremely satisfied with our stay at this hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it to our friends and family.", "Date": "June 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Bay, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery clean hotel with good service.\u201d", "Author": "OntarioMinn", "ReviewID": "UR31101660", "Content": "We stayed for two nights at the Hotel Lilium.

The Lilium is a lovely botique hotel near the Porta Pia and Termini train station. My wife simply loved the place. Staff: The staff is exceptional. They gave great recommendations for places to eat, tours, and transportation. Everyone was friendly, courteous, and most importanlty, very helpful. My wife and I can not speak Italian, but English was not problem for the staff. Ammenities: This is a small botique hotel, so it does not have the services of a huge international chain. Room 35 is on the corner of the building on the quiet street side and only has one neighbor. We didn't have any noise problems at all and we enjoyed the balcony with table/chairs and ample flowers. Not all rooms have a balcony. The room was on the small side, but was tastefully appointed and spotlessly clean. The bed was very conformtable. There was a remote control air conditioning unit that was very powerful and very quiet (best I've seen). We are very picky about room temperature and we had complete control. The electronicly controlled window blinds could darken the room completely at any time of day. A very pleasant and highly unusual surprise was the availability of loaner laptops for internet access. I've stayed at scores of hotels and have never seen this done before. Breakfast: Breakfast was included and was quite pleasant. The fare included fresh squeezed orange juice - they squeeze the oranges on the spot. It was a nice continental style meal - nothing cooked or hot other than the fresh (and hot) coffee. Location: We arrived by train at Roma Termini and were able to walk to the hotel in about 10 minutes with our bags. The hotel is not clearly marked, but if you have a map and the address you will find it. There is a buzz in panel where you press a button to get the door (a HUGE wooden door) opened.

In the blazing July sun, the air conditioned bus worked just fine for us. Security: We felt safe and secure at all times, both inside and out.

Not sure why some reviewers have said the location is \"off the beaten track\" or a bit far from stuff, because the Lilium's location is perfect. Easily walkable to either Termini station (with bags) or the Repubblica station. One day we WALKED from the hotel to the Spanish Steps and on down to Trevi and the Coliseum. Right around the hotel you can stumble on great food everywhere. I take away one star from the overall because of one bizarre episode the morning of our departure. I left my bags in the lobby and ate a quick breakfast in the breakfast room adjoining the lobby. This was just after 7AM. After breakfast I find that my camera was taken from where it was laid on top of my bags. Nobody came thru the lobby that morning, mind you the hotel is behind a locked street door and 3 flights up. There is just NO foottraffic anywhere close. Only the croissant delivery guy came thru that morning, at exactly those minutes I was in the breakfast room. Clearly he boosted my camera. However the hotel staff refused to entertain that possibility. I was stupid to leave my stuff unattended perhaps. But you have to see this hotel to understand how secure I felt doing so. Ultimately I was not pleased with the lack of zeal on the part of the front desk staff to investigate. They just flat out said it was \"impossible\" that the bread dude took my camera.

Very helpful staff, ecclectic decor, good location, reasonable prices and a real off the beaten track feel make this a great place to spend a few nights.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed with Lilium\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5034302", "Content": "We booked the Lilium Hotel on the basis of some good reviews. Sorry to disagree but we were disappointed. The hotel is on the third floor of a non descript building and if you don't like lifts, it is quite hike (and I am fit!). On the plus side, the hotel is beautifully clean and well kept. However, the rooms are minute, in a very cute style of a child's bedroom. The breakfast room is again very small but pleasant and the girl serving was lovely. The breakfast however consisted of cereal or rolls - they could have provided a little more althoughy orange juice and coffee great. There is no service whatsoever - we asked if it was possible for a cup of coffee at around 6.00pm and were told \"it is not possible, the machine is turned off\"! Even being in Rome, we thought it was very over-priced for the type of hotel and position.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast northern ireland", "Title": "\u201cpity about size of rooms\u201d", "Author": "mppnicholls", "ReviewID": "UR4125958", "Content": "breakfast room really pleasant, breakfast excellent, coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice beautiful.

It was very clean, comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful. As a 'tourist' class hotel, it was worth the money we paid for it. It was a short walk to most of the major tourist sites, but you were not right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle either, and there are some great wine bars and restaurants nearby that are off the beaten path and therefore not full of tourists, which was a pleasant change given how busy Rome is. The free laptop service they offer was really convenient as well.
