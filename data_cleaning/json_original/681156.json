Wanting to give my girlfriend a night of fun before she headed oversees (but not having much in the way of funds), the Jacuzzi rooms caught my attention. I called late Saturday afternoon and a friendly voice said they'd hold a room for me. I checked in, $100/night (tax included) with a $50 deposit. They didn't require a credit card, just a valid drivers license. The room was a bit dated but very clean - you could even smell the remnants of the cleaning products (which was easily aired out). Long story short: we had such a good time that we woke up the next day and paid for another night. Now we have a weekend full of memories neither of us will forget!", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cthe grand motel is great\u201d", "Author": "cajun44", "ReviewID": "UR74688249", "Content": "i have been staying here at the grand motel for 4 weeks now,im on a vacation from belfast northern ireland and i think the motel lives up to mits name it is grand in every way friendley manager and very helpfull the rest of the staff cleaning ladies are very efficent at there job and also very friendly i will defnitley return here again on my next visit to toronto i would defnitley recomend the grand motel to all my friends and to every one else who will be looking for somewhere to stay in torontp the best of irish luck to the manager allister and his wife from frank mcclinton room 26", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice place\u201d", "Author": "Anik55", "ReviewID": "UR72558936", "Content": "It was 770$ (tax included) for two rooms for a week.

Our bathroom was small but that didn't bother us. Nearby there are banks, grocery stores and restaurants. If you show your CAA/ AAA card you receive a discount!
