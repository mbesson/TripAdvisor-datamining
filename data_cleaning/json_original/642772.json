There is no furniture in the room i.e. wardrobe or place to put clothes or put a suitcase so you spend all your time dodging backpacks or shoes. It has the athmosphere of a hostel really. The 'en suite' toilet and bathroom was so tiny that you could do yourself some serious damage if you moved too fast or without care and attention. I used the shower in the corridor as at least I could move in it. The trolleybus starts at 6 in the morning and is right outside the hotel. I read reviewers saying it is convenient for the sights but unless you're on two walking sticks it is really of no advantage. The breakfast is adequate but I have tasted much better for the same price in the same location.
