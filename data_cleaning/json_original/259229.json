The room was small and dingy with peeling paintwork and not particularly clean. The so called kitchenette had a toaster and a kettle but no plates, or cutlery or detergent or tea towel. Capable of tea and coffee making only and the cheapest brands available. There was no phone, iron, hairdryer or ironing board. There was exposed electrical wiring and an electrical switch with a hole where the switch was meant to be. There were holes in the wall, The arm chair had lost its padding and was dirty. We found it unusable. The TV reception was so poor that we could only select from about two of the channels. The bathroom was so dirty that I was glad we had some thongs to wear in the shower. There were no spare toilet rolls and no toilet cleaning brush. The so called double glazing only extended to one of windows so that it was so noisy we bought ear plugs and used the airconditioner to provide white noise. There is no lift so we lugged our bags up two double flights of stairs and there was no offer of help with this. The only redeeming feature was that the bed was relatively new and the linen was clean.

They have redone the entrance section and, i can only assume, laid new carpets on the stairs and the hallways. The foyer of our room stunk like smoke and in our room there were cigarette burns on the walls/furniture/bed. The beds themselves were hard, but sleepable. The double glazed windows made the sound of the street bareable and had aircon. The bathroom was a bit of a shamble. Toilet was cracked, the taps did not turn on/off, one handle even coming off. It was very old and needs replacing. The shower 'squeeled' when running. Now ALL of these would be forgivable had this been at a budget price, however, at $200/night, for 4 people, it really isnt that good a value.

We decided we needed a place to stay after the night out and stumbled across the Wattle - relatively cheap and right in the heart of Oxford street. I've read all of the reviews here and yes, while there are some major issues with the place, it is in the middle of renovations. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the lobby - nice and clean with a simplistic modern design. The staircase leading to the rooms are another story, I too smelt the urine and cigarettes smell but I don't doubt this will be fixed during their renovations. Expecting a dump of a room I was actually very surprised when I first walked in. We stayed in room 105... nothing more than you would expect from a budget hotel, but (surprisingly) it was clean. No sign of cockroaches, clean sheets, walls and bathroom were clean etc. Not too keen on the theme they've gone for with the rooms though - golden curtains and golden framed mirrors but it's clear that they're aiming for a boutique budget hotel with some charm. I had no issues with the staff. I was served by a kind Asian lady - I really think some people must assume they're rude because they can't get past the language barrier. Sure sometimes she was difficult to understand, but she meant well. This hotel has a bright future after what apparently was a very dark past.

I had just arrived and didn't have $178 in my wallet, They eventually found the old click swipe thing and took payment that way. After arrival in my room which was clean but with very old furniture and in desparate need of total refurbishment there was a knock the door. They couldn't take Amex and did I have another card?

They did bring the previous Amex swipe and destroy it before me. $178 for the two nights plus $10 returnable deposit for the electronic room key Being a Queenslander and this the middle of winter I felt chill and asked for some heating and was told the a/c was reverse cycle. I turned it on with no joy and informed the staff who came and fiddled with it and said it would be fine in ten to fifteen minutes. It wasn't so they brought me a fan heater which was a bit noisy. I looked for the in-room tea and coffee, saw the kettle over the kitchen sized sink and eventually found tea gabs, coffee sachets and sugar sachets in a draw on the other side of the room but no milk which i didn't worry about as I don't' take it in tea and don't like instant coffee. However no cups to seen. Went back to reception to request cups which were promptly brought.....no in house phone. There were wall lights either side of the cheap bed but which was comfortable enough, just. Both lights flickered at a great rate and one or therm died shortly after being turned on. The bathroom is a mess with a corner sink where the tap runs constantly, not drips, runs ,and there was no plug to be seen.

The view from our private Harbour view deck is spectacular, but that's the ONLY redeeming factor of the place. The carpet smelled bad, the pillows and bedding were musty smelling, and there was a big hole in the bathroom door. Also, there was no closet to store our clothes, and we were afraid to even leave our bags in the room. If the owner would have taken care of this facility, it actually could have been a nice place. But, apparently the Chinese owner has no intention of upgrading the furniture (replete with cigarette butt stains, and a fridge that didn't work, and the rabbit ears on a TV set, which I haven't seen in decades, oh yes, I forgot the single lightbulb that hung from the ceiling with no shade around it... OMG, I wish I were kidding!). It was very close to a Welfare Hotel where drug addicts and hookers live. What a shame. The Wattle should not be in business anymore, and the pictures from their website are completely deceptive.... I wish we could get the word out, so nobody else makes the mistake we made.
