{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Convenient to the Tokyo Train Station We were on a business to Japan and we needed to stay at a hotel close to the Tokyo train station because we had to take a bullet train in the morning to another city. We found this hotel on the internet. The hotel is very convenient to the Tokyo train station. You can walk to the station even with luggage. The rooms are a typical hotel in Tokyo, very small. The room was clean and it included free internet that worked well. The staff was friendly and the breakfast in them morning was very good. Also what made it extra special was the room was at a reasonable price considering you are in Tokyo near a train station. Not only two blocks away from the hotel towards the train station are rows of restaurants. We ate at one of the restaurants and had an excellent meal. Being that this was a business trip we did not go to the Imperial Palace, but it is within walking distance to this hotel. We travel to Japan on business often and we would definitely stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR145242794", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SBCATraveler"}, {"Content": "location location It's well located, as others have said, being minutes from station and on Airport Limousine route from Narita.Rooms do not encourage cat-swinging; I have a double for single use, but it's as well I only have one suitcase as more wouldn't fit.Quiet and comfortable, i'd stay here again as it's not only well-located but cheap- if you can use such a word for a central Tokyo hotel.Breakfast is good, although staff English in breakfast room is limited; we had a voucher, and wanted to know what it would alow us to eat. This had to be rephrased several times before we got anything other than blank looks. Desk staff good English, helpful and pleasant.", "Date": "Nov 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR902842704", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ethelman2"}, {"Content": "Great central location The Yaesu Fijiya is a great location if you need to be close to the Tokyo Station. From the South Yaesu exit, it is very short 5 minute walk. The hotel has very helpful, English speaking staff. The room is a fair size for Tokyo. My carpets were a bit worn but the room was generally clean. A few things that I particularly liked about this hotel - the price was good and I was able to book it online - breakfast was even included. There was coffee n the room in addition to tea and they delivered an English paper in the morining. I was really pleased with this find - and it is walking distance to Ginza.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR558343830", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Bronwyn_8"}, {"Content": "Great Location, Dirty and very small room We have booked what they called Winter Special on the run Room including breakfast, however we were extremely disappointed about the cleaniness of the room. The carpets are filled with Marks (not sure what stains it might be!!! however it definitely looks very dirty!!!!), and the tea bag that we have put in the teapot was never removed forthe days that we have stayed there. The on the run room is very small. I can honestly say if you have 2 suitcases, then you definitely would not have room to move around.The location of this hotel was great. Close to Tokyo Station and Ginza tube station, and within walking distance to Imperial palace. The front desk staff is very helpful and friendly. The reception is clean and the restaurant looks good. Breakfast was OK nothing to wow about.No matter how convenient this hotel is in terms of location, I am not sure whether I would like to go back considering the state of the room. Really is a shame considering the staff was so nice at the front desk.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR241621547", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "EastmeetsWestAB"}, {"Content": "Good hotel for business travel I stayed at this hotel as it was booked by our business hosts and was close to the meeting location. There is an Airport Limousine bus service that will deliver you directly to the hotel from Narita airport and back to the airport when you depart; this was very convenient.The location within Tokyo is excellent. It is very near to the Tokyo train station and multiple metro stations, as well as many shopping venues and restaurants. The Imperial Palace and grounds are also a short walk away.The hotel itself provided good service, and had a decent coffee shop and restaurant on-site. There is also a 24-hour convenient store that opens into the lobby. The rooms are clean but the decor is rather drab and needs to be updated. The staff were generally friendly and helpful. The ambiance on the guest floors is quiet and I rarely heard any of my neighbors. Overall this is an acceptable hotel for the businsess traveler or a couple visiting Tokyo who plan to be out most of the day. I wouldn't recommend it for those traveling on holiday with children. For those looking for a more romantic or luxurious setting there are better choices in town.", "Date": "Dec 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR787273952", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TTraveler00"}, {"Content": "Good business hotel close to Tokyo Station I stayed at the Yaesu Fujiya Hotel for one night at the end of May. This is a decent business hotel just a five-minute walk south from the Yaesu South exit of Tokyo Station. Since I was arriving in the evening by train (at the end of a two-week trip) and then heading to the airport in the morning, the location was perfect.Otherwise, the hotel is nothing really special, typical business hotel with all the necessary amenities, clean modern rooms and good service, but not much space in the room and nothing really different from other business hotels. I paid about 16000 yen for one night, without breakfast, plus 500 yen for in-room high-speed internet. This seems a bit pricey for Japan, but probably not for the centre of Tokyo.Whether I would stay here again would depend on whether I could find something cheaper but similar in quality in the same area. The hotel is entirely acceptable, no significant problems, just nothing unique.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR374276770", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kymberand"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d324963-r22093172-Yuesu_Fujiya_hotel-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "324963", "Price": "$218"}}
