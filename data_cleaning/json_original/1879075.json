We chose the Conscious hotel because it looked descent and there were rooms available. The whole experience was a little disappointing. The hotel staff were professional enough, and although the rooms were really small they were clean. The hotel felt very corporate and it was clear that their policies prioritized their making money over creating an enjoyable authentic experience for travelers. Sure every hotel has to make money, but you shouldn't feel it when you walk in. Corporate headquarters must have decided to make every guest sign of on the fee structure for smoking in the rooms (150euro) or messing with the smoke detector (250euro). Nothing really lived up to the cool cafe vibe they attempted to create in the lobby. The whole \"conscious\" theme is a bit of a sham. Putting little environmental signs all over the room and eliminating the shower curtain in favor of an open door seemed to be the extent of the green design. The dumb sayings plastered on the door of every room are tacky. The tram is close by, but it is sill a bit of a hassle getting into downtown. It is a solid 20 minute brisk walk to Leidsplien. I won't stay with them again.

Found hotel to be clean, modern & functional. Communal reception / bar area was a really nice environment to sit, read / chill out in. Fab window seats allows great opportunity to watch the world go by. Drinks prices were quite expensive for a hotel out of the central area (perhaps that's why!). Rooms were on the small side (expected for a city hotel) and the minimal design did feel a little sparse but was spot on for a weekend base to explore the city. Staff were really friendly & gave us a great recommendation for a small nearby cafe to eat at & we enjoyed a delicious lunch there. We ate breakfast at the hotel one morning for convenience and whilst we liked it we were aware that there are cheaper alternatives elsewhere. Hotel location is out of the busy central part of Amsterdam but very easily accessible by tram right outside the hotel. Buy a 3 day tram pass and getting around the city is never an issue. Vondelpark sits behind the hotel and with a very short walk to the park entrance we enjoyed several strolls through the park and as a route into the city, choosing this as an alternative to the tram. We would stay at the hotel again & would recommend it to anyone looking to explore the city on a budget. Rated 4* for what it is, not in comparison to ALL hotels & categories. Constructive feedback for management: found reception check in / out slow so somewhat frustrating.

This hotel was absolutly great. When I first walked in I was amazed to see how beautiful the place really was. The pictures are FORREAL! This place is really beautiful, and that was not to mention that the 1 Tram from Cental station stops directly infront of the hotel. This was too convient. Even though your not in the Red Light district area the tram from the district bring you straight here. When I checked in i was giving a room on the B side, after taking the elevator up and walking across to the other side my key did not work so I went back down stairs, in the midst the cleaning supervisor was in the hall and I asked her was there any rooms availible in the front because being a woman alone I didnt feel comfortable doing that walk later to my room at late night alone. She quickly told me that room 116 was clean and availible and that she was calling the front desk to have me changed. By the time I got down there the front desk person was already on the phone with her and changing my room. She told me that I didnt need to explain and that it was ok. OMG When I walked in the room I was at a awww at how cozy and nice the room looked and felt. It felt like an 5star hoel just smaller. Actually I have been in 5star hotels and none of them had flavor like unless its like the Wynn in Vegas. Everything looked brand new and spanking clean. It took a second to realize how to turn the light on because you have to put your room key in a slot on the wall to turn on the power in the room to save energy and when you take it out to leave the room everything shuts off. Once I sat down on the bed I was then confirmed that I choose the best play to stay in Amsterdam. The bed was soft as ever just how I love it. I layed down and it felt like the mattress was hugging me. I didnt have a problem not once with the free wii fi it worked with my laptop and ipod even at the same time. The day Time front desk people were so great. They advised me of everything I can experience. The night time guy on my 1st night wasnt too good but I will not hold the hotel responsible because when I did speak to the manager Xavier about it the next morning he was extra extra helpful and not accepting of non customer service, He went out of his way to help me. The next night guy and evening girls were so great. Since they have a bar in the lobby they just talked to me and laughed as I sat and enjoyed one of their home made smoothies. The night uy even took the time to print out time and directions for the tram to locations. My room was cleaned spotless, Tissue refilled. The only thing is the there isnt a iron or ironing board in your room and you have to get it from the front desk, and since they have a really big and good ironing board it was really heavy to loged back and forth to the front desk but it was cool. I stayed two nights here and like I said when I return I will be staying there again. Let me not forget that the Price was much much cheaper than those of te hotels I saw online and when I saw them in person they were run downed hotels. I know my review may sound like im a worker there trying to big up the hotel but im not. Im just a NY traveler who travels alot and I appreciate getting my moneys worth.

It was easy to found from Schiphol Airport. Just take train to Amsterdam Lelyaan, after that take tram no 1 to Central Station. Then stop at Overtoom. The hotel location just in front of the tram Overtoom. But if you carry a lot of things, better just take taxi since u need to change train & to tram. I came there after my trip to Barcelona, with a lot of luggage & belongings and it was quite troublesome. When I came there & made the payment for the room, they said they didn't have the standard room & they only have the premium room which a bit more expensive but had bigger room. I also had asked for room with double bed, but they said the room was unavailable since it was Valentine's day and the hotel quite fully booked. Since I asked for room not facing the street side, they gave me the room at tower B which quite far from the lobby. With many things to bring, it was quite frustrating to found my room. But my room was nice & big. The bed was very comfortable. And the bathroom were big & spacious. I had a very pleasant stay here. One of my problem was the shower didn't have door so after I took my bath, the water were everywhere. Maybe the management can consider to put the door together with the bath, so that guest won't spent more towels to clean the floor. Tram to go to Dam Square is just in front of the hotel. It take around 15 minutes to reach Central Station. From there, u just can walk and go to Dam Square. It just too bad, the hotel isn't near Dam Square. Actually I stayed for 1 night only. I had asked for the staff last time how much if I wanted to have late check out, they asked me to paid another 50 euro. Then I changed my mind, since my flight at 9pm the day after. I thought to do late check out. The hotel didn't provide number to called the lobby, so I called from my mobile instead. And from the staff she said she doesn't have any room available for tomorrow, all was fully booked and I must check out tomorrow. And the day after, I tried my luck again & called the lobby to asked whether I could do late check out, and the guy staff said I could do it ! I was surprise since the day before the other staff insisted I couldn't stay since it was fully booked. And the guy said his colleagues didn't know I stayed at premium room and I could do late check out at 6 pm (his colleague that I asked the day before said if I wanted to do late check out, I must check out at 5 pm) ! Very nice ! Too bad, I couldn't remember his name. And I didn't know that if I did late check out, the hotel won't clean my room. So when I came back from Dam Square I still found out my room was messy. And I asked the lobby staff to gave me new towels. I need to wait for 30 minutes but all the housekeeping person never came, so I called the lobby again and within 10 minutes, I got 5 new towels ! So nice ! Will consider to stay at this hotel again.

The Vondelpark is a public urban park of 47 hectares (120 acres) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It is located in the stadsdeel Amsterdam Oud-Zuid, west from the Leidseplein and the Museumplein. Centrally located and a 15 minute tram ride from the center of town.The tram is located directly in front of the hotel.So its a quick 1 tram ride from Amsterdam's Centraal Station. Upon entering the hotel lobby after getting off a train from Antwerp at Centraal Station.I was little bit tired,sweaty,and hungry.I arrived at around 12 in the afternoon.Approaching the desk I was met by a very warm smile.Welcoming me to Amsterdam and the hotel,telling him my name we were told our room wasn't ready.Which was fine I went out and explored Amsterdam. Coming back a couple of hours later the room was available .The room was typical to european standards..smaallll.but that is to be expected.This being a eco hotel that means no control of the air condition.I t was sent from the lobby.No refrigerator in the room so no midnight snacks.I don't ever use the snacks provided .I often use it to store things I have purchased during the day from the local supermarket(wine,cheese,fruit).This was a slight inconvenience,actually more than a slight inconvenience.Also after a long day of touring a little ice would be nice with my drink.For you to get ice you had to go to the lobby to get it.After asking they only gave you a cup of ice for two people.They also asked why you needed the ice.Why i needed the ice?Are you serious? The shower was also not that great,I don't know if it had to do with conservation or poor plumbing.The room was decorated nicely in a plant theme,most of the rooms in the hotel ,as well as the lobby have a eco plant theme going on.The bathrooms was clean and efficient and unusually big.I almost wish they had taken a little less room for the bathroom and added a little of that space for the actual room itself. So if you have a chance to visit one of my favorite cities in the world.You can take a chance on The Conscious Hotel.Some might love it while others might hate it.I personally depending on the time of day felt both.For the price and location you can't beat it,so this might tip the scales for some.Either way travel,explore,and as always be safe.

Room was clean, comfortable but quite basic in design, it is basically breeze block room with a rubbish wall mural and grey industrial carpet, heavy black curtains but next to residential homes which can be quite noisy at times. LCD tv pathetic and way to small for a premium room but it did have all the channels and crstyal clear picture. Wifi throughout hotel(gratis) and work very well in my room. I asked for a double but got 2 singles squashed together. Always annoys me. Bathroom clean, good hot shower, with usual amenities but no tea/coffee making facilities. This hotel gimmick is an eco model, water saving features, heating, etc but I found the constant stickers next to plug points, in bathroom on the hotel doors quite condescending, patronising. Hotel is quite big, tower A Tower B with many rooms, if you get tower B be prepared for a good walk to your room and upstairs. Staff are good, quite funny and friendly, lobby, bar area very smart. Breakfast 13 euro. Just walk across the road to Albert Hein and breakfast is 2euro. I have lived in amsterdam on and off for 7yrs.

Almost 7 weeks in total. That's a long time, if something is irking you after a few days, you can guarantee you'll want to smash it after a few weeks. I felt no such urges. During this time, I moved around a few of the rooms, usually down to availability (point of note there, avoid the broadcasting seminar in August, Amsterdam sells out, even with rooms at triple rate), so tried out deluxe as well as standard rooms. If I'm honest, I wouldn't bother with the luxury rooms, unless you're partial to bathing (they have a bath and much bigger bathrooms) or need to dock your ipad/iphone constantly. So, my humble... Downsides? well, yes, I guess trekking to tower B was a bit of a pain, but only a minor twinge in the buttock rather than an utter bum ache. Yes, the rooms can be quite small, which can make things a bit tight with a big suitcase (but I still managed that and a Brompton folding bicycle) and yes, my god, the bathroom lighting is harsh, I was quite relieved upon my return to Berlin that I didn't look THAT bad. I suppose you could see the location as less than central, but personally, I'd rather be away from the Liedseplein and much closer to Vondelpark, which is truly beautiful. The tram is actually pretty quick, or you can walk into the centre in 20 mins, or even better, get a bike! More upsides, well firstly the staff, I think sometimes it's easy to misunderstand different cultures as rude, when in fact, they're just a little more efficient with their language than the English. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still learning to deal with this in Berlin. That said, I didn't find the staff at Vondelpark brusque at all. On every occasion they were very helpful, very well natured and quite willing to share some fun with you. On the occasions I was staring down the possibility of sofa surfing they did everything they could to find me rooms at good rates (I was on a budget, as my company, is well... 'me' so it comes out of my pocket). I found the rooms very clean, simple, stylish and exactly as described. Everything you need, but nothing else. No coffee making facilities, no small bottles of shower gel, no massive TV, then they never promised me these. I got all I was looking for, a clean, modern room, a comfortable bed and the Beeb. Any problems I had (an overflowing shower tray at one point) were dealt with quickly and efficiently. All-in-all my stay was very pleasant, I would definitely stay there again, in fact I look forward to it! I miss being greeted personally... and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.

No, not the architecture but the vibe of the place - too many people, too many bikes, dirty with no respite from the relentless 'tourist experience' - but that's all another story. We had clear instruction to get the No 1 tram and this worked very well. Quite a fun and frantic ride and it dropped us right outside the hotel. We were in the rear 'B' block which was quiet and relativly peaceful. Quite a trek to our room No 220 on the first floor - everytime my partner was drawn down a different corridor but I have a better sense of direction so we didn't get lost! The room was small - there really isn't anyway to dress that up! We did like it though. The bed was very comfortable - memory foam, which I had never slept on before but we both agreed it was great. Not quite enough surfaces to put your stuff but one manages, the trendy little upsidedown hanging plant was cool but it did leave a tiny, sticky puddle on the chair underneath it - good job we didn't leave a clean white shirt on the chair! It was quite a warm spell and it was frustrating we couldn't open the window fully - just a small ventilation gap - other windows looked as if they were open fully - but not ours. The tiny shower room looked stylish but had it's own problems - the shower absolutly soaked the floor due to the open nature of the tray, very little space to put stuff and pretty hash lighting when using the mirror but, as I said, looked fab - form over function, depends what you look for in life. The green and recycled credentials I found slightly bogus - we are into that at home so it's not that we don't care - it just felt a little patronising but really it's a sensible and profitable way to run a hotel. The extractor fan in the shower room was on constantly when the card key was in the slot, the wash basin took too much water to fill, the dual flush on the WC was 'quirky'. Don't get me wrong, we did like the hotel but, like nearly every hotel we have ever stayed at, they are experts in self promotion and promise so much and deliver a very average experience. We didn't have breakfast - too expensive for what they were offering, we took our mini kettle and bought bakery items and had a jolly little breakfast for very little money in our room. The lobby seating area was not a big draw for us although we did like the 'green, living wall'. Reception staff were rather cold but efficient - we had nothing to do with them really but if we had a problem I guess they would have delt with it. Our soap and shower gel both ran out and they had to be told as cleaners didn't replace them - basic stuff I would have thought but going back to all the hype they make about themselves.... I wouldn't stay here again, not because it was dreadful but I've had the experience of the Concious Hotel and if I went again I would want to be nearer to the city. The tram was essential to get around but the novelty did wear off. It wasn't really very feasible to go back to the hotel throughout the day. We are in our 50's and are by no means lacking in energy but Amsterdam is exhausting and there is nowhere to step aside from the buzz and chill for half an hour - public seating is minimal. A hotel on one of the canal streets would have meant we could have popped back for a couple of hours before going out again. We were leaving our hotel at about 11am and getting back at about 9pm - that's a long day in a fast moving city.

The first room I had was underwhelming - in the second tower and at the back with views of the neighbours. The internet was also misbehaving (supposedly was being upgraded so there was no free wireless). I was fortunate and upgraded to a top floor room in the first tower and it was very nice. That room initially couldn't get the net, then it could, then it couldn't but on the last day had no problems (maybe the internet upgrade got completed). The rooms are small - its Europe. The top floor room I was upgraded to though had its own outdoor patio - unfortunately there were no chairs on it but you could move ones out from your room. The showers were nice and you didn't notice that they were lower flow heads. The hotel has a 'groovy' feel with labels on items telling you how they were environmentally friendly. The downside of the top floor room is that the elevator only goes to 5 so you have to bring your luggage up two flights of stairs. There is a small bar/snack/coffee area in the lobby that always had some people kicking around even late into the night for a nice vibe - I suspect part of the reason though was that the net was down in a lot of areas and the lobby was the only place to get a connection. Parking is a good deal here (well, for Amsterdam, its still expensive but only about half what you would pay elsewhere). The downside is that to get in is a bit of a pain - all I could figure you could do was to get to it around back and then run around to the front of the hotel to get them to let you in (and there is no sign to tell you where it is so the first time I was past it and had to go around again as its a one way street around the back). If there was a buzzer to the front desk I was not made aware of it. The spots are tight as well, a large car would be a challenge for parking; doable but a challenge. The location is good - its near the park obviously and the tram is immediately outfront for quickly getting over to the center of town. There are a couple restaurants nearby that are good as well (the baked pizza place about a minute away was good value and tasty). There is a breakfast buffet that I didn't try available for 10 euro a day if you pre book which is probably not bad value considering what things generally cost elsewhere. One review mentioned the beds feeling lumpy/curved and I would concur, they were a bit odd. Its like they have a curve for you to sink into rather than a normal bed feel (that is flat). I am not sure if that is by design or if its just wonky/old beds - I suspect by design and you may or may not like it. I wasn't a huge fan of the sensation.

Maybe it is exaggerated to say it has a soul but there is a good feeling in the air. The rooms we have been in are very comfortable because of the nature near feeling. Furniture carpets towels chairs table, everything feels kind of natural, safe and most important the interior feels like there is QUALITY to it! Not cheaply mass produced stuff but like a true DESIGN HOTEL. and for everybody with allergies or somebody who enjoys chemical free atmosphere this is the place to go. The climax of this overall VERY NATURAL FEEL is definitely the SUPERB BED. One of the best hotel beds I have been in. So soft and comfortable with a huge blanket. Everything was VERY CLEAN and WELL MAINTAINED. So the most important tasks are perfectly fulfilled: excellent bed for a great refreshing sleep, very pleasant atmosphere and good location. Another great plus is the VERY GOOD BREAKFAST with a LOT OF CHOICE. also very healthy food, of course all organic. and the asking price of 13 Euros for the breakfast is really good considering the QUALITY of the food. Service was VERY FRIENDLY and capable of fulfilling all of our requests. They have a nice little unique comfortable \"nature\" lobby where you can buy cool organic/conscious gifts. The place of the hotel is great because it is just 5 min from the biggest and (I think nicest ) park in amsterdam the vondelpark. tram is near just in front of the hotel so there is an excellent connection.There is a raw food restaurant just 5 min away and a lot of other really good places to enjoy good food! only probable down site: If you are somebody who enjoys sitting all day in your hotel room I would choose another hotel because during daytime you have the street in front of your window which is not really annoying but could be a distraction when you want absolute silence. but in this case you shouldn't choose any city hotel at all. in the night there is no real noise and the excellent beds make up for it BIG time. All in all we will DEFINITELY COME BACK whenever we are here. The youthful stylish progressive atmosphere is just excellent. Everybody who enjoys organic or a healthy lifestyle should choose this over any other hotel in amsterdam. Also for this price point I think it is impossible to find any other hotel with such a comfortable and clean atmosphere.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach", "Title": "\u201cNo complaints.\u201d", "Author": "fyrmun37", "ReviewID": "UR117972914", "Content": "Clean, good value, courteous staff.

I recommend to reserve a parking slot because in Amsterdam is very difficult and expensive. To visit the city you can use the efficient public transport in Amsterdam (24/48/72 hours ticket) or rent a bike. The Hotel is located in front of a Tram stop. the hotel has a reception in the ground floor and two \"towers\" with rooms. The tower A is closer to the street and the tower B is closer to the Park. The size of the rooms is very pleasent, the bath is also roomy. As everything is still new you will not find anything to complain. The bed was so nice and the pillows too.

I never spent that much time checking in... 15 min (not including the balcony room argue). We paid 10 Eur per person for the breakfast wich is good but nothing special.

It also backs onto the Vondelpark, Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite park and is within walking distance of the Leidseplein restaurant district and two major museums , also on the tram line, Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. Parking in Amsterdam is expensive, at 3-4 Euros per hour and almost impossible to find, so the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s garage, while it seems expensive, is a reasonable price. They will arrange bike rentals for you. Hotel breakfasts in Amsterdam are also very expensive. We enjoyed the Oslo caf\u00c3\u00a9 across the street and over the bridge from the hotel for breakfast at a reasonable price. We took both the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153100 Treasures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd canal tour and the 3 hour Yellow Bike Tour. Both are informative and enjoyable and highly recommended.

You can get off in the charming cheese village of Edam in about 45 minutes and from there after looking around you can use your ticket again to take another Arriva bus to Volendam (10 minutes), which is a touristy seaport. From there, for 5 Euros, you can take the Marken express ferryboat (30 minutes) and enjoy being on the sea for a while.

There is a friendly lobby with windowsills for reading and tables for talking, served by a small bar with drinks and snacks. Check-in is adjacent and the staff was helpful and quick (despite having to work around a changeover in computer systems). Rooms are modern and compact, yet comfortable and complete (we found no difference between the basic and deluxe rooms in size or style). The wall murals stand bright against the minimalist black and white of the rest of the room, but it works. The double bed is well sized and firm, there is a workspace (although the free wifi was weak outside the lobby), there is local cable TV, a small refrigerator, and an efficient bathroom with open shower stall. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find as many restaurants within walking distance as others have indicated, and would recommend taking the tram into town to eat.

The light afternoon snacks and evening drinks are good, though, and there are local pannekoeken and caf\u00c3\u00a9 restaurants nearby for later in the day.

I stayed for 3 nights and on my first night after a long travel to Amsterdam I experienced a bad night sleep thanks to the bathroom's extractor fan, it was too noisy (natural noise of air coming) even when the bathroom door was shut, I phoned the reception at midnight and asked if there's a way I can turn it off but told it's impossible, I tried to sleep again but at 2am I had enough of it and went down to the reception to ask the member of staff to come and experience at problem - he came and almost fixed it by turning the part of extractor fan, so eventually I went back to sleep at 2:30am which is not ideal if you want to wake up at 8:00 to explore the city. The \"Organic\" breakfast was OK but not great - there's not much to choose from especially if you're a vegetarian. Wish it would offer a more variety. The location is so so, but when you use tram no. 1 it takes less than 5 mins to get to the heart of Amsterdam and 15 mins to Central station.

The hotel was slightly furtherout of the city center than we had first thought but it is literally one street away from the Vondelpark which makes it actually a lovely walk back to the center. It's close to the main museums and plenty of restaurants and shops. As we're not really into going out and were completely exhausted by the nighttime we were there I cant really judge how well it's situated for clubs or bars but I did find that our room [in Tower B] was very quiet on a night time. I didnt realise until we started walking to the room but the hotel is actually two 'tower' buildings connected by an enclosed walkway. Eeverything is very well sign posted trhough so still nice and easy to get arounf the hotel and find your room and if anything I think this may be an added bonus as when we arrived we were offered the choice of either a front tower room witha street view or a back toweer room which would be quieter.
