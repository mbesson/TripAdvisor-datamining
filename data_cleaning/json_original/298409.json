{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good value for Money $$ 8 Jan 2008This is a true Aussie hospitality pad. I am long term guest and in fact still staying here. It is true that it is close to Redfern BUT it is equidistance to Newtown railway station which is a another vibrant village. The owners; Mark  Jason are friendly and the rooms are comfy. It is noisy at times but this is not exactly the Hilton in the city. I would recommend this place for budget travellers who wants to be away from the city (10 minutes) and to meet new friends in the TV room.Arumugam", "Date": "Jan 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR752304867", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "shaun1970"}, {"Content": "Avoid This Place               More photos", "Date": "Feb 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR477014556", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JLee1902"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d298409-r12428204-Royal_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "298409", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
