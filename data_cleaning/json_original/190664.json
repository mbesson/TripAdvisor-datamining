We used to stay here when it was managed by Four Seasons and were a little worried when we heard it was changing hands to Regent. We needn't have worried and indeed the hotel has gone from strength to strength under Regent's leadership and especially under the exceptional management of Herr Athmann and his Team. Don't let the hotel's modern exterior fool you - inside it is beautifully decorated with the finest marble, and exquisite furnishings, and beautiful flower displays. It has a feel of a very grand private house, and never feels overly busy. The staff throughout is excellent and they get the balancer right between professionalism and friendliness. The bedrooms are without doubt amongst the very best in Berlin - even the standard rooms are 40 sqm and all are furnished in a tasteful, classic style with excellent bathrooms. The hotel boasts a number of suites from Executive through to the fabulous Presidential Suite on the 8th floor overlooking Gendarmenmarkt. We really like the deluxe suites which are on the corner below the Presidential and Gendarmen Suites, but some of the Superior Suites such as 825 and 625 are really lovely and spacious. Housekeeping is of the very highest, as is Room Service. Another highlight of the hotel is breakfast in Fischer's Fritz which offers an amazing array of hot and cold food all served in the beautiful restaurant. The food in the restaurant for lunch and dinner is amongst the very best we have tasted and Herr Lohse (Executive Chef) more than deserves his two Michelin Stars. Dinner at Fischer's Fritz is an exceptional experience - do not miss out! The hotel's location is great for visiting the beautiful Gendarmen Markt the shops of Friedrichstrasse and of course the Unter den Linden. After a busy day shopping or sightseeing it is lovely to come back to the peace and comfort of the Regent. We have been fortuntate enough to stay at many of the city's top 5 star hotels's including the Adlon, the Ritz-Carlton,The Hotel de Rome but this is without doubt our favourite hotel and what marks it out above other hotels is the staff and the quality of the hotel's management.

What a perfect experience. The Hotel Regent , centrally located near Potsdamer Platz and Unter Der Linden, is the most spectacular hotel I've stayed at in all of Germany. I cannot find one fault and only say kudos for every subject one covers in a review. The Lobby is breathtaking old world charm with immaculate taste in design and warmth. The salon, for tea service and Champagne at night, was so wonderful to end the day by sitting by the beautiful mantel in front of the fire surrounded by classic 19thC formal antiques..and yet...such a feeling of warmth and coziness. The lobby staff is impeccable as is every single person who works in this amazing hotel. Our room, a superior, was a wonderful size with beautiful furnishings mixing classic with an all modern comfort luxurious. The large closets were even amazing made of fine cherry and beautiful wood drawers and hangers. The sitting area is an added plus and fresh fruit and water was put in the room each day and upon arrival. The bed was a dream for sleeping and the calm of the room added more to lulling you to sleep. The bathroom is gigantic with a separate shower and bath. Totally 5* luxe with marble and stone and every upscale, modern appliance you could think of for your dream hotel bathroom. Truly a room for people who want the best. Breakfast in the beautiful 2* Michelin restaurant (we did not dine for dinner as Fish is the reason you dine here..and I do not eat fish) was a delightful way to start the day. Beautiful tables with fresh orchids. Cheerful staff that served the best fresh Orange Juice ever tasted. The Breakfast selections were wonderful each day and the buffet was over-ladden with delicacies. German cheeses, salmon, many different variations of fruit salads and fresh yogurts, amazing artisinal breads, cereals, german traiditonal breakfast pastries, hams and breakfast meats and I could just go on.....the cooked to order dishes were mouth-watering. This breakfast was included in our very reasonable price that we found through Amex Platinum. By the way..the hotel glows. I think they must polish every inch of it twice a day! I can't forget to mention the beautiful spa area and well equipped gym. Well...need I go on? I travel in Europe (mostly France) 7/8 times a year and it takes a lot to impress me.

It\u00b4s a great hotel, the rooms are big, spacious, comfortable, clean, with enough space for your bags, a great working desk with different plug-ins (UK norm / US norm / German norm), what is great because you don\u00b4t need to ask for an adaptor if you need to work on your notebook or charge your mobile, etc. I used several services of the hotel like the laundry (ironing), valet parking, room service, and everything was excellent, on time, and with high quality standards. Some services are not cheap (i.e breakfast), but also not more expensive like other same-level hotels. Location is also excellent. I was on business, but my wife joined me and specially told that the hotel is located very close to great stores and key attractions in Berlin. The only negative thing I found are the lights inside the room. I know that the trend is to have low-consumption lamps, and it takes a while until they are really efficient, but there are some key places on the room, like the desk (if you must work), or the couch (if you want to read the newspaper or a book) where you simply need more light. We had a gala dinner in Berlin, I was with my wife, who complained because she said was not able to see really good her make-up and her dress.

Our European trip included other cities and to be honest Berlin wasn't the city that I had great anticipation about so this gem of a hotel helped to set the tone for our visit to Germany's capital city. It was trip advisor that first made me take notice of the hotel. I originally booked with the Cosmo Mitte but I had reservations about the hotels location. A few weeks prior I got cold feet and went back to the trip advisor review by an american woman from NYC who raved about The Regent and as I read her review I saw her reference to WHATAHOTEL.COM and their signature travel perks. I got in touch with Maria who was able to assist me making the reservations. The room was extremely comfortable with luxurious pillows and bedding. Our sleep was sound as the hotel was the only hotel that we stayed in that you couldn't hear anything room neighboring rooms. The breakfast was superb. We loved the waitstaff. They were so professional and yet warm. This we did not encounter in any of the other hotels on our vacation. So we appreciated it. The maid even left us a thankyou note after receiving our trip. American's like to tip but it is amazing when you get thanked for it! I will state that Berliners are very appreciative of tips on the whole. Cabs were not that expensive and we very happy with the minimum tip. The check in was seemless as was the check out.It was my first time booking with WHATAHOTEL.COM and I was skeptical but I will use them again. We will definitely return to both Berlin and The Regent. We were shocked to hear how young the hotel is as it feels like a classic place not at all like a luxury chain. The location can not be beat! Easy to hop on a train or to walk to the sites or to the Museums. The Concierge gave us some great recommendations. Very hip again not what we would have expected.

We are Americans living in Spain and for over six months I agonized over where to take my mother for her 70th birthday. She is very well travelled and has stayed in her share of luxury hotels around the world so my choice had to be a special one. Once I narrowed our destination down to Berlin I relied on Trip Advisor reviews to help me decide where to stay. I wanted a hotel with old world glamour but with all the modern, five-star amenities. Schlosshotel Im Grunewald caught my eye but I mapped it and saw that it was a 15 minute drive out of the city center. The Ritz Carlton was a contender based on general reputation but I\u00b4d read that The Ritz in Berlin was quite flashy, sort of Dubai style with lots of white, black and gold...not our style. The two obvious choices for our taste were the Hotel Adlon Kempinski and The Regent Berlin. Both seemed very popular in the reviews and I had a very hard time deciding but thankfully opted for The Regent. In a nutshell.....don\u00b4t judge a book by its cover. At first glance The Regent looks like an office building from the outside. Very nondescript. My heart sort of skipped a beat as the taxi pulled up. But I breathed a huge sigh of relief the second I walked through the door. Attentive doormen, STUNNING flowers in lobby, very friendly staff in reception. So far so good. When we stepped out of the elegant lifts to our floor I knew we had chosen well simply by the immaculate and well-appointed furnishings in the hallways....everything from the wallpaper, carpets, framed botanical prints and furniture was elegant, refined and very pretty. Our superior deluxe rooms were adjoining and were both spacious and well-equiped with everything one would expect from a 5-star. Massive flat screen Sony TV set discreetly into a wooden console dresser, a writing desk, reading chair and ottoman, a bar, generous closet and a large marble bathroom complete with robes, slippers, L\u00b4\u00d3ccataine products, a powerful hairdryer, toiletries, even beautiful fresh rose. Toilet in its own cubicle, a deep tub and a gorgeous glass shower. I commented that all the stainless fittings looked as though they had been installed that same day. That sort of sums up everything in that hotel, really....gleaming, polished, immaculate, prestine....plus incredible attention to detail (staff remembered our names immediately and our likes and dislikes from the first day). And breakfast was a delight, room service of that standard being one of life\u00b4s greatest indulgences. The tearoom and bar were both equally beautiful and inviting.There was an overall hushed feeling, something very peaceful, soothing and luxurious about the place. After a day out it was always a relief to return to such comforting accommodation. Mom and I both agreed that our time there was perfect, if there is such a thing. Our only complaint would have to be that their 2-star Fischers Fritz restaurant offered an extremely limited menu (primarily fish courses with the only alternatives being frogs legs, pigeon or venison). And the prices are astronomical (about 80 euros for a main course). We stumbled across a fabulous alternative at the nearby Hotel de Rome and had such a phenomenal dinner there that we returned again the next night. I could write several paragraphs about it (best dessert of my life- the Blueberry and Basil Cheesecake) but I\u00b4ll save that for another review. DON\u00b4T MISS IT THOUGH if you stay at The Regent! Oh - we checked out The Adlon for a drink at the bar and walked away feeling relieved that I had picked The Regent. It was larger, noisier and slightly tired-looking, and apparent that a guest would not receive the level of personal attention that we did in a smaller hotel.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyny", "Title": "\u201cCan't say enough good things....\u201d", "Author": "jls57300", "ReviewID": "UR102450683", "Content": "Service, room, food, location...all perfect.

This is an outstanding hotel of the finest quality and I think the best in Berlin. One guidebook called it \"the most hushed luxury hotel in Berlin\" and I agree. It has a subdued, intimate feeling. Everything about this hotel is high quality and uncrowded. The location is outstanding. Next to Gendarmenmarkt, two blocks from Unter den Linden, across the street from Galleries Lafayette and a block from high-end Friedrichstrasse shopping and the U6 subway line. An easy walk to Museum Island and only a bit farther in the opposite direction to the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag and Tiergarten. Many good restaurants are in the immediate area. My junior suite was spacious and appealingly furnished in a traditional style. The bath was good sized and had a separate shower. Robes and slippers. My room overlooked the courtyard and was very quiet. Rooms facing a street might have some street noise, but no adjacent streets have much traffic. The cold buffet for breakfast was a very reasonable 12 euros. A unlimited breakfast costs an expensive 36 euros. I found the cold buffet more than enough. And--hold on to your hat--high speed internet service in rooms is FREE!!! I had good dinners in the neighborhood at Dressler, Lutter & Wegner and Borchardt. But the head-and-shoulders best restaurant where I had dinner twice is Bocca di Bacco on Friedrichstrasse, just a block from the hotel--an elegant, upscale, polished operation with a buzz and nice ambiance. Bocca di Bacco has great food, great service, great atmosphere and reasonably moderate serving sizes. I mistakenly had dinner one night at XII Apostel which is further away and is a noisy, down-scale Italian restaurant featuring primarily pizza. I do not recommend it. Don't miss Fassbender & Rausch on Charlottenstrasse, about 3 blocks from the hotel at the southwest corner of Gendarmenmarkt. This claims to be the largest chocolate shop in the world and I think the claim is probably true. Upstairs is a nice cafe for a light lunch or an afternoon snack with hot chocolate. The cafe has a nice view of Gendarmenmarkt. The Regent is simply a high-class, really comfortable place to stay in Berlin. I walked through the Adlon Kempinski lobby and quickly walked back out.

We arrived sunday afternoon and were welcomed by a friendly doorman who also took care of our luggage. The reception procedure was efficient and the room was quite spacious, clean and furnished in a classic style like shown on the photographs. The marble bathroom was luxurious with bathtub, shower stall and separated toilet. Unfortunately there was a noticeable cost saving program which wasn't dramatic for the rate we booked but would be a bit annoying for guests who pay the regular rates and expects upscaled service given in top deluxe hotels: - At check in my partner was named wrong although the reservation office explicit asked for the name of my girl friend at time of reservation (\"...and does she also have an acadamic degree?\") and sent a specific reservation confirmation with both names on it. - A guidance to the room wasn't given, the receptionist just showed the direction to the elevators (although the hotel was nearly empty and we were the only guests checkin in). - In the room was neither a welcome card nor a little welcome gift like flowers, sweets or something what makes you feel welcome. - Turn down was done correctly (including a change of used towels and emptying the paper baskets) but there were no bedtimes sweets or a complimentary bottle of water given or anything else like a notice with the weather forecast placed in the room. - A newspaper wasn't delivered to the room all three days although the receptionist asked for our preferred paper at check in. - Our room had a king bed with one oversized blanket and we asked for two single blankets. After changing the first blanket the housekeeping discovered that there were no clean bedlinen for the second blanket available so we finally got bed linen from suites with a gold application. Needless to say that the bed linen wasn't changed each day. - In the evening and during the night there was no doorman available. We saw guests arriving in the evening who had to carry their luggage from the taxi to reception and after check in to their room (also without guidance). This is far away from upscaled hospitality. All three days there was no significant guest frequency in the hotel. The lobby area and the bar were nearly without guests. Maybe the (f&b-) management should check the price policy: about 30,-- Euro for a mixed cup of ice cream with fruit topping, cream and choclate sauce are far away from all competitors and simply annoying.

There were two huge double cupboards with lots of good quality hangers (the real sort of hanger, not those annoying ones that clip into holders so that you feel as though the hotel is expecting you to steal everything!), robes and slippers, all the toiletries and cotton wool, sewing kits, emery boards you could need. Free shoe shine every night. The reception staff were some of the most pleasant I have come across, the concierge always helpful and friendly, the location right next to Gendarmenmarkt very central to all the sights and the tube stops. Why stay anywhere else? We did not use the bar or restaurant, but both looked lovely. There is a central courtyard where you can sit outside for lunch or a snack and enjoy the weather in season. Yes, the television is an older style CRT one, but it is kept in a lovely cabinet, so why would the hotel upgrade to a flat screen? The room is more than big enough to be able to handle the size of the furniture. There was free wifi. For the price, this was unbelievable value.

Room service food very good, and at the time requested. Maid service well done, and porter too. It was almost like being in a 2nd home.

It would have been helpful if someone had replied to my email to let me know this, rather than disappoint me at check in. The room I was given was pleasant - it had at least a partial view of the Gendarmenmarkt, but it was a bit tired - 1980s sage green carpet, pale apricot walls and gold taps in the bathroom. (One other quibble which I will put now so as not to end on a negative note - outrageously expensive computer access - I wish hotels would learn that the what they reap in profit on this, they must lose in annoyed guests.) Once I had a decent night sleep though I could begin to appreciate the Regent's other benefits and I forgave them for the decor. The Regent is in a fabulous location - on a quiet side street in the old Eastern bloc - perfectly located within walking distance of all the major sightseeing centres. I had worried that this part of town was a little removed from the heart of the city - the Kurfurstendam - but after visting that side of town I felt that we had definitely made the right location decision. The Regent is walking distance to the Brnadenburg Gate, to Checkpoint Charlie, to all the major galleries and museums. There is the Galleries Lafayette across the street and several beautiful high end boutiques minutes from the hotel. The service in the hotel was very impressive - complimentary shoe shine each night; a book mark left on a book we were reading; bowls of chocolates left every day and a box of chocolates left as a farewell gift.

I am a total princess, if that helps guide you.", "Date": "August 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "moserdvm", "ReviewID": "UR5476814", "Content": "My family and I are experienced European travelers, but this was our first trip to Berlin. We generally stay in fairly nice hotels but none have ever been as wonderful as this hotel - regardless of price. The service provided by every member of the staff - from reception, concierge, bell service, restaurants, house-keeping, room service, etc. - exceeded that of any hotel I've ever stayed in. They were friendly, gregarious, and really seemed to care about making our stay a memorable one. We were shown to our rooms by one of the reception staff, greeted with a welcome gift in the room (a \"personalized\" large chocolate chip cookie, assorted candies and some fruit), and given thorough information and directions about the room amenities. Each day, upon return to our rooms, we found more goodies and fruit. Returning from site seeing on our last night stay in the hotel, we found a large plate of chocolates and a chocolate souffle' awaiting us on the side table. The room was spotlessly cleaned each day. Every time we saw any staff member that we had met before, they greeted us by name, and with a firendly smile. Obviously, I cannot say enough about the service. In addition to superb service, the hotel is very well located virtually at the center of the more significant historical sites and attractions, with many being within walking distance. For those sites that require subway travel, the hotel is one short block from a U-Bahn subway entrance. The food in the restaurants was fantastic - some of the best we had in all of Berlin, and comparable to some of the best meals I've had anywhere in Europe. All of this was at a price of about $200 Euros per night (not including any meals). It truly would have been worth it had we paid double that amount.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "leicester", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel in an excellent location\u201d", "Author": "leicestershire", "ReviewID": "UR5325707", "Content": "I can only reinforce the views of previous correspondents. Taking our son with us, we had a 'superior room' which comfortably accomodated the extra bed. There was a nice treat for kids in a room, but this should be a suprise, so we won't spoil it! The location is excellent, close to many of the major tourist and shopping areas, and with easy access to all transprt possibilities around Berlin and environs. The breakfast is superb and is on a par with all the best hotels.

The staff goes out of their way to satisfy all of your wishes. The location one block from the Gendarmarket is great with lots of restaurants close by and fabulous shopping in the Friedrichstrasse. It is also a block from the Franzchoistrasse subway station (in the U line), and a block from the Under den Linden avenue (where the Branderburg Gate is located). The rooms are big in size. They are classy in their look, or as they say \"timeless elegance\". The bed is really plushy and the pillows are down feather and huge!. If you have allergies, they will bring hypo-allergenic pillows for you. You also have free internet access in your room. The bathroom is outstanding. The marble tiles are very pretty with separate bathtub and shower plus a separate toilet (with door). The products in the bathroom are L'Occitane and the towels are really nice. The closet is equiped with wooden and satin hangers (nice touch) and it has a safe. The breakfast is outstanding and included in the price of the room. You get what they call The Regent Breakfast. It has juice, coffee/tea, basket of rolls, 3-tier plate selection of cheeses, cold cuts and pates. Also fruit, cereals, and pastries. You can also add an egg dish, french toast, bagel/salmon and pancakes. And you can eat as much as you want! They also have a Japanese Breakfast (with miso soup) and a continental breakfast, plus you can order a la carte. Definitively, this is one fantastic place to stay.", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Regent Berlin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d190664-Reviews-The_Regent_Berlin-Berlin.html", "Price": "$218 - $1,320*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Charlottenstrasse 49</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10117</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "190664", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/28/2f/282f93482275a8c9ecd5009f9afe38687large.jpg"}}
