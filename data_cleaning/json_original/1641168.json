The hotel location is excellent. The Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, hosting some very interesting buildings from Gaudi and others and also a nice shopping street, is just a block away, as are the Avinguda Diagonal, Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya and the Ramblas. The metro station Diagonal is nearby (when coming from line 3 or line 5, follow the signs in direction of the FGC station (line 6/7), which brings you to the Proven\u00e7a FCG station through some moving walkways and take the exit Balmes: it's just next to the hotel. The original hotel design is very nice. Rooms are very clean and tasteful and the bathrooms are very nice. Every room is equipped with a safe. The free wifi is working reliably in the rooms and every room also has an Internet radio receiver which you can use to listen to radio stations from your home country. It's a nice gadget for this kind of hotel. Also, unlike many other hotels, every room has lots of power sockets for all the gadgets you might already be bringing from home. The breakfast also corresponded with our expectations. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They have compiled their own list of interesting things to see and do in the city, together with hints about how to get there with public transports, and it also contains restaurant recommendations. Very helpful! As some people already wrote, you can hear metro/train arriving in your room. However I want to say that this is not disturbing at all. It definitely did not prevent us from sleeping. Not all rooms have an exterior window, but this is also something which we did not consider a problem at alll. If you want a nice view, you'd better get out of your room to enjoy the nice city of Barcelona anyway! So we were very happy with our stay here, and would definitely come back here and recommend it to others, especially if you want to try something different than the common, standard hotel design.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHip yet human\u201d", "Author": "mf2hd", "ReviewID": "UR128198012", "Content": "This place is a great balance of stylish interiors and friendly, unpretentious service.

There were some nice little touches that really made you feel welcome. The breakfast buffet is lovely and finishes at midday so you can sleep late unlike most hotels. The rooms are modern, comfortable and surprisingly spacious and the music system is excellent. The only downside is that the underground system runs close by and there is a bit of vibration noise. you'll only notice it at night but some ear plugs or perhaps a room on a higher level will solve this.

The penthouse room has a private roof terrace with a large stone raised bath, (amazing for nigh-time bubble baths under the stars!) You can see over the rooftops of Barcelona, and there is a double bed outside for lounging in the sun, or cuddles in the evening. The room is very 'spcae age' in appearance and the bed is extremely comfy. The biggest asset of the hotel are it's staff; they are very helpful and recommended some fantastic restaurants to us; They recommended a local Catalan restaurant to us that was out of this world, (can't remember the name but it's not the Cerveceria Catalunya, it was much more upmarket and well worth a visit!) The only thing that stopped this hotel getting a 5 out of 5 was that the breakfast was rather mediocre, and the Ipod docking system in the room had a light that we couldn't turn off, which created a little unwanted disco at night.

Paintwork was shabby and when we went to take a shower we had to mop up the whole floor as it leaked over the room. When we eventually got to bed the sheets were so threadbare there were holes in them, the mattress was thin enough to feel the springs and the wallmounted radio had led lights flashing constantly, when we couldn't sleep because of the flashing lights and couldn't switch the radio lights off we complained to reception they were obviously aware of this problem and supplied us with an elastoplast to stick over the flashing lights which obviously had no effect. Watch out for the clothes hangers here they have staples sticking out which could ruin your best clothes.Complaining to management got us the offer of a free breakfast (as according to this manager the chain didn't offer refunds,). which we obviosly didn't accept as we couldn't wait to leave the place.

The room was modern and clean with a comfy bed, a huuuuuge shower, which was amazingly powerful, and a seperate toilet area. Other nice touches were a mini bar with a enough space to store your own bits too. Also amzaing wifi which was always available and fast too, unlike a lot of hotels I have stayed in recently. The area is full of nice little bars and restaurants, along with quite a few coffee shops and because of this we never eat breakfast in the hotel. I struggle to find anthing negative to say about the hotel, however I will try.

We had thought that the place to be was on or near Las Ramblas...actually, this location is lots more attractive, with less street traffic, less noise, great nearby eateries, and either a 15 minute walk or one metro stop to Las Ramblas. it is only a couple of blocks to two of Gaudis most famous apartment buildings, and the 5th avenue of Barcelona. The main problems are low lighting in the rooms, which is only an issue when you are trying to find something that you have misplaced, and the potential street noise in the front rooms which overlook the street. All in all, a good deal, nice looks, good location, good staff, excellent wifi, wonderful shower, and lots of apples!!", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cTrendy budget option in a good location.

Still, we were just so glad to be able to check-in at 9am! We took the airbus from the airport and switched to the subway at Plaza Catalunya to Diagonal. But if you're dead tired from traveling then it might be worth it to take a cab from the Plaza. If you're not too tired, it's only about a 10 minute walk from the Plaza.

Although we went at 10.00 in the morning they had our room ready (even though the check-in is at 2.00pm) !!!!!, so it was so good for us after a night of travelling to have the opportunity to rest before starting exploring the town!!!!! the breakfast is excellent and its price of 6euro is nothing compared to the choices the buffet has!!!! The rooms are very beautiful, and the only thing I have to say is that it was a little inconvinient the fact that the shower's door was from glass, and the fact that if someone wanted to read he had to switch on both the lightsby the beds!!! however, the beds were very comfortable, and I really would like to have one of their pillows in my bed!!!! the gadget in the wall with the music and the e-radio was very nice, and the flat TV on the wall was good!!!!! But the best of all that this hotel has to offer is the personnel!!!! Indeed, although I have travelled, and stayed in many hotels all over Europe, and New York, the employees of RoomMate Emma cannot be compared with anyone!!!!!It was really an unexpected surprise to meet such good persons, who were ready at any time to help you with everything!!!!! We really owe to them, some very good and not expensive gourmet experiences, and good tips about Barcelona!!!!! some tips for Barcelona: don't try to eat anywhere near The Rambla, all the restaurants there are very expensive and the the quality of the food is very very poor....... Oscar and Felippe from the Room Mate Emma reccomended us some very very good restaurants (and they had even the courtesy to print the maps of their location for us, and even to make a reservation in one of them!!!!!) try the Cerveceria Cataluna and the Baltazar, they both are in a walking distance from the hotel, the food there is excellent, and the prices really value for money!!!!! If you want to visit Gaudi's building I would strongly reccomend to go first of all and have an inhouse visit(12euros) in the casa Batllo, and then to La Perdera, but if you want to go to La Sagrada Familia, don't bother to go inside.....the best view is from outside and it doesn't worth almost the 20 euros you ll have to spend in order to go inside and to see nothing more than a construction place.....All the things that you need to know are more than enough in the 2 casas I mentioned before finally I really liked Barcelona, but I need to admitt that staying in this hotel, made my vacations really good, and to add that if I ever go back to Barcelona definetely I will stay in Room Mate Emma but also that whereever I ll go and there is a Room Mate hotel, it will definetely be my first choice!!!!!!!
