We have stayed at this Willow Tree Inn almost every time, through two name changes and two owners. We have on occasion gone to other motels, usually more expensive, and always made these one trip changes as Willow Tree has such great staff, clean rooms and a wonderful location for going to Silver Dollar City. The breakfast is acceptable and has been getting better the last several trips. If we want more, we usually go to \"Plantation\", about a 5 minute drive on Country 76. We are a party of 3 (all seniors) and get a room with two queen beds for the three of us and the charge (including taxes) has been a little under $250.00 for a 5 night stay for three adults in a clean, well maintained, quiet motel with friendly staff. This is a place you can count on for a great vacation without \"breaking the bank\" and is on the end of town by Silver Dollar City.

Our room was a queen with one bed in the room which made the room seem larger. Lounge chair, two chairs with table too. The bed was a firm mattress and not with a pillow top as advertised on their website. The breakfast was adequate as advertised. The pool we did not use but it looked clean. If you want more luxury choose another hotel, but if you want value, clean, and adequate choose Willow Tree. We did not want to spend money on a luxury hotel, so that we had money to spend on entertainment. The place was quiet and we were in the tower building fourth floor. Appreciated the quiet, birds singing since they have a RV park and trees. Walking distance to Golden Corral or simply drive. It was very hot 90's and the fact this is an older cement block hotel the rooms stayed much cooler even when we did not use the air conditioner all day.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jefferson City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cYou Get What You Pay For\u201d", "Author": "sschadster", "ReviewID": "UR131646614", "Content": "Unimpressed by hotel, we travel quite a bit and with kids we are always looking for the best hotel that won't break the bank during vacation.

The friendliness of the staff and a clean room is their greatest feature. We had reservations and check in was quick. There are two sections, with the front being two-story, and the rear section three story. We did not see an elevator. Our room was on the second floor, a single queen. The room itself was clean, recently painted, with typical motel furnishings and a sofa. The bed could have used a new mattress. The outdoor lighting was so bright at night we could read in our room without turning on the lights. (Too much \"carpet-fresh\" scent) There was an outdoor pool, but it was not in use at the time of our stay. The breakfast host was very friendly, but the items were a disappointment from the previous reviews, with only cereal, bagels, and pastries from the fridge, juice or coffee to drink (no milk except for cereal-sign). It's a short walk to Golden Corral and McFarlands. The posted picture is an accurate view of the rooms. We were given a \"special rate\" for 3 nights at $99, but other motels were offering the same rate. It's at the far west end of the strip area, a block off the strip.
