That I probably got food poisoning? That the staff were at best incompetent at worst insulting? That the rooms were terrible? That the internet didn't work? That it is extremely expensive? It's location is great though. Let me explain very briefly as I do not want to waste any more time. I won't give too many details but epigrammatically here goes: Service unattentive, only people at the front desk made some effort. Nobody to help with luggage when we arrived with the taxi. Standard room was EXTREMELY small. Barely enough space to move and a bathroom I couldn't fit it (I am not large). It also stank and was dirty. Had to change to the j suite which was niceish but carpet very dirty. Room service never once brought the right order, food quality was poor and I think I got food poisoning from the yogurt in the morning of day two(was probably off but didn't check). As a result I spent the third day sick in bed. Person on the phone was even rude when I asked for hard boiled eggs for my stomach (refused to help) and then brought soft boiled eggs. Internet didn't work, was repeatedly told it would be fixed promptly, even given codes to use that weren't working (four times), in order to just waste our time. What else? It was noisy. Noise that we were told was coming from the shop next door (relentless drilling and banging at 8.30 in the morning until we left the room to go out!! didn't return until evening when it had stopped), noise from renovation that was going on...Never again do I want anything to do with this hotel!", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cStylish hotel in a superb Parisian location\u201d", "Author": "Jemimagold", "ReviewID": "UR125371996", "Content": "We recently stayed for a night at the Hotel Castille this past February and here are our observations: 1. Location: The location is superbly situated on rue Cambon, about a 3 minute walk from the Rue de Rivoli and Place Vendome. 2. Decor: Clearly a great deal of effort went into the interior design of Hotel Castille. Our room was chicly decorated in cream and black whereas the lobby was elegantly appointed with rich crushed velvet sofas and jewel toned accessories. 3. Room: Our room was small but well furnished with all the usual trappings of a nice hotel such as flat screen tv, safe, heated towel rack, etc... The bathoom was equipped with \"StarHotels\" toiletries that smelled rather ordinary. 4. Wifi: Complimentary for multiple users per room. 5. Food: We ordered room service for breakfast and it was delivered within 20 minutes. The egg white omelets and porridge were well prepared, and there was a generous supply of fresh pastries and coffee. 6. Service: This was really the only negative aspect of our stay at Hotel Castille. The young fellow checking us in spoke very little English and seemed quite inexperienced. For example, he told us our room wasn't ready but when I asked one of his colleagues if there was an available room, she quickly found one. When he took us up to our room, he said \"here's the bathroom\" before abruptly leaving.

Overall, given the price, location and service, we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who values location and value over grandness. We stayed in Room 511, facing the courtyard. I think it may have been classified as a junior suite, but would have been a regular room anywhere in the US with possible exception of the boutique hotels in NYC. The room was \"largish\", with a separate sitting area, a desk, TV and separate shower/sink and a toilet. The shower was good, the water hot and the pressure quite adequate - although I still don't get the European insistence of not enclosing the showers, allowing the water to spray across the bathroom. The bathroom was very clean, in fact, I was able to take a bath, something that I rarely do in a hotel bathroom. The bed was large, and very comfortable. The linens felt nice and the towels were large and very absorbent. The room came with 2 bathrobes - nice touch when traveling with carry-on luggage. The staff was super nice, great concierge service. Very nice bar where we had a number of late night drinks and chats with a very friendly bartender. The morning buffet was ok, it could have been better - the eggs were not great, the croissants were freshly baked but tasted like they were previously frozen. The lobby is very comfortable and very nicely furnished. It is a great place to meet up with friends or just relax after a day of sightseeing or shopping. And just in case you love to savor your time in Paris to the last possible moment and you happen to patronize the Ritz' bars which close at 2:30 am, the back door of the Ritz is directly across the street from the entrance to Castille. You can stagger out of the bar and be in bed 3 minutes later. The bottom line is - Castille is a little boutique hotel, charming and cute. It is not the Bristol or the Ritz, but in its price point it has a lot to recommend itself. And the location is superb, on Rue Cambon, next to Coco Chanel's store, right in the back of the Ritz hotel, and down the street from the best shopping in the world - Faubourg St. Honore.

On arrival, we were allocated a room on the 2nd floor, and couldn't believe what we saw when we opened the door...a tiny shabby room in need of a complete refurb. We returned to the front desk to complain, and using the photos from their own website argued that the room wasn't up to standard. The staff said that the rooms on the web site were suites and the room we had been allocated initially was a superior room and was scheduled for redecoration in 2012. They agreed to reallocate a new room on the 6th floor, which had been recently refreshed...not sure how \"recently\" this had occurred, as it was rather tired, with marks on the wall and bathroom. It was also tiny...I've never stayed in such a small room. The room has TV /mini bar etc, but was so small, I could lie in the \"Double\"? bed and put my foot into the bathroom!...To be fair, the room was relevantly clean, but we felt mislead by the photos published on their hotel site, and we would never have booked this as a place to stay.

Try local street cafes if you only want a croissant & coffee & if unprepared to be a Parisian there's a Starbucks just up the road! The business centre was a computer & a printer that usually had a teenager on Facebook! WiFi is only free for a limited short time. NB: excellent & very helpful concierge!

A thief entered our room, broke the zipper of our luggages which were locked and stole all of our precious belongings. Amazingly, the robbery happened in the middle of the afternoon and the concierge even saw the man leaving the hotel with the loot!!! My husband and I together with our 2 small children were staying in a suite at Hotel Castille for 5 nights in August 2010. Our room was at the old wing and there were only 4 rooms (including ours) on that floor. The robbery happened on our last day staying at the Hotel. As usual, before we left the room we made sure that our things save for the children's toys and some clothes were packed in our luggages and locked. We made sure that we took extra steps to be prudent as the Hotel had hired temporary cleaners given that it was the summer holidays. In addition, there was also on-going renovation at the Hotel. Hence, we thought that it was best for us to be cautious with our belongings. We were told that after we left the room, a man had approached the hotel cleaner and told her that his family was staying in Room 454 which was in fact our room!! He said that his children were allergic to the products in the room and he instructed the cleaner to open the windows and put fresh towels in our room. When we left the room that afternoon, the room was already cleaned and fresh towels were already placed in the bathroom. When I came back with my son to the room, the whole place was ransacked..the bags were opened and the things were all over the floor. The windows were wide opened and there were fresh towels placed on the bed which clearly indicated that the cleaner must have been in the room prior to the robbery. There were no signs of break-ins so what actually really happened ie whether the thief had immediately entered the room after the cleaner entered our room was not made clear to us. According to the hotel, the keycard to enter the room uses a code which is secure and protected and cannot be duplicated!! We waited for about 2 hours for the police to come and we were then told to go to the police station to make a police report. The hotel said that they will compensate us for our taxi fare but that didn't happened. We were stuck at the police station in a scary part of Paris for more than 4 hours and by the time we got back to the hotel it was close to midnight. Our 2 young children aged 6 and 2 were exhausted and of course traumatized by the whole incident. The next morning as we were checking out, my husband realized that he had left his shoe in room 454 (we had by then moved to a new room). I contacted the front office and requested if someone could send his shoe over. However, I was told by the guy at the front office that someone had checked in to the room last night and the cleaner did not find anything there. We later found out that the guys had blatantly lied to us and my husband went up to the room and found that the room was left in the same condition as we had left them. Notwithstanding, the poor experience we had stayed at the Hotel we were asked to pay for the 5 nights without any consideration for a discount or compensation from the Management. Since the incident happened, I have written to Starhotel's (owner) President, their customercare, GM of the Hotel and the Marketing Director. Other than the emails from the Marketing Director requesting for the name of the police officer and copy of the police report, there was no response from Castille or Starhotel. I find the kind of service or in this case the lack of it from a 4star Hotel like Castille utterly dissapointing!!

I hesitated over whether to write this review because I really want to keep this hotel to myself. But that wouldn't be right. The Castille is a pleasure - reasonably priced, lovely rooms, and an absolutely unbeatable location. My teenage son and I stayed in a duplex suite that was perfect for a relaxing long weekend. The room looked out on the Rue Cambon and the decor was stunning - cream and black in a sort of Venetian style that really was a treat to stay in. Our suite had two bathrooms and both were very nice. The room price was extremely reasonable for a central location in Paris. The breakfast buffet is ok, but the staff is not focused on buffet \"maintenance\", so towards the end of the breakfast seating it looks as if locusts have been through the dining room. My son is 14 and requires constant feeding - I mention this because we ordered room service twice during our stay and both times it arrived within 15 minutes. The food was good and the portions generous. The staff are attentive and friendly. We speak French, but I heard them speaking English and Italian to other guests. The best thing about this hotel, and the real reason I stay there, is because it's right next door to the Chanel \"mothership\". You can go and have a little shopping and Chanel delivers right next door. I used to stay at the Ritz, which is just across the street, until I did the math and realized that I could buy an extra skirt or a pair of shoes with the money I saved by staying at the Castille. I must not be the only crazy lady doing funny \"shopping math\" because my salesgirl at Chanel said they deliver at the Castille all the time.

We paid for a deluxe room and were really excited about our stay. When we arrived the check-in was smooth and the reception staff friendly. But seeing the room gave us a shock. The room looked NOTHING like the pictures on the website had indicated. It was soooooo small, and not very clean (the carpet was dirty and stained, same with the the bed throw). But the worse was really the toilet. It was separate from the bathroom, and no sink in the toilet. It was so small that it was tricky to get in and close the door. The bathroom with the sink, bathtub and shower over it, were ok but nothing more. After \"complaining\" about this we were told that this is indeed the deluxe room but they all had different \"lay-outs\". And that the hotel had given us this room because it was at the back of the hotel and should be quiet. Anyway, we were moved to another room (not before the next day though). The new room had no different \"lay-out\" as they had told us, it was the same. Just a tiny bit bigger (with a bigger bed). Still separate toliet, but at least we didn't have to struggle to get in this time. No complimentary WiFi, but there was ONE computer downstairs. But unfortunately not very easy to use, since there were people occupying it for 2 hours (the hotel reception gives a 2-hour access to the guests). Which is ridiculous if they only have one computer available. The neighbourhood is nice with all the designer shops around, and being quite in the center. But it's very quiet and not easy to find restaurants, cafes or bars around here. If we hadn't paid as much as we did, the hotel would have been ok. But it was definitively not value for the money, and not the standard we expected or are used to.

But I did have a few issues. The staff was very nice and tried hard to be accommodating. I arrived and my room wasn't ready so I left, got some coffee, came back in about 2 hours and the room was ready. I requested a room on a high floor and got the 5th floor out of 6. The hallways were quite narrow and dingy. The room, a Superior, was very small. For me, it was fine, for more than 1 it would be a squeeze. That said, everything about the room was mostly positive. The bathrooms, though small, had a separate door to the toilet and the bathtub was narrow but deep and long and made for some luxurious and relaxing baths after walking all day. The bathrooms are marble from wall to floor so they were very cold. Also, on my last night, I noticed some small worm like bugs on the floor where the toilet was, the firs time I'd seen any sort of critters, fortunately i was leaving the next morning. The closets are large but are lit by a horribly blinding fluorescent light that flickered a bit. Also, the television had just one American channel, CNN, and that was the one channel that was out for a couple of days. Figures, I didnt watch TV much anyway, but it would've come in handy late night when I kept waking up at 3am due to jet lag. The maid service was great as was the internet service, which was free, but you had to get a code from the front desk every time you wanted to use it. I didn't go to the bar but I did get to eat at the restaurant. The food was quite good, the risotto that they recommend especially, but the scene is odd. It is very quiet atmosphere, lots of solo businessmen, and there were only 4 tables when i was there. They do give you a 10% off card when you check in though. Another odd issue I had was on my original tour of the hotel I was told by the front desk woman that my breakfast was included, which was a nice surprise, however, the next morning after getting the breakfast buffet, before my first bite I was served with a bill and told that my breakfast was NOT included. Surprise 28 euro breakfast! I did get a note from the front desk apologizing and offering to comp the breakfast though, which was nice.

It had a view of their beautiful courtyard (enhanced with wonderful painted scenes) in an extremely quiet part of the hotel (we heard nothing the whole week). The overall decor of the hotel is very chic and conveys a warmth and charm that I found very appealing. I also want to mention Benoit, the concerierge 'extraordinaire' who was so friendly and helpful.

We were 3 adults in one room, which was pretty crowded, but the separate WC/bathroom helped a lot. The buffet breakfast was OK, with a good selection of pastries. However, the scrambled eggs were not to my taste - try a small helping before you dig in is my advice. And by all means get a room price where the breakfast is included \u2013 as I remember, the price for the breakfast was EUR 16/person. What really sets this hotel apart from the rest is the excellent service; I have NEVER felt more welcome than I did at the Castille! The staff really takes good care of you, and using English was never a problem at all. The tip we gave them was well deserved, indeed! A final tip: while it is easy to have the hotel call a taxi for you, getting it yourself is much quicker and about EUR6 cheaper.

We arrived in paris 6am and our room obviously wasn't ready. However, Eddie at the front desk was so helpful and accomodating. He was willing to upgrade us to a duplex room that was available immediately, however we decided to wait because we didn't want a two story room with stairs with 2 young toddlers. however, he still upgraded us to a suite and called us on our cell at noon when the room was ready. Our room was on the second floor overlooking the \"courtyard\". there really wasn't any to see except the next building 50 feet away. however the room was wonderful. we had 2 large rooms with high ceilings, modern decor and very clean. the king size bed was very comfortable and the room had a safe, blow dryer, a fridge and 2 large tvs. The huge floor to ceiling windows lined one entire side of the rooms and they had great blackout curtains. they had an extra bed set up for my 3 year old and a large pack and play bed for my 18 month old. the hotel also has a gym. not much by american standards but enough to get a workout. they had a tredmill, an eliptical machine a couple of benches and a basic set of dumbells.

Channel was next to us. you are only a few blocks from the tuileries gardens and the metro and a 5 minute walk to the Louvre. There are a few restaurants in the area but they were very expensive. we asked the hotel for a casual, easy place to pick up a quick lunch and they recommended a small restaurant s couple blocks from the hotel. we ordered 3 bowls of plain pasta, a soda and a bottle of water and it was $70 US dollars! Very expensive all over paris. A can of soda was around 6 dollars in many places - so be aware before you buy! The tuileries garderns has a permanent carnival set up that the kids enjoyed at night. the only difficulty we had in the area was that there was no supermarket or small store to buy some milk, fruit and basic things for the kids. the closest one requirred us to take the metro.

The trouble started when we attempted to use our phone to call the concierge for dinner recommendations our first night (a must if you don't know Paris very well). None of the service buttons on our phone worked (operator, front desk, concierge, housekeeping, room service, etc.). So, we had to walk down to the lobby after we finished dressing. What a surprise to find out that there was no concierge... at 8pm on a Friday night! We reported the phone trouble to the bellman and he wrote a note to the lone desk receptionist (too busy with another guest to answer our questions about the phone). The next day, we were missing a robe. We tried to use the phone to call housekeeping, but it still wasn't working. No one ever called us back or contacted us about the phone. Good thing we didn't have any true emergencies that would require a working phone. And, there still was no concierge to help us with a dinner selection on the second night... at 7pm on a Saturday night! The front desk attendant seemed confused by the phone and concierge complaints, but didn't really have any solutions. She then told us someone would contact us before we checked out the next morning at 9am. Guess what... no one ever called us back. We had to complain to the front desk attendant (again) as we checked out. At that point, we were \"promised\" the desk manager would reach out to us when he arrived later that morning. As expected, we never heard from him either. This is on top of the worst hotel bar service I've ever experienced (no one in the bar, 15 minute wait to track down a bartender, flat champagne and prices higher than the Hotel Costes!).

Normally when we travel to Paris we stay at a nice little boutique hotel (Hotel de la TourMaubourg) in the 7th arrondissement. Since this hotel was fully booked I chose the Castille, because I thought it would be nice to explore the 1st arrondissement this time. And so we did. We had a nice time at the Castille. The neighbourhood is really pleasant, with all the great shops and Chanel next door! Lots of 'brasseries' for a breakfast, espresso or wine close by, and rue St Honoree is super to have so near to your hotel! I like the way the Castille is decorated. We had a 'triple-room': our daughter had her own bathroom and a pull-out sofa. With the stairs she came in our part, with our own bathroom. (marble as well). There was a large window to look at the rue Cambon which was really nice. The concierges were very kind and polite. In the evening we had some drinks at the bar and the barman was very sympathetic too. I find that in the past 10 years the French really have changed! (Much less arrogant! ;-) I must say that we would recommend the Castille and that we will come back whenever we'll visit the 1st arrondissement again.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "miami, fl", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Castille!\u201d", "Author": "cingo2000", "ReviewID": "UR20289896", "Content": "The description of the hotel sounded perfect.

Some minor drawbacks: our room was indeed very hot (as other reviewers have noted), the headline room prices are exorbitant (our suite was listed at over \u20ac1000 per night, which it was certainly not worth - as a result of booking online and the upgrade, we paid a third of that) and our room was slightly shabby and claustrophobic (in the duplex the space is all vertical rather than horizontal).
