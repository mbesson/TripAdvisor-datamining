The Hotel is not large, but large enough that each room has it's own balcony area and the people around us seemed very friendly and not posh or stuck up. We talked with the cleaning staff the next day and she explained how they don't rush to finish cleaning a room because the management puts no pressure on them, but they strive to do it right every time...music to my ears!

I was not as impressed as the other reviews have indicated. I stayed at the standard, two double bed, room. I cannot speak for the other rooms. Let me list the pros and cons of this place. Pros - Location, location, location. The motel is located right by the beach, and just hopping out of the motel room to go for a stroll on the beach was great. - Price: I payed about $70/night for this place. In the location its in, $70/night over the weekend is a pretty good deal. - Spacious room: The room had two double beds and was very spacious. - Nice view: All the rooms have a partial ocean view. It seems like most of the hotels in the area have it set up that way though. - Free wireless: You can ask the front desk and they will give you the password for connecting online. Do not pay for it!! - Microwave and fridge - Pool: There is a heated pool Cons - Its a traditional motel, nothing fancy. The door leads directly outside, and the only window in the room faces directly to the outdoor hallway. Hence, if you wanted to see the ocean from your window, you will be sharing the view with anybody that walks past your room in the hallway. You can't help yourself but glance into someone's room when walking past an open window... - Hard bed: Somebody had noted in a previous review that the bed was hard, but the manager had written back saying something about changing all the beds. Well, people have personal preferences on how hard the bed is, but boy was it hard! It was very uncomfortable. My friend's bed was a little softer, but it was super noisy! Every time she would switch positions, the bed would creak keeping us awake! - Make sure you bring your own shampoo/conditioner. They will only give you a bar of soap. There was nowhere to hang the hand towel since there was no rack. - Shower was really weak, and it did not drain well at all. We had to wait in between showers for the shower to drain. - You have to pay $10 for the second car if you come separately - No coffee maker or continental breakfast. Supposedly, you can get free coffee if you go to the lobby. Our room was one of the farthest rooms from the lobby, so it was not taking our sleepy heads for free coffee. All in all, the location was great, and it was probably worth the money for location alone, but I would probably pay a little more and go to a different hotel. It seemed like people with family really enjoyed staying at this motel, so I would recommend it to families with children who are on a tight budget.

Each of our stays is 10 days long, so after spending 50 days with them over the last few years, we believe we can give an accurate review of the motel. What keeps us coming back each year most importantly is it\u2019s location. The southern area of Daytona Beach is known as Daytona Beach Shores. The area is away from the crowds and heavy traffic found in central Daytona\u2019s Boardwalk section. Secondly, because it is a smaller, family-owned and operated motel -you have the benefit of dealing with the same friendly people on each visit. We\u2019ve even had the same maid service each time! A wonderful young lady named Kimberly is readily available to attend to our needs. Other reasons to stay at the Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn include: 1. Spacious, affordably-priced efficiency apartments 2. Very clean, well-maintained grounds and rooms 3. Friendly family atmosphere 4. Beautiful ocean views from the pool area and sundeck 5. A choice of more upscale jacuzzi suites 6. It\u2019s location within walking distance of several restaurants 7. Free wi-fi internet access (even in the pool area) 8. Comfortable beds 9. Optional, tile-floored pet friendly rooms 10. A feature that we\u2019ve come to appreciate over the years is that establishments like this one attract a type of customer we enjoy being around. We have met many fine people and developed friendships with other repeat customers who, like us, return the same time every year. Now that I have listed what you can expect to find at Atlantic Ocean Palm I think it is important to tell you what you won\u2019t find as well: 1. A huge parking garage with tiny parking spaces that makes it a 10 minute trek to get to your room 2. Loud parties next door and teenagers running up and down hallways at all hours of the night 3. Shady looking people hanging around the parking area and elevators 4. An overcrowded pool area with no seating left 5. A disinterested stranger every time you go to the motel desk 6. A bill so big at the end of your stay you feel that you should be made part owner After having read other reviews here, I would like to address some of the complaints made by others such as the lack of private balconies or not keeping the office open 24 hours. I can only respond by saying that if what you want is a high-rise hotel with a marble-lined lobby and impersonal 24 hour room service at double or triple the room rates found at the Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn -then clearly you should go somewhere else. But, if value is important to you; value provided by being efficiently run by attentive family members doing their best -then you should consider the Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn for your next vacation destination.", "Date": "May 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "TX", "Title": "\u201cNever Again - at least not for business travel\u201d", "Author": "Traveler25698", "ReviewID": "UR30110447", "Content": "When booking a business trip we found the hotels near the location we were working would be full most of the week. This hotel came up with a good rating (4 stars while the Hilton ranked only 3.5) and based on the rate (more than the Hilton per night) I figured it was safe to assume this would be a good hotel for my trip. WRONG!. 1st, this is not a hotel or an Inn. This is a motel. It is way down the road from the main section of town. If it is after dark you check in through a bulletproof security window. The ocean view from the room applied only if I stood at one end of the window and looked out sharply towards the other side. Directly out the window was the side of another hotel. The room smelled strongly of carpet freshener but it was clean. However, it was very simple basic motel furniture. No desk or internet capability for a business traveler. Fine, I can live through this for a night and in the mean time found openings at the Hilton near the venue. Then I found out about the punitive cancellation policy of this hotel. The entire week had been pre-paid at a rate higher than was posted on their web site and higher than the Hilton or two other nice name brand hotels closer to the venue. And they absolutely would not discuss it. Trying to defend this as normal hotel procedure (I have had to cancel / change reservations at hotels all over the country with no problems.) Now I can be particular when I am traveling, but I am reasonable. At $169 per night, I have certain expectations and this facility completely failed to meet them. Then their unwillingness to do anything to remedy the situation was completely unacceptable. I feel like their take was they got someone fooled into booking a room at their premium rates and their was no way they were going to give that up. If I were traveling on vacation with my family this might have been a good motel for $70 to $90 per night. However for a business traveler staying for one week, this was a huge mistake. My co-worker refused to spend even one night here. I ended up spending two nights here then moved to the Hilton @$129/night for the rest of the week. The two don't even compare.

We were able to book the Jacuzzi room with a King Size bed (room 301) with less than two weeks before the event. We arrived at night, but had no problem finding the place. The woman at the counter was very nice and knew exactly who we were when I told her my name, a nice perk to choosing a small hotel. The hotel is directly on the beach and we enjoyed the view from our room right away. The jacuzzi room has a small kitchenette with a dorm-sized fridge, microwave, coffee maker, small sink, and a hotplate and pans under the cabinet. The bathroom is standard hotel fare with the sink outside of the bathroom, and the toilet and shower/tub in a room next to it. The jacuzzi is in the main part of the room with a great view of the big window and of course the TV (flat screen). The king size bed takes up most of the room, while a table and two chairs are off to the side when you walk in. As hotel rooms go, this is pretty no-fuss, but it was very nice and clean. We definitely LOVED the view as the window looks out onto the ocean and the beach, and gives a great view of the sunrise. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of plenty of places to eat, such as Denny's, IHOP, Burger King, and a number of local restaurants. We got some great sandwiches from a pizza joint just up the road called Gator's Pizza. If you're in the mood for a bigger restaurant chain, hop in your car and head over the bridge to endless choices of places to eat and shop. On several occasions, we took the opportunity to walk down the clean, beautiful beach towards a pier about a mile south. You can fish, eat, or just enjoy the views and sounds from there. From what I understand, there are two restaurants on the pier, at least one of which does serve breakfast. We did not take the opportunity to swim in the pool, but I can say that it looked very clean and clear. It's a standard sized pool, no slide or kiddie area, but very nice. There are also several tables and chairs on a patio on the edge of the property. The woman who came to do housekeeping was very nice and happily cleaned up our room as we waited. The gentleman who is the general manager was out everyday doing cleanup of the grounds. There is a very large condominium right next door, but it's actually very pretty and isn't an eye sore and doesn't ruin the view of the ocean.
