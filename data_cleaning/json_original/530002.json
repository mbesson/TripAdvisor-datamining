{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good budget choice for expensive Florence! I have just returned from 3 nights in Florence and after reading reviews posted here I was a bit wary of what to expect but for the low price I paid I was pleasantly surprised and couldn't fault my stay at Hotel Aline. Accommodation is very, very expensive in Florence - even budget hotels are extortionate but I'd say I got a good deal with hotel Aline! I had a double room with shower and a small balcony looking out onto gardens and the Tuscan hills. There were 2 toilet/shower rooms in the corridor and I didnt have any issues with them. The room was very basic but clean with plenty of storage room. The 'hotel' is really the 4th floor in a building (there's a lift) and to check in you have to go across to the hotel liberty across the road. I was well aware of this as it is stressed on their website and on the confirmation email but when I arrived there was a group of people trying to get it even tho they all had the same confirmation slip as I had with all the info on it?!! Aline is in a good location, 5 mins walk away from the train station, the accademia and the duomo and maybe 15 minutes down to the ponte vecchio. The area is quiet, feels safe and the building is very secure. There is maid service everyday and the staff are very friendly, I emailed them a few times to organise car parking and tickets for the accademia and they were very helpful and quick to reply. If you are looking for a no frills, clean and comfortable hotel to crash in Florence (with everything this beautiful city has to offer you won't be spending much time in your hotel room!!) that's not going to cost a fortune then I would recommend Hotel Aline otherwise pay the extra, stay elsewhere and don't complain!!", "Date": "May 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR759114412", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "dinkydoll"}, {"Content": "Good price and good location Our staying was nice and the place is well located and very cheap.We read some bad reviews about this hotel........but i can't agree because is good accomodation for persons without big expectatives.....it is well located just 5 min from the trainstation and from all the museums .Good value for the money", "Date": "Aug 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR788725409", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "magghy"}, {"Content": "Ummm, Never again! My husband and I just returned from an amazing 2 week backpacking trip in Italy... let's just say the ONLY downer was our hotel in Florence - HOTEL ALINE! When we arrived, we were to check in at the hotel across the street (Liberty Tourist House). Although they advertised that their staff speak English well, I beg to differ... we would have complained (and gotten the hell out of there) if we could have communicated with them! Our room was very run down... 2 different creaking beds smashed together, floor hadn't been swept in years, disgusting ceiling, I could go on... ohhh but it got worse when I ventured down the hallway to the shared bathroom. Let's just say this bathroom was too filthy to throw up in. I'm not kidding. We are not pretension people. We're quite simple, which is why we opted to backpack and stay in one-star hotels/hostels. This was a poor choice. It wasn't in a good location either. It definitely put a damper on our stay in Florence, shaping our opinions of the city to rank as the lowest of all the places we visited in Italy. Take my advice, drop another 10 euro per night and stay elsewhere!", "Date": "Jul 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR567946866", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "KMPBuffalo"}, {"Content": "Didn't get the room!

And I arrived at Hotel Aline (hotel, it is not a hotel, you try to imagine where people slept during the war under the dominion of the nazis.In Spain it's called a campo de refugiados)Aline it's like that, first, the try to give you another room in another place instead of the one you reserved (you will have breakfast and free internet), but the room was so little that I cannot close the door because of the beed, and the ceyling was falling down to the bed because it's all old and disgusting, and through the window you only see the wall of the house above and nothing more.I say NO, i prefer to see the room I reserved, the breakfast was terrible and free internet it's not what I was looking for to see in Firenze where you can see beatiful things, not an old computer and a long line waiting for free internet.My room, UF UF UF it's nice if I don't have eyes, but if not....The room had a disgusting smell all day long, because when I arrived at night the smell was still there!!! But it was better than the liliput room, I can close the door. Where it is there is not receptions, it's the business man! they rent a place and put number on the doors and the sell it like it was a hotel! God!What a night! It was the room near the bathrooms and I had good luck I had something to punt inside mi ears, if not, it's terrible: all night long the pumping makes every 15 minutes BRUMMMMMMMMMM BRUMMMMMMMMMMMM BRUMMMMMMMMMM, very high and also, you can listen if the main door someone's openning. How can rent a room like that? It must be free to try to sleep there.The shared bathroms must be illegal because they were all brown and dirty, and sometimes without water. Oh! the water is finished, but I need to go to the toilets....It's Aline style.A lot of mosquitos inside the bathroom. It seems like India.Please, make a favour to you: DON'T GO THERE. The price is cheaper than another places because of all I have said. The owners only know to put the hand to get the money of us. A lot of advertisements arround Aline say that you cannot pay with visa and you have to pay a lot of time before you are leaving.What a silly and trick place. You can pay with Visa and at the corner there is a nice caff\u732b where you can drink a delicious capuccinno and good cornettos.", "Date": "Dec 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR899701537", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Manchuria"}, {"Content": "terrible place I booked this hotel through venere and checked the comments left on tripadvisor before, which seems all right.
