{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved this little gem! We, too, were recommended by Evelyn at Pensione Maria Luisa De' Medici. Thank goodness! We met Luca at check-in and became fast friends. He helped us so much during our 3 days in Florence. We stayed in Room #1 - fabulous!! The view was lovely. It's a clean, modern little hotel in a quiet building off the Via del Corso. There's a great little elevator to make life a little easier. Luca recommended several restaurants to us. One, was the most Italian of our meals. No one spoke English to us and it was great! I highly recommend this little hotel. It was only 95 Euro a night for the double, including a bathroom. Enjoy your stay and tell Luca we said Ciao!", "Date": "Oct 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR178901712", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "DivaCarol"}, {"Content": "highly recommended We're a young couple on a budget, so financially this was right up our street. We were then pleasantly surprised that it exceeded our expectations. The room was very spacious with a high ceiling and a large window with a great view (Room 3). The room had actually just been newly decorated...The staff were very helpful and friendly, giving us recommendations as to where to visit  eat (that weren't in the guide book). Breakfast is included; basic, but good enough for us.As it says in the title, highly recommended!", "Date": "May 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR204198916", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "davbb"}, {"Content": "Friendly basic hotel I originally tried to book with Pensione Maria Luisa de' Medici; however, they were already fully book 2 months in advance and referred me to this hotel. It's an economical hotel with private shower. Basic but clean. Staff were very friendly. Centrally located. Walking distance to almost all sight seeings. It's on a small side street so it could be difficult to find the first time. No A/C and TV in room. Temperture was ok in May but I think it'll be very hot in the summer. Since there's no A/C, I opened the windows for the first night and quite a lot of mosquitos got in. Noise level can be bad depends on your luck. It is actually a very very quite property but has very thin walls. Because of the property is so extremely quite, tiny noise becomes huge. Also without the A/C, street noise becomes loud if you open the window. With its central location and restaurants in the same blocks, people on the street can be loud.Another minor shortcoming is, there isn't much storage unit or shelving in the room nor bathroom. So be prepare to put your toiletry on the floor.Overall, it's a nice place to stay at its price. I particularly like their friendly staff. In-room amenities may be limited but feel free to ask the staff. They're very willing to help and lend you things, e.g. hair dryer. Just bring your ear plug if you're a light sleeper.", "Date": "May 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR122041882", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vjgoobee"}, {"Content": "Bravo per Luca   showReview(10715491, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR134170931", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JuanACoru_a"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d530004-r21000882-Ferdinando_II_dei_Medici-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "530004", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
