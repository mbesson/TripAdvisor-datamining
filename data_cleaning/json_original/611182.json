I set my reservations for 3/18/12-3/24/12, I spent almost $300. I requested to be on the bottom floor because I was vacationing with my 3 young children (including an infant) i also rented this hotel because of the small yard and pool/spa. the receptionist failed to tell me that there was going to be construction a door away from me. The noise was so loud that I couldn't even lay my 1 year old down for a nap. After the first day, they closed the pool for \"construction\" the receptionist said they were putting in a lift, but yet not a single worker had been out there. I had requested a different room repeatedly but never was able to get one. Finally the day before we were to leave, I was offered a different room and the pool was \"going to get cleaned\" after I told them I just wanted my money back for the remaining day. Overall, complimentary breakfast was good, wifi was good, room was decent, and the house cleaning ladies always made sure we had enough towels, (in case we went swimming) but the receptionist need a good class in hospitality.

This is an older hotel so we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting a resort atmosphere, and were pleased by the first impressions as we entered the lobby. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was modest but not ratty looking and the reception area was clean and smelled fresh. We had booked the reservation online so the check-in process was smooth. The front desk staff was very friendly, checked us in quickly, and answered all our questions. We requested a non-smoking room. With this being an older hotel, I was a bit leery about how the room would smell. Older hotels often just repaint or try to mask the stale smoke odor in the carpet, drapes, bedding and mattresses. So we get off the elevator to go to our room and instantly smell the tell-tell smell \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the floor we were on might not be a smoking floor now but it definitely used to be! But much to our surprise, our room smelled nice and fresh with no hint of stale smoke. I was very glad because I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I could have spent the night smelling stale cigarette odor. The carpet was a bit worn in a few places and there were some minor stains, but there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any rips or tears in it. Our room had plenty of lights on every wall and a couple in the ceiling, so there was plenty of bright light when we wanted it. When it came time to go to bed, the drapes kept out the light from outside. Our room faced the parking lot but the drapes were heavy enough to block out the streetlights and parking lot lights at night. The beds were very comfortable, nice and soft just the way I like them. I would have preferred to have more blankets, but didn't bother to ask for them. The sheets were a soft sateen material and the pillows were stuffed with a thick and fluffy down-like material. There were also plenty of pillows, three per bed. Free high-speed internet connection (either wireless or Ethernet) was available. The speed was actually quite fast. I was using a wireless connection and it never dropped the signal. There was a large desk with plenty of electrical outlets for plugging in a laptop and other accessories. The television had a great picture and nice selection of channels. It sat on top of a large dresser with plenty of drawers. The heat and air conditioning unit worked adequately. The built-in thermostat kept the room nice and cozy. The room itself was a bit cramped with two queen beds and all the other furniture, but was really that bothersome. The standard amenities were included such as a hairdryer, iron & ironing board, alarm clock, and coffee maker. I was glad to see they had included decaf coffee as well as regular. There was also a refrigerator and microwave in the room, which was convenient. The bathroom had a large mirror, a fair amount of counter space, nice clean toilet and shower. The tile on the floor was clean. The complimentary bar soap wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressive and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smell very good, and the small bottle of shampoo didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smell very good either. There were no complimentary bottles of conditioner or lotion. The massage-type shower head and was in excellent condition and the water pressure was fantastic. The water in the shower and sink area heated up quickly. There were plenty of fluffy towels and washrags available and they looked fairly new. There was extra toilet paper and facial tissue tucked away in a little compartment. The only major complaint I had about the bathroom area was the lack of an exhaust fan so the mirror fogged up from shower. This particular hotel is located right off a very busy expressway and we could hear the traffic noise if we turned off the AC unit, but the soothing white noise from the fan blocked out the street noise. We also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear any sounds from the guests on either side of us, and one of those rooms had 4 teenage boys in it! There were plenty of vending machines on each floor for sodas, water, or snacks \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the snacks were actually fresh. The ice machines were conveniently located and worked like a charm. The free breakfast was fabulous with a wide variety of food such as waffles, sausage, biscuits and gravy, fruit, 4 types of bagels, 2 choices of cereal, several different flavors of muffins, donuts and pastries, 2 kinds of juice, milk, and coffee. The breakfast area was very large and had a nice layout. It was also very well maintained and clean. I took a peek at the room service menu and the prices were surprisingly within \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd prices. The hotel also has a swimming pool, spa, and fitness center but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use them and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on their condition. I would recommend this location to anyone and would stay there again!", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York", "Title": "\u201cI will be coming back for sure\u201d", "Author": "Devlesa", "ReviewID": "UR97102751", "Content": "We had to travel on short notice to Dallas -- unfortunately to say goodbye to my grandmother who was dying. When we arrived there was a problem with our reservation (we had reserved a non-smoking king room). Turns out they were out of non-smoking king and because of breathing problems, the smoking rooms were not acceptable (they really smelled of smoke!). Given what was going on with my grandmother, I was pretty upset, but the young man working the desk took care of it quickly. We got bumped up to a HUGE suite, for the same rate as the king, for our entire stay. It was beautiful and really, though it sounds silly, it was nice to unwind in a pretty room after the stressful days with family.

When I made the reservation online I thought it would just be me so I reserved 1 king size bed. Well the stars were aligned and my 2 teenagers were able to come with me at the last minute. When we checked in and the desk clerk reminded me of my room selection I asked if there was any way I could get 2 beds. No problem. I had to pay $20 more but since I started at $55.00 that wasn't really a problem. I tried to do something similar at another hotel chain and they wouldn't do a thing because the reservation had made been online. This was the first La Quinta I had stayed at in a long time.

They did not have a business center, but they did have a computer for guests' use. The location was quite convenient and very accessible.
