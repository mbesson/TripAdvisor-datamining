The decor is ugly, to say the least. From the moment you walk in, you are met with posters of Venice taped to the wall, which has then been coloured in with a gold marker to give the illusion of a picture frame. You can enjoy this \"bella vista\" from one of 6 uncomfortable, ratty, dirty arm chairs in the lobby surrounded by a neon flashing bar sign to a bar that seems to never show up! The personnel at the desk are rude, unfriendly and above all unhelpful. Many nights there will be groups of school aged children, drinking, smoking weed until all hours, and the staff at the hotel simply shrug and say \"What can we do?\" The rooms are also disgusting!!!! Small, full of mould (I had to ask to move because the smell of mould and the dampness was over bearing, I could not sleep!) , the tap in the bathroom ran with brown water, the shower was uncleaned from previous guests and the windows did not close properly. They had also turned off the heat, and without adequate blankets, I remained cold all night. What is worse than the mouldy smelling room was the rat droppings that greeted my feet the next morning as I woke. Again, unhelpful staff shrugged it off and did nothing about it! I wish this review was all made up and untrue. Unfortunately it is not. This hotel should be shut down until renovations are made. It is a disgrace to the beautiful city of Venice and should not even get the one star I am giving it (i would give 0 if possible) Overall, I would NOT, I repeat NOT, reccommend this hotel to even my worst enemy - DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cSeedy Hotel\u201d", "Author": "TampaHappytraveler", "ReviewID": "UR126732489", "Content": "This hotel was a big disappointment.

The hotel is in an outstanding position in the centre of Venice, two minutes walk from the Salute Basilica, where there is a canal bus stop, only one stop to St Marks. 10 minutes walk to Academica bridge and minutes 5 to the Peggy Guggenheim. This hotel is clearly going through a major refurbishment from the roof down and they are making every effort to improve the quality of a visitors stay. The staff are very helpful and accommodating. The hotel was warm and all rooms were well heated. The rooms were clean and resident fairies did the daily clean and tidy. We had requested all en-suite rooms and this was what we received. Most rooms have stone floors but this is normal in this area of Europe. There was one room that was well below par (Room 6 has a big damp problem) and this room was instantly changed.Some of the rooms had fabulous canal-side views. Even an item lost by a member of the group was found and placed in the safe for collection.Beds were generally comfortable and the bedding was clean. Breakfast was full of excellent pastries, cakes and cereals with natural Yoghurt, cheeses and meats. There is a bar (closed on Mondays) and the bar man is very friendly. There is a light meals menu available for snacks but this hotel is very close restaurants and other eating establishments.

How wrong we were!! We arrived and the receptionist gave us our key to our room, up we went and walked into a very shabby room with four single beds, two of them pushed together and no ensuite. There was a bottle of wine in the room obviously the hotel staff hoping we would not notice the lack of bathroom but what we did notice was their lack of informing us of this fact! So down to reception we go to complain, the girl was very apologetic saying there had been a muddle up would we accept the wine and we can move rooms the next night, we said we're only here one night and no that's not good enough for what we paid. So she offers us dinner in the restaurant next door two courses each, starter and main and bottle of water. We went to check the menu as I didn't want a rubbish meal for my birthday and she saw us checking the menu outside the restaurant and we said yes that'll be fine. So off we went enjoying our visit in Venice and then eventually came to have our meal in the restaurant. We ordered and ate a delicious meal and when we came to pay we said who we were and the restaurant manager started shouting at us saying why did we not tell her as she would not have let us eat from their main menu and we would have had a substandard menu. We apologised saying we were not informed by the hotel of this and had we been, we would not have agreed to it. She stormed off to get the receptionist and they all came into the restaurant shouting and arguing with us saying it was our fault and we had to pay the difference. Standing our ground we did not and the poor restaurant manger eventually gave in but I assume the hotel manager would get a piece of her mind the next day. We got the impression this is a regular occurance. It ruined our evening and my birthday. We had a terrible nights sleep in the beds that we kept falling through. We complained in the morning to a very apologetic different receptionist but no sign of the hotel manager to complain to. However while on the phone to our booking agent every single person that came to reception had a complaint for one reason or another with their room.

This was not part of the booking terms and conditions (a 10% deposit had been taken) and I was suspicious because emailing card details is very risky so in the end I agreed to phone them with the card details.

The rooms were very dilapidated and in need of plastering, repainting and clearly had had no maintenance for a very long time. The hotel is a dump. A shame because it is a nice building in a lovely quiet location in Venice. The owners should be ashamed of themselves for let a beautiful building like this get in such a state.

I travelled with an aunt (late 50s) to Venezia for a short 2 nights stay over the Easter break. We booked the hotel on a recommendation from a travel agent in Rome a few days before as we figured it would be a better option than anything we'd hope to find on our own at such a late stage. Well a lesson learnt is a mistake less likely to be repeated. When we arrived our bookings were in order (the closest vaporetto stops are Salute or Zattere). The somewhat grumpy manager informed us that we had been upgraded to a room with an ensuite at no extra charge ~ note, we hadn't actually been informed that there were rooms with shared bathrooms. Anyway he then walked over to a door less than 5 steps from the reception area to a room which ideally would have better served as \"power nap\" room for staff on the late night shift or a maid's quarters by virtue of 1) the really close proximity to the reception desk and 2) the dilapidated state of the room making it a far cry from a room that any hotel manager keen to make money would never approve as a guest room. Where to begin...peeling paintwork, patches of exposed bricks in the wall, damp mouldy smell in every corner of the room, toilet without a toilet seat, shower doubling as a nest for \"fruit flies & mosquitos\", paper thin walls meaning we could hear guests arriving/leaving throughout the night & early morning as well as the night manager's music from his laptop...it was quite possibly the WORST hotel room ever.

We had booked a double room with ensuite. When we arrived, we were given the key to a large triple room, which was off a small corridor and had a bathroom adjacent. However, we weren't given another key to lock the outer door, so we essentially had a shared bathroom. After some discussion at the front desk, the lady conceded that she had indeed made a mistake and organised for someone to come and prepare the bathroom and supply us with the additional key. Unfortunately, whist we were waiting, another staff member barged into the room with a single bed and started rearranging furniture to accommodate it, before we could object. It seems that communication is not a priority in the hotel, and he was under the impression that we were to be joined by 2 others (strangers) in a 4 bed dorm room with a shared bathroom. Luckily this was quickly sorted and he left (not before putting a hole in the wall with the bed). The bathroom was cleaned and prepared nicely, and the extra key was given to us. We thought that was the end of our troubles. Sadly, when we arrived back that night, the hallway was toasty warm, the bathroom was a sauna, but the bedroom was freezing cold as the heater was broken. The friendly nighttime desk guy brought us up a portable heater, which solved that problem. Breakfast was a huge, delicious buffet, and after that first day/night we didn't have any other problems, and the reception staff seemed to cheer up (they must have been having a bad day) because they were extremely friendly and helpful after the first meeting. This review makes out that the hotel was terrible. It wasn't. For the price we got (an average of 33 Euros per night on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday), it was actually far more enjoyable than one might expect. The altercations were by no means a deal-breaker.

(sp?) We had a terrible time finding the place. The streets of Venice were completely bare (10pm) and many buildings were covered in graphitti with boarded up windows (by bus station). Luckily a man had pity on us and literally called the hotel and put us on the water taxi. After another long dark scary walk we found the hotel. I don't know about other months, but I would not recommend coming to Venice in January for starters and definitely do NOT stay at this hotel in January. Everything around the hotel is completely silent at night and very dangerous. My husband were just out at 10pm and there wasn't a single restaurant to be found without going all the way to San Marco Square. That's a long scary walk. I was told Venice was known for thieves and pick pocketing. I just witnessed it outside our window. We were sitting in our hotel room and we heard terrible screams. We flew open the windows and saw two girls running towards our hotel and a man dressed in black running in the other direction. They had obviously just been assaulted or stolen from. It was awful to watch. It's NOT safe here at night and by this hotel when no one is around. You'd be hard pressed to find a single soul on the streets here after dark. Stay close to San Marco in January or other off-season times!! Last night I slept with a tee shirt, long sleeve sweatshirt, my husband's fleece jacket and a hood, and long yoga pants. I was absolutely freezing! There is no way to turn on the heat in the room and the front desk just said there was no one on property after 11pm to turn it up?? I'm here right now and freezing my butt off! The breakfast is slim pickings. There were no coffee cups or meats left when we came down. I got sick of waiting for a coffee cup so I went into a room with no one in there and stole one from the bar area. We left and went to a cafe in San Marco. The staff, at night at least, is aloof, passive agressive and could care less about customer service. So save your breath! Be prepared to share a bathroom toilet- thank God it was clean, but definitely inconvenient. The blankets in the rooms were definitely dirty. My eyes at the moment are totally blood shot and watery from the dust on the blankets that were left in the closet. Or perhaps its from the cat that sleeps on the chairs outside the room- which I thought was charming b/c I love animals, but I am allergic to cats. The shower is so small, water not warm enough, towels smelled like a strange chemical, they only gave us one towel to share, the phone in the room didn't work, the door wouldn't shut properly, the glass on the desk was shattered and when I went to use it spilled all over into pieces on the floor.... If you are used to staying in hostels then this is the way to go. If you are not picky at all about dirty things, being comfortable, or nice service then this is the way to go. If you just want a place to lay your head inside so you aren't outside with the muggers then this is the way to go. It could be much worse than this place.....no bed bugs or anything (that I can see). This is not a place you stay for your romantic getaway, that is for SURE. The big thing is-----I'd rather stay closer to San Marco. It's too far to walk, especially at night in January. It's not safe.

I wouldn't recommend it to others because of a few key things that I think would bother other people more than us. Firstly, the hair dryer was broken and they didn't do anything about it, which was annoying because in January we were freezing with wet hair. Secondly and more seriously, our third floor room flooded on the first night and we had to avoid that part of the room which would have been okay but because our room only just fit the bed in it, it became an issue. The hotel seemed to be aware of it and there were stains on the carpet which suggested that it happens regulary. It really smelt too so the leak could have been from the loo or shower. When we told the hotel they said they would see what they could do and when we returned they had put a fan heater in front of the leak. That wasnt going to do much considering it was so wet you could see the water! There weren't many people staying in the hotel so it would have been easy to put us in another room but they didn't.

WE WOKE UP TO FIND A BAT IN OUR ROOM. The windows had been closed all night and we later discovered that the bat had come from the attic via a hole in our wall behind the shabby wardrobe. What made the whole ordeal even more shocking was that when we tried to explain to the staff on the front desk, they seemed completely unapologetic and not even surprised - I was so taken aback by their response that I presumed they could not understand the english word 'bat' so made a complete idiot out of myself by flapping my arms and doing a (not half bad) impression of the animal in question. When I realised that they had actually understood, I had been stood there explaining myself for at least ten minutes without a word from the clerk, and eventually found myself justifying telling them, saying 'I just thought I'd let you know', as if I was doing them a favour! Finally the only response we got was 'It is normal in Venice', and a muttering of 'stupido' to another customer.. I cannot comprehend that a bat in a hotel room, in any city, could be classed as 'normal'. When my partner also tried to complain at the desk he was faced with a difficult clerk who claimed not to understand any english; although of course we then overheard him giving detailed directions in fluent english a few hours later. I completely understand that hotels in Venice can overcharge and get away with it but even taking into account the good location of the hotel you couldn't pay me to go back there.

On the good side: reasonably priced room in a beautiful neighborhood on a side canal for 70 euros per night, very easy to find, not far from the Salute Vaporetto stop and one stop away from Piazzo San Marco, a decent size and relatively clean room with a private bath. Breakfast was included and consisted of croissant, rolls butter jams and jellies, cereal, yogurt, juice ham and salami ( though the self serve coffee/espresso machines made lousy instant watery tasting espresso's and cappucinnos.) On the bad side customer service was sketchy at best. In all fairness it was one of the female front desk workers in particular who was extremely short tempered and downright rude and gave erroneous information. On the day I had to leave I asked for some advice about the quickest way to the Piazzola Roma. I was told by her that if I took the Vaporetto #5 I would be there in 10 minutes but if I took the Vaporetto # 1 down the Grand Canal it would take an hour. After asking around and even walking to the water taxi stop she suggested, I learned that not only would it have taken me almost 20 minutes to walk to the stop (as opposed to the under 5 minute walk to the Salute stop on the Grand Canal) but also that the Vaporetto on Line 5 only came every 20-25 minutes. I also had alot of trouble with getting WIFI, and after few frustrating hours finally got it sorted it out but the same front desk woman previously mentioned was clearly annoyed at me for coming back for help and visibly angry at having to deal with the problem. After a very uncomfortable interlude during which she got on the phone and literally screamed at the person who had signed me up for the internet that afternoon, I finally got a signal, but when I went to my room I found that the signal would only be recieved if I stayed in one corner of the room right near the door, so I couldn't even sit on the bed and use it. The phone in the room was also problematic. While I understood I could not make outgoing calls, I had been told that the phone would receive incoming calls. Unfortunately this turned out not to be true or the phone in my room was not working properly. When a friend called me at a pre arranged time the phone rang but when I answered the line was dead. After 4 trys it became clear I would be unable to recieve the call. Also there was no pay phone in the hotel. All in all if your looking for a reasonably price hotel in a cute and very quiet neighborhood but are not worried about customer service, easy WIFI connection, or access to a phone, then I would recomend the hotel, but if customer service, WIFI and access to a phone will have an effect on your experience, then it may be best to look elsewhere.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chalfont, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "Carolkeo", "ReviewID": "UR87510814", "Content": "Our room was comfortable, painted a pretty shade of blue, with a Venetian glass chandalier over the bed.

Unfortunately when we opened the door to our hotel room, I wanted to run out screaming and crying. It's about the size of a 10 foot by 10 foot room and totally cramped with unneeded furnuture. We had our bed there but also was a desk and armoir that should be removed from the room. We had no room for our backpacks or even unload our clothes for the 3 nights we stayed there. The room had a sink and a mirror. Also to my surprise, our room had no private bathroom. The bathroom is shared with others in the hotel including the shower/bathroom. It wasn't a big deal but the toilets and bathrooms were dirty and smelly. Our bed was not comfortable at all and I had the worst sleep during my stay there. The bed sank but at least they provided clean sheets and towels. The carpet leaves much to be desired and I didn't dare walk barefoot in the room or bathrooms. Also, when your neighbor uses the bathroom or opens and closes their door, it is very very loud! Do not stay here expecting to get good sleep. The only two good things about this place is that the staff was friendly and helpful and it's located in the perfect place to get around Venice quickly. It's close to the Salute water taxi and nearby places to eat. They provide breakfast for 8 Euro but you can find better places to eat for less nearby because it's so close to many nice cafes and restaurants. They also have a computer in the front lobby but no free internet access. You must sign up for internet through their computer. We paid about 2 Euros an hour to use it. I can't imagine how much they charge during peak season for this slum but we paid too much for such a lousy room stay. Please, if you are worried, ask to see the room first before you decide to stay here.

The hotel was in a very good position - easy to reach by ferry from Troncheto - Venices long stay parking garage and also within easy walking distance of all the major sights - although NOT five minutes from St Mark's square as described on the printout from the hotel. The hotel is described as a 'beautiful sixteenth century building' The building may well have been sixteenth century but there was little or no evidence of this in the interior.

Unfortunately the curtains were hanging off their rails, there were mosquitos and evidence of squashed ones as well - three bulbs needed to be replaced, the leg was falling of my bedside table. The room was very very shabby.

The walls of our room were cracked, the bed was ROCK HARD, and we were covered in bed bug bites after spending two nights there. Everything in the room was soggy and damp.

I travelled to Venice with my friend for a 3 day break and booked last minute - we had no idea what to expect, but to say that we landed on our feet would be an understatement. The hotel was easy to get to from Piazzale Roma (just 30 mins on the Water Bus Linea 1) and very easy to find from the directions on the hotel website. The staff were friendly, and the Reception area is charming. I could not rate the location of this hotel more highly - it is just a 60 second boat ride to Piazza San Marco, two minutes walk from the Guggenheim, and you can get to Campo Santa Stefano in about 10 minutes. We found the residential location to be perfect - though there aren't bars literally on the doorstep, you are only a short wander from great restaurants and its on these little ambles that you get to see the most charming side of Venice. Though we only booked a double room with shared bathroom, we were offered a room with a private bathroom which was a real bonus. The room may be fairly basic (double bed, wardrobe, bedside table), but when you are in the world's most beautiful city this is really all you need - a place to crash. Breakfast was great; the usual croissants, cereal, yoghurt, hot drinks, juice and continental cheese and meats. Venice is completely different at night to during the day, and we spent two nights wandering Venice until very late. When we got back to the hotel the door was locked (I think that my friend and I are the guilty culprits featured in another review) but the genteleman on duty let us in when we knocked, and was very polite about the whole thing.

What a mistake. Let's begin with the location. The hotel is in a very residential area, about a five-minute walk from the Guggenheim and a ten-minute walk from the Galleria dell'Accademia, but don't let that lead you to believe that there is anything else in this area. It is extremely residential and is home to perhaps two restaurants and a few insignificant art galleries at most. If you are concerned about noise, don't be. It's almost eerily silent at night. Now moving on to reception. We arrived late in the evening for check-in and were handed our keys, told that breakfast would be in the courtyard garden from 8:00 to 9:30a.m., and led to our rooms. All normal for a hotel check-in. As we were about to walk up the staircase in the lobby to find our rooms we were stopped and told that our rooms were in a different part of the hotel. Alright, maybe there was another staircase. We followed the manager to the back of the hotel via a labyrinth of rooms with crushed marble floors and full cheap tables and chairs until we reached an old, run-down staircase through a door frame. Up the staircase we went. The lovely man then showed us our rooms. What a disappointment. The first thing we noticed was the smell; whether it was musty or something else I can't say. While they were large and definitely able to sleep the four people that were planning on staying in each, they were by no means acceptable as hostel rooms, let alone as hotel rooms. One had the luxury of having a carpet - the other did not. There were three beds in each room: two twins and a king. The king beds had extremely firm mattresses, but were comfortable enough, even with the pathetically thin and hard pillows. The twins, while likely more comfortable, were nothing more than glorified cots. There was not a headboard, a bedskirt, or a comforter to be seen; however, there were about 10 randomly selected blankets in the awkwardly placed armoire should we have needed one. The bathrooms were small and cramped. Only one had a shower curtain, but given the amount of mildew on it, we could have gone without. The shower head was broken but feasibly usable, but the hole in the hose sprayed water across the room and soaked the floor. There wasn't much of a view from the room, but no complaints there; that's not what we were paying for. The only difficulty with the windows was that they opened onto such a narrow alleyway that there was no possibility for a breeze, which in the summer months in a room with no air conditioning or fan was a slight problem. One of the two rooms did have a standing fan in the center of the room, which I assume made a decent difference in the air circulation. Breakfast in the morning was decent: plain croissants, croissants filled with marmalade, dinner rolls, proscuitto cotto, salami, cheese, yogurt, cereal and various condiments. The ham and cheese had clearly been sitting out for a while and were sweating in the heat, but they were still fine to eat. As far as beverages are concerned, there were four drink machines, one dedicated to water and orange juice and three others to coffee, hot chocolate and other hot water for tea (among other hot beverages). I was actually impressed by the quality of these drinks, and would strongly recommend trying the hot chocolate. Apart from that, the breakfast was a nice touch, but nothing special. And while the hotel advertises it, there was no fruit at breakfast. Not that important to me, but if you're looking for it, you're not going to find it. Perhaps the most interesting quality of this hotel is that it locks it's front doors at night so that you cannot enter or exit the hotel. A couple trying to catch an early train was stuck inside for ten minutes banging on the door and trying to get out while a group of people were stuck outside trying to get in in the wee hours of the morning, and the front desk was unmanned because the night manager had decided to go to sleep. Not only was this inconvenient, it was a fire hazard. While I'm sure some of the rooms must look like the ones pictured on the website, keep in mind that the majority of them look like cheap hostels or degraded dorm rooms. Know that for which you are paying before you get here. As a place to crash, it's more than fine, but if you're looking for a decent hotel, this one doesn't have much to offer.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cCheap and not so cheerful but did the job\u201d", "Author": "emzi1981", "ReviewID": "UR68267984", "Content": "I booked 4 nights at the Hotel Alla Salute via Last minute.com and got a bargain at \u00c2\u00a3330 for the 4 nights inc breakfast.

We had not been told when checking in or leaving to go out for the night that the main door locks at any time. After knocking pretty loudly and no response, my husband had to climb their ivy fence (which is their restaurant patio next to the front door) and luckily the sliding door that connects the restaurant to the lobby was open. He found the night guard snoring in a chair at the lobby. We literally knocked loudly and shouted HELLO for at least 5 minutes, so I am not sure how he did not wake up. So, the guard had to unlock the door for me as it was locked from the inside as well. And was still hesitant to unlock it for me even though I had our room key in my hand and my husband was standing right there! If it werent for my husband climbing the fence, we would been stranded outside.

Definitely some sort of bed bugs. Every time we approached the staff with a question or concern we were either ignored or dismissed rudely. On top of all that, they would not let us check out the night before our 8 am flight, so we had to wake up an hour early to check out around 5am. A little side note- the staff members who work behind the front desk from 10pm to 8am speak no english, and are incredibly rude. Da Cici is an awful awful place.

Admittedly we booked just before Easter and had limited options, in my defense I thought I had checked each option out carefully. From the exclusion list one had no reviews and there was this one with good reviews on the booking site and mixed on Trip advisor. First the positive, very good position, well it was for us anyway, close enough without being in the midst of the madness, if you are not a reasonable walker then it would be too far out of the way although it is quite close to a vaporetto (waterbus stop). Also no matter which way you arrive it is not walkable with luggage.. Secondly, it came with ensuite which we had not expected as we thought we were booking the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room with shared bathroom. The internet access is in the lobby, and is free and Wifi. There is a hardwired computer for general use which is almost always occupied. Thirdly the bed, which is important was very comfortable, the room was very clean and beautifully decorated. The negative- like others have mentioned and I should have taken more notice, but I thought we were OK because we had the shared bathroom, so were booked in the main hotel. When we arrived (which was late at night) we were shown our room in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of the hotel which barely fitted the double bed and told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the hotel is full, we may give you another room tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When we asked the next day this was obviously not going to happen because we had already been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgraded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The other negatives, there were no Tea and coffee making facilities, no TV (which did not bother us but may upset some); the towel heaters did not work properly so our towels were constantly damp. The hot water was just ok and sometimes just tepid. There was no room to put your suitcases except on the floor beside the bed and then no way to get round except to step over them, luckily we did not have lots of luggage, this room is not workable with more than 2 suitcases or for the elderly or disabled. The breakfast was OK for the 1st 2 days \u00e2\u20ac\u201cat least the rolls were fresh, the following days they had obviously been frozen and defrosted (they were still frozen on the 4th day), now I understand that this probably has something to do with it being Easter, but maybe an apology, explanation would make it a little more palatable? I heard someone in the lobby ask about the lack of TV and they were told by the concierge that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we prefer to read\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well so do I but preferably in a chair and possibly with a cup of coffee to sip. It would be impossible to read in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guest lounge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which is the lobby, as there were always people coming and going and the reception staff talking to each other about bookings, on the phone etc. Just a suggestion which would cost little- if anything, as this hotel obviously caters to the budget tourist, a little more tour information would help, I had been to Venice before so knew where to go to get this information but most of the tour information is not a short walk away, maybe a few brochures may help, although they do have a map.

Very basic when compared to breakfasts at other European hotels I have stayed in. But, the price was 112 Eur. a night, which seems pretty good for Venice. The location is terrific; steps from the Guggenheim museum and Salute church; very quiet neighborhood with \"good\" art and jewelry stores - and two good restaurants around the corner near Guggenheim - rather that the normal touristy schlock stores.... The walk to St. Marks is more than \"5 - 10 minutes\", as suggested by one person - more like 15 - 20 - unless you take the Traghetto (shuttle boat gondola) at a stop 2 minutes from the hotel that puts you very close to St. Mark's square. cost of a traghetto is only 1/2 of a Euro; well worth the price and the experience (but the traghetto stops running at about 7:00 p.m. apparently; so you must walk to and across the Accademia Bridge later in the night.

What an amazing city, we struggled with our rucksacks through the crowds to get the our hotel. I though we would struggle to find it but we didnt, the sun was beating down and it was a great feeling to walk into a nice clean cool reception. The receptionist was fairly friendly and took us to our rooms. We were led out of the main hotel, through a courtyard to the new section of the hotel, so far I was impressed for a 2 star hotel. ROOM She opened the door to let us in, by this point I was still happy with the hotel. After squeezing into our room I was shocked to say the least, I have never had such a small room before, when she closed the door behind us it really did feel as if we were in a cupboard. It was the middle of the day yet we had to have all the lights on as the \"View\" was a brick wall which was only a couple of inches away from the windows so it allowed absolutely no light in. After throwing down my rucksack and starting to unpack, my girlfriend commented that there was no TV. Now I know what your thinking, your in Venice, why do you want a TV? But its just I've never stayed in a hotel that didnt have a TV. Its always nice after a long day of walking, seeing the sights, to put the TV on and have a glass of wine while getting ready for the evening. So it did feel a little quiet without one. To be fair though, the room was very clean and the bathroom, again incredibly tiny, was lovely and the shower was probably the most satisfying in any hotel i've stayed in, loads of water pressure and room to move! FOOD To say the breakfast is basic is an understatement. You get a pot of coffee, which was lovely, and a basket of bread. And thats your lot, you cant have more. It did the job and the bread was generally nice, but if you want anything other than bread and jam then your gonna be dissapointed. LOCATION Its in a very quiet part of venice, very much south of the island, and is a good walk away from the main sights, probably 15-20 minutes. While Venice is fairly safe, it does feel a little unsettling to be getting back to your hotel with deserted streets around you. Probably not ideal for sole female visitors, although as I say Venic is fairly safe. OVERALL We paid \u00c2\u00a3100 a night and I thought that was very overpriced, although you are in walking distance from most of the main sights so thats why you pay the price. The rooms were actually pretty good other than being incredibly tiny and having the worst view you could imagine, almost no point in them putting windows there! If your looking for a quiet hotel at night, a basic room for a moderate price for Venice and basic breakfast then maybe this is for you, but I would reccomend trying to get somewhere more central of the city.
