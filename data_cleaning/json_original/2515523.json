Located a half block off the strip on a side street, the location was okay and it appeared to be a newer facility. We'd never been to a timeshare and thought the room would be a grade above a typical hotel room. Not our first choice, but we thought we'll rack up the Marriott points for the few hours we were there and move along. Mistake. The basic king room itself was clean and generous size, equipped with a microwave and refrigerator, seating area and breakfast table. Bath had a nice vanity and good lighting, lots of thick towels. HOWEVER, the king size bed was hard as a rock, the AC was loud and the walls were paper thin. I went up to the rooftop pool to relax after a long flight, and found the \"pool\" - 3 feet deep and approximately 10' x 10'. Crazy small, barely large enough for 10 people to stand in without touching. No laps here. The deck itself was wall to wall people drinking at a bar in the corner - a sidewalk atmosphere. NOT at all what I was expecting. In the morning, I was awakened at 7am when the bed shook several times as the door to the next room slammed. I could hear loud voices talking as if they were in my bathroom. A call to the front desk resulted in quiet 10 minutes later. When checking out I asked what the commotion was, I was told it was housekeeping in the next room. TOTALLY unacceptable. No apology, no offer to award extra points. When I walked outside to leave the property, I stood in the self serve (no doorman) taxi line for 20 minutes as cabs drove by within sight. The hotel driveway is accessed by an alley off a side street and apparently there is no taxi light to alert passing cabs. I was ready to walk the block and half to the strip and hail a cab on the corner myself when finally a cab appeared to discharge passengers. The entire stay was very frustrating.

(A 2 bedroom villa is basically a one bedroom connected to a one bedroom suite.) The place is nicely appointed, with tasteful decor throughout. The rooftop pool has some nice views, and a bar area for those so inclined. It's cheaper than the comparable MGM Signature (which doesn't come with kitchens, AFAIK). That said, there's several massive flaws in the design of the place that knocked it down from a 5-star to a 3-star property: 1) The place is a timeshare hotel, and the Marriott staff will hound you relentlessly about buying a timeshare, even if you're just there on a business trip, using it as a normal hotel. They'll pretend to be calling about something else, too, which is unusually deceptive for a company like Marriott. 2) The road access is terrible. There's a little driveway that gets completely clogged by cars and taxis, and people will cross into opposing traffic to get around the clogs, and then THEY get stuck, and then traffic backs up onto the street, and it's just a total nightmare. It can take 10-15 minutes from getting in your cab to getting onto the main street. Which is a distance of like 30 yards, total. 3) The front desk staff were surprisingly rude and unhelpful. (Again, very unusual for a Marriott.) They'd look at you and just ignore you, even after you'd been standing there trying to get their attention for 15 minutes - and it's not like there was a line or anything. 4) You might have to call for linens three or four times before they bring more towels up. And you need towels because they don't change them, apparently, even if they're all on the ground. 5) The kitchens don't vent. Cook anything in your room, and you'll be smelling it for the rest of your trip. This sounds sort of whiny in retrospect, but I stand by them all. I'm a pretty easygoing traveler (I spend a lot of time on the road for business trips like this), and it takes a lot to annoy me at a place, but these guys managed it.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place in the Heart of the Las Vegas Strip\u201d", "Author": "toteach", "ReviewID": "UR128482151", "Content": "This hotel is so close to the strip, it is practically on the strip!

Complimentary wifi which is a huge savings when other hotels charge a ridiculous fee per device. Kitchenette in studio room was great, with fridge, micro, and toaster. All dishes and cutlery provided. Hotel secure after 6:30 - you have to use room key to access floor. Valet parking only. A little slow at times but nothing crazy. Always can get cabs easily. However, you can walk everywhere easily because you are in a great location. The only negative is the pool. When people say it is tiny, that is an understatement. A hotel this size should have something much bigger. It was probably smaller than most backyard pools - no word of a lie.

We had a fantastic time! We initially were placed on the 7th floor, which direclt overlooked the parking lot. We asked to switch and they gave us the same location a few floors higher. Now I don't usually do this, but since we would be there for 7 days, I really wanted a better view. So we returned to the front desk for the 3rd time. The staff were very gracious and, after checking with their manager, they gave us the 23rd floor. It was FABULOUS and worth the effort. The 50-yard-line location could not be better for us. Straight ahead, our street dead ended into the City Center, which was new to us and quite beautiful. Right across the side street from us was Planet Hollywood, their side door into the miracle mile was a great access to restaurants and shops. There was one young lady, CeeCee, on their concierge staff that was THE BEST! True to our request, she gave us great tips, for off-the-strip smaller, not so glitzy places to eat. (IE: Ellis Island - 2 blocks behind the Chateau (walkable) had great BBQ, although you have to be 21 to eat....which I still don't understand). Also - FAR less expensive prime rib meals at the Orleans (must drive to get there). We also found Fitgeralds down on Fremont had a great steak lunch that included their large salad bar for about $12; and 4 Queens (also on Fremont Street), upstairs cafe had a wonderful Hawaiian steak with rice and eggs (sounds odd, but it was really good) for about $10. We were a little worried about not being able to call ahead for your car, but the valet staff proved us wrong! We never waited more than 5-7 minutes, even with the huge crowds. By the time I would stop & talk to the concierge, the car would be delivered to my husband. They were very efficient and ready with directions. The pool on the 38th floors was nice although quite small. It was fine for hubby & I to go up in the mornings and soak in the hot tub, but as the kids showed up later in the day, it became quite crowded.

I was in Tower 1 and read that this is the \"renovated\" rooms? I had a one bedroom and it was wonderful. Love the deep tub (no jets but fine). There is a rooftop bar with small pool and jacuzzi - did not use because a bit chilly during my stay. I'll say on hot day the max that can be in the pool is around 15 NO swimming just dipping and maybe floating if less than 8 in pool. Great view and bar staff friendly. Store in Lobby (believe it's 24hr) and you may print your boarding pass in the lobby and rooms have free wi-fi. Glad this hotel does not have a casino. Walk in through lobby and at elevator in less than 5 minutes. At night there is usually someone checking guests ID-card key. You need after 6PM to operate elevator. Always felt safe. My sister at Mirage it takes about 20 minutes or more to get through casino to elevator to room. Shuttle from airport was $7.00 and it took about 20 minutes - cab back was $15.00. There is a Shuttle that takes you to Albertson Supermarket (runs certain days last shuttle around 10 am?) then the shuttle runs down to Fashion Mall across from the Wynn the last at 6:30 PM. One evening raining and I and a few other guest were going to the LeReve show at the Wynn and the driver was kind enough to drop us directly at the Wynn. Excellent Show - no bad seat since theatre is round. Take you own snacks water is $5.00 small popcorn is $6.50. Across a Blvd you can walk directly into Miracle Mile Shops that is part of Planet Hollywood. There is an ABC shop inside to purchase inexpensive beer/wine/champagne and other snack and basic food items. There are many shops. restaurants, bars and even a theatre inside Miracle Mile Shops. You can also walk through to Las Vegas Blvd put near Paris that you can walk through to Bally. Down the street - two NY City blocks is the Harley Davis Restaurant and across the Blvd (via walkway) is City Center, Aria and Cosmopolitan. Nearby (Marketplace) is a Discount ticket seller - \"Tkts 4 Half\", most are generally seating but you may pay a little more for assigned? Go early if you want to see a specific show - there is another booth near MGM by the M&M store/large Coke bottle. If you are into Spas and want to have a Spa Day then I recommend Qua Spa at Ceasar's Palace. You can pay to be there for the day or if you have a treatment you can spend the day there - leave and come back. They have everything - steam, sauna, arctic room, jacuzzi, hot & cold baths, warm stone lounge, etc. Robes, slippers and lockers, snacks, drinks and all you need to get ready - toothbrush/paste, flat iron, dryer, curler and hair/body products... yes, I had a wonderful time. Look for monthly specials. Must try Wynn the next visit. Also nearby is \"Kraze\" that I believe have various show since the people on line varied and sometime very young people.

Spacious, very comfortable and with all the self contained amenities you need - from washing machine with dryer, to dishwasher, very efficient oven and pretty much all the utensils and crockery. Two free packets of coffee with the filters, so good to go. And of course free wifi A few grumbles - the walls are on the thin side so weekends can be a bit noisy. The towels were a little bit less plush than what we expected from a Marriott, and a few front desk staff who were big on \"HI, HOW ARE YOUuuuuu\" and smaller on actually being helpful. But check in and check out is seamless. Just what you need in Vegas. Note to those who rent cars. The car rental companies have a policy of pre-charging you for a full tank and asking you to drop it off empty.

We arrived at the hotel, and at first it was a little hard to find, just because it is tucked between some really tall buildings. Then when you see it, you find yourself saying \"how did I miss that\". It's a huge building, and located between the MGM Grand and Planet Hollywood about 1 block east of the strip. This location is truly ideal, and though it is slightly off the strip, you will probably end up walking less here than a place on the strip. For instance I also stayed at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay and Aria, and had to walk much less to get to where I was going at the Marriott simply because I didn't have to walk through a huge casino and navigate around the cars pulling into the mega hotels. Check-in was a breeze, even at 9:30 in the morning. We pulled up and were in our room in about 5 minutes. It was a very smooth process. Parking was also really nice, and offered another advantage over the mega casino resorts. Valet at the Marriott ran less than 5 minutes consistently, however at the Aria it was over 20 minutes, not to mention it was farther to the Aria valet from our room at the Aria than from our Marriott room to the bus stop on the strip. The rooms are also really nice. We had a 1 bedroom which had a full kitchen, washer and dryer (small apartment size), and very nice washroom. The kitchen is a nice touch, and if you don't mind cooking you can really save yourself some serious money in food. I must mention the negative of small t.v.'s. This is a running theme at all of their resorts, and for the small price I just can't figure out why their rooms do not offer a large screen t.v. The staff was very nice and helpful as well. There was one valet and one market employee whom I found less than chipper, but for the most part they were all great. I will say this place has a different vibe than the Mega Casino resorts. It does not have the wild, hip feel of the Aria, Mandalay Bay, etc. This was just find for us. No drunk or loud people at the resort offered a nice break from the activity of the strip.

We didn't use our International Interval Getaway but had to pay outright because we couldn't get a Getaway for the 2 bedroom villa ( one king bedroom on each side of the living/ kitchen area with own bath) that we needed in that particular week. It hurt to have to pay $1000 instead of the Getaway price. WE are very glad that we stayed in this hotel because we did not have to pay a resort fee ( as many hotels in Vegas are charging that fee now) and the location was very good for walking to major hotels on the strip. The Mile Mall Shops and restaurants were right across the street. THe beds were very comfy, the kitchen was spotless, and the noise level wasn't bad at all, considering that we were facing the airport side and occasionally heard a jet take off, even on the 24th floor. If we ever stayed there again, I would opt for the Planet Hollywood side of the hotel. The roof swimming area was okay, but small, and of course it was a little chilly to swim, but they did have those big heater stands up there. The pool was suppose to be heated, but we didn't feel it. However, we did enjoy the view from up there and we all sat at the bar for a terrific pina colada and some beers. The Bartender, (Nice, was her name,) was very informative and enjoyable. There is a shuttle from the hotel to the Fashion Show Mall most days and from Sat-Tuesday there is a shuttle to the grocery store because you have a full kitchen in many units . WE just gave the driver a small tip. Taxis are expensive in Vegas, so opt for the cheap bus that runs on the strip anytime you can. THe only complaint was the bell desk was not as helpful as they could have been for my stepson and future wife. THey had many bags and no one offered from the Bell Desk to help them. THey had to grab their own luggage dollie, load it, and push it up the room. THe Bell Desk just gave them a look and said\"Be sure to bring that right back!\" When they complained later to the management, they apologized and gave a $50 credit to the room to spend in the market near the lobby. THat was nice. My husband and I had no problem and they immediately brought our luggage up when our room was ready after a short wait. THey actually let us in the room long before official check-in time. Everyone else was terrific during our stay. THe timeshare people didn't hound us and just called once to offer a 90 minute program, but since we were already in Int. Interval, maybe they backed off a little. That was fine with us. Housekeeping service was good and no complaints. Towels were replenished each day as needed, garbage emptied, and kitchen was straightened up. I'm sure if you want a noisier hotel, this isn't the place for you, but we enjoyed the quiet after being out in the hustle and bustle after returning to our \"home away\". Don't forget that we were paying outright for the room and maybe timeshare guests wouldn't get that same service each day.

The pluses are the posh accommodations, the nearby Planet Hollywood for restaurants, a casino, and shopping at the Miracle Mile. The minuses, no restaurants within the hotel itself. That's it..really, that is the only downside. As mentioned, casinos, restaurants are just short walk away. There is a 24-hour convenience store in the lobby for essentials. The Miracle Mile store across the street has an ABC convenience store which is just a tiny bit less expensive, and the hotel provides a shuttle daily to a local grocery store.

Our concerns were completely unfounded. It's a very easy walk to the Strip, even in the December chill. You can either cross the street to the Planet Hollywood mall right outside the front door, or it's an easy half-block walk to the Strip up Harmon Ave. And honestly, it's nice to have an escape from the Vegas crowd at times.

Our room was very well-equipped with plenty of dish soap, dishwasher detergent, and laundry soap.

The kitchette had proper cutlery, glasses, crockery, toaster, microwave, decent coffee maker. Complimentary coffee provided to get us through the first morning. The bathroom was huge.

We did a price check because we were self catering but couldn't bring food with us - shopped at Albertsons, which is a bus ride away. Out of interest bread and milk was only about 50c difference in price to Albertson. Even though fruit, cheese, ham, cereal and other items are way more expensive on The Strip than Albertsons. The Marriott market right in the lobby wasn't much more expensive than CVS or Walgreens down the strip for the items we checked.

Anyway, across the road, there's a whole big mall out there, the Miracle Mile with it's shops and restaurants. leaving at the end of our stay was a a simple affair, I washed most of my clothes in the suite, dried and ironed them, nice and tidy, neat luggage for the security at the airport to rummage through. The lobby has a service to offer guests that want to check in and print their boarding passes, free!!! I forgot to mention this, that there is an available taxi service outside the lobby, and one can be arranged for you. Now, how can I fault the Grand Chateau? Well, the outside bar for 1, but it is a holiday resort, no breakfast bar/reastaurant, If that is a fault then they are guilty, but you be the judge of that. How can I default this place? It's perfect, I think. The lifts/elevators work, the rooms are huge and spacious, air conditioned, tv's in sitting room and bedroom, huge comfortable beds, clean sheets, clean everything. They even have shopping trips if you are tired of getting robbed at the local convenience store. Check those out. Except for 1 thing. The couch/settee/sofa did not have a throw on it. In terms of hygiene, I would bring one with me next time, you never what you're sitting on. And you can wash it before you leave anyway. So as a tip, bring one huge light cotton throw(a beach towel even) for the settee/couch sofa or what ever. You will love this place for what it has to offer and for the conveinence it dispenses to you. We differ on this, my wife and me, She would stay here again, wild horses wouldn't drag back to an hotel again everrrrr, however, as for me, I most certainly would go to a Mariotts hotel first and only come here as a 2nd choice, but hey thats me. As we, well, I guess we are going to be back here real soon. We came her at the beginning of November fo one week and left on the 10th November.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cA great location\u201d", "Author": "Feds294201", "ReviewID": "UR120940119", "Content": "We exchanged our timeshare for a 2 bedroom, sleeps 8 condo at the Grand Chateau.

On the other hand, the location is excellent; we walked to many of the large hotels from there and the Miracle Mile Shopping Mall is across the street. Valet parking was very convenient.

The minus - the walls were thin, and when they had the weekend party at the pool at Planet Hollywood you can definitely hear them despite the insulated windows. For some reason our bed was extremely hard. I think it was a memory foam mattress and I can't seem to make a dent to it. So I kept waking up with sore shoulders.

What a great pick! The hotel was centrally located, just a half block off the Las Vegas Strip, within walking distance of everything we came to Las Vegas to see. We booked two suites, each identical. Each suite had a separate living room with eating area, kitchen, bedroom, and bath. The baths were luxuriously appointed, with dual showers, spacious sink area, and beautiful stone tiling throughout. The bedroom had a large garden tub and a second spacious sink area. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was exceptionally well appointed with dishes, glassware, cooking equipment, and silverware. I say exceptional because one of the kitchen drawers was equipped with every kitchen gadget you'd have at home and all the appliances were full size, not mini versions that are found at many properties. The coffee maker came with enough coffee and filters to last until one could get to the market to buy more. And speaking of market, there was a small market in the lobby from which we purchased supplies daily. It was simply too convenient to make an effort to travel out to a grocery. The prices were what one would expect in a market inside a hotel, but we never failed to find everything we wanted in that market, from snacks and refrigerated breakfast items, to staples like milk, bread, and sugar. There were six very fast elevators and even after a week, we never had to wait for an elevator. There was a small pool on the rooftop which we didn't use, but it looked inviting and the Jacuzzi beside it was a good size and well maintained. The pool area sported a hosted bar and had great views of the Las Vegas strip. Other than the physical facilities, which were superb, the employees were the best I've ever encountered, and that compliment is not offered lightly. The check-in was effortless and the front desk staff never rushed us when we were asking for directions or suggestions. They were simply some of the most pleasant employees I've ever dealt with. The hotel offers free valet parking; self parking is not available. The valets were efficient and delivered our car within a very few minutes in every case. They were as friendly as the front desk staff and were helpful on several occasions in giving us directions. Anything I didn't like? Well, only one. All the lights in the suites had been changed out to the new compact florescent light bulbs and they did not produce much light. When first turned on, they were very dim, but over time got brighter, a mild aggravation. This was simply one of the most pleasant and beautiful places we've stayed.

On things others have commented on; the pool is on the 38th floor (roof) and although small is I would have thought adequate, ok it's not the Mandalay Bay beaches and all that, but what do you expect on the roof! There is a small bar and a sitting area and the views across the strip skyline night and day must surely compensate in some way. The hotel is on Harmon Ave but the access is a turn off, but it's very simple to find just turn at the lights at the entrance to Planet Hollywood. And something to remember the hotel only has valet parking which was not a problem as the valets were helpful and quick, just allow 5-10 minutes and your car arrives at the main entrance.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat place and location\u201d", "Author": "goodone26", "ReviewID": "UR119311692", "Content": "Am late in reviewing but wanted to say my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.

Location is excellent being just a block away from the strip making its location quiet, but within a 5 min walk to strip, City Center, or Planet Hollywood. Front desk, valet, and bell hop service were excellent (nice touch for them to remember our names even when we were just passing by). Hotel was generally in great shape, however, our room's furniture had a lot of dings and the hall carpets were in need of a good shampoo/cleaning. Still better than some of the more upscale Vegas hotels we've stayed in the last few years. Having a full kitchen was extremely convenient as we elected to have breakfast in twice. While we elected to rent a car and were able to pick up our supplies as needed, the Grand Chateau offers door to door service to local Albertson's on designated days. It also has a small shop off the lobby which has a good variety of general items, however, it is a bit pricey but convenient. Main positive point is that we were able to get a 2 bedroom suite (1 bedroom suite with adjoining deluxe room) for less than the regular price of a deluxe room at the 5 star hotels we generally stay while in Vegas. Great to be able to share space with our friends while still being able to have privacy when needed. Also, used the in-suite washer/dryer which was a real help in not having to pack extra clothes. All in all we jhad a wonderful stay with only had 2 complaints - the pool is 12x12 at the most and lacks any real use for swimming. Located on roof which offers a nice view but little else. Secondly, housekeeping really not up to standard. We slept late every day and notified housekeeping of our leaving (you call if you want your room cleaned after 3:30 pm). Three of our 7 days our room was not cleaned. Twice our room was cleaned but no wash clothes left. The value is excellent and we highly recommend to anyone who enjoys being close to the action but enjoys the quiet.

Although the focus here is obviously on selling time share rentals the property is available for nightly rentals on an availability basis. Being in town on a trip for both business and pleasure I stayed here along with some friends that had already booked their rooms for the same events we were attending together. The property is located on Harmon Avenue, maybe one block if that far from a bustling section of the Las Vegas Strip. This location is actually quite good for both business purposes and pleasure seekers. Pleasure seekers will find themselves barely a block from the new City Center with short walks to notable properties such as Aria, The Cosmopolitan, Monte Carlo, Bellagio, MGM Grand and beyond. For the business traveler the Marriott offers complimentary valet of your rental car where you can quickly exit onto Harmon Avenue towards Koval Lane, avoiding the immense congestion on Las Vegas Blvd. The arrival process was very good with the valet being a great first impression for the facility. He quickly greeted me when I pulled in with my business rental car and gave me a good lay of the land as I unloaded my bags. A little tip he offered for those of you staying here on business is if you\u2019ll let him know at check-in he\u2019ll pull your car forward and have it ready for you as long as you\u2019re leaving before 8AM. This is a little something he says he likes to do for his business guests to make it easier for them to get out in the morning and get to their jobs. That was a nice touch. The check-in process was good but not exceptional. It seemed to take a bit longer than needed until the assistant front desk manager finally came from the office to assist in breaking loose the log jam. At that point I was finally cheerfully greeted and quickly checked in with all of the information I needed to take on Vegas. The facilities all seem brand new and in pristine condition. All of the common areas are modern, clean and attractive. The rooms seem to be primarily longer term vacation or business rentals. These rooms are basically expanded suites that include separate bedroom, bathroom, living area and even a full sized kitchen for cooking and entertaining. The kitchen comes stocked with the basics for preparing moderate meals, full sized coffee pot, dishwasher, full sized refrigerator and the like. The adjoining living area has a nice sized flat screen LCD TV with stereo system flanked by a full sized couch, two chairs and a coffee table. The four seat dining table is wedged between the kitchen and living area in this open concept design. In the bedroom there is a king sized bed with another good sized flat panel LCD TV, an arm chair for reading and watching TV and other basics. Of particular interest there is an over-sized tub located in the bedroom set across from a separate sink, mirror and make up table for the ladies to utilize while the bathroom is otherwise occupied. The bathroom is all marble, with a really good sized walk in glass wall shower containing two shower heads. Overall I\u2019d say the Marriott Grand Chateau 1 & 2 is a very nice, part time rental property. The only negatives I can think of from my stay where the heightened push to sell you a time share. I personally find this annoying, especially when traveling on business. Others might not even be bothered in the least. I found the advance phone calls from the \u201cPre-Arrival Marketing Specialist\u201d a little annoying for what was essentially a business trip. In addition, our water was shut off from 5PM until 8PM the first night of our arrival due to a broken water main outside of the hotel. You can\u2019t blame the hotel for such acts beyond their control but when you\u2019re the guest that needs to shower before heading out to dinner for the evening it still irritates a little bit nonetheless.

No umbrellas, no shade, no small tables, just rows of chase lounges surrounding a pool the size that you might have in your own yard.

We were allowed approximately 40 minutes to do our shopping. If you do not have an Albertsons discount card there is no need to register for one as they will give you the discount at checkout providing you ask for it. There is also a shuttle operating to the Fashion Show Mall which we did not use. Card access was required for after hours access to the elevators. Unable to comment on the pool and the gym (which is free) as we did not use these facilities. While there is laundry facilities in the unit it took about an hour to wash a load and the dryer took a long time as well and you could smell the exhaust in the room. Did not attempt to do any additional loads. If you have the time suggest renting a car and visiting Hoover Dam and hiking Red Rock Canyon. We were very happy with our accomodations and will stay here again.

Finally after asking for more compensation we actually received 6 tickets for the Phantom show playing at the Venetian. Actually booked the show for a future stay and hope to use them later in the year. The problem is simple - Veags is a late night to early morning vacation. Most people sleep late during the day. The Marriott should have never given me or anyone else rooms directly below construction - very poor planning on their part. If it happens to you just tell them that \"Sorry just does not cut it\" and ask for some real compensation. I had a total of 3 couples in the room and I even apolgized to them for the noise because I had planned the entire trip. The Marriott is usually a great place to stay but in this case they fell short with their lack of planning and consideration for guests during their renovation projects.

It's about 5 years old and the decor is French. We stayed in room 2619 with a clear view of City Centre/Aria and some of Planet Hollywood. Nothing was worn, torn or scratched and everything was very clean. Bed was very comfortable. We love this place because it isn't just one room which is great for us as he likes to stay up and sleep in late and I am the opposite. This way he could stay in the living/dining area watching TV as late as he wanted. We were able to check in at noon which was nice. When we checked out, they let us have until 11:30am to get out. I guess that's subject to whether they are booked up or not. Our flight home wasn't until 7:30pm but they held our luggage for us at the bell desk until we left for the airport. There is a shuttle that goes to the grocery store Albertsons several times a day from Saturday to Tuesday. We took advantage of this but we bought way too much food and much of it went to waste. We had no desire to cook on vacation and there was just the two of us. Next time, I would just buy water, fruits and vegetables to snack on and maybe ice cream. We made a suggestion at the concierge that perhaps they could set up a food bank drop off box for unopened food items that guests haven't used while there, but she looked at us like we were crazy. Or even if there was somewhere we could have put the unused stuff so that other guests could have taken them if they chose to. Before you pick up groceries, you may want to see if the kitchen has all of the dishes/pans/utensils you will need for whatever you plan to make. Also, just a tip: If you take the shuttle to Albertsons, there is lots of shopping nearby such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls, Walgreens, Target, Payless, Best Buy and others. There is also a big mall maybe a 10 minute walk away from Albertsons (www.boulevardmall.com) on Maryland Parkway. These stores aren't nearly as crowded as the outlet malls and the fashion mall. If you aren't able to catch the grocery shuttle back to the hotel, you can catch a bus on Maryland and Flamingo (route 208, I think) by Walgreens back to the strip. I think you get dropped off by Caesars Palace so you can either walk back to hotel from there or transfer to a strip bus. The front desk staff was always very friendly and helpful. As other reviewers have mentioned there is no daily housekeeping service which was fine with us. If you want extra towels and sheets, you have only to ask for them. It doesn't take long to make a bed yourself. There is a room where you can take your garbage and recycling if you so choose or you can just put the stuff in the small closet by the entry way. It was great to have a flat screen TV (maybe 36-40 inch?)in both the bedroom and living room. DVD player in the living room as well. No problems with the internet connection and it was always fast. The pool is small, as many others have said. It was still refreshing though. It's not deep and you can't really swim in it but it was nice to hang out there for a bit. Everyone was friendly and chatty. Very social and intimate setting that you might not get at a huge pool. You probably wouldn't hang out at the pool all day anyway. Seemed like there were always empty chairs. There is a small bar there. Many bought drinks there but there were also quite a few people who brought their own alcohol to the pool and it wasn't a problem.

There seems little rationale in comparing and contrasting Marriott Grand Chateau with Marriott Ocean Pointe in Palm Beach, Marriott Grande Vista Resort in Orlando, Marriott Newport Coast Villas in Newport Beach, or Marriott\u2019s SurfWatch in Hilton Head Island. All five of these Marriott timeshares offer superior accommodations on two different oceans and in Las Vegas. The geography of the Great Basin is vastly different from the geography of Pacific southern California, or central Florida, or the Low Country near Savannah, or the Atlantic Palm Beaches. Our two bedroom and bathroom condo is listed as 1252 square feet; this is not spacious, but very congenial for my wife and me. The villa has two king beds and two sofa beds. Because the Las Vegas Blvd. area is highly developed with timeshares, hotels, motels, and the recent CityCenter, Marriott offers elegant, guileless refinement. A tiled floor foyer extends to the kitchen and bathroom area. A full kitchen (smaller than some other Marriotts) is very well equipped with appliances, cook wear, and service wear. We tend to prefer morning coffee and an American breakfast taken in our villa, with options to prepare lunch or dinner as we consider various opportunities. Granite counter tops in the kitchen and bathrooms compliment the walnut cabinets. The villas feature the standard industrial grade carpet; the furniture and accessories tend to resemble French provincial, and are comfortable. The combination living room and dining room features a large, wall-mounted HDTV and DVD player with a broad selection of TV cable channels. Cell-phone reception is fine. The all-important Wi-Fi connectivity is complimentary, truly high speed, and flawless. Marriott\u2019s designer (decorator) service is an expression of sophisticated elegance. Several framed mirrors and pleasant framed prints add some stylishness to the villas.

It is a half block from the strip and no smoking. While some Casino hotels have no smoking rooms, the smoke smell still seems to linger in the hallways and in the rooms. This is a timeshare hotel. My 5 y.o. daughter thought it was the best hotel in the whole world. She has stayed in over a dozen hotels. They have a small kids activities room with daily activities. It is a little hidden to the left of the front desk. My in-laws, who do not understand timeshares, found out how much we paid for the 2BR unit and wondered if we could do it every week and just live there. They also wondered if there was a volume discount. We were in a 2BR lock off, so we had a king and jacuzzi in the master bedroom, sofa bed in the living and a king and sofa bed in the 2nd bedroom. The living and dining area wasn't large and the dining table was at the door between the lock offs, so my in-laws needed to squeeze by. There was a full kitchen in the main unit with a kitchenette in the smaller one. There wasn't a fan over the cooking range, so the smell stayed in the unit. We had to leave the door open while cooking. The windows do not open, but they have a sliding pop up vent along the windows for air flow. Because the pressure of the hallway air conditioning was so powerful, we could have probably left the door closed if the window vents were open, to air out the unit. The valet parking is outsourced and they have like 10 cameras at the garage entrance to view all angles of the car and area. Valet parking is free. A couple days a week, they offer a free grocery shuttle. To get to the heated pool, which was very warm, on the roof, you have to go through the sales department, but no one bothered us. The pool and hot tub are small. We were able to see the New Years Eve fireworks from the roof. Part of the roof structure blocked view the MGM side. The Planet Hollywood and its mall are across the street. The Spices (I think) buffet there is very good. Todai is typically good for Japanese seafood buffet, although we didn't eat at this location, is across the street as well. The mall has its own water show, that the kids loved. They also had an area, where it \"rained\" along the wall way, every 10 minutes.

We booked a 3-bedroom, 3 bath suite, which is more than enough room for 5 people. I expected the suite to be one unit. However, it is actually 2 suites--one 2-bedroom and one 1-bedroom. To my knowledge all 3-bedroom units in this hotel are located at the ends of the hallway. There is a main door that opens to a \"foyer\", providing access to both suites. In this regard, it is very private. The suites are very spacious and nicely decorated. Each has a sleep sofa in the living area, as well as a separate kitchen with full refrigerator, stove, dishes, pots and pans, etc. We only used the kitchen in the 2-bedroom unit, so that we could eat at the dining room table (which seats 8 people). There is a washer/dryer combination machine in each unit. I don't recommend using the machines if you need something quickly, as the dryers are not efficient. Each bedroom has a very comfortable king size bed. Comfort is what I expect when I stay at a Marriott hotel, and I am never disappointed. There is an option to have two beds instead of a king. The master bedroom has a large jacuzzi, double sinks, and a walk-in shower with a built-in bench. All the bathrooms are spacious. The view from the large windows is spectacular at night, as the location is only 1 block from the strip. My 15 yr old daughter pulled up a chair to the window each night to look out, while listening to her iPod. I would request a room on one of the higher floors to get the best view. The only negative we encountered was noise coming from nearby construction on the strip, and a banging sound above our room during the day. This didn't prevent my family from sleeping, but could be an issue for a very light and late sleeper. If a room is requested at the back left end of the hotel, it might not be heard at all. Be prepared for valet parking, as there is no self-parking available on site. There is an open parking lot across from the hotel, however. We chose not to park there for security reasons and to keep our vehicle shaded from the heat. We bought a few items from the convenience store, though somewhat pricey as expected. There is also a shuttle available for trips to the grocery store. My children and I used the fitness center a few times. It is well equipped with treadmills, each with its own tv; free weights; machine workout stations to target various parts of the body; and a few other nice touches. We visited the pool one day, but did not actually swim. It is a bit small. There were daily activites for young children at the hotel, but nothing for teenagers. Thus, we found all of our entertainment away from the hotel. There is plenty to do on the strip. Away from the strip, I recommend the Town Square outdoor mall (late in the day), Hoover Dam, the Grand Canyon, and the Barringer Crater. My children are fans of amusement parks. So, we also took a trip to Six Flags, Magic Mountain in Valencia, CA. Another choice is Knotts Berry Farm Amusement Park. I would go just to eat the chicken dinner. Overall, my family and I had a very nice stay at the Marriott Grand Chateau.

The location is exceptional as it's just a block from the strip by the new City Centre. The lobby area has a mini-market. All staff was very helpful & friendly. Here are some pros & cons: PROs 1) Location, location, location. If you get a higher-floor room facing the strip, you'll get a good view of the strip actions. I can see the new Cosmopolitan & Bellagio from my room. It's just a short walk to the strip & directly across from Planet Hollywood & the Miracle Mile Shops. 2) Free mandatory valet parking. 3) Exceptional high quality unit - fully equipped kitchen with granite counter-top, stainless steel appliances, higher-end cookware, washer & dryer. These are lock-off units. The 1-br side has a jacuzzi tub inside the bedroom. The bathroom shower has an awesome opposite-facing dual head shower with great water pressure. The sofa bed in the living room is not bad either. 4) Excellent security. To access the various floors, one must use the room key. This sort of prevents non-guests from roaming around the floors... although they could tailgate other guests. CONs: 1) The roof-top pool area is so small that it's a joke. When the wind kicks in, the door to the pool area is closed. I heard that Marriott plans to construct additional building(s) adjacent to the existing property and will have a bigger pool. 2) The pillows are ridiculously soft and small ... to the point where they don't provide any support. One could double up on a pillow but due to the small size, it's hard to stack them up. As an owner, I was invited to participate in a timeshare in exchange for some bribery (I opted for a visa gift card). The salesperson was not pushy at all. I immediately informed her that I was not interested in purchasing this property. So, the discussion was mainly focused on how to best benefit from Marriott's new point system.

It's across the street from the Planet Hollywood mall, and a 10 minute walk to the Bellagio fountains and the new City Center complex. It's pretty good considering Las Vegas blocks are massive, and it can take 10 minutes to get out of some other massive resorts. We got a two bedroom, two bath room. The room itself was nice, clean, and decently sized, but not luxurious. The room had a full kitchen plus a kitchenette in one of the bedrooms. A typical timeshare \"lock-out\" layout. The master bedroom had a separate double-showerhead shower, and a deep soaking bath for two *in the sleeping quarters*. Yes, there is a bathtub & a sink next to the bed.

The room itself was very nicely appointed with the tile floor, tile shower and granite counter tops along with the big soaking tub. It had everything we needed. This was the first place we stayed that had BluRay players and there were two of them for each of the flat screen TVs. I think the living room one was at least 47 inches. There were also lots of free movie channels like HBO and Starz. It was also nice to have free internet access and a washer and dryer both in the room and a common set on the floor for free use. We rarely saw anyone on our floor and never heard anyone. It was nice having the security on the elevators so you could not get to your floor without your magnetic room key. But it did allow going to any floor. A couple of small negatives were the small pool and pool area on the roof with no shade. The other issue was the valet parking. It was a inconvenience having to get the car through the valet but it was free. We did use the free shuttle service to the grocery store. You can also use the Las Vegas bus system and avoid the bad traffic on the strip. I expected to have to pay for some of these \u201cextras\u201d from our last experience staying at a hotel type property in Canada. It was a Delta timeshare property and they charged $15.00 per day for parking, $8.00 per day for the internet, the common use washer dryers were a charge and it did not have DVD or CD players nor more than one HBO channel.

The \"Donnie and Marie\" show is also within walking distance. It's a great show appropriate for all ages.

Here is the lowdown. HOTEL \u2013 Pros - Stayed at the Marriott timeshare facility called the Marriott Grand Chateau which was one block off the strip. Called ahead and asked for a high floor and got it. I was very happy that the room was ready when we got there at 11:00 in the morning. I have stayed at timeshares before and this was no different. We had one bedroom, living room with pull-out couch, kitchen and bathroom, no balcony. The beds were comfortable, the AC worked fine, we had garbage bags, laundry detergent, microwave, toaster, everything that you should have in the room. The hotel was clean and everybody is friendly. AND A GREAT VIEW from the 26th floor. There is a convenience store in the lobby which is open 24 hrs. and they have everything you need in a pinch. The hotel has a shuttle which will take you to the grocery store, if you want. Valet parking is the only way to go at this place. The valets are really busy, especially during check-in times but only once did I have to wait longer than seven minutes for my car. The pool is very small (remember this is not a resort) and is on the roof and has a nice bar. There was always a nice breeze on the roof and it was actually relaxing there. The pool area got crowded during \u201chappy hour\u201d. Cons \u2013 The girl behind the desk gave me wrong directions on my first day there. Luckily the valet gave me the right directions a few minutes later. The concierge didn\u2019t seem to be much help. They didn\u2019t know anything more than what I could have found myself on the computer. Location \u2013 Perfect location. The hotel is situated one block from the strip. It is within walking distance of five or six other resort/hotels such as New York, New York, MGM, Bellagio, and Paris. It is directly across the street from Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile Shops which is a mall with many restaurants. It was an easy walk for breakfast or shopping. If you like seafood, you HAVE to check out \u201cTodai\u201d \u2013 a seafood buffet which is in the mall across the street. Without a doubt, my best meal over the five days. We tried breakfast in the mall at a couple of places but it was really expensive and wasn\u2019t very good. My kids went up the block one night for dinner to the Harley Davidson restaurant and they said it was very good (cheesesteak, burgers, pulled pork). We had lunch in the Mirage one day at the Carnegie Deli (pastrami, corned beef, matzoh ball soup) \u2013 delicious but, of course, expensive. We also tried the Bellagio Buffet, which supposedly is the best on the strip. It didn\u2019t disappoint. The Mirage also had a dolphin and animal habitat for seventeen dollars which was very nice. They also have the Terry Fator Show which we saw. He\u2019s a fabulous talent and one of the best shows in Vegas. The Bellagio Fountains was one of the highlights for me. I could stand there all night and listen to the music, which is choreographed perfectly with the fountains. There\u2019s a show every fifteen minutes at night. And the Eiffel Tower from Paris is right across the street from there. Another highlight was the Barry Manilow Show at the Paris. He still sounds the same way he did thirty years ago.

We did some price comparisons and determined that we could stay in a 2-bedroom villa here for the same price as 2 hotel rooms at a nearby hotel/casino. The 5 of us (with some urging from me) decided that a villa would be the best way to go, especially since it included a full kitchen, dining area, and living room and was smoke-free. I'm glad we stayed here! We arrived midday Saturday, and check in was a breeze. We found everything clean and ready for use in our room on the fourth floor. The kitchen was fully stocked. The master bedroom had a king bed and a separate tub and shower. The second bedroom had two queen beds. The sofa included a fold-out bed, which luckily meant no awkward bed sharing would have to occur. We called housekeeping for linens for the sofa sleeper, and they showed up about 10 minutes later. The Grand Chateau does not have a casino, which makes for a quieter and easier-to-navigate hotel lobby. (It was like night and day compared to Treasure Island, where I had begrudgingly stayed a year prior.) The hotel has some timeshare properties, but luckily they were not in our face about it. Even though the Grand Chateau does not have a Strip address, it is across the street from Planet Hollywood and almost the exact same walking distance from the Strip itself as the nearby Aria and Monte Carlo properties. An unexpected perk of staying here is that, despite it being January, the roof-top pool and hot tub were open! Yes! Also, views of the Strip from the roof are excellent. The only sour note from our stay was the bedding: It appears that down bedding was used, and 3 of 5 of us woke up heavily congested as a result. I realize now that this is preventable, though, as the reservation system does ask for a bedding preference. Live and learn, right? Overall, I highly recommend the villas here! P.S. We didn't have a car for our stay, but if you do, be aware that this property has valet parking only.

The 2 bedroom offered one king bed, another with 2 double beds and a sleep sofa.

A washer and dryer are also conveniently located in the kitchen area. One downside (if you want to call it that) is that all parking is done by valet only. Great and quick except you sometimes felt like you didn't want to pull the car out so many times a day, so a little planning was to be made :) They offer two complimentary bus shuttles - one to the Fashion Mall on the Strip across from Wynn and Venetian....and the other to a grocery store. For those not in the know, you can also order groceries online (Vons, Albertson's and a few others) and have them delivered at the start of your stay. Staff was great - especially the valet guys (Thanks Zachary!). It took some getting used to not having the convenience of a casino downstairs but I probably saved more money that way.

We have no problem re-using towels from day to day for a long weekend, but on our third day, the maids cart was parked outside of our room and we took advantage! Ha ha! The location of the hotel is UNREAL. You walk out the doors and the Miracle Mile shops are right across the street. Plenty of shops, and restaurants with CHEAP, reasonable food! (We had breakfast 2 days at NICE restaurants for less than $6 per person!) The best kept secret of Vegas is the ABC Shops. There are TWO of them in the Miracle Mile Mall that sell beer and wine for REALLY cheap (Beers- $2 and Wine-$3-$4), and it is absolutely awesome to be able to walk around everywhere with open containers! Us being from Illinois are not used to that. We love shopping with wine! (Although we shouldn't make a habit of it- Oh my! Ha ha ha!) Last but not least, the rooftop pool and bar of the hotel is amazing. They had a \"Happy Hour\" special every day from 2:30-4:30 that offered spectacular views of the city. The drink specials, not so spectacular, but then again- the view was what we were paying for! We also capped off our last night in Vegas in the hottub on the roof above it all. We didn't want to leave! We cannot wait to save up a week again and return to the Grand Chateau- next time for the full seven nights! That says ALOT for Vegas- bc usually it tires fast!

Rooms are very nice with comfortable beds and pillows, adjustable thermostats, luxurious bathrooms with good lighting, and kitchen amenities. There are not many services available at the MGC. Services are limited to a small convenience store, a rooftop lounge, and shuttles to a grocery store and the Fashion Show Mall. There are also children's activities available. There was no daily maid service provided during our stay, nor were bathroom towels refreshed. We got clean towels from a cart that was parked in an adjacent hallway, but the dirty towels accumulated in the bathroom. For a fee, maid service could be requested. One problem we encountered during our stay was that the water system for the entire property was shut off from midnight until 6:00 a.m. on the day we were scheduled to depart. This was a major inconvenience as we had to check-out at 4:30 a.m. to make our flight, and we ended up having to cancel our last-night plans to go Downtown so that we could shower and prepare for the next day's travels. To compound the problem, we were not notified of this planned water outage, and only circumstancially found out about it ahead of time because we happened to be in the lobby printing our boarding passes when another guest was overheard talking about it. We went up to our room to see if there was a message on our phone or a written notification of the planned water outage, but neither were found... There were also an unusual number of visits to the property by firetrucks and ambulances during our stay. This was noticeable since our window overlooked the front entrance. There were signs posted throughout the MGC that testing of emergency systems was going on, and it's possible that the emergency vehicles were part of the testing. Overall, if you're looking for peace and quiet amongst the noise and excitement of the casino resorts and a comfortable night's sleep, this is a good place to check out. With the multi-bedroom availability, It is also worth considering if you are traveling with a larger group or traveling with children.

The bathroom was also spacious and had a lot of room to keep toiletries. The hallways were clean, spacious, and the elevators were fast. The lobby was very nice. There is a small shop for snacks and goods, but it was extremely overpriced. Instead, we walked to the Walgreens around the corner on LV Blvd. We did use the hotel shop for coffee each morning, which was only $1 if we saved the Starbucks cup from an original purchase. The hotel is located on Harmon Ave. in walking distance of the strip - we cut through the Miracle Mile Shops to reach LV Blvd. each day, which took no time at all. The cabstand in the front of the hotel quickly and efficiently got us cabs on two different occasions. We had a terrible view, which was one of the cons - we overlooked a parking deck and could see part of the MGM Grand as well as the airport. This view also offered some mountains, which I enjoyed most at twilight. Again, we weren't really in Vegas to chill in the room, so it wasn't that big of a deal.

Most of our activities were away from the strip (I highly recommend Hash House a Go Go on Sahara Ave for breakfast). I give this information so readers can appreciate what we really liked about Marriott's vacation club villas. We stayed in a spacious corner 2-bedroom. The room was clean, and the furnishings were comfortable and conservative (no Las Vegas flash). The kitchen was compact, but was fully equipped so we could comfortably eat meals in the villa. The dining table accommodated 8. The master bathroom was spacious and actually had a great view of CityCenter. (We had views of the strip from all windows of our 25th-floor villa.) Our villa was QUIET. A huge priority for me! No hall noise. And no traffic noise below (except for occasional sirens.) The Chateau is just one street off the strip, so if you want quick access to Paris or Planet Hollywood or Bellagio, they are just steps away. (I actually love the Bellagio's decorated conservatory and the fountain show.) But, if you want to avoid the strip (and if you have a car), just turn right onto Harmon to bypass Las Vegas Boulevard all together. (You can also take a complimentary shuttle to Fashion Show Mall.) The Chateau does not have slot machines or gaming tables; it smells fresh and clean (because it does not allow smoking); and it welcomes children. It has very few amenities, however, so if you're looking for an amazing pool, an on-property restaurant, or a spa, you may be disappointed. But if you want a family-friendly, quiet haven from the strip where you have flexibility to prepare your own meals, you will be pleased! CONS: Internet (complimentary) was frustratingly slow. Dryer took forever to dry even a small load. The little \"convenient store\" near the check-in desk would be a true convenience if the prices were more reasonable.

It is not deep enough to swim - it is like an infant pool, no kidding. There are places you can go to that are open to the public (RIO is one of them), but it is kind of a hassle to have to drive.

Granite counters and the Master Shower was huge/large/nice and the master also had a separate tub from the shower. Our 2 Bedroom was configured with two rooms = the main room had a master bedroom separated from the living room and kitchen and then the second bedroom was open by the double doors (so the second room had its own bathroom and mini-kitchen area too). What you don't get is a room in a hotel where you are DIRECTLY on the strip. So if you want to literally step out of your room and go down an elevator that empties into a casino then this hotel is NOT for you. However in our case the 1/2 block was nothing and we LOVED having the separate rooms = one for the kids and one for us. Since we were traveling from the east coast the time difference made some of us want to get up earlier then others and this configuration was awesome because we could get up early and not wake anyone up. The roof pool area was nice too. From the roof you could see most of the strip and at night it looked nice. The chlorine in the pool and spa was intense and my opinion is whenever a hotel does that they are just being lazy (in other words by adding so much chlorine they do not have to clean it as much). Bottom line is anytime I am with family or a large group this is the hotel we are staying at but anytime I am by myself or with a small group of guys playing poker we will stay at an on the strip hotel.

For breakfast eating out, I recommend the nearby Ocean One Bar and Grille in the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood. Pancakes and a cranberry juice was about $9 plus tip. We used the small pool most days and sometimes it was empty, but when it was busy you couldn't swim lengths in it - just really for cooling off. There was always space in the hot tub though.

That said, I was extremely shocked at the room size (1 br villa), layout and amenities. If I did not have the experience or knowledge of what a typical vacation club property is like, I think it would have been great (my friends thought it was). When we walked into our room we saw our view was of the roof, with the Crystal Mall (beautiful) beyond that. It was my sister's first time to Vegas, so I had hoped for an unobstructed view. Given I also was not satisfied with our room layout (see below) I immediately asked for a room change, but was told the hotel was to capacity. There was absolutely no way that was possible. Our flight in was half full, the lobby was desolate and in the evening most of the lights were off. Our kitchen did not have a bar counter, instead it was all against one wall. We had very little counter space, which was a problem for food prep, being the three of us all wanted to pitch in. Our bathroom was a standard hotel bathroom, not what I saw in other traveler's photos, or the hotel photos. In other words, we did not have the nice jacuzzi tub or the beautiful shower I saw in so many pictures. With three females, it was difficult to get ready, since we only had one sink with limited counter space and the one mirror (no other mirrors anywhere, not even a full length). I was also surprised they do not supply conditioner or lotion. I never pack these items so that I can carry on for short trips. We did not trade through the timeshare, so we were supposed to receive daily housekeeping service. We were out by 10 am and came back at 5 to a room not cleaned. I called the front desk who stated we should have received cleaning, but service was no longer available for the day. I asked for clean towels to be sent up which never came. I figured I would call again in the morning, but instead took them off the maid cart in the morning. Wireless internet is complimentary in rooms (personal laptops) and you can print boarding passes in the lobby. Internet service is available in the lobby for a ridiculous fee of 35 cents per minute. Okay, let me throw in some positives. Friendly valets and bell service (not great front desk staff). Right across the street from Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile shops, which have great lunch specials at their restaurants and ABC stores which are great for drinks, souvenirs, pharmacy items, and some grocery items. The rooftop pool area is great for a southern strip view. The pool was warm and the hot tub perfect. The bar was closed (it had been raining, don't know if that made a difference), but heat lamps were on near the tables and nice music was playing (this was in the evening). I think I would have been happy here if we had been given the room I expected, but since it appears to be luck of the draw on room layout (I'm also a Marriott Rewards Gold member....Usually receive upgrades and the better rooms), I don't think I would take the chance. By the way, if you read my other reviews I think you will find I'm not usually so negative!

The issue started there. This hotel has many floorplans.....different types of one bedrooms and different types of two bedrooms. Interval international's system can not differentiate between the different types of floorplans. It makes a huge difference. We thought we would be staying in the larger one bedroom, but we ended up in a \"mini\" one bedroom.....losing out on a huge soaking tub and a ton of sq footage....and a ended up with a tiny kitchen. I had called interval to confirm that we had the room with the big tub as pictured online....they said yes we did....and this was not the case. After noticing we were in the wrong room....the hotel manager said she could not move us because she could only use what was in intervals inventory....so we decided to stay and just remain in the tiny little room. The first night our room began to smell like dead rotting fish....we called down to the front desk and they said they could give us air freshener to spray....hmmmm we had a 10 month old baby in the room so this would only mask the odors with chemicals, which i didn't want to do. We asked if we could be moved, and she said no because once again they can only pull from interval's inventory and there was nothing available. The second night we called again...the smell was getting worse...they said they only had one engineer on duty and if they sent him to my room to come take a look at it then they wouldn't have him available for other needs in the hotel. At this point I became very frustrated and told her to send the engineer that this is not my problem. He indeed smelled the fishy smell but could not figure out where it was coming from so he walkie talkied the front desk and told the dumb girl to move us (after stating we'll just move you we have a ton of empty rooms). She refused and stated that there was no vacancy! Lets keep in mind we were here in Jan. Las Vegas itself was dead....and the hotel was dead.....there was vacancy she was just stubborn. At this point my husband said forget it....well just go home. It was 2 am and we began to pack our stuff....we called her again at the front desk and asked if there was ANYTHING she could do for us bc if not we were going to go home.....yes drive back to Orange County at 2 am with a 10 month old baby because we can't stand the rotting fish smell in our room! She said they could bring in some \"Ionizing machine\" but that we would have to leave the room for 2 hrs. So we decided out of complete exhuastion to leave our room with our baby and go drive around for 2 hrs until our room was done. When we returned, our room smelled like a gas station...a mixture of gas and oil....and we were too tired to deal with it anymore. We went to bed and woke up the next morning and called down to tell them our room still reeks and that we want to be moved. The day manager was on duty and he said, \"oh no problem\" I see here that you had this issue for days, lets move you! He called back and had sent a bell hop and new keys up within 20 minutes. The other girl had apparantly lied! He also moved us into the bigger one bedroom where we thought we had been staying anyways. From then on our trip was better although we never unpacked all the way after being moved twice and moving an entire kitchen of food/baby supplies not to mention pack and play's high chairs and all of our luggage. So as far as the rooms go....they are nicely decorated....nice TV's, furniture, and seem to be clean...the big bath tub can hold about 4 people, and really makes the room worth it....Do not waste your time in one of their \"mini\" rooms......it's like any ordinary hotel room with a kitchenette. If you have an issue at this hotel....LET GOD BE WITH YOU!!! It will depend entirely on the management staff that is working that day/night as to whether they will help you. The pool is not very kid friendly....it is a small simple rectangle pool but almost everyone around it is smoking and hanging out at the bar. The kids room is a nothing to brag about....they do not provide \"cribs\" as they will confirm for you over the phone....they are pack and plays....we specifically called to see if it was a crib or a pack and play...we were told a crib....but it was a pack and play....which if we had known we would have brought our own from home. They do provide high chairs. The only reason why i would recomend this hotel is because it is in a prime location....accross the street from the city and in between planet hollywood and the MGM. It is clean.....you don't have to deal with walking through a casino everytime you go in and out if you have children. Its up to date....except there is no desk in the room....so if you plan on taking a computer or working from the room (as my husband needed to) you will need to work on the dining room table or bring a folding table. Parking is ONLY Vallet also...so if you prefer to self park...this is not the place.

There was a large living area which included a full kitchen (completly stocked with all appliances and cutlery, bowls etc), a 6 person round table, pull out sofa and large screen LCD. The stand up washer/dryer was in a small closet in the kitchen. Everything was spotless and everything worked without issue. The king bedroom was gorgeous.

Overall, very clean, VERY quiet stay with no issues at all. The Pool: Yes, it is small. 3.5' deep. The hot tub seats about 12 and there is a nice bar area on the roof as well.

With our 1 year olds, we wanted to have a hotel with a refrigerator, microwave and washer and dryer. We had previously stayed at the Wyndham Grand Desert and enjoyed it. However, it wasn't available for our stay, so we decided to try the Marriott. Overall, it was a good experience. The staff, from front desk to housekeeping to the valets were very accomodating and helpful. We needed three cribs and though they didn't have them in the room on arrival, they brought them up quickly. The hotel was clean. The rooms were more than enough space for us. We were able to shop and bring some simple snacks for the kids. We were even able to bring home leftovers from a restaurant and had it for lunch the next day while the kids were napping. Two minor quibble s: 1. the combo washer and dryer doesn't seem to dry as well as it should when we washed the kids clothing, and 2. while it was nice to have valet parking, it was not as convenient if you're in a hurry and have to wait for other cars to be pulled before you. At the time of our stay, there was construction going on at the corner of Harmon and Las Vegas Boulevard, so you cannot turn into Harmon from Southbound direction of Las Vegas Boulevard. Once that's completed, it should be even more convenient for people to access. Overall, we would stay there again if the price point was right.

This is our 4th stay at the Grand Chateau and our first in a two bedroom villa. First, The Grand Chateau is a time share property, but you can also rent room s like you do a hotel if there are rooms not being used by the owners. They do have hotel style rooms that are a single room with a Queen bed, couch bed, and small kitchenette and they have one bedroom, two bedroom and three bedroom villas (read: condo style room). Each has a master bedroom with a King bed and giant bathtub and each has a living room, dining room, and full kitchen stocked with cooking and dining supplies. This time we actually used the small washer and dryer provided, as well. It worked, but wasn't the best washer and dryer we ever used. This was the first time that we went with a group of people. We had a two bedroom villa, which has a second bedroom that is the same as the standard one room hotel room. The bedrooms are on each side of the living area. We had 8 people with us and it was a little tight for that many people. we each had a bed, but when we were up and about, the living/dining area was a little small for that many people. But we had an amazing view of the strip and fully took advantage of the full kitchen by preparing many full meals right there in the room. We all had laptops with us, though, and the free wireless Internet was soooooo slow that we didn't use it much because it was quite frustrating. We love that the property is non-smoking, but are not happy that the rooftop pool/bar area has set aside the best part of the roof for smoking. That is a bit of a disappointment. The pool is one negative of the Grand Chateau. Its on the roof and quite small, but it and the jacuzzi are open all year unlike many of the hotels there and its open late, also unlike many Vegas hotels. Once they add the third tower, a larger pool will be put in between the 2nd and 3rd towers. We're looking forward to that! For parking, it is ALL valet, so you cannot self park, however the valet is complimentary and you can choose to tip or not when picking up your vehicle. We have never had a problem any of the times we have stayed at the Grand Chateau, but our friends this time has a 6 speed manual transmission in their vehicle and felt that the valet did not know how to properly use that transmission. The location is fantastic, you're close to the center of the Strip, between the MGM Grand and Planet Hollywood casinos and directly across the street from teh new City Center.

It has studios with a queen bed/ mini kitchen/ and sleeper sofa. 1 bedrooms include a private master bedroom with large bath, full kitchen with washer/dryer, dishwasher, etc., dining room, and living room with a large sleeper sofa. When you rent a 2 bedroom unit, you get both the studio & the 1 bedroom, so a total of 2 bathrooms, & it will sleep up to 8 people. There are also limited 3 bedroom units. The front of the hotel has a pull thru area where you check in & give your car to the valets to park in the garage for you. There is no self parking. Be prepared to empty your vehicle and get a luggage cart yourself, or have the bellman do it. Check in was great -- staff are very helpful. There is always free icewater in the lobby (with fruit in it). There is a small marketplace for snacks in the lobby. For owners, there is an owners lounge. They have weekly donut & coffee breakfasts for the owners to hear about local activities. These are for Marriott timeshare owners only. We stayed 3 nights on the Marriott timeshare presentation package. I paid extra & upgraded from a studio to a 1 bedroom & really glad I did. For 2 people the studios are great, but for a family of 4, with older kids 12 & 22, we needed more space. The kids both slept in the sleeper sofa which is king size I think. Maybe queen. The timeshare presentation is painless with Marriott, by their policies they don't pressure you. You spend about 2 hours getting a tour & hearing about all the awesome resorts they have & then get a choice of $75.00 Visa card, 10,000 Marriott reward points, or other rewards like helicopter rides or show tickets. We already own 2 Marriott timeshares, both 2 bedrooms, so we really appreciate the consistency of Marriott hotels and resorts, and also their food when there is a restaurant on property. The location is very close to the corner of the strip next to Planet Hollywood, so it is just about on the strip. A block south is MGM grand, and across the street is the new development with Aria Casino hotel, Vdara boutique hotel, Crystal shopping mall, many restaurants, etc. The location is perfect. We had a room with a view of the MGM grand. They have about 8 elevators, so you usually have no trouble getting to your room. The entire hotel is decorated in beautiful Italian decor including the rooms, which are just lovely. The living room TV's also have a DVD player so you can bring movies, or Netflix. The front desk will mail your Netflix back for you. After check in, go to the concerige and pick up your discount card for a few local area restaurants, etc. Be sure to visit the best kept secret in Las Vegas. This is not part of a tour group, so you won't hear about it from Marriott or anyone else. The Springs Preserve Las Vegas. It was opened in 2007. Here is the website to check it out. It is not far from the hotel. www.springspreserve.org If you are taking a couple kids, and are not from Nevada, get the membership instead of tickets. Out of state tickets are more costly & with the membership it is nearly the same cost, it is tax deductible, good for 1 year & you get discounts on the Wolfgang Puck restaurant & the gift shop. Also, go over to Henderson & tour the Ethel M Chocolate Factory. Best on weekdays when they are making candy. The place is open every day though. Outside is an awesome desert botanical garden on an accessible concrete pathway. They treat all the waste water from the factory on site in a large pond in the back that uses natural methods to destroy the waste. My other two favorite destinations are Valley of Fire State Park -- this is like Disneyland in the world of nature -- my favorite place anywhere. Also, Red Rock Canyon -- go on the driving tour & stop a few places for hikes. Red Rock is BLM land.

The small market on the 1st floor was well stocked but WAY over-priced - you would be better off to find a local Walmart as we did. They do have a shuttle that goes to the supermarket a couple of days a week if you don't have a rental car. The beds were wonderful and perhaps more comfortable than what I have at home. The only problems I had were with the location and our room overlooking the airport. They are located off a side-street next to Plant Hollywood. You have a good solid block to get to the strip. Not a big deal for us, but when you are used to walking out your door and being in the center of it all - it is something to be aware of. The other issue was we didn't check in until mid-week and the only rooms available were in the back facing the airport. The only time it was an issues was the stream of 6:30 am take-offs and landings. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have nice lodging in Vegas. A few other tips: avoid valet if you are going back out that same day - park in the back of the hotel (we did do valet at night); the view from the roof at night is nice on a warm night; avoid the lobby market; the showers use full shower-heads - not those whimpy water-conserving ones :)", "Date": "November 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cfirst time in vegas\u201d", "Author": "miami_is_here", "ReviewID": "UR48776098", "Content": "this was an awesome resort with a great location. not much to do at the resort but the pool has an amazing view and the place is beautiful. i would definately recommend this resort to any family or people who want to go to vegas and still be able to enjoy your time there and still have a relaxing time.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cPosition \"A\" on the Strip but forget about sleeping in.\u201d", "Author": "cpl5938", "ReviewID": "UR48534713", "Content": "Great place and a good position next to the strip.

Certainly upscale, comfortable, clean, convenient and blissfully quiet. Great views of the strip.

We came to Las Vegas for a week stay as a quick family vacation. We usually spend a week or two in a beach location in Mexico, but are taking two other major trips this year, so this summer trip is short and close to home (Los Angeles). We knew Las Vegas had enough to offer our kids, but this resort was a surprise. The rooftop pool is perfect. Not too big but plenty of views, chairs and towels. Not to mention the nice rooftop bar. You can see both ends of The Strip from this vantage point. The rooms are well equipped. Full kitchen means full kitchen! Nice bathrooms and great beds. Even though we only got a one bedroom for the five of us, it was big enough. We spent more time than expected here, and it actually worked for us. It's so nice not to have a casino in the hotel, yet everything so close. We are literally half a block off The Strip. The only drawback is not having a restaurant in- ouse. However, right across the street is the Miracle Mile with plenty of reasonable options and then everything from expensive fare to McDonald's and Fatburger less than a block away. It probably made for a more reasonable vacation for us, since we just ended up buying pasta, cereal and eggs at the Walgreens (block and a half) and at the store downstairs (expensive as expected, but well-stocked). Also, the hotel offers a free shuttle to the local Vons at a few different times during the mornings. They also have a kids club that offers quite a range of activities for ALL young ages. I believe they started at 2 yrs old. Finally, the staff is wonderful. From the valet to the bellman to the store cashier, we felt very appreciated.

I am an admitted germ freak and very particular about the cleanliess of a hotel room. When we walked in our unit it blew me away.

The kitchen was well stocked and had a front loading washer/dryer, full size fridge, microwave stove/oven and dishwasher. The children's room had two queen beds, a flat screen TV and sitting area. The living room had a comfortable couch, two chairs and a flat screen. The master had a very comfortable king size bed, flat screen and chair. The closets throughout the unit were very large. The master bath was beautiful with double vanity sinks, soaking tub and a huge shower. The best thing is the triple bedsheeting. NO disgusting bedspreads to deal with, so you know it's clean. It was nice to walk about 2 minutes off the strip to such a serene and smoke free building. You must valet park your car. They do not allow you to self park in the garage.

The shuttle for the supermarket only runs from Sat through Tues..but if you miss it no worries...there is a fully stocked market in the lobby. They carry everything from bread to first aid items.

By the way, the entire property is smoke free..so if you smoke stay somewhere else. Im not kidding. There are no smoking areas in the hotel and no exceptions..and if housekeeping finds as much as a speck of ash or whiff of smoke in the room expect to pay a hefty \"cleaning\" charge...upwards of 200 bucks in some cases. Some places you can book a smoke free room and get away with smoking. Not here. Trust me. All in all, my stay was pretty good. Minimal complaints. I am a big fan of Marriott properties..so I will stay in one again. This place is a timeshare property..and I did sit through the sales pitch but decided not to buy. Its still pretty new and in good shape but who knows what it will look like in 10 years? Also, only 2 of the 4 quads are up...so when construction begins on quads 3 and 4 I dont think i would want to stay here for the construction noise. City center is going up across the street. HUGE. I counted 10 buildings...its going to be ridiculous when its finished. I didnt hear any construction noise..maybe a truck or two early am but nothing major. Millions of people will be added to the strip. I'm not so sure it's going to be pleasant since they have no plans to widen the sidewalks. Overall, I thought it was an okay place allthough, if I return to Vegas anytime soon I may try somewhere different next time.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Terre Haute", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "JonsTravelGirl", "ReviewID": "UR29164259", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay.

With a 1 to 2 minute walk you're on the Strip. It is located behind the Harley Davidson restaurant. This Marriott is one of the Vacationclub resorts from Marriott, but with a few different detaild. First of all: the location: it is probably located better then most vacationclub resorts. Often they are away from the city centers or places of interest, so you need a car. (Well, some are on the beach, which can be a good location if you just want to relax). Here the parking is valet parking, which works very well. And it can be handy to use a car to get around (shopping malls or even other hotels on the strip... the strip is long...). We were with friends and stayed in a two bedroom apartment. The views are nice. The two bedroom appartment a bit smaller then in an average vacationclub (the kitchen and living room area for instance), but you get all you need, as always. The rooms look nice, the kitchen is handy (for some shopping and taking breakfast and a late night snack). What we enjoyed in Vegas?

We've always stayed at hotels (MGM, TheHotel, Rio, Luxor, TI, Excalibur, even Stratosphere once to check it out) so were hesitant at what my timeshare could offer us in Vegas. A great big space with everything we needed in a perfect location is what we got! The entire suite is decorated in brand new, clean sunny modern sort of country french design (don't worry, it's not frilly or flowered). The kitchen is fully stocked for all your needs - I made dinner for two and even breakfast for six one morning. Special note - if you are making bacon do it in the microwave. There's no real exhaust for smoke which resulted in us setting off the really loud smoke alarm but hotel staff responded IMMEDIATELY with friendly and very nice assistance. The dining room seats 6 comfortably. The living room has a comfortable couch, two chairs, and tables and a flat screen TV with a ton of cable channels. We actually stayed in once or twice to relax and watched a movie or two - very nice. The entire hotel has free WiFi - a nice touch that really came in handy. The bedroom is huge, with another big tv, comfortable bed with nice linens and good pillows, well lighted vanity area, and a really big two person jacuzzi. The separate bathroom has a two person, two shower head shower that was awesome. Our view out the bedroom and living room was of City Center on the strip and the side of Planet Hollywood and beyond - including a slice of the Bellagio fountains. My only gripe is that there is no full length mirror - come on, it's a must for getting dressed up for a night out in Vegas! The rooftop has a bar (open 11am to 6pm) with several tables and chairs, and 6-8 person hot tub and a small but fine sized pool (open from something like 7am to 11pm) with lounge chairs. We liked the day and night view from the roof - you can bring up your own wine and chill out while watching most of the Strip lights, from Mandalay Bay up to Caesar's and beyond. There's also a 24-hour fitness center but between Vegas fun and the ultra comfort of our suite, we never quite got there to check it out. As for location - this place is right behind the Harley Davidson Restaurant & parking lot located on the corner of Harmon and the Strip, across from the new City Center. Unless you cannot walk 90 seconds of a block, there is no reason to call this hotel \"off the strip.\" Think of it this way - if you are staying \"on the strip\" at the MGM, you enter on the strip and then have to walk to the back of the hotel to check in or get to elevators so you've just walked 2 blocks indoors. At the Marriott, you are simply not walking through a casino. And if you chose not to walk the short block up to the Strip, but instead to cross Harmon Ave, you can enter Planet Hollywood & the shops through a side door located directly across (i.e., about 50 feet) from the Marriott's entrance. Marriott guests can use Planet Hollywood's pools and gym for free too. Check out Planet Hollywood's players club - when you join you get a ridiculous amount of free drink & $$ off the buffet coupons as well as free food and retail coupons. With the free drink coupons alone, we saved over $100! Also check out Planet Hollywood's buffet (since the Marriott does not have any restaurants). We were pleasantly surprised by how good the PH buffet was - the dessert bar even has cotton candy! Overally, Marriott Service was friendly and professional. Valet parking attendants and bellhops were great. One of them even gave us the name and number of a nightclub hostess who hooked us up with VIP service and a private table at Ghostbar at the Palms later that week.

Actually there is one about a block away from this property. Ask the concierge where the closest location is. We used this to get 2 for 1 tickets to see Louie Anderson stand up comedy. We also saw that they sold discounted tickets to \"O\", Elton John, Love, Cris Angel, Blue Man Group, Excalibur Knights of the Round Table, etc. The only problem is that they give you a voucher and you have to run over to the box office for the show that you are seeing to get a seat assignment.

When we asked to speak to his manager (Tom), he told us we'd have to wait until the Monday following Thanksgiving (5 days). It got worse from there. We had a 7am flight the next morning and never received our wake up call. Basic amenities weren't available: no glasses in room, no full length mirror, can't call ahead to valet for car, and cheap, tacky decor. Doesn't do the other Vegas Marriott's any justice.

The location is great! its a 1 min walk to the side of the Planet Hollywood mall which is full of great shops and restaurants. To the actual strip its 3 mins at the most. Seeing as most of the hotels on the strip are massive and set back from the actual road the time from Marriott to strip would be the same as MGM hotel room to strip. The only negative thing would be at night you have to walk down a road to the hotel rather than through a hotel, would not suggest that for women on their own at night...better to go through the planet hollywood mall to the side entrance or take a cab if late at night. Whenever I was walking late at night with my husband down the street there were always people around, but I did think to myself I would not feel comfortable without my hubby there. This is not a huge deal just the only negative thing I could think of about this location. The one bedroom suite was like an apartment, it was amazing to come home to every day and felt more like 'home' than a hotel room. Having a full kitchen saved us money as we went to the grocery store the first day so we didnt have to have every meal out. The room was on-par with any of the rooms Ive stayed in the MGM, Luxor etc. but obviously way bigger! Theres a large TV in the living room area and a smaller one in the master. Nice large tub that fits 2 in the master. Shower has a 2 shower head either side! The hotel has a shuttle that goes to the grocery store and to the Fashion Mall opposite the Wynn so very convenient. I would definitely stay here when I come back to Vegas. Unlike other timeshare hotels we were not bothered about going to a presentation at all (just a few phonecalls) and the staff were extremely nice.

We were asked once - and only once - whether or not we would like to listen to a timeshare presentation.

The washer and dryer were small and a full load in the dryer took a long time to dry so I would suggest drying several small loads rather than one large one. The master bedroom is large and had one of Marriott's super comfortable beds. The shower in the master bath had dual shower heads. The living/dining room had a nice table for a meal and a large flat screen tv.There is only a small store with a limited selection of groceries onsite, so if you want to stock up, take advantage of the free shuttle to a nearby grocery store. There is valet parking only, but the valets were incredible. If we called down, the car was always waiting for us. If we didn't call first it took no longer than five minutes to get our car.

I have stayed in Marriott properties from the JW to the Fairfield Inn and I stay in Marriott properties because of the consistency in quality. However, I will never stay at the Grand Chateau again. I went to the property for a timeshare preview and received a smaller studio room. That was okay by me, although I would have preferred the larger one-bedroom. The property has some positives. It's hard to beat the location, although there is some construction noise during the day, it is not overbearing. You can easily walk across the street to Planet Hollywood and there are several casinos in walking distance. The rooms themselves are nice and the bathrooms are more than acceptable. My problem stems with the service. Maybe Vegas hotels can afford to be a little less than accomodating because people will always go there to visit and they are still building hotels left and right so if one properties doesn't get your business somebody else will certainly follow, especially on weekends. But I had a major problem with housekeeping in my room. I went out and when I came back the carpet around my kitchenette was soaked and the water seeped into my closet. Housekeeping left towels on the floor to soak up the water, but no explanation followed. We complained and the hotel moved us to a similar room (another studio) paid for cleaning the wet clothes in the closet. We were late for a dinner appointment because of the problem and were disappointed that we didn't get an upgrade in room for our troubles. We did complain to the manager the next morning and we got half off our room rate. That said, in a city known for comps, I don't understand why we didn't get a better room or get the room comped for one night. The night valet service was also lacking and very slow, even though there weren't many cars on a Sunday night. I am still loyal to Marriotts but next time I will go to the JW or Marriott Suites.

I was told that construction was going on and I heard it once and saw it once, but the entire Strip is under construction right now. Be advised: there are different types of one bedrooms. Make sure you know what you're getting. My room was small with an awesome king bed, small pull-out sofa, a roomy, nice bathroom and an efficiency kitchen with a microwave, sink, small fridge, coffee maker, plates, glassware, etc. There were only two of us and we weren't in Vegas for the hotel room, but if you think four adults can stay in that size room comfortably, think again. Two adults and a child could handle it. Oh, and I never actually saw a housekeeper and didn't have housekeeping \"tidy up\" because it costs extra $. Still, if you need extra towels, shampoo, soap, all you have to do is ask. There's a downstairs Market Place store selling all types of things and yes, it's pricey, but the new Vegas isn't cheap anymore. The days of Prime Rib and Lobster for $9.99 are gone, gone, gone.

It took 7 hours to get out there because of the stops (Hoover Dam, Route 66, getting gas, etc.) and 5 hours to get back. We were at the canyon for almost three hours. Worth it? Yes, especially if you have the time and don't want to pay $4.33 a gallon and drive almost 600 miles in a day. Actually, the tour was a nice break from the Strip. The pool on the 38th floor was small but well maintained. One gripe: no full-length mirrors anywhere. I \"complained\" and the concierge said \"that's the most common complaint we get here...\" (uh, then buy some?). Taxis are easy to get but walk as much as you can.

Although they are presently adding another wing to the hotel, we were never disturbed by the construction noise nor from the construction noise of the other properties going up around the hotel. We booked a two bedroom penthouse suite which consited of two closed bedrooms each with its own washroom, as well as a living room with a large flat screen tv and a large kitchen fully equiped (toaster, coffee machine, glasses, plates, etc) and also included granite counter tops and a washer and dryer. The hotel also provided us with soap and laundry detergent during our stay. As usual within the Marriott chain hotels, the beds were very comfortable and also had quality linens. It is also important to mention that this hotel is a timeshare hotel so if you wish to have someone come clean your room daily, it is for an extra fee. The hotel also has a rooftop pool and bar. The views are wonderful at night. The area is kept very clean and has lounge chairs for sunbathing.

As luck would have it, we happened to get the other side, a full 1 bedroom suite. The 1 bedroom suites are very nice. Not that I stay in a lot of luxury places, but I was very impressed. The room was comfortable in all ways. Being not attached to a casino, they're not trying to get you out of the room, so they have nice freebies not un-common in most cities, but not usually seen in Vegas hotels, such as free premium channels (such as HBO) and free WiFi. The Big Plasma screen was nice (the channel guide didn't work though) as well as the mini-stereo. The double shower was nice as well as the big soaking tub (was odd draining though, which could be the plumbing issues other people have mentioned.) The place was quiet, we didn't hear any construction or plumbing noise, but the AC was a bit noisy, no less than the AC units in other \"mainstream\" hotels though. As much as it was nice to have the kitchen, and as much as we planned on using it, we just didn't, but it was nice to have the option. We did use the fridge, it worked (shrug.) The pillows on the bed were a bit flat, but the front desk sent up a replacement (although we found out there were more in the closet for the pull out bed.) It was also nice to have the extra blankets in the closet since the comforter on the bed was thick and hot, the thinner blanket was perfect. We were on the 7th floor, facing the strip. No view to speak of, we could see the MGM sign, the Polo Club, construction, and part of the Belagio sign. At night though the construction view wasn't as bad, just twinkling lights and purple neon from the Polo Club. Short elevator ride though. From the roof pool though, that was a nice view. The weather was not so great (may 21st to 24th) when we were there, so the pool was closed the first day due to wind, which is probably the main down-side to a roof pool, but other things were closed in the area as well (Belagio fountains, Sirens of TI.) The lobby and exterior were nice; the mini-store was handy, although a bit expensive, but you pay for convenience. Von's (general supermarket) wasn't that far away if you have a car, we passed by it on the way to the Pinball Museum on Tropicana. There is no self parking, the Valet is the only thing to park on site, but they are fast and plenty courteous (they lost someone's keys while we were there, but took care of them well by paying for the locksmith and taxi's while they searched the area and videos to find the keys.) If you're going for a Timeshare presentation, be prepared for the presentation. I've been to a few and this one is on the nice side, but it's still sales. Plan on at least 2 hours, closer to 2.5 when you include waiting for them. The sales person we had was very personable and easy to talk to; they'll show you lots of options. (We didn't buy, but it looks like a decent deal, choose for yourself.) Checkout is a bit early for us at 10AM (well, early when you're in Vegas) but you may be able to get a late checkout, call early to find out or check the night before, they didn't have any available at 8:3AM when we called. This is a great location, fine with a car or not. We didn't have our car the first day, PH was right next door, simply across the street.

Good attitudes, good hustle, good service. No problems at check-in, a few minutes and I was headed to my room. Good bank of elevators, 6 total I believe. Never had to wait more than 30 seconds going up or down. Rooms are nice, with a nice layout and a decent \"kitchenette\" setup including a fridge, microwave, toaster, sink, plates, utensils, etc. Most important for me were the wine glasses and corkscrew.

At the Chateau its tough to have two people in this room. There isn't even a second mirror in the whole place. The area only accommodates a two person dining table but they squeezed in four chairs. We had to stack up two of the dining room chairs in a corner as they blocked the entrance door and the kitchen area. The Chateau itself does not call this a one-bedoom, but they allow Interval to keep booking this as a one-bedroom. If you know what a junior suite is at a Residence Inn, that is what it is.

MGC has a great location right next to Planet Hollywood (going by the lower case \u2018ph\u2019) which is almost done with the redecorating from the old Aladdin although the mall part still needs much work. There was no trouble getting a cab (my preferred means of transit) which was a big plus over other non-casino lodging. I could also walk to MGM but it was quite a walk and past some of the cheap trinket shops and a 24 hr Walgreens (also nice to have close by). - Room \u2013 First let me say that while I knew in advance that this was a timeshare/suite hotel, that did not prepare me for the size of the room. It was quite spacious! Fully stocked kitchen (I don\u2019t cook in Vegas when Chef Puck has so many choices for me!) along with a washer/dryer unit in the closet. King bed was very comfy. Double shower heads were fantastic and water pressure was good. Soaking tub was a great option on the last night when I wanted to wash all the Vegas dust off and prepare to return to the \u201creal\u201d world. There was some plumbing noise and the AC unit was louder than most. The outside of the windows were really dirty because of the construction outside. The windows blocked most of the construction noise from the ph tower that was being erected not 250 feet from my room! - Service \u2013 I only had my room cleaned once while I was there. Standard care, nothing extraordinary. The valets and bellmen were all really friendly and appreciated being tipped (who doesn\u2019t) but weren\u2019t as pushy as some can be in sin city! - \u201ctimeshare\u201d \u2013 I thought I was going to be overwhelmed with pushy sales people trying to get me to \u201ctake the tour\u201d and \u201cexperience the difference of ownership\u201d but that just didn\u2019t happen.

They have built only 1 of 3 towers to be located on this site, and presumably there will be a full complement of restaurant choices when complete, but not now. Only a 24 hr convenience shop with outrageous prices, even for Vegas (can you say $80 for a generic sweatshirt and a marriott logo, or $3 for a coke?).

The Lobby is very clean and smoke free with NO casino! This was a bonus since you do need some down time from all the noise and excitement of the Strip. Valet parking is also free. The room was huge. I had a Villa Suite. It was perfect and very clean. Plasma TV on the wall in the family room, a large kitchen with all the cabinets stocked, a full size fridge, oven, stove, microwave, double headed shower, and a sink and massive bathtub in the bed area. I had a guest that slept on the sofa which converted into a bed. He said it was one of the best nights sleep he had ever had. He could not believe that a sofa bed could be so comfortable, and I tried it and it was quite nice. The King size bed in the main room was also very comfortable and also included its own TV. Both rooms also had DVD players and you can rent movies down in the Lobby. They did a great job cleaning the rooms and even made up the sofa bed after the first night of using it. My favorite thing to do at Hotels is to use the fitness center and pool area. Let me tell you about the fitness center. It had all the equipment you could ever need and it was very clean. Plenty of TVs to watch on the treadmills and other equipment. The best part was the Locker room which included a huge steam room. I have never been in a steam room that was as efficient as this one. You could hardly see your hand if front of your face. It was magnificient! To top it off (no pun intended) , the Hotel decided to put a Pool, Hot Tub and Bar on the top of the Hotel. It was January, so I did not see anyone using the Heated Pool or Hottub. Well, I had a few friends join me at the pool. We enjoyed the Hot Tub for about an hour. It was so nice. Not one person bothered us because they were not there (and the hotel was completely booked!). The view was amazing. You could see the whole Strip from end to end. There were heating lamps out on a patio in front of the bar to keep you warm and smoking was allowed in a small area. The bar was closed because it was winter, but in the summer time it will be perfect.

Regarding the construction going on at nearby properties and at the Marriott property, I did not hear a single thing realted to construction. In fact I could not hear anything outside at all. The room is sealed very well. Keep in mind my room was facing the strip. If you face the opposite direction (towards the airport) you may hear something but I can not attest to that. I only have one complaint and this is because I am a technology enthusiast. They have beautiful HD Sony Plasma TV's in every room, however they are only delivering analog programming to every room. This blows me away. What a waste of a TV. There is no reason to have these TV's if they are not going to deliver High Definition content. In fact, this is not dificult to do either and would cost the hotel $0 since all the local TV stations broadcast Over the Air (received with an antenna) in High Definition and is FREE.

They have yet to build two more towers on this property so noise will be an on-going issue, but when we were there they were doing internal work on an existing tower so we heard no noise from our property. However the whole of Vegas is a construction zone and there was early morning noise (5am onwards) from a huge site across the Strip. Guests at areas of Bellagio, Polo Towers, ph , and Monte Carlo would have been more affected than us however. Grand Chateau is very nicely decorated and the suites are spacious. The pool is tiny but it was too cold to swim anyway! There is no restaurant on site but many within easy walking distance. We walked nearly everywhere because the traffic on the Strip made walking just about quicker than a cab! GC has a shuttle bus to and from the Fashion Show Mall several times a day and to a local supermarket once a day friday-tues I think (ie. the mornings after check-in days). We tried the Deuce bus once when we wanted to go downtown. Maybe we were unlucky but we found that we had to wait 20 minutes for a very crowded bus, and we got a cab back( after a lovely meal at Hugo's)! Also had a wonderful (traditional) Christmas lunch at The Verandah restaurant at the Four Seasons. Best turkey I've had (but don't tell my mother). As for shows, we loved Ka and Spamalot, and found Mac King (free if we bought a $9 drink, no-brainer!) side-achingly funny!

Yes, the maid service is extra but we made out fine with just getting towels and clean sheets with no problem. I know when you are on vacation you feel you should not have to clean up but I enjoyed my privacy. We did not have to worry about having someone come in our room everyday and distrub us if we just wanted to stay in. I love the Grand Chateau and would recommend it to anyone who inquired. Oh, and even though we did not have to do the timeshare presentation when they ask we decided to see what it was about. They were not pushy after we told them we did not think it was for us.

Bellagio is only a 15 minute walk as is Paris, MGM Grand, and New York New York and others. The Marriott is non-smoking which is great especially after hanging around all those smoky casinos.

However the price was also a little above average. We had a 1 bedroom villa which included a measter bedroom with king bed, a sofa sleeper in the living room (where the kids slept), a small but full kitchen, and a dining table. The extra nice things were: The entire property is 100% total non-smoking! Great for a non-smoking family that does not wish to smell smoke filled rooms, or smoke permeated carpet, furniture or linens, pillows, etc. The bathroom has 2 vanities, each with it's own sink. Also, there is a large soaking tub (our kids loved taking baths), and a seperate shower with 2 shower heads. On the down side: During a 6 night stay we only had the daily towel exchange, and the beds made -- which was include in \"the daily tidy-up service\" -- that was free of charge. Our bed linens were not changed once! The floor was not swept nor vaccummed. The bath tub and shower not cleaned once. To have the room cleaned once we would have had to pay over $100. for the basic cleaning that usually included free of charge at every other hotel I've ever stayed in. Since this was my vacation I was not going to clean the room myself. Why we decided not to buy into the timeshare program: Simple, we figured out that it was a scam. We had paid $1,295. months in advance for a 6 nigh 7 day vacation. Thats a little over $200. a night. Over $200. a night was a bit pricey for Las Vegas during the \"off season - work week\" Sunday - Friday stay. Other places had much better deals for the money. Everything was over priced! My husband bought a cheap brand \"trial-sized\" can of shave crream that actually read \"not for resale\" from the store next to the lobby for $5. What was really alarming and made us decide NOT to buy was the outrageous prices added (not included) for a basic cleaning service(s) that was charged to vacation club owners every day. Combine the excessive yearly maintenance fees + daily cleaning fees + $25,000 (with interest) = rip off scam! As if the $25,000 wasn't enough, by the time you add the daily cleaning fees together with the yearly maintenance fees you'd be paying well over $100. a day for a vacation you already paid for in advance. In the long run you save no money buying into a timeshare with Marriott.

You are only a half block from the strip and located next to Planet Hollywood (formerly Aladdin). You are very close to NYNY, MGM, Bellagio and Paris. The best bit of advice we picked up on this site was regarding show tickets. Do not buy in advance. Just up the street from the Marriott in the Hawaiian square shopping area is a kiosk that sells 2 for 1 show tickets. They open everyday at 11:00am and have a monitor which lists the available shows and prices. Most are 1/2 price, but some of the more popular shows are available at 1/3 off. All of the shows were available when we were there...Carrot Top, Mamma Mia, Zumanity, etc. Unless you are not flexible or are absolutely set on one particular show, you should definitely buy tickets from the kiosk.
