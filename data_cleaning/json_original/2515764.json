Typically we stay with family or friends when we\u2019re in town but now that we have a little girl (1 \u00bd yrs old) we find it easier for us, and our family, to have our own space. Growing up in Carlsbad I\u2019ve always noticed this hotel tucked away in the cul-de-sac but never really gave any notice. Now that they have remodeled the exterior and interior they\u2019ve turned this once drab space in to a shining gem. As my title says its all about location and this hotel has it. Walking distance to everything Carlsbad has to offer. It\u2019s a bit of a distance to the beach so if you\u2019re trucking all your kids stuff, and in my case, kids stuff, and my surfboard. My suggestion is bring a folding wagon or cart. That might be a good thing the hotel could offer their guest. Have a couple wagons on hand to loan out to guest with families. Hopefully they read this and pick up a few of them at Costco. As far as the rooms they were very nice. I noticed a couple things they could have improved which is the reason I\u2019m giving them a 4 rather then a 5 rating. If you\u2019re going to update an entire hotel with new furniture, carpet, paint and so on. Why not get rid of the dirty popcorn ceilings? Yes I know there is extra cost involved, but to have all brand new then look up to see an old, dirty popcorn ceiling threw me off. The other thing that stood out to me was the bed. They had new, modern looking bedding but no bed skirt. The box spring was a bit beat and it really stood out. This is an easy fix which would make the room so much nicer. The rest of the room was great. The kitchen came in handy since we had the baby and could easily fix her meals. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel doesn\u2019t have a regular cleaning schedule so if you want your room turned its by request. We never requested the cleaning service but did request towels and dish soap for the kitchen now and then. They were there in a flash with no waiting. If you\u2019re like us and arriving via your own car I would suggest bringing your bikes if you have them. The hotel is walking distance to just about everything but next time we\u2019re bringing the bikes for sure. There are a couple places in town that rent bikes for the day or week so that\u2019s always an option as well. We had a great stay at Extended Stay and will definitely be returning again.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cThe best!!!\u201d", "Author": "Edsan_12", "ReviewID": "UR139117512", "Content": "Very clean and courteous staff.

We landed around 8:30 pm and got our car and drove to the hotel. When we arrived we were tired from our flight and just wanted to go to sleep (due to the 3 hour time change coming from NJ). We got the lobby and we smelled smoke, no big deal. When we got to the reception area check-in was quick and she was very pleasant, then she said it and this is the only reason I gave 4 and not 5 points. She said the lobby is closing soon and if you have any problems call the police. Well my wife (holding our 4 year old song) her eyes bugged clear out of her head! When we got back to our room I got hit with 20 questions. \"What did she mean?\" \"What problems will we have?\" \"Does she know something?\" I calmed her down and we enjoyed our evening. I am not mad at her, or the hotel I actually appreciate the warning.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa", "Title": "\u201cBeach trip for a good value\u201d", "Author": "LMC76", "ReviewID": "UR133403257", "Content": "Nice value for beach trip.
