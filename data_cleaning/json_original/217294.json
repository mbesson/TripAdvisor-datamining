It was so noisy the first night (Saturday) sleeping was difficult. Went to the drug store and bought ear plugs the next day, which really helped. If you go, ask for a room away from the main streets. Also, because there are no screens on any of the windows, mosquitoes abound in the hallways. Have to enter/exit the room quickly else the mosquitoes would get into the room. Didn't realize it and got bitten numerous times the first night. Finally had to get up, tracked down, and kill the two mosquitoes in the room. The low flow toilets do not flush well, and we'll leave it at that. The upside are that the room was cheap and clean, and the hotel was next to Chinatown with lots of good cheap places to eat.", "Date": "Sep 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR937275796", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "travelorca"}, {"Content": "Avoid I was very disappointed with the hotel. The staff are RUDE. I have not encounter such rudest people in the world. The hallway is very scary and dark and smelly. Room is small and the surrounding area is noisy. There are lots of homeless people around the area and some could even walk in to the lobby. The facade is always on renovation. I was told by the guard that this is more like an apartment for long term stay than a hotel. The guard also tell me that you better decide to stay or to go somewhere else, afterall we are paying and we should pay for what we like. To stay or not to stay? If you think you cant afford to pay any extra, by all means you stay here. It's a very convenient area but not safe.

It's so cheap (around 25$ per night), i've got my own room with a good bed, two lights, a fridge, a microwave, a washbasin, a desk, a huge mirror, a big window, a medecinechest, a tv (70channels), a closet, drawers, your own phone... It's not really spacious but, considering the weather, i spend a lot of time in my room and i appreciate it. You can fix the radiator as you want, there is a lot of plugs. It's really clean, each day there are 2 women who change the towels and clean the room (they're so nice that they've ask me when do i prefer they come, and how often). There is a lot of restrooms and bathrooms, always cleans and spacious. When i arrived someone from the staff helped me to carry my luggages. The entire staff was not so nice at the beggining but now they're cool, all the night they've got a security person. Each room has it own mail-box. There is a cheap laundry room in the building. And the place is really cool, it's between the financial area with all the shops, subways/BART and everything, and North Beach, a really nice italian area. The location of the hotel is close to china town, but safe. The only thing is that the people inside are not very friendly but who care, if you need to, go to the club med. And you have to pay the entire price of your stay when you arrive. I don't know about the others rooms, but the third floor is really cool, and i've got the sun each morning by the window (when the weather is cool).", "Date": "Jan 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR520159426", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "French_Jess"}, {"Content": "Best Value in the Area I stayed at the St. Paul twice for 4 nights each period while I was in between apartment leases. Booked another site for the second time, but was unhappy with it and returned to the St. Paul. The hotel is nothing lavish, but certainly met my needs in terms of basic accomodations and value for the money. You will not find a better place (location, private rooms, etc.) in SF. I rarely saw other guests or the resident crazies that you can get in other budget hotels. Hotel: Basic appointments, relatively small but clean rooms, excellently maintained shower and bath areas, microwave, fridge and TV with many channels, wifi and laundry facilities. Renovations are underway with the lobby, restrooms/showers, and some guest rooms completed. Ask about rooms 18, 27, 28 if you would like a more tranquil spot (not facing the street). These rooms have also been updated.Location: In Northbeach, bordering the Financial district.

My main priority was to find a cheap hotel near the conference venue and close to the centre. The hotel is probably not the 5* and you most probably won't get Thai massage from the personnel but if you need a place to sleep, to keep your stuff and relax for cheap, then the place is perfect. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. There is a supermarket about 5-10 minutes walk from the place.

The staffers a Joe and Patrice are surly, and you just know they hated being in the public. When I asked for an extra blanket they said I had one, although I told them I wanted another one. I was begrudenly given a smoked hole rag for a blanket. I left with fleas. After many many complaints I was finally moved after I asked for the manager.
