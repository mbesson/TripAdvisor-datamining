Email them first & they will tell you which apt you are being put in, this will make it easier for the taxi to find the right hotel. We were in 3 so can only comment on this one. Rooms were cleaned daily & as advertised in the book,reception spoke very good English & were helpful when asked a question. Take an ethernet cable if you are taking a laptop, reception will provide one but they tend to be quite short. Breakfasts were fine with lots of choice & nice coffee/tea, we were usually early & it wasn't busy at this time can't comment on how busy it gets later in the morning. Using the pool involves timing it with the sun, it tends to get quite a bit of shade from other hotels, as in most things it's all about timing. Make sure the aircon works OK because you will need it at night,any problems report it straight away to reception. Don't use the taxi outside the hotel, they are nicer cars but you pay a premium. The many taxis that drive up & down the streets are OK & cheaper. The metro is the way to go in getting around Dubai, the main station is in the centre of a junction probably a mile away,this can seem a lot further in the heat of the day :-) The nearest stop is quite near to the hotel,straight opposite reception up the side streets & you will come to the main drag,to the right you will see the station above the road, it looks very futuristic. I would start off with the main station where you get your travel card which you can top up as you use it. Using the Metro will get you to the malls very quickly & in aircon too.The Dubai Mall will involve a short bus journey from the terminal to the mall, same card can be used on this trip too. This mall also has the entrance to the Burj Khalifa. Do go see the fountains at the bottom of the Khalifa at night. Overall a very good trip,well it was our honeymoon...

Location is ok not far from a big supermarket (Spinneys, open 24hrs) & metro station (very clean & since it is over ground you can actually have a great view of the city while travelling). Staff was just ok, sometimes a bit overbearing: as soon as you stepped foot outside the hotel they kept asking you if you needed help even if you were perfectly fine, but when you actually needed their help it was a different story: I had to call a few times for different things broken in our room and never got fixed! The room itself was just ok, not luxurious but not bad either, the 2 major problems were the bathroom being very old& very dirty (it should be changed completely) and the fact that cleanliness was not their major strength. Reading through the reviews on this site I understood that the cheapest taxi were the yellow ones so I was looking for them, the way it works is that all taxi are creamy colour, the only difference is the roof, the yellow taxi are the national ones. If you catch a taxi from the airport the price starts from 20aed, while if you stop it on the street it\u2019s only 4. So we paid 50aed from the airport to the hotel and only 23 from the hotel to the airport. During the day both subway & buses are very convenient, cheap and clean so after buying a metro card (which you can use both on trains & buses) we used it for our entire stay.

I arrived early due to flight timings so was asked to wait in the foyer until my room was available (3 hours or so) but the staff were happy to secure my luggage until the room was free and so I decided to go take a walk to the nearby shop to get some things in for the room (bread, milk etc). On returning 20 minutes later I found my luggage still beside the reception desk but with a label on it with my name - not the security I was expecting! I actually got my room after only another hour of waiting and still before the normal 2pm time so that was good. The room was very spacious and had a huge bed. There was a shower, not bath, and the kitchenette area was well designed with adequate worktop space for food preparation. There was sufficient pots, pans, crockery and utensils available for 4 people. In addition there was a microwave, fridge, electric hob and a washer/dryer. The in-room safe was large enough for a laptop to be secured. Wired internet (free) is available and is surprisingly fast and far better than I have found in other hotels in Dubai. The TV shows some English language channels including BBC World news and Fox Movies. I took a tour of the building facilities to see if it matched the brochure. There is a small pool which is next to a restaurant and the gym. All 3 are on the 1st floor with the pool being outside on a sun terrace. There are 7 floors in total which does affect the amount of hours the sun can reach that area but even in February it was fine from about 9am - 3pm. The gym is well stocked with modern machinery including 3 treadmills, 2 rowers, a bike, plenty of loose weights and a couple of weight machines. There is plenty of water available but you will need to take your own towel. The restaurant serves breakfast, a daily BBQ by the pool, and an evening all-you-can-eat buffet from 6:30pm - 10pm (AED 69 pp) The only complaint I have for the room is that the dryer function of the washing machine did not work and when I complained to the Housekeeping they sent an engineer to my room who twiddled some knobs, pushed some buttons, opened and closed the door and declared it perfectly serviceable. I disagreed as I had run 3 cycles and I still had wet clothes in there. He went away and came back 15 minutes later with a replacement machine. This impressed me until a fellow guest at the hotel came along to my room and asked the mechanic where his washing machine had gone from his room (next door!). End result was I got my clothes dried eventually and my neighbour got a new machine and a bowl of fruit. Overall, the Golden Sands 3 was a perfectly adequate apartment with daily room cleaning and towel exchange. Facilities are good, if slightly dated in places, but still good value. The location is very handy for the shops, restaurants, and entertainment with a decent sized supermarket (Spinney's) within a 5 minute walk and 3 English-themed sports bars within 10 minutes. The Metro is also 5 minutes walk to get you to the main Malls. Be aware that there are Golden Sands 1 - 10 and this review is only for Golden Sands 3. I have also stayed at Golden Sands 5 during this trip and a separate review is available for that. I'm writing this review in my room at GS 5 and will save you the trouble by saying already that GS 3 rooms are better than GS 5 but not by much.

First one must understand that Golden Sands is a group of individual buildings, each offering separate services. The only co-operation is that if you stay in one, you may use the facilities of the others (like indoor pool in one, rooftop pool in another, gym, wi-fi, etc.) Golden Sands no. 10 is located on the southern edge of the area, close to a 24x7 supermarket, and with a pool in the centre of a building creating a square around it. Apartments either give on the pool or the street, most (but not all) have balcony (large ones) and are both spacious, clean and reasonably equipped with furniture. Kitchenware is just enough to get you through the day, but only just. You should either bring your own bread knife of buy the cheapest one in the supermarket (18 AED). There is internet by cable in all rooms, only wi-fi close to the reception. There is also a coffee shop but none of us used it, having the cheap supermarket nearby. There is a desk for car rental and easy access to a tour desk in Golden Sands no. 3. Staff is friendly and helpful, making sure that you get all the information and understand it. Also they can arrange for taxis or limo's, also for a day tour (we paid 600 AED for 11 hours in a 4x4 that took 7 persons, wnet to Abu Dhabi with us and were very helpful).

After that experience, we decided to go to the supermaket to get breakfast. My daughter thinks it was a bit far to walk to the metro station. But for families without kids, the 15 min. walk is no problem. It is about 10-15 min. walk from Burj juman center, where you have different restaurants. There are two pool areas, one next to the restaurant. It is very small, and a lot of pigeons poo around it, so not that pleasant. We used the pool on the rooftop, it was big and had a lifeguard that was looking over it (almost all the time). My daughter loved the pool, and I had problems getting here up. The downside on the pool, was that the tiles/floor around it, where the sunbeds where, was dirty. So when you got up of the pool, and walked to your sunbed, your feets where black underneath. There where not enough sunbeds, to all of the persons wanting to use them.

I would NOT use this place as a hotel for a few days but when in town for 2-3 weeks it makes total sense since being in the same hotel for that length of time can drive you round the bend.

I read many reviews on this site, but decided to ignore the more negative comments. First huge negative is the fact that although they knew I was arriving very early as did many other travelers my room would not be ready until 12pm at the earliest.My husband and I did have a wander round the block and into a nearby shop but after such a long flight we were just to tired.We sat in the hotel lobby for hours and not once did anyone say anything to us. We were allowed to go upstairs to the coffee shop which was fine but we were quickly told and rather abruptly that we would happy to pay for our cup of coffee.Eventually we were given our key card and shown to our room.On first impression it looked OK and I use the term loosely.We started to have a look around and it was the bathroom that got me the most, it was filthy with impregnated grime. The tiles had never seen a cleaner or bleach before, infact I used a few of my face wipes to clean some of the tiles which were black with mildew. There was a metal soap dish attached by 1 screw in the shower.The whole bathroom looked thrown together and about 20 years old and just left to rot. The kitchen area wasn't great but served its purpose.If you intend to buy food and do some sort of cooking then make sure you bring some dishcloths and a tea towel as you are not provided with any.You do have a washing machine,microwave,kettle and a 2 ring stove, sadly no toaster which i missed as the bread here is lovely.For some reason you are only given 3 of everything, except we only had 1 glass and one of our saucers had been glued together. On reading other reviews about stealing and prostitution and cant say I had that problem. The area is perfectly safe and had no problem with leering and unfriendly people. We never ate in the hotel so cant comment on the food, however we did eat at the 4 points just round the corner on the street running parallel, it has 3 restaurants but we only ate at yesterday pub, where we also watched F1 on the big screen.Fabulous mixed grill and burgers. Buy your coffee,milk etc at spinneys just up the road,very reasonably priced and they sell pork. Taxis are easily flagged down on the street(cheaper than the hotel taxi)20dhs to dubai mall,40dhs to emirates mall.Buy a all zone metro card,17dhs(under\u00a33.00)lovely and smooth and clean. If you get a chance try a trip to Hatta to the hotel there it was lovely and peaceful and the drive through the desert and mountains makes a nice change to buildings,also see the camels roaming around.(Take your passport as you pass into oman territory for a few miles) All in all this has been a good trip and I certainly haven't let the poor standards of the hotel let it spoil it.

I live in a villa in Mirdif and my wife has just given birth to a baby girl in the past 10 days. Due to some electrical failures at home\u00a0 which caused the airconditioning and water pumps to fail, and the fact that maintenance teams are only able to come tomorrow, we were forced to take lodgings in a service apartment. We subsequently booked ourselves into Golden Sands 10- party of 5 adults - wife, the maid, the in-laws who are visiting from Malaysia,myself and 2 children - the newborn and my 2 yr old daughter. Whilst checking in, we were told that passports are needed for the check-in. My immediate family and maid had all our documents but my in-laws didn't bring theirs - left at home in our rush check in. I was on the way back to secure the documents. What we had requested was for them to check in first - there were 2 young children and a mother who has just given birth. Meanwhile, I would be coming back within an hour tops with the passports. The management of Golden Sands 10 refused despite the situation. I cannot understand why such strict requirements are enforced with absolutely no thought. My family was left in the lobby for an entire hour until we could not take it and we subsequently chose a hotel. This is the kind of service that is being offered in Dubai and I am sad that it is being offered by such a good company - or so I thought. (ARENCO). the wife and I were previous tenants at golden sands 2 and had hoped that some semblance of common sense would prevail but it had not. I will be sharing this complaint with all and sundry. There are other providers out there and there is no doubt that I will dissuade others from using the Golden Sand's services.

We were on the second floor and whilst I would have liked to be on a higher floor I gave up asking them because all the room are exactly the same. There isn't much of a view anyway as you are surrounded by other buildings around you. I booked my stay through Expedia and when I arrived I did have to charge my card as a guarantee only but payment for my stay was already completed before we arrived. On arrival the bell boy takes all your bags up for you. You receive an electronic key for your room and you even need the key to call for the lift. The room had a small kitchen area and utensils are provided. There is a safe, a coat rack, a large fridge and freezer, a washing machine kettle (coffee and tea topped up daily) and a microwave. The bathroom is of decent size too with a large mirror, soaps are provided, toilet, bidet and a shower space with a shower curtain. The shower is quite powerful. The towels are changed daily. There were two single beds with two night stands and lamps, a telephone, about 2 or 3 pillows each, a desk with writing paper and 1 postcard, a pen, a chair for the desk, a very large mirror above the desk. There were also two chest of drawers and a TV with lots of channels. There is also an area which could be considered as your lounge. The was a 3 person sofa as well as 2 person sofa and a decent sized coffee table. There is a box of tissues there too. There was also a small table with 2 chairs which could be used to dine. The balcony is very small but you can fit a chair outside but not much else can be done there. The sofas are comfortable for sitting or falling asleep on and the beds are also quite comfortable. The curtains are quite heavy and thick so it keeps the hot sun out of the room in the morning. There is a restaurant in the building and the opening hours and the menu is in the room. There is a wide selection for you to choose from. If the restaurant is closed you can order food for your room. I think it but I cannot remember. I ordered once from there and my brother went to the restaurant to eat. The food portion is of decent size and the prices are \"reasonable\" however, the majority of the food sold there can be bought by places in close vicinity for half the price. You should not be put off by small labour looking places as the food in these places are something the best. The \"Karachi Darbar\" chain is excellent if you want to try Indian/Pakistan food. There is a pool on the rooftop which shuts about 8 or 10pm. I went there once and came straight back because it was filled with people all over the place trying to catch the sun and there was nowhere for me to leave my stuff as even the floor space was occupied by sunbathers. There is another pool on the 3rd floor I think which is quite small and looked like a much shallow pool. The area around it is quite large and the gym is also located here. My brother used the gym almost every day. They do not provided any sponge or washing up liquid so if you want it washed, leave it in the sink for the housekeepers. The apartment offer Internet but you have to ask at reception of a cable lead as the service is not wireless. The connection is pretty good. If you need a hair dryer, you need to request for it. There is also a business centre but we bought our own laptops so we did not make use of this facility. The nearest Metro station is the BurJuman station which takes approximately 15 minutes to get to. Taxis are a convenient way to travel but there is a minimum 10 dirham fare. We used the metro a lot and even if our final destination is not close to the nearby place, we still went by metro and then caught a taxi because if you caught a taxi directly from the hotel, it would have cost much more. Taxis from the airport have a minimum fare of 20 dirhams. There is a grocery store directly opposite the road if you want to buy milk, drinks, crisps, cornflakes, mobile top ups etc or there is a Spinneys supermarket about 5 minutes walk away as well. You cannot buy alcohol is shops in Dubai and the apartments do not sell alcohol. You will have to go to a bar or a hotel bar or a club. Beer is approximately 30 dirhams (\u00a36) so I suggest you buy your booze from the airport on arrival. You can get crates from beer from the airport. If you find the cigarettes you smoke at the airport duty free on arrival, I suggest you buy it then as it beats looking for a local shop when you are out and about. If you want a SIM card whilst you are in Dubai, you can buy this from the airport. The operator is called \"du\" and you can find more information from their website. It take 1 hour to activate and comes with pre-paid credit.

Our initial stay was for a day and we were provided complementary mineral water bottle in apartment and while I extended the stay for two days the similar benefit did not come, the reasoning being that it is complementary for first day but not subsequent (let me clarify that, it was not a package deal but per night tariff). Then while checking in the hotel announcement board mentioned that the internet is free and also the breakfast at coffee shop. I was given the internet on asking but was denied the breakfast when I went to check the same on fourth day of stay (at the time of checking out) that it is not applicable on my tariff, which made embarrassed standing at coffee shop.

I am still unable to understand the logic behind this, since when you engage a 2 bedroom apartment which is fit for 4 persons and while also having vacant capacity why one should be asked to pay extra, at the same time a european guest was seen walking happily to his room with 5 guests. The staff at the reception was rude and had problems after problems for any issues. The end of all problems for them was extra money, which seems to be their only mandate while managing the reception area. The free parking for guests at the hotel advertised in brochure is free but on full tariff. So a good hotel with a bad management. can be avoided as there are several hotel apartment which are equally good for location and other things .", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cProbably the best value hotel we've stayed in!\u201d", "Author": "cammyxxoo", "ReviewID": "UR105505219", "Content": "We stayed at the Dubai Golden Sands 3 for three nights during a stopover on our way to Morocco.

When we couldn't get it working, someone came straight up and started it for us! The room was spacious and comfortable with couches and a dining table. The bathrooms were clean. The staff were extremely helpful. The only downside was that we couldn't use our balcony because of a pigeon nest in the eaves - droppings everywhere! Golden Sands 3 (and the rest of the complex) is about a 10 minute walk to the Dubai Creek and the Souks.

We arrived from our Emirates flight very early getting to the hotel at about 7:30 am. We had only paid for one night and were going to leave the luggage there until check in at 2pm. The hotel staff allowed us to immediately check in from 7:30 am without needing to pay a night (ofcourse this was probably subject to the room being available) Also, he knew we needed to check out by 5am the next day so the front desk staff encouraged us to use our free breakfast on the day we arrived. We never got to try this though as we had to leave for Dubai Mall for our ticket to Burj Khalifa. We paid for the queen bed studio apartment. It was a large and clean room. My only issue would be (and I'm not sure if it's like this everywhere in Dubai) the toilet water was way too high in the toilet bowl. I mean if you saw that back home, you might think the toilet was blocked. But the toilet worked fine in the hotel. The staff are incredibly helpful people and our feeling from our experience there is customer is always first. Put it this way, they will never allow you to open doors or carry your luggage yourself. They will always go to you and offer their help.

Our flight arrived in Dubai at 8am and although check in wasn't until 2pm (I think) we were allowed straight to our room. Our room was spacious and was equipped with fridge, freezer, washing machine, cutlery, etc. We also had a balcony (no chairs or table). Great Aircon. The bathroom could do with an update but other than that the apartment was in good condition. We had a problem with our key card and were moved to another room (with a bigger bed) and given a complimentary fruit basket for our trouble. We were slightly worried about things we had heard about Dubai before we left (e.g. It being illegal for unmarried couples to share hotel rooms) however the staff at Golden Sands were lovely and helpful and didn't question us about this. Out of respect if we were asked by anyone else in Dubai we just said we were married . Room service was also good and relatively cheap. Overall I would stay here again. Although you have to take a taxi most places (which are cheap enough) I think it's a better option than spending hundred of pounds more to stay in Jumeira. The hotel itself is in Bur Dubai and is approximately 20 minutes from the airport (30DHS), 10 minutes from Dubai Mall (15DHS), 20 minutes from Mall of Emirates/Burj Al Arab (35DHS) and about 30 minutes from Atlantis (55DHS). There are approx 10 Golden Sands in the same area - we stayed in Golden Sands 3. Don't expect a good view from the balcony - just a view of the other Golden Sands. This hotel is perfect for a city break/beach but do not come for honeymoon etc there are far more luxurious places. Tip 1) do not use the taxis (unmarked) parked outside the hotel - turn left and hail a Dubai Taxi as they're cheaper Tip 2) Go to the book shop in Dubai Mall and buy a book called \"The Entertainer\". This book is full of BOGOF vouchers for hundreds of restaurants and attractions in Dubai induing Atlantis, the Snow Park and Dolphins. The book cost \u00a350 but we saved over \u00a3230 between the two of us in a week. Tip 3) Change your sterling spending money in the mall as exchange rate was 5.8 (better than UK at 5.4. Tip 4) Go to 360 bar near Jumeira Beach Resort - stunning views Tip 5) Book the Burj Khalifa online before you go as it costs 100 DHS rather than 400 DHS on the day. Tip 6) Men should take jeans, shirt and shoes to get in some of the restaurants. Women are fine with strappy tops. Tip 7) It was hard to find a lot of nightlife or anywhere to get a beer. We liked the Hilton (Dubai Marina), 360 bar (Jumeira Beach Resort), Waxy O'Connors (Bur Dubai), Irish Village (Bur Dubai), Barrasti (near Dubai Marina).", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancashire", "Title": "\u201cBasic Hotel Appartments on a budget\u201d", "Author": "mih1954", "ReviewID": "UR83955443", "Content": "Firstly when you get your booking confirmed make sure you know which block you have been allocated.

I agree with others that the bathrooms could do with refurbishing , but the rest of the room is lovely . there is a really nice little restaurant just around the corner ,Good reasonably priced food , good service & nice and close it's just past the little supermarket , which is also handy and cheap for the things you need for your room . It isn't the most convenient of locations , not close to the rail system at all , but there are plenty of taxis around . Just be careful when you walk out the door and the doormen ask you if you want a taxi , they aren't doormen , they don't help you with your luggage , they are drivers employed by the sands and while they are friendly and helpful if you hire them , they are much more expensive than a normal taxi ...so if you want a normal taxi , grab one yourself .

When we walked in it was surprisingly large, the living room was spacious with a TV and some decent channels with english films and bbc world news channel also with 2 sofas. Dining room table was large - enough for 8 people. The kitchen was well equipped with cutlery and plates/cups etc, fridge freezer a cooker and oven, kettle and microwave. There was a long hallway to get to the bedrooms, there were 2 rooms with 2 single beds each plus 2 bathrooms and one master bedroom with queen size bed at the end of the hallway with an ensuite bathroom. Bedrooms were large and clean with a considerable amount of wardrobe space and a chest of drawers. Bathrooms were OK, could have been abit cleaner but average on the whole. The apartment was cleaned daily but I don't think the bed linen was changed everyday. It was still reasonably clean and we didn't expect an apartment to be serviced anyway. The reception staff were helpful and the bellboys were attentive and friendly. The hotel lobby was nice and there was a pc to check emails etc - although a bit slow. There was also a pool, sauna, gym, squash court and table tennis available. We didn\u2019t eat in the restaurant as we were self-catering but there was a large supermarket called Spinneys across the road from the hotel which we used a lot and was really handy! It had everything we needed there as well as a food deli to buy things like ready cooked pastas, roast chicken, salad, rice, spring rolls, samosas which was good when we wanted to eat in the evening. Through Spinneys there\u2019s also a McDonalds and foreign exchange place that had a good exchange rate. The hotel was in a good location in Bur Dubai and was fairly quick to get to places. Taxis are cheap and frequent outside the hotel. A tip is to use the yellow taxis rather than normal ones as the fare starts off at 3 dhs whereas some others start higher at something like 7 dhs. The BurJuman shopping mall is about 5 minutes walk and is a really nice place to go and the main road has some good food places from Pizza Hut to Indian restaurants and one in particular we enjoyed was called Sukh Sagar - a really tasty vegetarian restaurant. The hotel is really close to Dubai Creek. Also really close to the airport - about 10 - 15minutes taxi ride. Not too far from Jumeirah beach which is so lovely and the big shopping malls \u2013 some of which are Dubai Mall which has an excellent aquarium where you can even feed the fish, Deira City Centre, Mall of the Emirates where you can visit Ski Dubai \u2013 really good fun \u2013 and Ibn Batuta Mall, influenced by other countries in the world like China, Egypt, Tunisia and more. We did the Night bus tour which was 2 hours and takes you round most of Dubai and you can see the main destinations in Dubai. We also visited the Palm Jumeirah which is a must see. We took a train costing just 25 dhs which runs above the island and you can see the famous Atlantis Hotel and great views of the city. Overall our stay at Golden Sands was very pleasant and I would recommend this to people who are looking for an affordable place to stay rather than people looking for something luxurious.

From a practical standpoint, we didn't want to arrive at our planned 'luxury' hotel near midnight just to end up paying a few hundred dollars and checking out the next morning. We were booked at the Golden Sands #3. There are 10 of these Golden Sands Hotels in the area, 3 of which are for short term hotel stays. If you are booking through an agency or online, remember to ask which one you are booked for. Even though they are all within close proximity, you will save a lot of time, energy, and cab fare by knowing from the start which one to go to. Upon arrival we found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. They were also multilingual which we appreciated since we only speak English. We were treated courteously at all times. We found our room to be unusually spacious and very clean. It was 'L' shaped which defined the living and sleeping areas. There was a kitchen area with the usual amenities such as dishes, water, coffee, tea, etc. We ordered late night room service and my finicky teenagers found the food to be very good! There was a washer/dryer. Our balcony overlooked the pool area. Air conditioning kept us comfy. There was wifi in the room as well as a business center near the lobby. The hallways were quiet even though next morning I noted numerous families with young children Our mattresses were firm so we slept well. There was also a sofa bed in the room. Before checking out of the hotel, we took a walk around the neighborhood. There were numerous hotels and apartments in the area as well as a shopping mall with a grocery store. This hotel is not on or near a beach. Your room key will also work the elevator. We appreciated the fact that only guests could take the elevator. By the way, Dubai is on the list of safest places to vacation. This is not a luxury hotel but it is a very basic, safe and comfortable hotel.

Whilst the apartments probably do meet their 3 star rating based on the facilities available and size, certainly Golden Sands 3 is in need of refurbishment if our apartment was anything to go by. Whilst it does have a few bonuses such as your own kitchen complete with washer dryer it equally had some more worrying issues like a very basic bathroom really showing signs of wear and tear and not what I would expect from a modern 3 star. Another more worrying issue is that whilst every one of the apartments, and there are 7 floors of them in each block, there is no sign of any smoke detection in case of an emergency anywhere in the room or corridors. With the combination of cooking facilities and no detection this is surely a recipe for disaster at some point when a tourist isn't careful in the kitchen. Other issues are that the general use PC's for accessing the internet are in permenent use, I only saw two occasions when one of the three PCs was available in 5 days. Equally the advertised bus to the beach was permanently fully booked. The restaurant is very basic and not that impressive and combined with the 'dry' no alcohol policy in the hotel isn't that well used. The pool is small but warm but unfortunately is positioned between the blocks and so the sun is shaded from about 14:30 in December so not much good for sunbathing. On a high note if you want a decent restaurant try the 4 points Sheraton around the corner which equally has a bar (although \u00a35 per pint).

Checked in, but had to wait an hour before our room was ready (we arrived before the normal check-in time). The apartment itself was spacious, clean, plenty of closet space. As others have noted, it included a cook-top, microwave, refrigerator, and washer/dryer. They also gave us 1 bottle of water as well as daily coffee (instant, but ok) and tea packets. The housekeeping staff took care of all clean up of utensils and cookware, which was a nice touch, as well as replacing towels and general tidying of the apartment. Internet access at the cafe worked well after I set my wireless modem to be on 802.11g mode only -- if you don't do this, you will get horrendous lag and really slow speeds as it bumps you down to the slower wireless modes. The location is pretty good, being about a 15 minute walk from Bur Juman mall and Spinneys supermarket. This is a pretty grueling walk in the heat though, so during my trip, we left early in the morning and we had a route that would keep us in the shade almost the entire way. Bur Juman mall became our \"home base\" for getting a sit-down breakfast (usually at Paul's cafe by the entrance of the mall) as well as transportation (taxi stand is at the entrance, also Dubai Metro stop is on the other end of the mall). My only complaint with my stay is that the hotel front desk staff were basically useless. They couldn't recommend any places to eat around the area and they referred me to calling information over the phone or looking at the yellow pages. They paced around the front desk area look for papers to shuffle through to dodge having to deal with hotel guests. That's right, they do an incredible amount of paper shuffling for a hotel in the computer-internet age. Would I recommend this place? Yes, for either a (1) budget accommodation with good bang for the buck or (2) for someone that is not a beach person.

From the research we did, we found that this was the cheapest hotel we could find in the expensive city of Dubai. We paid about $175 USD for a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom. It was quite spacious - there was a kitchen (complete with W/D) area and a living room area with sofas and a dining table. There were 2 single beds in the corner by one bathroom and then there was a seperate bedroom with a double bed that also had its own bathroom. So technically, there was only 1 true bedroom and the other 2 beds were more like in the open area (no door separating this area from the living room/kitchen). Postives: it was clean, spacious, came with a free bottle of water (we were informed not to drink the tap water), and also had free internet in the lobby. Negatives: mattress was pretty hard. We also had a negative experience with the hotel car. We went to check out and stepped outside to hail a cab to the airport and the hotel car driver came running up to us and assured us that he was using the meter and quoted us a reasonable price to the airport, which we agreed to. As soon as we got in, we noticed that the base fare for the meter was a bit higher than what we had seen in normal city taxis. When we arrived at the airport, the driver asked for more money than we had originally agreed to because he said he had to pay tolls (regular taxis are exempt from tolls, but he stated that as he was the hotel car, he was not exempt). We informed him that he did not mention tolls when we were agreeing on a price and we sat there for about 5 minutes arguing an he finally agreed to just let us pay what was on the meter.

The room was okay - a studio with quite nice furniture, twin beds, kitchenette, etc. The advert said the room could accommodate up to three but they clearly did not encourage this as despite the fact we told them there would be three of us when we booked, there was no bed linen in the room to make up the sofa bed and there was only two of everything else such as towels, crockery, cutlery, etc. which was a bit odd. We requested extra bed linen for the sofa bed and the housekeeper promptly brought some to us including extra towels. However, when the room was made up the next day the third towel disappeared again!! The furnishings in the room were quite nice although the mattress on the sofa bed had some revolting looking stains on it so in the end my son slept on it closed. Staff wise, the receptionists were rather odd - far from welcoming. My biggest dislike was most times when I went to the counter I virtually always had to ask for service, despite the fact that the receptionists saw me waiting right in front of them! In fact, one morning I said 'good morning' cheerily to the guy on reception and he did not even acknowledge me until I repeated it in a more aggressive tone. The staff in the breakfast room were a bit more pleasant, but top marks go to the back of house staff such as the housekeepers who were always really courteous and greeted is with big smiles. The breakfast was included in our room rate, but again only for two of us so we had to pay for my nine year old son. The food was mediocre but plentiful enough although to be honest I would have preferred to not have had the breakfast in the room rate and made do with the kitchenette in the room to rustle something up instead. The complex has two swimming pools - both small but enough to keep kids and some adults amused for a while. There was also a gym and sauna although we never got to use them. The breakfast room was located in the coffee shop which did food throughout the day although we did not try it. For internet, we had to borrow a cable from the reception to use our computer in the room although it didn't seem to work and according to the instructions they provided it would not have been particularly fast anyway. They also had free wifi in the coffee shop and whilst we never used it, several other people were on it regularly so presumably it was okay. Our room rate gave us a late checkout of 4pm. The night before, reception has left us a note saying we had to be out before that but when it was queried with them they agreed it was a mistake and checkout was indeed 4pm. That was very useful as our flight was not until quite late in the evening and it meant we could rest a bit in the afternoon before travelling. Baggage can be left at the hotel once you have checked out but it is just left out in the lobby by the toilets and they ask you to sign a responsibility waiver so I would not recommend leaving any valuables in your luggage. Saying that, we had no problems. The hotel location is okay - a 15 minute walk from Bur Juman and it's new metro station and there's loads of restaurants in the surrounding hotels too. There's always loads of taxis passing by so they are easy enough to flag down, although coming back was sometimes difficult as some taxi drivers never knew exactly where the complex was - quite understandable given that there are many in the Golden Sands chain. In fact, make sure you get dropped at the right one as some of the others are quite a walk away and the whole area looks identical no matter which street you are on. All in all our stay at Golden Sands 5 was okay, but to be honest I think there are better apartment complexes around the same areas for similar money. My biggest issue with the place was with the reception staff, many of whom could do with a bit of customer service training or better still, laughing gas!!", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDissapointed\u201d", "Author": "FrankS6", "ReviewID": "UR47097120", "Content": "It was cramped, dirty, smelly and musty.

They also deliver the daily newspaper to room every day for free, even though we did not understand a word of it!!!. The golden sands hotel we stayed at did not have a bar or restaurant (or we never saw one and there was no information of one) but there is a comfy area for sitting drinking tea etc if you wish to drink alcohol you have to drink in the restaurants out side or buy from the supermarket and take to your room, There is no entertainment either, You can arrange trips from this hotel and there is a car hire office the other plus about this hotel has secure free parking & free use of three computers in the reception which we took full advantage off.( many hotels charge for both these services) There is a swimming pool which is placed over the car park and a pool side bar/cafe where you can get snacks and drinks, the pool is clean and there is sunny & shady spots with plenty of sun lougers and its on green rubber mats to give impression of grass, this may have been update now? but there is no view all you see is other tall hotels, but if you higher a car like we did you can drive 40 mins to the securer jumeirah beach you have to pay about \u00a35.00 for the day to park car or \u00a33.00 on foot but it has showers toilets bar and food & there\u2019s no beach bum,s the beach is spotless and the sea is like walking into a warm bath brilliant. The hotel is in a great location for shopping eating out & sight seeing all within walking distance there is also a supermarket just on the corner open 24hours, but I would recommend hiring a car if you wish to go to the beach, and for further sight seeing or if you would rather have a beach holiday book a hotel much nearer to the beaches.( of course you will pay a much high price for this)", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for price\u201d", "Author": "Abby12345", "ReviewID": "UR30995982", "Content": "Arrived early Sat morning at 6.30 am, Although i had emailed hotel before to see if we could pay a bit extra for the room they still charged us for a full day.

The room was great for us, 2 sofas and a kitchenette with washer dryer and microwave, free newspaper and maid every day. Looked out over the car park but it was too hot to go on the balcony anyway. Took the Big Bus tour on our 2nd day, bought a ticket for 24 hrs, should have split it over 2 days. There are 2 routes 1 around the city and the other down the beach and back along the malls. There are loads of places of interest where you can get off have a look and get on the following bus (every half hour) and some free entrance passes to the museum and river cruise. We hired a car for 4 days from the hotel for \u00a3120 (could have got it cheaper from the airport) and went all over, the Jermiera Beach Park was lovely, free parking on the road, \u00a31 each to get in, it has changing rooms, toilets, restaurant and cafes and parking for about \u00a34, it gets busy on fridays. Free parking at the malls but had loads of trouble parking at the gold souk and traditional souk the other side of the creek, we waited 20-30 minutes for a space. We booked a Dune Safari with Jaas Desert Safari for the Thursday afternoon, they called my mobile on Tuesday asking where we were!!, We were picked up on the Thursday by a man who couldnt speak much english and ushered into his 4x4, there were 2 asian lads in there already who were very chatty and 1 could speak the drivers language. It was really hot in the back sandwiched between 2 people on the 1 3/4 hr drive. We stopped and were told to get out and pointed to a toilet, we went and then those tea towel things were tied around our heads by men in the shop, we got a drink and went to the till. They tried to charge us \u00a320, I took it off my head and gave it back (the one I got in Egypt was only about 25p!!, we then arrived just down the road at the loaction (we thought the stop off was where the drivers were paid to stop by the shop owners) I got in the backseat of the 4x4 so I could hang on. The dune safari wasnt good with a moody driver who said he wasnt going to drive us and then did, I thought it was supposed to be fun, the other lads said last time they came the driver was informative and happy. We stopped at a bedouin camp where we ate, had a henna tattoo, rode a camel, dressed in arab dress and watched a belly dancer. The driver came to collect us and I indicated I wanted to get in the back seats, he pointed to the middle, I said it was too hot to be sat so close, he slammed the seat down and walked off in a huff. I climbed in the back and we drove back to the hotel. It took only 45 mins as he drove twice the speed limit whilst speaking alernately on 2 mobile phones. When we arrived he tried to speak asking how long we were staying. I just ignored him and as I got out told him how rude he was. We had a great time other than that, weather was hot and not humid and we got the free shuttle back to the airport.

The Golden Sands airport shuttle goes from Terminal 1 and only every 2 hours, so we got a taxi - 40 Dirhams (20 Dirhams just to sit in the taxi at the airport). Upon arrival we checked in and were asked to wait in the foyer until our room was ready. In reality you could probably leave your bags there and go out, but we were tired didn't think anything would be open at 8am, so opted to wait. At 9:30am we were able to get into our room. Since official check-in time is 12noon, I didn't think this was too bad. The studio appartment (Golden sands 3) was spacious and clean. We only stayed one night so didn't really use the extra facilities of the washing machine, microwave etc. We walked to the Burjaman mall (10-15 mins) where they have a food court and also restaurants and then continued on to the creek and the Dubai museum (another 15-20 mins). Do-able, but you have to like walking and not in the middle of the day! We needed to leave our luggage for the day upon check-out and I was concerned that it would just be left exposed in the lobby as it was on check-in. The reception staff informed me that it would be locked away for the day. Whilst I did not see them take it away, upon return it did have to be retreived from behind reception by the porter. The reception staff tried hard, but did not fill me with confidence. I get the impression they are trying to be better than a 2* hotel with the porters etc. We took the evening shuttle back to the airport and were able to be droped off at Terminal 3. All in all, a good hotel for the price. There are some restaurants within walking distance and otherwise taxi's are cheap. Our most expensive was from Mall of the Emirates - about 50 Dirhams.

The facilities in the apartment were also excellent - a huge well kept kitchen with a big fridge, microwave and all amenties.

I decided to book a one bedroom studio here (which was massive by the way and plenty big enough for 2 people). Golden Sands is a cheap place to stay and gives you the option of catering for yourself - there is a supermarket nearby however you probably need to catch a taxi to a bigger supermarket if you want to feed yourself for the duration of your stay. I decided to stay here so i could spend the money that i had saved on a hotel on the actual trip and doing different activities. The positives: early check-in if requested when booked (we were checked in at 9am); rooms cleaned every day and fresh towels given; a complimentary bottle of water and a daily newspaper if requested; the restuarant/ cafe served an array of snacks and meals and were very reasonable; pool available (althought the sun loungers filled up quickly); free shuttle bus to the Jumeriah Beach Park at 9.45 every morning and returning at 4pm which will save you at least \u00a310 a day in taxis (be warned, you need to book your places on this as soon as you get there as it fills up pretty quickly); tour booking office in the hotel; very helpful front desk; always taxis outside - go with the white and coloured taxis rather than the hotel ones (pure white cars) as they are MUCH cheaper. Finally, there is a free shuttle bus to and from the airport - you need to phone the hotel before you get there if you wish to arrnage a pick up. It was also a very quiet hotel - no noisy people about and no building work going on in the immediate area! The only negative: the bathroom was a little dated and did have a very mild smell to it but to be honest, for the amount i paid for the hotel and for all the positives listed above, it wasn't a problem at all! In my personal opinion, the location was great as Dubai is so huge that it is impossible to walk anywehre therefore taxis are the way forward. The taxis were readily available and you can hail them on the streets - go for the coloured ones - white and yellow, white and red, white and blue etc etc as they are a lot cheaper. The most expensive taxi ride we took was down to the Burj Al Arab and that cost around \u00a38 (40 AED) but it miles and miles away and there is no way you could walk it. My only other tip is to ring Golden Sands before you get there or ring Expedia if you have booked through a company like them and they will phone and find out which apartment block you are in as there are 10 Golden Sands and if you end up going to the wrong one it can be a pain.

The hotel staff are not overly helpful particularly the staff on reception but this lack of customer service (never mind a smile or warm welcome) is typical of most of Dubai. The hotel has a excursions office which seemed to be closed whenever we wanted to visit but when we did the woman working there was possibly the rudest and most unhelpful person we encountered during our entire visit! She also doesn't provide particularly useful information so my advice would be book your excursions before you go through your travel agent or online. Taxis are available outside the hotel but very expensive when compared to the generic dubai taxi service (which are metered) - tip: come out of the hotel, cross the road and walk through to the parallel road and wave down a taxi - you will pay less than half! Public transport is a nightmare! Room service is overpriced and not very nice and most decent places are a taxi ride away - as is everything else. Free access to check your emails is available, but there nis only one terminal and its usually being used and has a queue waiting, I believe there was a business area that had free wifi access though.

The wirless internet facility (accessed from the restaurant or pool area) worked well and was free of charge. The gym was reasonably well equipped and free to use. For us, the hotel was well situated - being easy walking distance from the Dubai Creek and local market areas. A taxi to Deira City Centre shopping mall cost just 20 DHS. However, it is at the far end of the city from the large international hotels and fancy tourist attractions. So its suitability would depend on what you want from your time in Dubai. Taxis to and from the airport, using excellent quality private hire vehicles, cost about 35 or 40 DHS and was no problem. The hotel complex is well known to local drivers.

Everything is only minutes away, but seems to take ages to get to. It's like the Middle East's equivalent of L.A, traffic that seems to go on for miles. When we were there the overhead metro was under construction and I think this will take a lot of the hassle of getting around, especially for tourists. I must however, say that the taxi's are incredibly cheap for such an opulent country. A visit to the Wild Wadi waterpark is amost as is a visit to the miriade of shopping malls, even if you can't afford to buy, although I have to say eating out is surprisingly cheap. What I liked about the food courts in the malls is that you can all have something different, yet all sit together to eat. The Golden sands was superb. At first entering the hotel ,I thought I had stepped back into the 70's as the reception seemed a bit dated, but was soon very impressed with the room. Before I forget, I must mentioned that a hotel courtesy bus runs from the airport to the hotel every 2 hours, so you do not have to pay for a transfer and try and pay that little extra for a direct flight as we missed or connection in Doha due to a delay in Manchester and had to wait another 2 hours for a connecting flight. The hotel staff were spot on and nothing was too much trouble, probably wouldn't pay extra for breakfast as it's not really worth it, plus there are self-catering facilities in the room. Ours had washer/dryer, oven, an iron with ironing board as well as fridge. There is a small mini-mart if you walk out across the car park to stock up, but we spent most of the time out and about. They let you swim in the pool until 10pm, if you fancy a swim instead of sizzling in the daytime.

I have sent many people there for stopovers & that's exactly what we were using it for. I'm very open when it comes to Arabic people, had at that time no opinion of them however did find they are not the friendliest nor the most welcoming to their country. On entry through customs there was no conversation at all, not even a welcom to Dubai, just a motion of the hand and passport said. Then passports plonked back on the counter & that was that. We had a private car transfer booked & that worked fine on arrival & I was very thankful I had done that as outside the airport is busy. Our reception at the hotel was as friendly as it was at the customs. Now I'm a friendly person, I don't look mean or like I'm going to bite & have good manners & travelling with a teenager who is the same. I deal with the public everyday & know the importance of a smile & this & a friendly hello costs nothing! Our room was a great size, had a kitchenette, washing machine/dryer which we were desperate for, the beds were comfy & rooms quiet. Bathrooms were a good size however the shower taps were mixed up and hot was cold & vice versa & nearly caused my son to be burned. The hotel wasn't far from the shopping centre & prices in the supermarket nearby were really good & I can happily say that we had a very friendly, efficient asian girl at the McDonalds who was very welcoming. We did a city tour & was picked up in a largish Tarago style vehicle. 8 people including the driver, was very squishy as 4 were largish & we were in & out so much everyone got a bit frustrated. The city itself was fantastic & I'm glad I have seen it - amazing! We were taken all around & saw alot driving along but what was disappointing was we were then taken to one shop after another which wasn't mentioned on the tour. The first one was the Islamic Arts Centre which was nice, really different things but very very expensive & we were ushered along past people with calculators ready for us to buy things & I mean these things were thousands of dollars & none of us looked like we had that sort of money. We were then deposited at another place & we just went in & out & everyone came out after us as it was exactly the same. We then went to the beach and outside the Burj Hotel. The city is so big we spent ages driving but it was interesting. We finished at the gold markets but again very expensive. Travelling with a teenager on my own I would not have gone out at night & have heard from clients that they wouldn't either. The city is full of men just wandering around at night, sitting on street corners & barely a woman to be seen. I have honestly never seen so many people as around the bus station & ferry terminal - very un-nerving. We had room service for dinner & that was nice & the waiter was very nice & friendly. We had only 2 nights there before heading to Egypt. We had organised a private transfer to take us to the airport & the main purpose of this was convenience & so we had time as I don't like rushing. When we first arrived in to the hotel we had a message saying the car would pick us up the night before so I called & confirmed the info was incorrect & they confirmed their mistake. However I then received 2 different times/dates but I confirmed again the day & time. Anyway to cut a long story short, the driver never showed up so I spoke to the rep who was at the hotel & she said it would be there in 5mins then she left. 45 mins later & two irate phone calls a van with people in pulls up & we fly to the airport in the nick of time. Not impressed with that so will be letting the wholesaler know as I would hate my clients to go through that stress! Otherwise an ok place. No customer service on checkout & to be honest I really got the impression they just didn't give a hoot about tourists.

The setting may not be to everyone's liking - surrounded by tower blocks within an area called 'Goldens Sands ' as there are so many other buildings that belong to the same group but as a single female traveller, I have never felt unsafe or wary walking around there at night. The apartments themselves are spacious and contain everything to be completely self contained. In fact in the other buildings some residents live there long term. There is a 24 hour supermarket located 5-7 minutes walk away called Spinney's, a bit like the UK Waitrose store, you can stock up there reasonably enough. One major issue to plague not only the Golden Sands but Dubai in general is the unavailabilty of taxis. There is a solution, get the local buses for only 2 Dirhams, they are very clean and reliable and take you to all the major places in town. If you walk to Spinney's Supermarket, the Bus Stop is practically there. The C1 (CBD route) will take you to Deira, the Airport and the Gold Souk. Route Number 9 (less frequent though) takes you to Al Ghubaiba Bus station and from there - Dubai's your oyster, not forgetting The Creek! I recommend getting the number 8 to Jumeriah Beach or even zipping over to Abu Dhabi for all of 15 Dirhams! I only learnt this way after waiting outside the apartment for taxis, pick up a bus map from the friendly uniformed staff there! In the apartments themselves on the ground floor next to the check in area (I think they are called Knights Tours) they can organise day tours to the desert and Fujairah amongst others. There is also free internet but it has a nasty habit of freezing at the crucial moment! The Hotel offers a free shuttle to the airport ( I took the one at 8pm) and they were on time.

The good thing about Bur Dubai is that is centrally located and you can get to other parts of Dubai reasonably cheaply using the trusted taxi service.

I imagine however that this could be the case with a lot of hotels in Dubai, but if possible, I would reccomend working out what what you actually want to do in Dubai and choose accommodation accordingly. I.e. we were there for three days and went to the Burj Al Arab, Atlantis Aquaventure water park, Buddah Bar (highly reccomended, although very expensive!!) and the Mall of the Emirates during our stay - these all happened to be in \"New Dubai\" which is a good 15-20 minute cab ride from Golden Sands, so we would have been better off staying in that area instead (not sure if there is a difference in price however).

First let me say make sure you know which number apartment you are staying in because there are 11 apartment blocks. It might also pay to print out the map of the apartments from their website so you can show it to the taxi driver if he gets lost. Apartment 10 and 11 are a little separate from the rest. It cost us 50 dhs from the airport to the hotel and the reverse was 28 dhs. We had a 2 bedroom apartment and it was huge, there was a lounge room/ dinning room, a laundry with a washer and dryer free of charge, a big basic kitchen, 2 bathrooms and 2 very large bedrooms and a large walk in robe in the main. The main bedroom could have used a TV in it otherwise the room was great. There is a caf\u00e9 down stairs where you can get breakfast at a price. We went there on the first morning and it was 55 dhs per person and it was very basic. There is free Wifi, but only in the reception and caf\u00e9 area. This was very slow. The pool is a little run down, but it was nice on the hot days just to relax. There is a large supermarket directly in front of apartment 10 across a vacant block, this was great for your kitchen supplies. At Golden Sands number 5 you can book tours and I think there is a bus that can take you to the beach at about 10:00am from number 3. Finally the reception was about unhelpful as they possibly could be. There was no tourist information up in the hotel and every questioned you asked they only told you the basics and nothing more. I think this is more a business hotel as they do not cater for the tourist at all well. The location of the hotel is not too bad, there is not much around, but you are located between the river and the beaches. Taxis are pretty cheap, but they always seem to take the long way. This wasn\u2019t a bad hotel, but I would probably try somewhere different next time.

We had heard that there was a free shuttle service but were too tired to go looking for it. Upon checking-in to the hotel and enquiring about getting back to the airport the following morning we were advised that we could use the free shuttle service. We found the shuttle service very good with a very helpful driver who helped us with our bags at both ends and pointed us in the right direction at the airport for our airline check-in desk - also we found he took a much quicker route to the airport than our taxi driver had taken the previous day which did make us think the taxi driver had taken a longer route to increase his fare!

Taxis - getting a taxi outside the complex is a bit hit and miss.

The evening entertainment at the bedouin camp could have been missed as quite boring and makes it a long day. Cost around \u00a325.

It was ideal. As i had young children the only problem i had was taxi's, they would not travel short distances they wanted to go for long journeys such as jumeirah beach. That really annoyed me, however it gave us the opportunity to go walking taking the kids in their strollers and that was an experience on its owna s we got to explore places where i don't thnk we would have noticed going in taxi.

They said this would be fine and I confirmed the price I had paid through laterooms. When I tried to check in I was told I would need to give them 500dirhams as a deposit on the room. I explained I didnt have a credit card and only had enough cash for the room and my food. The woman on the counter was completely unaccommodating and refused to check me in.

I had such high expectations for Hotels in Dubai. It wasnt cheap, it was dearer than a good 3 star here in ireland but lacked the quality. The rooms are big and the staff are friendly (if you're a man). The bed was very comfortable and was pretty quiet. Thats the good part. The room was very dated and was dirty in places.. particularly the bath. I found that the staff were fine with me but quiet abrupt with my girlfriend, especially those on the front desk. The location of the hotel is quiet a bit away from all the major attractions in Dubai. Its about a 20 min drive from the Mall of the Emirates and a 20 min drive from the beach and about a 30 minute drive from the Burj Al Arab. Getting home at night was a pain too as the traffic was awful, spent hours in traffic one night. If you are travelling in Dubai at night, dont bother going anywhere at rush hour in the evening. The city is at a standstill. If I was return to Dubai I definitly would not stay in this hotel, I would stay in Jumeriah. Thats where all the attractions are and where most of the visitors to Dubai are... We got a bit of hassle from locals in our area because my gf had her arms uncovered which I personally thought was rediculous, especially as everyone was dressed very liberally. That is something you may come into contact with in Dubai. Despite what people tell you, some of the locals can be rude to and dismissive of westerners. We were taunted on 3 occasions. Guys also leer at western women... I got pretty annoyed about this after a while as cars were slowing down to check my girlfriend out and groups of men would stare. These are things you will have to consider if you are visiting Dubai. Another thing is that there is no public transport. Taxis are ok but the drivers are hit & miss, some can be friendly some can be rude (same as everywhere I guess). It used to cost us about 10 euro to go to the beach which was about a 20 min journey. They are building a metro system in Dubai and I probably would not return to Dubai until this is completed. I would definitely not stay in the Golden Sands again as I felt it was over priced and in a bad location.

On arrival they had booked us in the GS3 even though they had confirmed to me by email that we would be in a quiet room at GS5, we preferred GS5 due to the pool being on the roof top, with better views and especially more sun all through the day! After complaining they managed to find us a quiet room in GS5 but a much larger one, so we got upgraded, we were very exited, and glad that we had insisted! The room (no.328) was so big (to USA standard), fully equipped and in very good condition, we only paid \u00a370 per night (including the 5% service charge) using booking.com and the room was worth much more, I would expect in Dubai at least \u00a3130 per night. We were very happy with our room, we used the kitchen every morning for breakfast, and were always impressed to return at night to an immaculate room (yes they did the washing up too). It's more an hotel than an apartment. A \"quick\" note about taxis, they are not easy to get outside the hotel, as it's a quiet street, you will need to go to GS3 (which is more popular) or try the more busy street nearby if you don't want to wait for 15 minutes. They also don't organise taxis for you, even to the airport so we had problems getting a taxi at 7.30am to catch our flight. We did check with the receptionist the previous night who told us it would be no problem to get a taxi outside at 7.30am, however we waited 30 minutes (there was another couple in front of us waiting for a taxi also but on their way to the office, so we didn't stand much luck) we ended up using their free airport bus at 8am, saving about \u00a310 but man we were stressed out and worried that we would miss our flight. Luckily there was no traffic and it took us 15 minutes to get to the airport (compared to the usual 45 minutes at this time of day).

The apartment was large and very sunny, with an extremely pleasant eat-in (for two) kitchen with floor-to-ceiling windows. Bathrooms are basic but fine, and the furniture was extremely comfortable, with good (very firm) mattresses, big easy chairs, and a nice sofa. The master bedroom had an en suite bath, while the twin-bed second bedroom had its bath across the hall.

Drawbacks: definitely more of an apartment building feel than a full-service hotel, and the unit was a furnished apartment, not a lavish hotel suite (i.e. bare china cabinet, empty bookshelves, etc.); smallish pool in the building's central courtyard; very hard to get taxis unless you get lucky (management will not ring one up for you). As with nearly everywhere in Dubai, there is lots of construction in the neighborhood, but the noise started late, ended early, and was never very loud.

There is a Golden Sands tourism desk inside the airport just before you exit (you can\u2019t miss it) just check with the personnel and they will direct you to the shuttle, 2) a large welcome bottle of water in your studio, 3) Gulf News on your door knob daily, 4) shopping bag in closet is a handy beach tote, 5) data port in my room for internet connection 6) business center in lobby- 4 computers, a printer, a fax machine 7) wireless wifi connection in the restaurant, 8) beverage service condiments-2 tea bags, 2 coffee sachets, sugar/creamer replenished, 9) somewhere there's a gym & sauna, but didn't have time to use it. My studio apartment had very quality furnishings, was very large, and the kitchen was well equipped with nicer amenities than I expected - washer/dryer combo, microwave, toaster, electric kettle, 2 burner stove, iron and board, fridge/freezer, porcelain china, and all the pieces needed to cook if you ever wanted to. A small grocer can be found just down the street. Things to remember: 1) beware of touching any outdoor item that is metal, very warm and easy to forget 2) no cold water in Dubai taps, so make ice in your freezer, 3) great Duty Free store in baggage claim area to make your purchases while waiting for luggage 4) use sun block, wear a hat, drink lots of water 5) bring a few clothes washing tablets, 6) the swimming pool is cooled down here rather than warmed up! 7) you can purchase a prepaid UAE SIM card and replenishment time at the grocers, 8) this is a conservative country, and visitors are expected to dress conservatively and not show too much skin, 9) signs are in English & Arabic, everyone speaks English, 10) TV in many different languages. Rooftop pool was my favorite, but when you want to go to the beach, you have choices: 1) take the complimentary shuttle bus (first come,first served) to Jumeirah Beach Park, (5 Dhrs entrance to the park) 2) if you wish to treat yourself to a \u201cResort Day\u201d and use the Hilton Jumeirah Beach facilities, (90 DHrs buy tkt at reception) there\u2019s a bus that goes there, too. The Hilton Jumeirah Beach has an incredibly huge swimming pool with swim up bar, (check out their webpage) gorgeous beach of course, but I enjoyed the sea then a chaise lounge, reading under the shade of the palm trees. Walk down the beach to the right and you will find Ahmed and his sweet well groomed and well mannered camel waiting for the next customer. 3) Taxis are relatively reasonable for getting around town, so you can come and go as you please if the bus is full. When you come home hungry, the dining room offers a fresh buffet, at 55 Dhrs. Or, having menu items sent up to the comfort of your room isn\u2019t much more in cost (available round the clock & I did this often). And plenty of good restaurants and pubs are nearby. Taxis were easy to grab on the street. I had a look at a 2 bdrm flat in Golden Sands 10 for future reference-gorgeous. GS 10 is a newer building and I loved the flat screen TV there as well as the square footage for being so large. The decor is similar but in lighter hues and there's no internet connection inside the rooms, but wireless wifi in the lobby and restaurant.

This time we stayed at Golden Sands 3 and not 5. The 2 buildings neighbour each other and share a pool, restaurant and car park. We used the level 1 pool (another on teh roof og GS 5) and had room service and ate at the restaurant - all very good in quality and price. The rooms are nicely sized, with clean bedding and bathrooms (we had 2), a kitchenette complete, wiuth oven, fridge freezer, washer dryer and sink with Cooker hood! Our room had a sofa, coffee table, dinning table and TV and still plenty of rrom. the hotel is easy to find and well located just outside th hustle & bustle of bur duabi, but within walking distance of the major eateries and shopping areas of Bur Dubai. The reception and all the hotel staff are very helpful - we only tipped at the end except the waiters and porters. the local supermarket : opposite the buidling 5 entrance or go through the car park towards with GS 3 behind you. Take at left by the car park entrance and on the opposite side of the road slightly to your right a 24 HR store and decent restaurant. Both deliver your food/purchases rght up to your room. Trips to go on: desert safari, dhow cruise and wild wadi. The city tour was quite good and you get to see a lot of the sites with a break at Jumeriah Beach and the jewelary quarter and museum. Have fun go, but be careful of the sun it's a scorcher.

Two small pools available. Cafe serving breakfast, lunch etc. Taxis easy to get outside. We walked to the Ramada (10 mins away) for the pub inside and the Bur Juman shopping centre where we took the city tour bus. Dubai is much bigger than we expected with an enormous amount of construction which appears to leave a grey dusty cloud hanging over the city. It was good to feel warm in the evening walking about. We took a taxi to Bar 44 at the Grosvenor House Hotel for cocktails, this took about 25 mins in clear traffic. We liked Dubai and would return. Not being fond of hotels we would be happy to self cater at the Golden Sands, we certainly did not think it was of poor quality and we too have travelled extensively.

Obviously it's not a 5 star but it's still a decent place to crash out as that is all one should be doing whilst you explore Dubai during the day and into the night ! Just one slight criticism about the complementary airport transfer service....we couldnot find the bus outside the airport on arrival as it was parked well away from the main collection point...we nearly missed it and only just got there with the help of a local. Also the hotel willnot book a seat to take you back to the airport...it's a first come first served basis...i ended up stopping in the foyer for 2 hours to ensure we got a seat and all our luggage aswell, with 8 of us you can imagine there was quiet a bit !!!", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, England", "Title": "\u201cDecent living!\u201d", "Author": "tigger83", "ReviewID": "UR7752638", "Content": "I stayed in the Golden Sands 3 Hotel Apartments (GS3) complex and had a 2 room studio. It was great - there was a washing machine, fridge/freezer, air con worked fine, cooker and they even washed the dishes for you every day! Please note that these are self catered, serviced apartments! GS3 do offer a buffet breakfast and dinner, but that is at an extra cost and I didn't see the need to eat at GS3 when there are plenty of eating places within a 10min walk! There is also free internet access to in the lobby and they have a tour booking office. I booked a desret safari package from here and it was excellent (a little short - there are lots of other operators who offer this safari cheaper, but I didn't trust them really!) The staff are very friendly and try to accommodate your needs! With regards to location, it's quite centrally located. I felt really safe here (I went with a girlfriend and we both felt very safe walking in the streets at night). In addition, all taxi drivers know where it is too, so that is a bonus. Jumeriah beach is about 15mins away (as long as there is no traffic) and costs about 26 dirhams (and there are currently 7 dirhams to the pound). If you don't feel like paying, then there is a complimentry bus that goes from GS3 at 9:30am and returns at 3pm. In addittion, there is a complimentary bus service that runs from Dubai airport to GS3 throught the day. It's worth calling and confirming this prior to departure! In conclusion, I was very happy with GS3. It's not the 5 star service that some might expect from a Dubai hotel, but it has all the amenities to make for a pleasureable stay. They room was clean and the staff helpful. We had fresh towels every day and also the room was cleaned daily (no matter what time you left the room during the day!). They also gave u a complimentary newspaper every morning! There is so much to do and see (and places to shop ;) ) in Dubai, that there is little need to stay in the room. GS3 does have a pool that is clean and in addition, the adjacent GS5 has a roof top pool that can be used by GS3 residents. If you are after a luxuary pampering holiday in Dubai, then GS3 is not for you. If on the other hand you are looking for a place to crash whilst you explore Dubai - then GS3 is perfect!", "Date": "June 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands", "Title": "\u201cfantastic!!\u201d", "Author": "Tonii", "ReviewID": "UR7551561", "Content": "(we stayed in golden sands 5)..what can i say...the best self catering appartments we ever stayed in.
