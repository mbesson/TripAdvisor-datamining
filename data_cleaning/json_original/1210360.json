The Sanur Beach Hotel provided us with all the facilities we were looking for - two excellent large pools, good breakfasts, clean rooms with problem free air-con, tv and showers. The only thing we couldn't get was a DVD rental but we were able to hire one at the dvd shop near the bonsai cafe.The hotel caters mainly for families and provides excellent front desk service. An additional benefit is the Garuda office located in the hotel main complex. We were able to check in and get our seats the day before departure.There is a free shuttle bus to Kuta of a morning and lots of organized activities for kids and adults that are free of charge or very inexpensive.The hotel has a range of restaurants but the surrounding area provides a much better range of places to eat ranging from the cheap and cheerful to the ritzy and expensive.Our favourite was Bobby's with is right next door to the hotel with indoor and outdoor on the sand seating.Although the hotel is at the southern end of the beach there are lots of shops and transport for those too lazy to use the excellent paved walk way which runs the length of the beach", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR178881967", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "balihappy56"}, {"Content": "Enjoyed our stay! I read all the reviews and had some concerns and on the main they were all on the mark eg. a bit tired looking but the facilites, staff and surroundings were really good  it is all about value for money which I think it was definitely. After the long line up and hassle to get through customs in an unairconditioned airport we were a bit frazzled by the time we got to the hotel. The entrance and foyer weren't overly flash but still nice, (would have been beautiful and very flash when built in the 70's). But everything was very clean and the service was great and breakfast was very good and so nice out near the water. We had reservations when we arrived but by the time we left 8 days later we loved the place, especially the bar on the beach with $5 cocktails and a 3 piece band playing every night at 6pm. We did travel around to Kuta, Legian etc and were so glad we stayed in Sanur, so much quieter and older set, Seminyak/Kuta was full of the younger groups, mainly dutch and german in Sanur. My partner didnt want to go to Bali at all but he did agree by the end of the trip he was so glad he went as we both loved the place and the Balinese people, they are so lovely. Another great thing to do is go on the early bike ride with a guide from the hotel for $10ea and he took us all through the streets, to the local market (we were the only westerners there) then into a local families balinese house and also a local school, a highlight of the trip without a doubt!", "Date": "Dec 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR232757445", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Kookie8"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294226-d1210360-r23360992-Sanur_Beach_Hotel_Bali-Bali.html", "HotelID": "1210360", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
