We booked the Hotel with booking.com and payed just 200\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for 3 nights, althought it was a special offer. The Hotel staff was unbelivebly nice (i worked in a Hotel once and i know how it is, but these guys were very friendly). The breakfast was good as well and you had enough choices. Our room was very big with a nice double bed. The furniture was quite old but i guess that is the specific venice charm - we liked it. The TV was huge (with English BBC News) and the WIFI was free, even in the rooms. The Hotel is in a very nice area on Lido. The mini shopping street, a few restaurants and the busboat stop are very close. If you dont mind to get a boat every morning to Venice and like it a bit quieter at night its the perferct place to go. It just takes you 15min to the Marcus Square and the boat tickets are surprisingly cheap. When you are under 30 you can buy one of these 'rolling cards' which allow you to get cheaper offers in museums and on the boat tickets. (Overall we paid togehter 44\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for a 72h boat ticket) But if you are over 30 it doesnt really matter either, because these tickets are not expensive (33\u00e2\u201a\u00ac each) and very usefull to get to certain places in Venice. We were surprised how big it actually was. We both imagined a much smaller city. If you like walking aroung in Venice dont forget to buy a map (you can get them for 2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac), especially when you have a target. We tried it without one and ended up somewhere random. The streets are quite often dead ends and there a lot of water around so you need to find a bridge to cross it.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cA well located hotel in a very pretty area.\u201d", "Author": "Emma D", "ReviewID": "UR127855712", "Content": "We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel in April 2012 whilst we explored the various things that Venice had to offer. Overall it was a very pleasant hotel with all of the basics that you could possibly need. It's location on the island of Lido is perfect for getting away from the hussle and bussle of Venice itself. If you're under 29 years of age I would highly recommend buying a Rolling Venice card for 4 Euros which entitles you to a large discount on boat transport passes. We paid 18euros for unlimited boat travel for 72 hours instead of 32euros. The pass also gives you lots of discounts on main attractions and specific restaurants. The hotel is approximately a 1 hour boat ride from Marco Polo airport and costs around 26euros for a return trip. Beware when waiting for the Alilaguna boat back to the airport - local Italians seem to be given priority even if they haven't waited for the boat as long as you! Only dissapointments with the hotel: walls were extremely thin and we could hear every word of our neighbouring guests, beds were very hard, shower had no curtain so baths are probably a wiser decision and the decor was a little old.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, a little dated, but good location and staff\u201d", "Author": "JonB-CA", "ReviewID": "UR126347823", "Content": "We enjoyed 2 wonderful nights - it is a 5 minute walk to the ferry over to Venice, but Lido itself is wonderful and quiet at night, and has its own little shopping area nearby with amazing gelato and good restaurants.

The vaparetto is easily accessible by foot from Marco Polo airport, take the red or blue line (quicker) to Lido SME port. The Biasutti is in a good location not far from here, but it is a question of knowing where you are going \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would recommend investing in a local map rather than a taxi! There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing much going on in Lido, but I came to realise it is a great escape from Venice, and the weather was still very temperate in mid-October. The main square and shopping area (just a 3 minute walk if you know where you are going!) is busy in the evening, although the outdoor cafes closed by 10.30pm the gelateria was open until midnight. There is also a Billa supermarket open early to late which is a handy stop off for picnic items. The hotel itself is pretty enough from the outside, but is an old property and this is reflected in the interior. The staff were friendly and very helpful, and the facilities matched expectations so overall I was happy staying here. Access to Venice from Lido is very easy (its better value to buy a travelcard rather than singles), consequently not a lot of time was spent in the hotel itself. The buffet breakfast was more than just standard continental fare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fact was a coffee and cake-lovers dream, although cooked items were also available, and available until 10.30am so was far from rushed. The buffet was actually better than the Villa Oriana Relais St Agnello (the TA reviews rave about the breakfast but this was in fact superior). There was a small gym available (the swimming pool was closed for the winter), a bar and terrace area. Internet access was available in the public areas, and I was pleased to find that I could also access it from the room itself. The hotel staff were happy to arrange free transportation to the glass factory in Murano, which was a bonus. Now for the negatives: the room itself was a disappointment; dark with poor lighting, styled in shabby Venetian fashion with little space to manoeuvre suitcases etc. The TV was small, old, difficult to navigate with limited channels and very poor reception. The fridge which was very handy, and the bathroom was bright and clean, with a huge jacuzzi bath and powerful shower, both of which I loved\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6what I really disliked though was a lack of a shower curtain, which meant that the bathroom would flood no matter how careful I was. It was not the kind of room you would want to do anything more than sleep in. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why this hotel is rated as a 4* - I thought it was on a par with the Hotel Bazzoni, Tremezzo (Lake Como) which was a 3*. I would recommend staying in this hotel for the location away from bustling Venice, price (far more reasonable than Venetian hotels) and service from the staff, they really were nice people. I would not however recommend it for newlyweds, those with mobility problems as there are some steps to the entrance of the hotel, or anyone wanting a luxurious experience.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cnice but boring\u201d", "Author": "muzakmanGlasgow", "ReviewID": "UR119670952", "Content": "We got off to a bad start when we arrived & found out that the company we had booked with (Hotel Connect) had gone bust!! which meant we had to pay all over again! however the manager gave us a good deal and we will claim the money back, the hotel is about 15mins walk to the boat terminals so its quite handy, but nothing happens at this hotel i never seen anyone sit and have a drink and they don't do snacks only breakfast which is the same thing everyday, eating out in venice is very very expensive no matter where you go but the supermarkets are reasonable, we were here for 5 days which was too long 3 would be enough, its a good hotel for getting around and sightseeing but don't stay too long or you will be very bored.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNicest people and great service - An Oasis in a town of unfriendliness.\u201d", "Author": "Jay201146", "ReviewID": "UR119497715", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights along with our two very young kids.

We managed to get a great deal on the room through a 3rd party hotel site, and were pleasantly surprised with the size and quality of our \"economy room\". On confirming the booking the hotel had told us it had a french double bed - this is actually just a standard UK double so perfectly fine. Our room on the 4th floor also had a wardrobe/dressing area, spacious bathroom with shower over the bath, and in-built jacuzzi in the bath! We also made use of the wifi which was free throughout the stay, and good, strong, and quick connection from the 4th floor. The only tiny minor downsides - the mattress on the bed was a little hard, and there was only 1 English tv channel (BBC news) out of about 300 I would expect a few more! Location wise - after a busy day in Venice with people everywhere, it was nice to go back to the peace of the Lido. There are a handful of great restaurants within 5-10 minutes walk, down the main street (Santa Maria Elisabetta). Access-wise it's also very easy. From the airport you can get the Alilaguna boats - the Rossa line is pretty much direct to the Lido and takes about 40 minutes, or the Blue line which goes all around Venice ending up at the Lido (about an hour). Return ticket was 25 euros each. To get into central Venice there are boats leaving from the Lido stop every 5-10 minutes, and going to all different parts of Venice, taking 10 minutes plus depending on which bit you go to. Definitely be sure to have a good boat-line map as there are a lot of them! At the Lido station there are electronic boards to tell you what boats are coming so very easy to figure out. We bought a 48 - hour ticket that can be used on all the ACTV/vaparetto lines - 28 euros each and would definitely recommend it as single trips are about 6 euros each! This is a different company from the airport service. Hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido boat stop. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but there is a patisserie on Santa Maria Elisabetta and greengrocers nearby for fresh fruit as well if you want some. Also took a walk up to the beach - again about 10 minutes from the hotel and great to relax away from the hustle of the mainlands.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cvery well located,comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "greenbid", "ReviewID": "UR119407238", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights in September and was more than pleased with hotel.

The staff is very nice and helpful. They offer many tours too;; We took a free tour of a glass factory on the island of morano; A private boat picks you up and wisks you to Murano, where you get a free tour of the wionderful glass that is famous there. Then you are on your own to discover the island; go to Venice, or wahatever. My advice fora relaxing visit to the Venice area, is to stay here and relax on Lido. It's a nice island in its own right. Yes, during summer the beach is crowded, but we did't come to lounge on the beach but to discover Venice. The main street on Lido has many many restaurant and shops also. Don't forget the gelato!!

I was a little concerned about the toilet however which was right at the side of a window, (although covered with a net), i did feel a little self conscious as you could clearly see through the netting to outside, and did feel that this could be visa versa. The hotel itself is in a quiet residential area, so quiet you could hear a pin drop, but to be fair this was very very pleasant. It is about a 5 min walk from the water bus drop off point, however if just arriving it will probably take you 10, but it is very easy to find. Having jumped off the boat, turn right and head over the small bridge, then take the first left, (hotel is signposted down the street). Continue down the street until you reach the cross roads/canal, continue straight ahead and the hotel is on your left about 100 mtrs from the cross road. The reason for the title is that for me the hotel does not offer the facilities and amenites that a four star hotel would do. The breakfast as already mentioned in other threads is not up to much. There were two cereals to choose from, 3 different types of juice, which was quite good. My husband stated that the coffee was not very good but still drank it. There was no toast or facility to toast any bread. the bread was only bread rolls. There was a small warming plate that contained scrambled eggs, which you had to get as soon as it was put in the heater other wise it would be stone cold. The heater also contained garden peas, cauliflower,and sweetcorn !!!!!!!!!!. There were numerous cakes to pick from and some fresh fruit, but all in all i would say this is not the makings of a 4 star breakfast. There is no coffee/tea making facilites in the rooms either. Staff were pleasant enough and always had a smile on their face. Lido itself at this time of year ( begining of March) is like a ghost town, but we also found this true of Venice. Where does everyone go at night, the place is deserted. Having said that i thought Venice was a very beautiful and romantic city and would reccommed anyone to go. Just be sure to take enough money with you because it is very expensive, even in the reccommeded 'cheap' restaurants. We did find a lovely restaurant not far from the hotel, and came reccommended by trip advisor. I think it is called Andios or something like that.( will post name when i find it out). As you exit the hotel, turn right back up to the cross roads. Once there turn left and head down the street. The restaurant is about 300 mtrs down on the left just after another hotel. ( again when i locate the calling card with full details i will post the address). it is closed mon/tues, but is a very pleasant and welcoming restaurant. it must be good as there are pictures of film stars on the walls that have eaten there during the venice film festival. This hotel is in a good location if you want to be away from the centre of venice, which i can imagine during summer is a nightmare. The transport system is very easy to use and is around 10mins from Lido to venice. I would reccommend the hotel, but think it should be classed as a 3 star and not a 4 star.", "Date": "March 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barrow-in-Furness", "Title": "\u201cCould do better\u201d", "Author": "aitch11", "ReviewID": "UR10036922", "Content": "Hotel room was excellent, a good size, comfortable and spotlessly clean.

Lido is a very quiet and a great option instead of Central Venice, which is very busy and everyone wants your business! Lido has a good selection of restaurants and the best Gelato !. I have also read many reviews and there is such a wide range of opinions about accommodation, its hard to know what its really like. I've decided that if you dont have great expectation, you will not be disappointed. The Biasutti is a clean comfortable establishment for what we paid. We travelled with our 2 year old and everything was fine, our Italian is limited and all the staff were very friendly. The hotel is situated very close to the Main Lido Shops, where there are a number of food stores you can buy a hot chicken (Billa) or ham, cheese and bread, should you not wish to eat at a Restaurant. Biasutti breakfast is fine, not a Full English, but decent enough - my tip is to ask the waiting staff for coffee and tea, they will bring it to your table, we too noticed the older coffee machine. We only had one problem with the Bar Fridge in the room as we bought ham for our lunches, the Bar Fridge temperature was warmer than it should've been, we asked a couple of times about it, staff said it was working, but just not cold enough .. it was never really resolved .. Other than this we were very happy. 10 min boat ride into Hustle and Bustle of St Marco Square. Overall cant complain .. we had a lovely trip. We also hired a bike which catered for our 2 year old (interesting looking thing) and spent 3 hours leisurely biking/stopping round Lido - great way to see the Island.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed the quiet neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "gover", "ReviewID": "UR6144895", "Content": "Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Biasutti.

The staff are really friendly and rooms clean and well decorated. The hotel is situated in a quiet area but close to all the action. We had bed and breakfast. The food was fine, if a little uninventive, but we ate out in town every evening so not a problem I can recommend the Carribe restaurant, 15 minutes walk along the sea front, where the menu was reasonable and food good (even if the service was a little slow). Alternatively, there are a couple of reasonable restaurants in town. Venice is not too expensive if you come from London like ourselves.

Secondly, there are quite a few good restaurants in Lido and the area is less crowded than Venice so it's a good place to have a relaxed dinner after having been the full day going around Venice.
