It was one of the less inexpensive hotel on Pacific beach. The area is fun with lots of bars, caters to a younger crowd. But this hotel needed some serious updating. Our check-in took forever. 50 minutes. The person checking us in was running around doing other things at the same time, and telling us really useless information, like the city wanted to install parking meters on the street in the future. Really? We're only staying a few days. The rooms were not very clean. The beds seemed ok, but the shower really needed some work. I didn't want to look too closely at the shower seams, because there was some black stuff there. We were with friends who had another room, and they said they had a real gnats problem. We were told our rooms were \"updated\", so I'd hate to see what the non-updated rooms looked like. FYI, the room did not look \"updated\" at all, unless what they meant by updating was to paint it and put a new mirror on the wall. However, the beds were comfortable, and seemed clean. There is no \"continental breakfast\" as was stated-- it's just hot water and coffee. Most motel places will at least give you a packaged roll or an apple. When we stayed it was really noisy at night. Not the hotel's fault because it is on Pacific Beach, but something you may want to be aware of. Our door was broken so we couldn't open it from the inside (uh, fire hazard!). Our friends had to let us out of our own room. They did fix it the next day though. The rooms are quite cramped. Not much shelving space to put your stuff down. Obviously, I was not paying for 5 stars, but I did have the minimal standards of cleanliness and efficient service.

Check-in involved an uncomfortable 20-minute interrogation with the manager about why I was in town and what I was planning on doing in the room.

Luckily, Expedia was helpful with this and the matter eventually got resolved. 3. A friend from La Jolla showed up to hang out with us at the beach during the day, and the manager yelled at me as we walked by the office because he saw 3 people although I only booked a room for 2. Again, even though it was none of his business, I explained that our friend was just meeting us there and we were on our way to the beach.

Knowing we would have lots of visitors, we book a two room suite at the Beach Haven Inn. Pacific Beach is a little funky in places and we are comfortable with that. We were not comfortable with what we found in our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suite\". Upon entering we saw a stained, cigarette burned sofa bed that I chose not to sit on or touch. Checking out the bedroom we discovered that the queen bed took up over 95% of the room. Since it was a four poster bed with rails for a canopy (minus the fabric) it was almost impossible to squeeze between the wall and the foot of the bed to reach the other side so we spent the weekend crawling over each other to get in and out and trying to avoid the stained, cigarette burnt blankets. I ended up with a rash everywhere my skin was exposed to the sheets. The kitchen was another special surprise. The faucet was functional although it was missing its handle. We had no ice bucket for the ice machine and resorted to using the carafe from the coffee pot since it didn't work. The original built in mini fridge was rusted and broken and had been replaced with a new fridge which was the only new thing in the whole unit. The glasses, silverware and dishes in the cub bard and drawers were not what you would consider clean. The some of the amenities in the bathroom were partially used. There were of course not additional rooms available.

We had the 1 bedroom suite that in the picture is 2nd floor all the way to the right. It is probably the best room and looks just like the pictures.

DO NOT expect anything fancy or luxury, but instead a welcoming home like atmosphere. Things not to like - no view of the water (we knew this before we went just pointing it out). No snack machine, there is a soda machine and an ice machine, but snacks you'll have to go get. The continental breakfast is nothing special, but hey, it's free. (Unlike local calls) In our room specifically, the refrigerator was rusting on the inside, and that is my biggest complaint. We also had an old TV which worked fine but had no captions. Definately do not get the room on the second floor all the way to the left, it sticks out into the alley (at that is your view instead of the pool). Parking can be a little tight, and it may take a trip around the building to find a space. Also, PB is a great neighborhood, but there are a lot homeless people (who are generally harmless) around.

The furniture is comfortable, and there are lots of extra blankets and pillows if you don't need the sleeper sofa beds. The shower has good water pressure and hot water lasts at least 30 minutes a shot (I take this long so I know for sure). It has A/C but open windows can really get a good breeze coming through the unit. The pool and hot tub were nice and warm, if standard, and the staff was very pleasant. (Other guests are friendly too, be sure to say Hi in passing) It's close enough to Garnet (5 blocks) to walk, but far enough away to be away from the party atmosphere. A public beach access is almost directly behind the hotel, with requiste good sand and nearby life guard stand. The Cystal Pier is really close - a must see.
