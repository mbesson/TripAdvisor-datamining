Very old part of town, just out the front door at Sint Olofspoort stood the first gate to the city, close to the Red Light District, but not too close. Surrounded by many cafes, restaurants, shops, music cabarets, and sights to see. They have a wonderful breakfast, and a restaurant just down stairs (try the Erwtensoep or \"Snert;\" Dutch pea soup)that has ample terras and indoor seating, as well as a cafe (bar) that connects to the lobby. The rooms are \"large\" for Amsterdam standards, kept very clean, and have lots of windows to watch the action outside, and let in a cool breeze. I have been lucky enough to stay in room 210, the \"Chet Baker Room,\" twice now. For Jazz fans this is a sacred place, as it is where trumpeter Chet Baker unfortunately fell from the window to his death. There is a small plaque outside on the wall commemorating him, hard to find, but this is definitely the room where he stayed his final day on Earth. The Proeflokal (tasting house) \"de Oovievaar\" is directly to the right as you go out the front door, one of the best places in all of Holland for trying Dutch and Belgium genevers. Also right across from here is \"Int de Aepjen,\" perhaps the oldest Brown Bar in town, even though this fact is up for debate. Walk down Zeedijk Straat and you will find plenty of places to eat, as well as endless cafes, and maybe a coffeeshop, keep going South and you will end up at the Nieuwmarkt, another interesting part of town. For being so close to Centraal Station this place is quiet enough to get a good nights sleep. The staff is very pleasant and can help you with directions etc. It is very hard to not have a fun filled stay at this place.

The hotel has some contradictions within it. It means that some of the things are really good and some are really bad. lets start with the good ones. The room is very clean. the service is served every day with no surprises (and its good). the location is excellent because its less than 100 meters from central station, where all the trams, buses and trains (easy to come easy to come back). The stuff is very welcome although the person in the reception insisted on taking the money in cash (or in credit, but immediately). our complains that the last payment (1/3 of it) will be payed in cash or in credit card only at the end of the order and meanwhile he will take empty credit card voucher (like it is managed by everyone) were decisively denied. so, if you plan on cash and coming to this hotel, you will have to pay cash or immediately charged in credit card at the start of the order for all the time you will stay there. beside that, the stuff were friendly. Breakfasts are good! There are some defects as well: the entry to the room comes as several steep stairs (about a meter high) so it is strange. when you climb about these stairs you will get a very spacious room. the stairs are not suitable for handicap. the room is actually quite pleasant but the windows are barely open (only to a small crack. so if you want some fresh air, you won't get it here. The bath is big but 2 comments: there are no hangers at all in the bath so you have to put your towels and clothes on the toilet chair's cover and also the shelf under the mirror is tiny. we were 2 persons in the room and we barely managed our stuff on this tiny shelf. there is no alternative wherer to put your stuff beside the tiny shelf. there's neither kettle nor cups so forget about coffee in early mornings unless you go down to the coffee shops in the street. the last hallucinatory problem is the mirror which stands in oblique line simply because the wall of the room is like this. so you can stand in front of the mirror and see only your shoes (in the best case).... To our question, they brought us ,immediately i must say, some smaller mirror, not connected to any wall. Summary: There are quite good things about the hotel like location (best) and cleaniness, but the noise from the street is quite hard. the other \"strange\" things, togather with the lack of devices in the bath, caused us to decide that next year we will be in another place, probabely in this surrounding. one more thing, they have great humour, one of us got an orange juice with a tiny bug/muskito and the waiter didn't become confused and said, \"thats mother nature...\". he promised us the next bug (in the next cup) on the house...", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGood Value & Location\u201d", "Author": "Hel1982", "ReviewID": "UR117636006", "Content": "This hotel was facing the train station and close to all tourist attractions.

This set-up had the feeling of a small apartment (but without a kitchen). It was a twin room, partially in the roof space with three windows onto the narrow street at the back of the hotel and another window in the roof. The room was very spacious and the furnishings were reasonable, with heavy wood furniture. There was a wall-mounted LCD TV (not widescreen) with channels that included BBC1 and BBC2, but the picture was very grainy (obviously not digital). There were no tea/coffee facilities in evidence. The room was not the warmest place for a snowy night in November (the wall-heater was small for the room size and didn't seem to be on). The bathroom was warmer and was again roomy, with both a bath and shower (over). I was quite satisfied with this room until I pulled back the bedspread of one of the beds to find a stained sheet, which was definitely not acceptable. I therefore used the other bed but found there was insufficient bedding for such a cold night. Another serious grievance with this room was that the electrical plug for one of the bedside lamps had no cover and was therefore dangerous. Breakfast was available in a bar/diner with a traditional, rustic feel and was completely self-service. The range of food was good and could not be faulted. I must stop short of giving this hotel a 100% recommendation due to the serious problems that I found in my otherwise charming and pleasing room. If staying at this hotel, I advise you to inspect your room thoroughly before deciding whether to accept it.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "greece", "Title": "\u201cback to the 80's\u201d", "Author": "sx_Greece", "ReviewID": "UR84434730", "Content": "I have stayed in a building right next to the main one, from the outside it looked excellent but when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve opened me the door I saw a narrow spiral stair that I had to climb with my luggage.

Im glad I wasn't able to find somewhere else! We all had a great stay & a great weekend!! This is not a hotel for a romantic break or family holidays or for business travellers who need comfort but for singles or carefree couples its perfect for exploring the city. Just across the road from the central train station (around 4 euros each way for 15 min journey to/from airport) & lots of tram stops its ideally located. On the map it appears right on the edge of the red light district, which in a way it is, but its far enough away that we never felt insecure or in any danger. Nearly everything in the city centre is within walking distance so long as you have a pair of comfy shoes. The hotel wasn't stylish but all 5 of our rooms were very clean & we had plenty of room. The bathrooms were spotless & the rooms were tidied each day. The stairs were indeed a nightmare but we didnt have to use them as the lift was always in perfect working order. Breakfast was fairly good and the hotel bar was cosy & friendly. The hotel staff were all very nice except for the guy at reception on the day we checked out who was very rude to 1 of the girls but otherwise we have no complaints at all.

My apartment was especially large but the rooms seem to be quite large in general from my observations - I was able to sneak glances into a few rooms while they were being tidied and they seemed reasonably generously sized on the whole. The decor, it has to be said, is a bit tired and could do with freshening up in some spots. There were also exposed gas and water pipes in the stairwell up to the bedroom which were painted white to match the stairwell and did not detract from the overall look of the apartment, although those of an aesthetically delicate nature would not like them. The furniture was also slightly worn and faded; my couch had a small cigarette burn on one arm. I would also caution elderly travellers that the hotel also has a lot of steep stairs but only one small elevator. The beakfast buffet was OK if unspectacular, the usual European selection of sliced meats, cereals, bread, crackers, drinks and scrambled eggs.

Its 2 minutes away from Centraal station. Canal cruises. All the cuisine you could want. Chinese, indian, thai, english and more. Coffee shop just round the corner literally 2 minutes walk with good prices. Hotel could do with air con and a fridge. Rooms are cleaned on a daily basis and someone comes round to check to see if your happy. A continental breakfast is served from 7am-10.15am they have a bar and a resteraunt quite reasonable prices. The staff are helpful and your allowed to smoke in the rooms. Smoking is practically accepted everywhere in Amsterdam even in McDonalds. The red light district is also about 3-4 minutes walk round the corner of the hotel and is well worth visiting. The only things you have to mind is which way the trams, bikes and cars are going and then your safe lol.

I normally book through one of the travel websites but on this occasion, none of them gave me anything within my budget for the dates requested. I therefore e-mailed nearly 80 hotels and B&Bs (I'm not joking) and got positive replies from only 3 or 4, among whom was the Prins Hendrik. So I definitely did not choose this hotel based on reviews or anything. And for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150 per night for a double I thought it was expensive. As mentioned by other reviewers, the hotel is convenient to get to upon arrival at the Centraal Station. Our room was very big actually but it was extremely dated and not well-maintained (toilet flush was coming apart), our wardrobe also acted as a storage room for the hotel (an unused bidet and a toilet were stored away in there!). There was no finesse to the place at all, e.g. different parts of the curtains were made of different material. There were some stains on the duvet but let's not get into that. The room was cleaned everyday to a good standard though, and they changed our towels everyday. Our room overlooked the main road and so yes, it was fairly noisy... but we were so tired from walking around all day round Amsterdam we hardly noticed it after we hit the sack. Our bed was also quite far from the window which helped. The guy at reception told us that breakfast was very good, and I guess it was, for 3* standards. We had cold cuts, bacon and scrambled eggs, cereals, jams and different breads, coffee and tea, and juice. Only oranges for fruit. There were lots of tables for breakfast so am not sure why some people complained abt not having seats. All in all, I'd say that looking around at some of the other hotels around Amsterdam, the Prins Hendrik was about average. I get the feeling that Amsterdam is such a popular place for weekend visitors that these 2* and 3* hotels have no real interest in really offering something special to their guests.", "Date": "April 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "brighton uk", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel well worth it\u201d", "Author": "seebass", "ReviewID": "UR4999412", "Content": "Me and my friend stayed at prins hendrik in february 2006 and the room was very good.

The location is probably the best point to it 10m from warmoestraat and centraal station which makes it very easy to find when checking in.

The room was filthy; the towels were grey from being so dirty, and were so worn out you could see through them. The bathroom was dirty, the bedding was shabby, and there was tons of noise in the room from the street.
