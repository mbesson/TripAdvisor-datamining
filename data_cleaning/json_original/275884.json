Located about 1 km north of the main railroad station, and about 1-l/2 km east of the Borghese Gardens, this villa (built in 1900) was about 100 meters from a bus and tram stop, and a 5-to-10 minute walk to Metro stop. In a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood within walking distance of really good, economical restaurants, perfect after a long day's touring, or even a hectic day of business. Rooms called small by other reviewers were spacious by European standards, my pal and I moved around easily. Terraces were available to all, complete with chaises-longues, for relaxing in the mild Roman nights. The pricing for rooms was low compared to the dubious privilege of staying in the Centro Storico, or anywhere near it, any why bother when you are 10 to 15 minutes by taxi or bus, tram or Metro away from almost anything you want to see? The staff, again, were warm, professional and totally helpful with directions, including maps, making reservations, etc. I love Rome, and stayed downtown and near it, but I'm staying here again.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but not central\u201d", "Author": "evheg", "ReviewID": "UR118932328", "Content": "Nice hotel in a lovely quite neighborhood but you need to get public transport to get anywhere lovely local Italian restaurants ask for recommendations at reception overall good but a bit far out might be good for kids ad it's quite", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cDefinately NOT recommanded\u201d", "Author": "traveller0238", "ReviewID": "UR89756321", "Content": "From the pictures you may think that this is a nice, good furnished hotel. Our experience however showed that this is far from true. The rooms are small (it is almost impossible to walk around the bed) and extremely hot and dark. There were no windows in our room, only an exit to the balcony. Because of the heat we had to leave the doors to the balcony open, allowing everyone to enter into the room, so this was not without a risk. The bathroom stank and the bed was very hard, making it difficult for the blood to circulate and thus causing 'sleeping' limbs. The tv set was very small (15 inch or so), making it almost impossible to watch a movie. We asked the guy at the reception desk to fix the air conditioning. Clearly irritated ty the question, he told us that in the winter it only blows hot air and the only thing that he could do was to switch it off (which he never did). The breakfast consisted of a couple of croissants, some sandwiches, orange juice and undrinkable coffee. Definitely NOT good. Furthermore there was this woman, never speaking a word and watching us every move and counting the bread each time we took some. It was as if the woman was like a ghost that could not find rest in the hereafter; knocking about in the restaurant of the hotel. We made jokes about this, but certainly, this was the most ridiculous experience we ever had (in a hotel)! There is no (internal) telephone guide and the information provided by the staff is unreliable. For example we asked at what time the first metro leaves during weekdays. We were told from 05:00 AM. As a result we found a closed metro station at 05:05 AM the day we left, because in reality the first metro leaves about 06:00 AM! The doors at the hotel are locked by a chain and a padlock during the night, making it impossible to leave the hotel in case of an emergency.

We had room 304 which had a huge private terrace, would definitely recommend trying to get that room. The room itself was cosy but big enough for the two of us with all our stuff, the bathroom on the other hand was quite small with limited surface space to set things down (although the size of the terrace more than made up for this!) Breakfast was limited, breads, ham, cheese, pastries, eggs, cereal and yoghurts etc, and as we were staying for a week it became rather bland, eating the same thing every day, although it hit the spot until lunch time. The hotel has a metro station within 3 mins walk and is situated two metro stops from termini train station, from which you can reach anywhere in the city. We bought a week long travel pass for 16 euro - bargain! If you don't mind not being in the heart of city life then this hotel will suit well, however I think I'd prefer to have been a little closer to the centre. Be warned - there aren't any shops or restaurants close to the hotel, there could have been but we coldn't spot any. If we wanted anything we bought it at termini (plenty of shops there) and brought it back to the hotel.
