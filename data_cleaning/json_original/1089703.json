{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice location but average rooms I stayed here twice between 2003-2005 and booked it through JTB, a Japanese travel agency. Their website actually has a reservation function but only in Japanese.The price has gone up over the years, though I am not sure if the quality has caught up. It is a typical business hotel with tiny single rooms (remember this is Japan).Also, very few rooms are non-smoking and I had to open the window to get some fresh air.Location-wise, it is within walking distance to Tokyo Station and quite a few restaurants and convenience store nearby, but otherwise the area is devoid of cultural sites or even big shopping malls.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR413163529", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Machaboy"}, {"Content": "don't be fooled by the website We booked our stay at the hotel by phone (as their otherwise lovely website had no way to book online) and were relieved to find a hotel in the city at a reasonable rate and near the central train station. Their website, and the beautiful lobby, suggested that we'd found a great place. Our room, however, suggested otherwise. I know how tiny Tokyo hotel rooms are, but it is reasonable to expect that they are clean and well maintained. Our initial room was dingy, with some peeling wallpaper and the smell of old smoke. We took it, but were fairly horrified to later find a stain on one of the sheets that was either smudged chocolate, dried blood, or something worse. Even more bothersome was that none of these were ours. Further inspection revealed someone else's hair as well. The desk staff allowed us to move our own belongings and selves (including our sleeping daughter) to a nearby room, and this one was in slightly better condition. It was not good enough, however, to warrant another stay next time we're in town. For this price range and room size, I'd recommend a Toyoko Inn. They're in all major Japanese Cities, are often near train stations if this is needed, and are a better value. Sad, because I generally prefer independent businesses.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR458819497", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AnAmericanIn"}, {"Content": "decent room for a decent price Booked the hotel through the Japanese version of hotelclub: Rakuten Travel. Paid 5500 Yen a night for a single room.Hotel is located in a business/office area, so it is very quiet area after working hours. The hotel is a 10-15 min walk to Tokyo station, has 2 subway stations near it, so it is convenient for sightseeing. It is one or two stops to Tokyo station and couple of stops to the fish market and imperial palace.It does take 20 min or so to get to Shinjuku. Around the hotel are many convenient stores and some restaurants. Very safe area, because it is very close to a police station and the fire department. :)The hotel entrance and lobby looks very modern and stylish, however the room was very old dated. I stayed in a single room that was quite spacious for Japanese standard. It was clean came with the standard stuff: fridge, tiny bathroom, tv with Japanese channels, CNN and a Korean channel. I did not bring a laptop so had to make use of their computer downstairs. Paid 100 Yen per 10 minutes to access the internet. Staff was friendly, helped me to get around in Tokyo, as I arrived from Tokyo station where there is not a Tourist info center.", "Date": "Oct 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR972352439", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "yogi1919"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d1089703-r23275064-Center_Hotel_Tokyo-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1089703", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
