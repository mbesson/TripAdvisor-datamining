The hotel was situated in a lovely quiet street right next to a gorgeous park. With tram links just round the corner that take you straight to amsterdam city centre we found this better than staying too close. Tram fares are also relatively cheap. There was quite a variety on offer for breakfast and you can eat as much as you like. Hotel staff were polite and helpful. Room was very clean and had been described as a 'small' double room so we were quite impressed by its size. The windows had net curtains as well as blackout curtains. The room was a little cold although the heating was on however we were quite happy with that. The hotel also runs a shuttle service straight to the airport which we found very handy as our flight was early in the morning. The shower area was clean with plenty of towels and shower wash. The shower was temperamental with the temperature and it took a while to gage it. The lock on the room door looked as though it had recently been broken and hadn't been repaired very well however the door still appeared to lock properly but left us a little nervous as to the security of the room. We did report this however it had not been repaired by the time we left to go home. Breakfast time was from 7 - 10.30 however as our flight was so early the hotel staff allowed us to have our breakfast at 6.30 am. There was the usual tv (satellite) hair dryer and coffee facilities however there was no iron so would recommend taking a travel iron if staying at this hotel.

We loved Amsterdam but would not stay at this hotel again. The room itself was a decent sized double and clean on the surface but it was clear most of the furniture/fittings needed a good dusting. The bed linen was too big for the duvet/pillows and none of the furniture matched properly, 2 of the chairs actually had large holes and tears in the leather. The bed was very comfortable though, and we had a beautiful view out over the Vondelpark with large floor to ceiling windows - but it's a shame they steamed up so easily in the morning, and it would have been nice if they'd remembered to put up the white curtain for privacy (it was hanging on a hanger by the door) because the back of the hotel also faces apartments. There wasn't a fridge but it was so cold outside we just put what we wanted on the window sill outside as the windows opened - very handy for a diet coke! We only had 1 pillow each, and no spares or blankets. No info leaflets or do not disturb notice, but the TV was good and we got BBC1 and ITV1. The bathroom was small but again the same level of cleanliness (the tissue box looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months). The shower itself was a small cubicle and a huge shower head which meant having very little room to move without getting wet. Yes, it's a shower and you would want that - but not if you don't want to wash your hair every day which I was annoyingly forced to do. It really wasn't a pleasant experience showering, the water wasn't very powerful, the streams thin and sparse which made it difficult to rinse my hair properly. It was equally impossible to lather my body properly with the spray of the water reaching the entirety of the cubicle, and the temperature was impossible to get right - it would just go really hot without even touching the controls. Odd also was the toilet roll holder being situated so that you couldn't properly sit on the loo without scratching yourself on it. Body wash and hand wash were provided, but no other hotel minis, and the loo roll itself was really rough. The wall-attached hairdryer was useless (it was freezing outside and I had just been forced to wash my hair), the towels were small and there wasn't a heated towel rail or shower mat for the floor. Unfortunately, we also had the noisiest creaking floor outside our room and we could hear everything and everyone going past, there was very little sound proofing and we were woken up several times during the night with passing guests. The lift didn't work from the ground floor (you had to go down to the basement to call it) and there appeared to be no attempts to have it fixed. The wi-fi was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8 a day I think, but there was a free to use computer in the lobby which was very very handy. The breakfast was disappointing too - no cooked breakfast except scrambled eggs that were a bit grey or hard boiled eggs and some DIY toast. There was a large array of processed hams and cheeses, packet croissants/pastries, granola/corn flakes, yoghurt, tinned fruit salad and concentrated fruit juice - there's a lot there but the quality was not something I'd expect to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 for. Particularly of note was the large sign stating that no food could be taken from the breakfast room. What if I want to finish my breakfast upstairs whilst showering? I've paid for it I should be able to do what I like with it thanks. The only positive thing I'd say was that they had rooibus tea which is something I very rarely find in hotels. However, the hotel staff were helpful and courteous, and the location was very good - very close to good tram links and on a lovely quiet street close to the park. As isolated complaints, the above isn't so bad, but collectively they made our stay at this hotel a little more stressful than relaxing.

Taking into account the negative reviews, we weren't expecting a great experience, but for a budget break we didn't want to break the bank. However, I was very pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The hotel is very close to the museum district, and easily accessible from Schipol (the airport). We took a train to the central station, and then picked up a tram (very speedy and affordable way to travel). When we first arrived we ended up walking further than necessary because we didn't use the right tram stop, but it allowed us to see that the hotel is one block over from one of the most prestigious streets in Amsterdam - with many shops that we couldn't afford to go in! The hotel is walking distance to museums such as the Van Gogh, and you can get to Leidesplein (lots of bars and restaurants) in about 5 minutes via the park. On arrival, we were too early to check in but they were happy to store our bags for us and the lady on reception gave us a map and directions to a local market, the Albert Kuyp market, which gave us a throroughly enjoyable afternoon before we returned to check in. Our triple room was spacious (actually containing four single beds) had a clean bathroom, and plenty of towels, which were replenished daily. We had a desk/dressing table, tv, bedside tables and a wardrobe. Throughout our stay the staff were helpful and willing to assist us with directions and information to get to various tourist attractions. Breakfast was a variety of fruit juices, cereal, bread, pastry, meats and cheeses. I admit I'm not the most picky traveller - I don't need state of the art technology or brand new furniture, I just need cleanliness, space and helpful staff.

When we arrived back to our hotel at 2pm we were freaked by a rentokill man who was checking the hotel over for mice, as you can imagine now we are not happy girls, we confronted the man on reception who tells us the problem in under control and not to worry, but seriously you cannot help but worry when you have a rentokill man walking around the hotel in front of customers. We went to our rooms in disgust and they looked ok now to be fair the man showd us how to use shower etc, within 2 minutes of him leaving the room he knocked on the door to see if he could check something and we agreed nervously, he had the nerve to bring a rentokill man into our bedroom and check a mouse trap behind the bed. The two men now were trying to reasure us that there was no mice, on our entire visit we were freaked out by this we never seen a mouse in the hotel but come on you dont bring a rentokill man into your room to check the trap while you have paying guests sitting there watching you!!! Bad idea!!! Hairdyer was broken and light didnt work in our room, window sill was all cracked and broken and one window was tied with wire because it was also broken so overall i would not recommend this hotel to anyone. When you pay the price that we paid the least you expect is a room thats clean and not looking around the room your hole visit for mice. Our bathroom door wouldnt lock either. We also seen reviews after we had booked this hotel about bed bugs but thank god we didnt come across any of these either.

There was a lift to the second floor (the one above the ground floor). The room we were given was a reasonable size. It had a large bed, a writing table and a chair, and an easy chair. We found the suitcase stands were adequate, allowing us to use what we wanted without unpacking everything. Yhe lights were bright enough to read by. Our room overlooked the street (oh no!) and the HOTEL sign was outside our window (oh no!). In fact, neither caused us the least concern. The curtains darkened the room, and there was no street noise. The bathroom was small but adequate, It was old fashioned but clean. However, toilet bags had to go on the floor as there was no shelf or vanity top. On the other hand, the shower was hot and powerful. Security was good, with a small strongbox in a cupboard, and card security for the door. The bed was comfortable and warm (it was autumn, and the nights were chill). The room was clean, as you would expect of Holland. Surprisingly, the stair carpets were grubby. Fittings were well worn but servicable (or old fashioned and comfortable, depending on your view). Staff were welcoming and friendly, even when under pressure. They were of assistance to us in several ways, and took a personal interest in our requests. Internet was free, with one computer in the lobby. The tariff included breakfast. This was a buffet, and quite a good one at that. The dining room was comfortable, and the food was kept fresh and replenished as necessary. There were many restaurants nearby for other meals, and staff were quick to point out the most popular. The hotel is well located. From the hotel it was an easy walk to the Flower Market, the Reijksmuseum, van Gogh collection, many other museums and a lovely park. Waterlooplein was also in walking distance but we chose not to go to the flea market there. Instead we walked along the canals and explored some of the galleries. The best thing about the hotel was the staff. They were friendly and helpful at all times, and were efficient and obliging. The food was good, and the shower was tops.

Just returned from the City Garden Hotel in Amsterdam! I loved it! I don't understand why there are negative reviews of this hotel - my only thoughts from the reviews and reviewer pictures are that it has probably had a major re-furb in the last 2 years. We were only looking for somewhere to put our head down but this was far more than we could of ever expected. We booked last minute through Booking.com and paid a total of \u00c2\u00a3155 for two people for two nights for what is referred to as a small well equipped double / budget double - room 169. The Hotel: This hotel is a three star and I would say that was about right. It's clean and well furnished and looks pleasant from the outside. When we were staying there was a mixture of people staying. Not many British tourists, lots of spanish, german, italian tourists of all ages. I think my boyfriend and I were the youngest (mid twenties). There was also couples with young babies. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are looking for a lively / noisy place to stay or if you intend on having parties in your room. If you are looking for a comfortable & quiet place to stay then read on..... The Location: We arrived in Amsterdam at 8am and couldn't check in until 2pm we decided to try our luck and get an early check in around 12pm unfortunately we couldn't but the reception staff were more than happy to look after our luggage for us. Walking down Hoofstraat to the hotel I was thrilled - it's located in what is referred to as the Museum and Fashion district - on the same street is Chanel, Louis Vuitton etc and it is in walking distance from various museums inc. Van Gogh Museum & the Heineken Brewery. A minute further down the street past the hotel is the entrance to the beautiful VondelPark which is where we spent a lazy few hours in the sun waiting for check in. At the top of the road are various trams that get you to many different places in the city. You could get a tram straight from Centraal Station to the hotel if you needed. The Room: When we got to the room we were thrilled. It was small yes but it was more than big enough for two and had a huge window facing onto the street. We had a double bed - (Fantastic -not two singles pushed together)!!!! - it had a very comfortable mattress and had plenty of pillows and covers- a wardrobe with hangers, a dresser table/desk with chair & mirror, a full length mirror, about 4 lamps, an en suite shower room with toilette & hairdryer, a TV with plenty of English channels subtitled in Dutch, phone, Kettle with tea (fruit & normal) & coffee, cups, saucers & spoons. The shower deserves a special mention it was a good size, super powerful with a never ending supply of scorching hot water - bliss - actually bigger and nicer than my own. There is also a hair dryer in the bathroom - a tube that comes out of the wall - it is more than adequate - I have really long thick hair & my hair was bone dry within 10 minutes. The maids also tidied and replaced towels every day. I was most impressed that the rooms looked exactly like they did on the hotel website. The Breakfast: The breakfast is included in the price and is served buffet style between 7am - 10am - regularly being replenished - it's great you can eat & drink as much as you want which is good if, like us, you're on a budget. We found 8am was a good time to eat - not too busy still plenty of food. Each day there was scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, various breads to toast and rolls, croissants, three types of ham, cheese, cereals, jams, yogurt and fruit salad (the tinned type). Along with orange juice and apple juice (both from concentrate) and various tea's and coffees. The staff at the hotel really can't do enough for you and are happy to make suggestions and book you onto excursions. The reception also seemed to be always manned - even when we arrived back in the early hours. I felt very safe & comfortable the whole time I was there. I couldn't recommend this place to you enough. Although the hotel is only a small part of a city break as you obviously want to be out and about the majority of the time it was really great to come back to such a comfortable room after a hard days sight seeing and also enjoy yourself safe in the knowledge that your belongings & money are safe in your room.

We were checked in promptly and politely and our room was adequately sized (there were four of us in a family room). Multi channel TV, clean bathroom, tea and coffee etc. but a bit short of hanging/drying space for what was a very wet weekend. Breakfast was a buffet-style with plenty to choose from and unusually was included in the price, which was a major deciding factor for us. Staff were friendly and spoke excellent English. We had a couple of problems. Firstly, the room safe had been left open by the previous occupant in the 'locked' position, so we couldn't use it. Reception said that they would sort it out when the next person with the master key came on duty. This turned out to be 11.00pm, when Reception kindly telephoned the room, duly waking us up and offering to fix the safe. Needless to say we declined, thinking they'd do it in the morning. They didn't and we heard nothing more about it and we did without it for our stay. On our last evening we were watching TV when a mouse appeared in the middle of the floor then quickly disappeared. We could not find where it went and reported it to Reception, who apologised and noted the fact but could do nothing about the mouse itself. To be fair, they offered to move us to another room, but with it being our last night we said we'd put up with it. We heard it in the small hours behind the dresser, but could do nothing about it and didn't see it again before check out. However, the attraction seemed to be the sugar sachets from the tea/coffee facilities which the rodent had clearly got wise to. Looking at some of the older reviews on this site, it seems that rodent infestation is not new at this hotel and clearly the professionals need to be brought in. I was also a bit surprised that the windows were single-glazed, which meant that even low-level noise from outside could be heard, especially at night, and also meant that heat was going straight from the radiators out of the window.

Our room had torn sheets, holes in the walls,rust around the sink and shower plugs, fur growing on the ceiling of the bathroom, filthy carpets and Rentokill mouse traps around the skirting boards. One couple we talked to had been bitten all night and couldn't sleep. We were very dissapointed and even rang our travel agent and tried to changed hotel but everything was fully booked, It was a Valentines holiday I booked and we had seperate beds, when I asked at reception if they would swap our rooms for a double they wasn't interested.
