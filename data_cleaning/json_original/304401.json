Our room was cosy and we had a nice view towards the Dubai centrum skyline. Pool area was clean and it was well equipped. I went few times also in the gym, training machines were good. Hotel has few own restaurants and also three individually operating restaurants. ( Mexican,Indian and \"steak house\") Overall service in Rydges Plaza is great and helpfull.

The rooms were quite spacious although as earlier mentioned would require little updating. Also the smell of cigarettes lingered in from the other rooms. The airconditioned seemed to be on full blast all the time, unless one switched it off completely. Even so the airconditioning the in the bathroom kept awfully loud noise. However I am a heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me at nights at all. Our room was facing the main road and we did find the noise a bit too loud at times. However the view was nice. Each room includes a kettle so were able to make tea and coffee and the water was provided free of charge by the hotel. The pool was very busy during the day and one had to get in early to get a seat. The pool area was kept very tidy and clean. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. We did not have breakfast included in our room, however there were several restaurants nearby so we used them. There was a good selection of restaurants for dinner as well. The shops nearby are inexpensive and would defenitelly recommend to stroll around them. We used both public transport and taxis to go around. However the metro station is about 20 minutes walk away although one can take a bus to get there. The taxis are cheap too and will take you exactly where you want them to. All in all this hotel was ok although we did miss wifi. There's nothing extra in here and would not recommend it if you wanted a romantic break.

The Rydges is an older style hotel, and therefore lacks the glitz and gaudiness which seems to be the norm in Dubai. However I consider the price we paid to be fair for the facilities on offer. Location wise, the hotel is about 20 minutes walk from the nearest metro, and Sheik Zayed road. Taxis are very cheap in Dubai, so we took advantage of the value and did not use the metro. It costs about 50 Dirham to Mall of the Emirates, and about 20 Dirham to the far superiour Dubai Mall. In the immediate vacinity of the hotel there are plenty of restaurants and supermarkets,and the fast food restaurant across the roundabout offers free wifi. Our room was fine, and like others have mentioned could do with updating. But it was well equipped with mini bar, iron and ironing board, room safe and bizarrely weighing scales!(Now I can only speak for myself, but, when I am on holiiday I rarely feel the need to weigh myself!!!!). I found the room to be very clean, and the bed was very comfortable, can't say the same about the pillows. Our room was at the back of the hotel, and you would hear the calls from the local mosques. However if you are very un-green, and sleep with the air con switched on at night, it will block out the noise and your sleep should not be disturbed. Likewise with the Thursday night music from the bar. My pet hate was the lack of wifi. Now coming from a bankrupt country where free or low cost wifi is readily available, it seems unbelievable that the management of this hotel do not offer wifi in the rooms. Please get with the times! It smacks of greed that wired internet is charged by the hour. We only found out about the free internet access in the business centre by chance, this information was not readily made known. We were on a bed and breakfast package and also visited some of the other outlets in the building. The breakfast buffet was consistently cold, but we got around this by ordering freshly made omlettes. You can also make waffles, and there was loads of different toppings. Staff in this restaurant were very hit and miss, very friendly but seemed put out if you requested a second cup of coffee! I hated the Australian sports bar. It was smokey and dark and felt slightly seedy. On the other hand, the Mexican restaurant on the 8th floor is fab, and you can just go for drinks in a much nicer atmosphere. The pool and jacuzzi were very well kept. Try and grab a sunbed on the side of the pool opposite the hotel building, that way you will be able to enjoy the sun all day long. There is a complimentary bus shuttle to the Jumeria Beach, but you will need to book in advance to ensure a seat. So there you have it. The Rydges Plaza is not the best hotel in Dubai, but neither is it the worst. It is not somewhere to go for a romantic break, but if you are looking for a good base in the city with reasonable facilities, then you can't go wrong with booking a room here.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manama", "Title": "\u201cFine Hotel\u201d", "Author": "MEtraveller11", "ReviewID": "UR124715863", "Content": "stayed in this hotel early Feb 2012, overall it is OK, location wise and all, however, cleanness wise they must improve, on my last day 3rd night I saw blood stain on the other side of the bed. that was disgusting, i can stand anything but not this thing, on other side, the room smelled (smell of smoke) I had to open the window to ventilate the room. otherwise everything was fine...just fine.

For the price, the room was extremely spacious and luxurious \u2013 we had a sofa with coffee table, desk, full wardrobe, large bathroom and entrance hallway. The bed was amazingly comfortable and large, especially if you haven't slept in a decent bed for a while. Internet was complementary and reasonably fast. The d\u00e9cor may feel a bit dated for some but we thought the service and facilities more than made up for it. Every day we went to the pool and gym area to relax and cool down. During the day the pool area is very busy so it pays to come early if you want to sun bathe. The gym is also well equipped and the adjoining bathroom and sauna area is very nice. We ate at the Italian restaurant at the front of the hotel a couple of times and we enjoyed the food there. The Aussie Legends bar was also a good place to grab a beer and relax. In the surrounding area there are much cheaper local food eateries and plenty of supermarkets to buy food from if you're on a tighter budget. To get around we mostly caught buses and used the metro system. Keep in mind that buses don't take cash, only pre-purchased tickets from the metro stations or ticket kiosks. The metro also shuts down on Fridays until 1PM \u2013 this caught us out when we were leaving for the airport and we ended up taking a taxi instead. It's about a 15 minute walk from the metro to the hotel. In the height of summer this could be a very painful experience but while we were there in November it was bearable. Taking a taxi around town may be a cheaper option if you're travelling with a larger group of people.

We went there during the Eid holidays earlier in November and the hotel staff turned down our request for an early check-in. This meant that we had to hang around the property for an hour after lunch and even after we had checked in around 2 pm, the staff took more than an hour to bring our luggage upstairs! We'd booked for four-days and three-nights and our package according to the online booking site, included free internet in the room. At the time of checkin, the staff agreed that internet would be free, but subsequently, the service wouldn't work and when we called reception, they said we'd have to pay for it. After a heated exchange (which ruined our holiday mood), we were told we'd be provided complimentary internet service even though it \"usually didn't come free\" and that the booking website had mentioned the freebie \"by mistake\". Anyway, when the internet did start working, the connection was pathetic and none of the emails I tried to send were actually delivered to any of the recipients, as I discovered later! We gave up on this ultimately and tried to concentrate on making the most of our vaccation. The next morning, the hotel shuttle to Jumeriah Beach left without us, that too, five minutes before the scheduled departure time - and with just lone passenger! This, despite reminding the hotel staff the night before that we'd be availaing the complimentary shuttle service to the beach the next day (another promise made online, where the hotel failed to deliver). The best part about the property is that its centrally located on Satwa roundabout and its minimum cab distance to Jumeriah Beach. Which is why we didn't bother about the shuttle service for the rest of our stay. However, the negativity and uncaring attitude of the staff left a bad taste in the mouth which utimately led to my leaving behind my digital camera and mobile phone in a taxi - which ruined our vaccation. All said, the hotel seemed to be grossly understaffed and the ladies manning the reception, especially a young Indian lady, was particularly negligent, rude and utterly unprofessional. Suffice it to say that in a city that has thousands of options, I'd definetely stay somewhere else on our next trip to Dubai.

The stay was the culmination of a 3 week Mediterranean cruise, so we were looking forward to relaxing in Dubai and seeing a few of its highlights after visiting there 2 years previously. Our flight arrived at midnight and after delays at the airport due to over-officious customs (kept all passengers waiting) and the non-appearance of our hotel transfer, we finally got to the hotel just before 2:00 am. The check-in process was inefficient due to the presence of a couple of young girls who took the staff\u2019s attention away from us. After finally getting our room key we unpacked in our very spacious room on the 3rd level. We found the room met our expectations fully - plenty of space, particularly the bathroom, and the bed was very comfortable. One problem we did encounter was there was only one towel, a problem that was quickly remedied the following day. Our main concern, however, was the loud music coming from the bar on the ground floor. It sounded like it was next door. We love music, but we were desperate for sleep after a long flight. I rang the front desk at 2:30 am and was advised that it was due to finish in 15 minutes. When I asked about the following night I was told that the band plays only on Thursdays and Fridays (this was Friday), so there would be no problem. Our friends were not affected as they were staying on the 6th floor. At 5:00 am we were awakened by the call to prayer which sounded like the loudspeaker was placed on the wall outside our room! Needless to say we had little sleep. The breakfast was good, although coffee/tea service was a bit slow. Each day we were supplied with large bottles of water free \u2013 a nice touch. Taxis are a must due to the hotel\u2019s location and the heat. The porter service was very good \u2013 he was very friendly and helpful. We made use of the Aussie Bar to watch the World Cup Rugby Final and had a great time although the venue was not smoke-free. We have stayed at Rydges hotels before in Australia and have found them very good. This stay was a disappointment to us because of the first night\u2019s interruptions and sloppy check-in service.

It also has various restaurants (italian) a themed bar called aussie legends with different entertainment every night and food was also available and various other venues for drink and food which we never tried due to lack of time. Would i stay here again i would probably say yes, but for over 24hours this time, why pay the extortinate rates in the top hotels to stay in Dubai when you can pay a pittance and still be in Dubai.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value\u201d", "Author": "TripperC2010", "ReviewID": "UR117688629", "Content": "Centrally located.

Also cigarette cartons were cheap! airport to the hotel was no longer than a 15 mins journey and didnt cost much especially when your splitting the bill between four girls. There was a guy by the name of armando at the hotel and he was always assisting us with everything and gave us great advice. We had many friendly laughters with him. The hotel has a bar where they do great cocktails but its not open for long but a great place to mingle and meet new people and have a few drink ups before going out. they have a chinese restaurant, indian and an italian restaurant all of which are slightly pricey but very good food. we had a slight issue with the hotel concierge as they tried charging us something like 50 dirhams for a cigarette burn on their linen but after a heated discussion with the hotel manager he was more thann happy to take that off the bill which was useful. We were surprised as to how centrrally located this hotel was. everyone is friendly and do their best to help. they have a hotel jacuzzi and a pool area with sun loungers and its very nice to go out in the morning have a swim, grab some breakfast and ehad out. when in dubai visit the following: - burjamaan mall, dubai mall and mall of emirates. My favourite was the dubai mall and you have the aquarium whcih you could visit in there. Mall od emirates is nice as they have the ski dubai and definately would recommend you visit! try out the 4x4 desert safari, Dubai city tour where you visit the gould souk (defo a must as the gold is cheap when you haggle!) Also visit the waterpark in atlantis the best waterpark I have ever been to in my life. the burj khalifa tour was great views of dubai and the burj al arab at night time looks amazing. clubs to visit: cavalli club, armani club and another club beginning with B but cant remember!! visited in June 2011 and would defo recmmend that you visit! loved every minute of i!", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for a stopover\u201d", "Author": "BrianR6", "ReviewID": "UR116483492", "Content": "What a great hotel for a stopover and at a good price too.

We travelled as two couples celebrating a 50th birthday. The hotel is quite old and probably a little old fashioned furnishings etc but do not let that put you off. We arrived late at night from queuing for ages at immigration at Dubai Airport where all officials are more interested in playing on their blackberries than letting people into the country. Taxi fare very reasonable. 50 Dirhams using airport taxis but returning from hotel only 23 Dirhams. Reception staff very helpful and efficient. We had booked 2 executive rooms that were inclusive of very adequate cooked breakfast and a great deal of free alcohol and canapes every evening between 6 and 8pm. We really made use of this as alcohol is quite expensive especially wine and beer. In fact the hotel were probably glad to get rid of us as we were the first in and last out every evening. It is worth upgrading as it is only a few pounds more!!! Rooms had huge beds and were very comfortable and quiet. Occasionally heard the call to prayer but hey you are in Dubai after all. We left our camera either in the hotel or in a taxi and the security staff trawled through the cctv for us. Unfortunately we did not get it back and we had not downloaded last photos so lost a lot of very personal photos of family etc. This was very upsetting as we tried taxi companies etc but the staff at Rydges were exemplary. Swimming pool lovely but a bit too warm. Same as in most very hot countries though. St Andrews Bar and Aussie |Bar did show lots of sport especially every premiership game you wanted. That was very important to us. I think there are about 7 restaurants in the hotel from pub grub to Mexican to Italian and more. All are of a reasonable quality. There is a gym but we did not bother. About 5 mins by taxi from beach and Dubai Mall etc. Be careful in taxis as they do tend to go round the world. Should cost about 16 to 20 Dirhams to get to Dubai mall and a little less for the beach. Saying that the hotel does have a free shuttle bus to the beach a couple of times a day.

These guys can also organise airport transfers for 50DHS. The food in the hotel is great too, you can sit in the lobby and snack on some nachos or potato wedges quite cheaply, whilst sipping on one of their milkshakes, which come highly recommended!

The hotel is situated on Satwa roundabout which is about half way between Bur Dubai and the north end of Jumeirah beach. Also, Sheikh Zayed Road is only about a mile away (In fact, you get a fantastic view of the tall buildings along SZR). The staff here are extremely polite and professional. As this hotel is smaller than the grand five star hotels the staff can offer a more personal service. I arrived at the hotel before 7am but was offered a twin room immediately. However, as I wanted a room with a king size bed I opted to wait until one was available. They let me use the showers in the gym in the meantime. Due to the recession the room rates had been reduced since I booked so the manager arranged for my prebooked rate to be amended which saved me quite alot. There are several restaurants here although I didn't try any because Al Dhiyafa Road is teeming with good (and cheap) restaurants. The hotel offers an airport shuttle but a taxi is cheaper. There is a swimming pool, jacuzzi and sun loungers on the first floor with a gym adjacent to it. A good tip is to join Rydges Priority Guest Club; it's free to join and you get a 10% discount on the room rate and 20% off of other hotel services. There is a laundry very close by which only charges six dirhams per item (much cheaper than hotel laundry rates), and a male hair and nail salon called Diva on Al Dhiyafa Road (well worth a visit gents!).

The TV was good with 2 english film channels and cnn and bbc news. The hotel has an aussie legends bar which opens till about 3am and has pool table and tv's etc but i warn you now, if you like a drink or two, take plenty of dirhams... Alcohol is very expensive.. A pint of beer, ie stella, heinekin or guinness will set you back circa 35 dirhams.. at the current rate of about 5 to the \u00a3.. it works out to about 7 quid a pint !!!! Spirits and wine even more expensive. This is the same as everywhere in Dubai. The hotel has a good choice of restaurants, indian, chinese, italian etc and again it certanily isnt cheap but very nice. Roughly expect to pay 15-20 quid each for a steak or decent main course. Most attractions are a cheapish taxi ride away but not walkable. Taxi's arent expensive and you can get to most attractions for less than a tenner. The airport is only 10 mins away too.

The Rydges Plaza has had a few bad reviews on here - primarily it would seem due to either the furnishings or the location. I would like to challenge these reviews as I've just got back from a very pleasant 4 night stay here. It's not a theme park, it's not a luxury enormodrome and it's not by the beach. It is VERY central, and it's got some character. LOCATION: Right on Satwa Roundabout, the hotel is minutes (depending on the traffic!) from the creek, the airport, Sheikh Zayed Road, the beach, anywhere. The taxis are cheap, safe and regular. OK, so there's a fire station opposite and a mosque over the road - but what do you expect, it's a city centre hotel not a luxury beach hotel. The local area is full of decent cheap restaurants, and there's a supermarket 3 mins walk away. ROOMS: The rooms are large, well furnished spotless. The bed in our room was very comfortable and absolutely massive. The bathroom was large, with a huge walk-in shower and plenty of smellies etc. TV was good - plenty of channels (BBC/Star etc). EATING/DRINKING: Breakfast was great - tasty and fresh, staff very attentive. There are about 6 eating establishments in the hotel - didn't use them at all other than for a sandwich by the pool for lunch - which was fine. There's a Chinese, a decent Indian, Mexican, American and Aussie Bar. The bar, Aussie Legends was packed on the Thursday - decent enough prices for a beer too. FACILITIES A small but perfectly adequate pool area - not really a hotel for sunbathing. Large gym/health club. Business Area. Internet access etc. Overall an excellent hotel, spotlessly clean, staff who went out of their way to ensure that we were well looked after.

The hotel is an old one with 1980's worn out furniture. The bathroom fixtures are also rusty. The staff at the resturant and reception are very rude and would not rise to a level of one star hotel. The breakfast was the most misrable part of the stay. They served basically bread/butter/jam..!!! I had to get into an arguement with the heasd waiter just to get an omllette!! Another negative side is the lack of car parking space in front of the hotel. You may have to park your car at a good walking distance across the street. Housekeeping was also not impressive. I recall having left for over 10 hours and back to find the my room was not cleaned. I have stayed in many hotels in Dubai both 4 & 5 stars...but this is difinatly the WORST hotel in Dubai.
