I will stick to the basics for this review, even though it is a bit late. Parking - though there is parking available at the hotel, there was no room for our vehicle (I believe they only have 6 or 7 spots) so we were directed to park at the Congress Centre underground for $24 per 24 hours with no in and out privileges. We were able to park in front of the hotel to unload our stuff to our room. The parking is on the next block and more convenient than we originally thought. And it's quite nice to walk through the Congress Centre. Definitely not a set back as everything was within walking distance to the hotel. Rooms - Our room was immaculate. A king size bed with updated linens, comfy pillows, a large bar fridge and a large electronic safe that was easy to use. We also had a side table with a leather chair and a desk with a chair. There was a large enough dresser that also served as the TV stand. The television was modern with DVD player. On the nightstand was an iPod dock/alarm clock which was a nice surprise. The bathroom is also updated, a bit small but the shower stall was large and there was enough counter space for all of my feminine necessities. Definitely sufficient for the two of us. The breakfast included boiled eggs, Fairmount sesame and plain bagels, white and brown bread (with ample toasters), yogurt, apples, bananas, cheese, peanut butter, jam, cream cheese, cereal, juice, milk, tea and the awesome espresso machine for specialty hot beverages (lattes and cafe au laits). The area is great and within walking distance of the main shopping areas, the old town and Chinatown.

The location is great and is only a 10 minute walk to the Old City district, in which there are plenty of great restaurants, bars, and gift shops. Montreal is generally expensive and this is the most expensive part of the city we stumbled upon. We had a great time walking around and even got the Bixie bikes to bike around the city.

It is walkable to central Montreal and the old city and it is right next to the Convention center which houses both a metro and the underground tunnels believe (RESO - although I might be wrong on this since we didn't use it).

Some of the staff can even help you with what streets to bike on to avoid some steep uphills. The only negative I could come up with is the parking. We had to park at the convention center, which although was very close (one block away) and very safe to walk to (at anytime of the day/night) and safe to keep parked, you couldn't really take it out except after 24 hours or else you would incur more charges. Parking is $20 and you get the ticket from the hotel so everything gets charged to your room. A little inconvenient but luckily the bikes took us EVERYWHERE we wanted to go in the city. Oh and there is a continental breakfast which is exactly what everyone says it is: good enough especially considering that it's inclusive. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Montreal.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, affordable and convenient to convention center\u201d", "Author": "TX3travelers", "ReviewID": "UR117245459", "Content": "I was attending a conference at the Montreal convention center the end of July and stayed at the Dauphin Hotel across the street.

Small reception area but friendly knowledgeable staff. A few vending machines. But once in your room. Pretty terrific! A refrigerator, a safe, your own Dell computer which worked better than using your own laptop with their connection. By many standards it is a huge roo. We had 2 queen size beds with quite comfortable mattresses (and I have a bad back and was ok). A leather desk chair and 2 other chairs for watching flat screen tv and still plenty of room to move around in. And NO carpet. Wood floors! So much cleaner and less germy. Also a large totally tiled bathroom with modern fixtures for sink and shower. Everything you could wan t unless you were looking for pure luxury, room service etc. The rooms were quite modern with scandanavian style furniture and were very clean and kept that way. Huge windows for light and good block outs for nighttime. Oh, and THE ENTIRE HOTEL IS NON SMOKING AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY! Breakfast was actualy quite good unless you were expecting a hot meal. The coffee machine was to die for wih absolutely the best expresso, latte, cappucino good quality beans and also another machine for regular coffee. Hardboiled eggs, fresh fruits, yogurt, reguar breads for toasting, some mini croissants, HOMEMADE (I saw the do it) bran muffins and sesame bagels from one of the 2 oldest bagel bakeries for which Monrteal is known (a special type of bagel making process). I couldn;t ask for more. Parking was $20USD/nt with in/out privileges and while expensive, it was convenient under the building or overflow down the street.. Elevators worked only with your room key card so good secure place. Sorry some people expected more-but if you go on their website you learn that there is no pool or real restaurant or bar.So there should be no surprises. It is next to the Palais de Congress, near the Metro, walking distance to all of the old city. And a decent rate! My husband once again was thrilled by my research on Trip Advisor.

Small fridge was very good too. Laundry facility is free; just buy the detergent for $1. Air conditioning works well and window opens also, so we could breathe fresh air.

On a negative side, one has to get used to the hassle of constantly using the room key to operate the elevator or to turn on the lights, but it is a very minor inconvenience. Breakfast buffet has good selection with yogurt, several kinds of cheese, mini-croissants, hard boiled eggs, plus all the usual kinds of breakfast food, though I could not learn to love steamed kidney beans for breakfast. Juices (orange and cranberry) are very fresh. I saw the kitchen employee open a large bottle of fresh orange juice and pour it into the juice dispenser, contrary to often diluted juice in some US hotels.

Although there was some confusion regarding our reservation, we eventually ended up in Ste. 902, top floor. And a bargain price for this excellent location - 149.00/night. It was huge, with 2 flat screen TV's, our own computer (husband used laptop hooked to their free internet as well), king size bed, large L shaped black leather couch, windows that open! Air conditioning, gorgeous bathroom with double glass shower, giant oval tub you could practically swim in, lovely spa soaps and creams ! We travel a lot, and this place really was great, and also included free morning paper at your door, plus continental brekkie downstairs every morning - fresh juice, bananas, apples, an assortment of bagels (sesame Montreal bagels are the best!), muffins, croissants, cereals, yogurt, cream cheese, etc. Certainly a great way to fuel up for a busy day of sightseeing - a short 6-7 minute walk straight down the street to Old Montreal, Notre Dame, Rue St. Paul etc. Subway station Place d'armes is right at the Palais de Congress (1/2 block) to connect you to the whole city. Cabs are everywhere and can be hailed on the street or phoned and will be there in minutes. Excellent service. Also there is a great bike rental system throughout the city, pick up a bike from one location, return to another of your choice. $5.00 for a 24 hour rental. We had some great dinners - famous places such as Moishes (since 1938, in the Jewish quarter - take a cab there and walk back), Gibby's (Old Montreal) those two are revered steak houses. Schwartz's on St. Laurent is an equally old establishment, Montreal smoked meat sandwiches- always crowded, can eat in or take out - kosher dills, buy some spices - yummy. We also took a walking tour of Old Montreal - 3 hours long, we left from the Palais de Congres right near our hotel - very interesting, lots of history there for sure. Be sure to go inside Notre Dame cathedral - spectacular. Keep going back as far as you can and you will get to another awesome chapel. Bells ring on the hour. There is an awesome roof top terrace on top of the Hotel de la Montagne, (short cab ride from hotel) drinks and snacks only, no dinner - but what a view!

First the positive, it's in a great location, really central and easy to get to the main shopping area, and to the old town. There is good wi-fi connection and a restricted buffet breakfast included. There are a couple of things I'm not sure about, the pc in the room seems like a good idea, but to be honest i wouldn't trust it with anything other than basic surfing, with no antivirus and windows defender not working properly I wouldn't connect a flash drive even though it has office on it. It also takes up space, and they have already taken a reasonable sized room and, imo, overfilled it with furniture. There are two beds when one would probably be sufficient, if someone is using the pc you have to climb over the bed to move from one end of the room to the other. The whole room feels cluttered, it's difficult to put a couple of big suitcases out of the way. There is a fair sized fridge in the room, which is also a little odd as there are notices telling you not to have food in your room. I found the bed hard, and the room was light soon after sunrise as there were only blinds rather than curtains, I was on holiday, i didn't need to get up that early! The bathroom was fine, and there was a nice walk in shower. I personally didn't think the buffet breakfast was worthwhile either, I swear they had the weakest coffee I had ever tasted. The whole place seemed like a hostel more than a hotel. I think the worst thing though was the staff were the least friendly people we'd met in three weeks of travel in Canada, in particular the woman on the desk when we checked in.

The Port is very lovely to walk up and down on. They have a new bike system where people can rent bikes I believe up to 24 hours. I must warn you that there is a deposit of $200, so if you plan on renting the bikes make sure you use your credit card and not your debit (needless to say we flipped out with we saw the charge). It takes from 24-48 hours for the pending charges to be removed once the bikes are returned to any station. I would def. rent the bikes again. It was a great time, i'll just make sure to use my Amex lol. Catherine street is about 3 blocks away, this is where you will find the shopping stores, Old Navy, Puma, foot locker. Crescent street is filled with bars and restaurants.

At arrival no one helped us with our luggage, my mother had to push one of the carts to the front of the hotel to get our luggage from the car and than up the elevator to our third floor room. There were two staff members present, and not a lot of visitors in the lobby. Someone could have offered us some sort of help, we had just arrived from Quebec, and we had more than one suitcase. One benefit was the computer in the room this was a nice touch which I have never seen before. The t.v. was nice, and so was the modern feel of the room with a nice shower. It was clean, and the location was close to chinatown which is a nice place to visit and eat. The street this hotel is located on, is not great compared to other hotels close to more attractions. This hotel also does not have parking and our parking thing got messed up where we ended up paying more than we should have. The beds were hard, which some people I guess like, but way to hard for me. Close to Old Montreal, we were able to walk a few blocks and we were there. There was also a free breakfast which was conveniant. Our family first traveled to Quebec than Montreal, and this hotel does not compare to how nice our other hotel was. Just think in a few years, the computers and the tv will be outdated, and it may be hard to replace all of them, making this hotel older faster. Montreal is a nice city, and I think there are other better hotels out there. If your just traveling for business this is probably made better for that, than family traveling. the hotel also did not seem very busy in our stay, which I am not sure is a good/ bad thing.

My mom (in her 60s), myself (in my mid-40s) and my two daughters (ages 10 and 12) all loved the hotel. I chose it specifically because it was the only hotel in Montreal I could find that offered 2 queen beds standard. I ended up booking it online (I think room was about $147 per night) as my travel agent couldn't find me anywhere that had anything but 2 double beds and we wanted to stay in 1 room! Not only was the room clean, new (I believe the hotel only opened in 2007. Everything seemed new), well decorated, with luxurious bedding and a beautiful bathroom, they also provide a computer with internet access in each room at no additional charge, as well as a flat screen cable TV with DVD player and a refrigerator (plus 2 bottles of water per day in your room free). They have breakfast everyday in a nice breakfast room from 6 to 10 am and it includes cereals, croissants, bagels, toast, fruit, beans, coffee, tea and juices. They offer some snacks (sodas, bottled water, candy) for sale in the lobby. There is also a washing machine and dryer behind a door in the lobby restroom (can only enter with your room keycard) in case you need that and laundry soap available for sale in the lobby too. The hotel staff are French-speaking but the staff in the reception area all speak fluent English too. It is also located in a great place. It is one block from Palais de Congres (Montreal Convention Center) which is across the street from a great fountain that was originally created for the Olympics and is covered in steamy smoke and a ring of fire each night (at least it was when we were there. Not sure if it is seasonal). We were also within 2 to 3 blocks of 3 subway stops on two different lines which made getting around on the metro (which is very clean and safe and easy to take -- even my mom went alone to the casino by subway and bus) very easy! The underground mall (including shops and cafes) at Desjardins on Boulevard Renee-Levesque is within 3 blocks and you can walk through it to get to Place D'Arts subway stop (we were directed by hotel staff). The main tourist sites of Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal) are also within easy walking distance of the hotel (about 4-8 blocks depending on where you are going) and if you go out the hotel door and turn right and right around the haunted house next door, you will see Chinatown within about 1 block! Though not much was mentioned about Chinatown in guidebooks, it has good Chinese restaurants and even bakeries. This hotel is ideal if you do not need a real concierge (all the staff at the reception desk are helpful and have maps and guidebooks but there is not a real concierge), and do not need a restaurant or pool right in the hotel.

The parking onsite was sold-out. The rooms were comfortable and clean with a mini-fridge, safe, and flat-screen TV. The bathroom had a nice walk-in shower. One complaint - the gym is a little creepy. It's in a windowless, interior room that's a little smaller than one of the guest rooms. Could be a little weird if there's more than one person in there at a time.

Two lights weren't working which I could live with (as there were 6 lights in the room). But one of them was flickering and we wanted it changed. We stayed there for two days and they changed the light the next day. Another thing none in the front desk can suggest things to do in the city. They give u a brochure and ask u to figure it out..

The rooms are spacious with superb amenities, i.e., a computer with free internet connection, a modern inroom safe, refrigerator, a beautifully furnished bathroom with state of the art shower fixtures, comfortable beds, etc. The exterior is very modest and initially a turn off because it is tangent to a closed out and what appears to have been an amusement haunted house, complete with ghouls hanging our of windows and intentional graffiti (I think) on the walls. It is located on a fairly calm street and consequently traffic noise is not a factor. We were on the fourth floor facing the street and we couldn't hear any traffic on weekends as well as weekdays. The location is terrific and negates having a car. About 7 easy minutes walk to Old town and a myraid of resturants and shops., 3 minute walk to Chinatown, 12 - 15 minute walk to the train station, and a 5 minute walk to a Metro station. The Chinatown had a some good resturants and a particularly neat bakery which offered these warm rolls with bacon and other stuff on it - they were delicious and cost about $1.25 each. Also try their custard tarts for a $1 each. The area immediately around the hotel felt very safe to me and we (my wife and I) often walked to and from at night without feeling threatened at any time.
