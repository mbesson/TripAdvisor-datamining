{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Disappointed My husband, 2 boys  I stayed at this hotel during the Olympic Games. I booked 2 rooms for 8 days directly through their website. The hotel requested full payment which I wired to them and received confirmation. The hotel arranged airport pickup for us which was very convenient. But, when we arrived at the hotel, the hotel representative whom I contacted with told us that only one room with one bed was available tonight. They would refund us the fee for one room. The other room will be available the next day. We were not happy  had no choice but to stay because it was 8:30pm  we were not familiar with Beijing. It was a miserable night for us. We just got off from the plane  planned to get a good night sleep. All four of us had to squeeze in one bed  nobody was able to sleep. We were able to get two rooms the next day  thought we're able to enjoy our stays now. But, no! The shower door was broken  water was flooding the floor every time you take a shower. Then, the showerhead hanger was broken. I then realized that the pillows had no pillow cases and was told that the pillow cases were not delivered yet. I checked the bed sheets  found some crackers pieces. The next day, I asked the housekeeper to change my bed sheet but was never done. We did get our refund back after asking for it many times. We didn't move to another hotel because we just didn't have time to look for another one. We had a full 8 day schedule planned. Will we stay at this hotel again? Definitely not!", "Date": "Nov 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR156199220", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "jskuang"}, {"Content": "Booked for 10 nights stayed 1 The hotel is very difficult to find. Upon arriving I was greeted with no smiles and an unfriendly welcome. The room was smelly, small and even though there was a window it is of the hospital next door. The shower curtain is a stretchable plastic sheet. There was hot water but that was all that could be said about the hotel room. The conservatory red chairs are dirty and worn. The whole sitting area is dirty and not well kept. The computer that is available did not work nor did the connection in the room. Some man came to the door before 8 am to fix something. Never knew quite what it was as I ignored. There are a lot of places to stay and I wanted to try a reasonable courtyard but this isn't the place.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR796081709", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "MX1975"}, {"Content": "Great room, great price       Hotel sign high on a building along Dongsiwutiao", "Date": "Apr 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR138820014", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "WisconsinVagabond"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d775215-r22010804-N_E_Courtyard_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "775215", "Price": "$41"}}
