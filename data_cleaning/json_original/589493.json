After being asked to pre-pay at check-in the almost $2,500 for 5 nights, I was overcharged by $185 and then told to sign a $150 pre-authorisation for \"incidentals\". I was then told that because of the public holidays there would be no housekeeping until the following Tuesday (I checked in on Friday 30th December). When I arrived at our 19th floor 2 bedroom apartment I was quite relieved to find it clean and spacious but for 5 people there were only 4 towels so I went back down to reception to ask for more towels only to be told that it would cost me $2 for each extra towel. I said that women like to have a towel for their hair to which it was repeated to me that it would cost $2 each for extra towels to which I replied to put it onto the \"incidentals\". I remarked that I have stayed at several OAKS hotels and have never been charged for extra towels and in fact have never been charged for extra towels at other hotel groups around the globe. How disappointing after spending $2,500 for 5 nights to then be charged $2 for each extra towel. I was furious because it wasn't the money but the principle of the matter. But a more stressful situation was to come... We set out about town for that day and night (the good thing about the hotel is that it is in an ideal location close to everything) and the following afternoon after we had all been for a swim (using the same bath towels from the previous night's shower, the morning shower, and for after swimming and shower), I rang reception asking for our towels to be replaced and at first was told housekeeping was not open but after I persisted, stating they can't expect us to use the same towels for 5 days, I was told to bring the towels to reception to be replaced as there was nobody else on duty. I felt humiliated lugging all the wet towels into the lift in front of other guests down to reception to be replaced. This was definitely not a good look for a hotel lobby! For the next few days I decided to wash the towels myself in the apartment washing machine and dryer rather than being put through that stress again of practically begging for clean towels. It's those little things that spoil what should have been a very satisfying experience. However I decided to get on with my holiday because I was happy with the apartment with its big balcony and the hotel's great location. I was very pleased on checkout to find the charge for the extra towels had been waived, so whilst my arrival experience was quite unpleasant, my departure was much much better.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay\u201d", "Author": "TomDUSA", "ReviewID": "UR121809179", "Content": "I was in Sydney for 17 days on business.

Two of us were booked into Room 138 on the 14th floor. The rooms were clean and tidy and it was great to have two bathrooms as it made getting ready in the morning so much quicker. The beds were king size and very comfortable. The lower bedroom had a TV on the wall and full bathroom with bath, shower and toilet. The upper bedroom had a bathroom with shower, toilet and a cupboard containing a washer and dryer. The kitchen had a microwave, fridge/freezer, oven, dishwasher and assorted small appliances. We didn't use the kitchen much but found the microwave a bit of hit and miss to operate. Instructions would have been helpful. We asked for a Welcome Booklet as we had no idea how to use the TV and couldn't figure out how to use the dishwasher either but eventually got it going by sheer fluke. There weren't any instructions on how to phone other apartments but the receptionist provided us with extension numbers. We used the pool but found it a bit unpleasant to access as we had to go past the rubbish skips. The pool however was good for a few early morning lengths and the spa was very welcome. There appeared to be a well equipped small gym but we never used it. The entrance to the apartments is set back from the street in a small outside foyer between a resturant and a coffee stand and a bit hard to find at first. The building is very secure requiring a swipe access to get in after hours and to access each floor from the elevator. Reception and after hours security were very pleasant and helpful. The apartments seem to have some more permanent occupiers as there was a bit of cooking smell wafting down the corridor. There were only a couple of negatives. One was the lingering smell of cigarette smoke in our apartment even though smoking is only permitted on the balcony, I would have preferred a smoke free apartment. The other negative was the sound of several skips being picked up and dropped off downstairs at 12.40am!!! It was loud enough to wake me up and was extremely annoying as it seemed to go on for a long time. However, saying that, my colleagues who had been booked into the Oaks Goldsborough complained that they had noise all night, every night from people walking to their rooms and banging doors. It's a wee distance from the central city but it didn't a huge effort to walk to Darling Harbour or get into the city using the Monorail.

They were not helpful at the front desk at all, and I even managed to track down the maintenance worker, who looked at the unit and said it can't be fixed. There were many other things in both our units that did not work - lights, both our TVs were not working properly etc. Being in a heat wave and having no air conditioning was extremely uncomfortable plus the fact the we had already been moved out of our original unit due to maintenance issues and not doing anything about it when asked, is unacceptable.

The receptionist was helpful, but perhaps a little too busines like and not as welcoming as one might expect. Lighten up a bit please. It would be nice to be greeted with a smile. Parking is an extra $20 per night on top of the $522 we paid for two nights accommodation and is secure. We had a two bedroom apartment and it was on two levels with the first level containing a king size bed and a good sized ensuite.Up the stairs there is another bedroom with a king size bed with ensuite, a kitchen and a lounge area . The apartment was very clean and fresh smelling- no smoking permitted in the apartment which we thought was a great plus as we are all non smokers. The kitchen is pretty poorly equiped in my opinion- good electrical items, fridge , stove, microwave, dish washer, toaster, jug , but light on with the utensils- no fry pan and a limited amount of saucepans. No possibility of cooking bacon and eggs for breakfast. If I was staying longer I would have requested some more cooking utensils. The lounge/dining area had a table with 6 chairs but the lounge room only had enough seats for three people- a bit poor for a two bedroom place. The tv was a good size but the operating instructions were a bit light on. However, we got to the Foxtel channel after a bit of playing around. There are limited channels available on foxtel. The carpets were clean but starting to look a bit tired- perhaps they will squueze another 12 months out of them- no more I hope. The big plus with this place is the location, its right in Chinatown and a couple of minutes walk to the Paddy's market area and chinese restaurants. Our best find was the Thai restaurant (Satang Thai) downstairs- True tasting Thai food which hasn't been westernised (see separate review).

After travelling from Bangkok, and having no sleep for 48 hours, we arrived at Oaks Harmony at 7.30am. We dropped off our bags and asked if it was possible for our room to be one of the first to be ready once people checked out. They said that would be no problem (check in is normally 2pm). The person at reception said they would call us when our room was ready. After wandering around Sydney sleep deprived till 1pm we decided to make our way back to the hotel and wait in reception. The reception is not the nicest, so doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the best first impression and we found that lots of taxis had trouble finding it, so make sure you have good directions. After waiting in reception for what seemed like forever we checked into our room at 3pm!!! I guess we were a little annoyed about this as they knew we were waiting, and other people were checking in before us. Our room was ok, but looking a little tired. But I think it was the little things that really bothered me about the room. There was still rubbish in our shower, the bathroom floor obviously hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been vacuumed properly with dust in the corners, and the pictures on the walls we hung so crookedly, it almost looked like it could be a joke \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how could a house keeper miss these things?

We stayed in a one bedroom apartment, that was nice, but nothing special. The bathroom is spacious, with a large bath, and a good amount of bench space. The living area is small, and has lots of modern furniture that all seems to be white or made of glass. I was a little disappointed at some of it though - the coffee table was chipped and broken at one corner, and the desk was shoved in an awkward position between the two lounges. The bedroom was fine, a large cupboard, separate balcony and a comfortable bed. The room did not offer a fantastic view. If you looked straight down there was an alley with skip bins in it. Look ahead and you can see the rooftop pool of the Marque Hotel next door, which I must say is not a great sight. Look to the right and you get a bit of a mix. Down is an old, decrepit building whose windows are full of junk, but up is a nice view of the rooftops, and a stunning clock tower that is really quite beautiful. There were very effective blinds on the windows that were very successful in blocking out all light, so we had no issues about being woken up by the sunrise. We checked in after hours, so there was no one at the reception desk. Our check in must have pre-arranged, because a security guard was waiting to give us our keys. We didn't really encounter any service during our stay, so I cant comment on that aspect of the hotel. The pool, spa and sauna were adequate. The pool was small, and although the hotel website claimed it was heated, it didn't feel that way to me. To access the pool you had two options, neither of which is very appealing at all. You could take the lift down to the car park, walk past some construction material, down some concrete steps past the rubbish bins, and enter the pool area through a gate. You are surrounded by metal grilles and humming generator noises. It feels quite threatening and it not at all a pleasant way to get the pool. The second option is to walk out of reception, across a courtyard, that at night is cold and dark, down a long flight of stairs, and into the pool area. I felt a bit safer going this way, but it still is not ideal. Finding the hotel is a nightmare. There are no signs pointing to it, nobody seems to know where it is, and there isn't so much as the Oaks logo on the wall. I arrived by train at central station, and wandered around with my heavy luggage until I recognised the building from a photo I had seen. I would recommend that you bring a map so you can find it easily. All in all, the Oaks Harmony Apartments is alright. Nothing special, but not in any way bad.

It was like staying in someone's apartment. It was great to have a laundry and kitchen (not that you need the kitchen with all the places to eat nearby). The location is extremely convenient. The reviews were right about the staff at reception. Sloppy. One girl looked like she'd just climbed out of bed. Oversized ugly uniform, messy hair, no make-up... NO smiles. When I arrived they were too busy [-] about another customer to serve me properly. The staff kitchen is directly behind the front desk and they were sitting there drinking coffee and whinging about their job. Not a great first impression. If you are a local and just in Sydney for a few days, this is a great place. You can do your own thing and it will suit you. If you are a tourist or visitor to Australia... please don't stay here. I would hate this to be the impression you got. My room looked straight into other apartments and the garbage truck woke me at 2am every morning. The exhaust in the bathroom never turned off, so although there was a giant bathtub no one in their right mind would try to relax in it with a noisy fan above. The rooms are \"cleaned' each day but not really... they call it a \"Partial Clean\" which means they empty the bin and make the bed. That's it. The bed was made in the most unusual way. Instead of a doona cover they just put a plain doona between two shirts. Very uncomfortable when they slip in the night. I ended up pulling it all off and just having the doona. Internet wasn't too expensive. Around $25 a day with 100mb to download. Could be worse... could be better. Free WIFI is rare in Sydney. Would I stay there again?

I checked in 9pm at night, firstly, the light of the room didn't work, we went down to the reception and the security advised us there was no room service after 8pm; secondly, I requested a high floor quiet room, but they offered me a room in level 2, where my bed room was just next to the car park, the noise at 6am wake me up. We changed another room at level 6 next day, we requested King bed but it was the combine of 2 single beds. We found a hair inside the water pot. The drape was a single layer film only, we wake up very early every morning when the sun comes up. Though in the booking it stated room service was included, don't expect daily room service. They came to tidy up our bed only ONCE out of our 5 nights stay, which was after my husband's complaint. But they didn't sweep the floor. Don't stay the hotel during winter, because after we turn the air-con to warmer, there were cockroach came out under the sofa and kitchen, 1 of them died next to the microwave and nobody tidy it up. Only the location is good, but definitely I will not recommend this hotel nor stay here again.", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat!\u201d", "Author": "gazzzh", "ReviewID": "UR6817930", "Content": "The apartments are in an excellent location in Sydney.

The property itself is located just off George Street near Central Station - my partner and I were able to walk there (5-10 minutes) with our bags after getting off the airport train. We arrived early in the morning after a long haul flight and, whilst the staff were not able to check us in straight away, they stored our bags and expedited the cleaning of the room so that we could check in 4 hours before the usual check-in time. We really appreciated this and it was indiciative of the helpful attitude that we found from all of the staff during our stay. Our room was well sized, with a separate bedroom, dining area, kitchenette/lounge and bathroom. In addition, the bathroom had a separate washing machine and dryer. The furnishing was all pretty modern, new and clean, if not of the highest quality (a certain Swedish furniture store spings to mind). The only issue we had with the room was that the bedroom backed out onto a service alleyway so, although it was on the 16th floor, you could hear garbage and delivery lorries during the night. We liked the place so much that we decided to stay there again on our return to Sydney. Despite the fact that not all days were available at the Hot Deals price on the company website, we spoke to the manager and she was able to secure us a unit at the same, low price. This second unit was also spacious and well furnished and, with its location further down the service alleyway, did not suffer from the noise problems of the first one that we tried. Overall - an excellent property.", "Date": "December 11, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Oaks Harmony", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d589493-Reviews-Oaks_Harmony-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$4 - $6*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">107-121 Quay Street</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Haymarket</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2000</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "589493", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/52/75/52755a7b2b1806c1db60d36b9c1d60321large.jpg"}}
