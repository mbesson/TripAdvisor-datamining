It is on the same road as the Spanish Steps, Piazza del Popolo is at the end of the road, the Trevi and Trion fountains are within a 5 min walk and the Pantheon is no more than a 15min walk. The hotel is very basic but met our needs for a short city break. The bed was comfortable but there were no tea or coffee making facilities available. There is an instruction in the room asking you not to change the settings on the air conditioning as it is set to the correct setting and if you change it then it may not work anymore which was a bit strange. The en suite was fine, however there was a little bit of damp above the shower and the water just poured out of the shower like a tap rather than like a normal shower, but this was fine for just a few nights. Breakfast was disappointing. It is just a croissant, crusty bread roll and cracker bread with a selection of butter, jam, honey and hazelnut chocolate spread which got very boring. I also found it quite strange that you have to leave your key with reception when you go out for the day, you are not allowed to take it with you. This wouldn't be too much of a problem but when you return and ask for your key, they don't even ask you for your name to check that you are the person staying in that room. Also, there is no safety deposit box in the room. However, I found this hotel great value for money in terms of location and would go back for this reason.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but does not offer what they advertise.\u201d", "Author": "Pure_diversion", "ReviewID": "UR124521642", "Content": "I had been in touch with Hotel Doge the day before our arrival to explain that we would be checking in late.

What really bothered me about this experience was that I find it not only impolite, but quite frankly \"dodgy\" that a \"hotel\" would wait until its guests arrived at 12.30 a.m., before telling them they have been moved to another hotel. They could have also contacted us with a simply phone call as they had this information but it is certain they simply don\u00b4t care. You should also be advised that you will not be staying at anything closely resembling what Hotel \"Dodgy\" pictures on its website. Concerning the rooms, well when I opened the curtains, I was greeted with small pieces of falling plaster on my head and the bathroom was a freezer, no heating, with mold growing on the window panes.

The beds were not flat, felt like I was going to fall out of it because it was tipped on one side no matter what I did. The bathroom was tiny and had mould growing in the corner of the shower which caused it to stink (the filter was full of gunk!) The shower, as well as being extremely small, took 5 minutes of running before the water came through luke warm and then only came out as a dribble. The walls in the room were extremely thin and half painted and the wallpaper was ripped and very old in the corridors. The choice of breakfast was good but again was set out in a tiny room with not enough tables for all of the people staying at the hotel. The breakfast staff were extremely rude to us and told us that we couldn't have tea because they hadn't turned the machine on yet and how can we expect to have tea as breakfast has only been open for 20 minutes...

Breakfast was continental: bread, butter and spreads, croissants, coffee, hot chocolate, and juice. This was much appreciated! Our daughters stayed in a room with 3 twin beds. Their room was old and rather shabby - perhaps it could use a little rennovation - but it was clean. We did notice workers with supplies working on some of the rooms.

Point to note - be prepared to use the stairs. There is a lift - I think it went up 2 floors, but it can only hold 1 person and 1 large suitcase! Hotel staff was helpful, and courteous.

My wife joined a group of Italian learning students from Greece, (including the teachers,an Italian from Bologna and his Greek girlfriend).As a group,they managed to get good prices in their destinations(Venezia,Firenze and finally Rome-doge hotel). The plan was to join them in Rome.The result was to stay in a double room during the high season of the hotel and give 140!! euros(normal internet price for the excact period was 180!!!,but we had that reduction as almost part of the group. What i want to say is that i wouldn't book that hotel as an individual.From what i realised,searching on the internet,in Rome you pay first of all the location. Doge is (self)called a three star hotel.I tried very hard to find some of those in our room,in the coridors,in the breakfast room. Consider that for 4 days we had the same towels!!! Going there I had the feeling that we are giving a lot of money, staying there I realised that we were giving a lot of money for a ...hostel. If you can get a good price through a travel operation doge is in a very convinient position.

I could get by all the negatives, except the fire hazards, for which I will not return to that hotel this summer.
