The breakfast is OK but would get a bit monotonous after a few days - other meals were very good. The beach is cleaned and fine although below the water line it is rocky and to swim easily you need to walk up the beach for ten minutes to a sandier area. The real problem is the isolation - it is secluded but surrounded by other properties and the only places to walk are up or down the beach ; taxis into Playa del Carmen cost 170 pesos each way. No children , no TV , wifi access in the bar area. Very nice for a few days but not for much longer. Massage is availabe and many other guests did this although we did not - expensive but they seemed to enjoy it. Pool is small and shallow.

We had read a few reviews about the condition of the road leading to Le Reve, so we were a bit worried about this being an issue for our guests. We were relieved to see that it has recently been repaired and we did not have any problems at all driving in. As soon as we arrived at the lobby and caught a glimpse of the beautiful view of the pool, beach and ocean, we knew we had found a little piece of paradise. We were greeted by the lovely Jacqueline from the Concierge team who immediately made us feel welcome, offering us a delicious cocktail before introducing us to our wedding Coordinator, Arlenis. We have been in touch with Arlenis by email and phone over the past few months and she has been amazing with answering all of our questions, sending pictures, making recommendations, and putting us in contact with all of the vendors for our wedding. She will always take the time to help with any question big or small and definitely takes the pressure away from planning a destination wedding. Arlenis gave us a tour of all of the different rooms that our guests will have the option to book (we have reserved all 25 rooms for our group for the wedding weekend so will have the whole place to ourselves!). There are 4 room categories, and each suite is beautifully decorated, with its own unique touches. We loved the hammocks that had just been installed in the garden area of the garden suites and we can definitely picture our guests relaxing in them with a margarita in hand. We then visited the spa area, the gym (small but with all of the essentials), and the spectacular infinity pool before heading down to the beach. We were happy to see that there is a good distance between Le Reve and the hotels on either side so we really felt like it was a private beach. After, we headed to Naay restaurant for our menu tasting and were blown away by the food and service. The Food and Beverage Manager, Antonio, was absolutely incredible and made the experience so much fun! We were so impressed with the food tasting, we can\u2019t even imagine how wonderful the menu will be for the wedding. Antonio explained every dish for us and he and Arlenis were constantly checking-in, taking notes, and asking if we had any special requests. Le Reve really is a spectacular little gem, with a beautiful beach, first class amenities, and above all, incredible service. I would not hesitate for a second to recommend this hotel and cannot wait to celebrate at Le Reve with all of our family and friends this summer.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cWonderful getaway near Playa del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "YDL0414", "ReviewID": "UR126205179", "Content": "We just finished a short relaxing break at the Le Reve- what a beautiful location and hotel!

She is such a friendly sight that you always want to stop and say hello. She had a way of always putting a smile on our face.

We love to cook at home and also eat out often and found the selection of ingredients in every dish so well placed and thought through. We felt as comfortable dressed casually as we did more formally at dinner. It\u2019s nice to know that you can go there either way. We found ourselves wanting to only eat at the hotel instead of going to town and that says a lot. There are several different types of rooms there. They are all gorgeous, well layed-out and very comfy. My sister & boyfriend stayed at a garden suite and said it was great. We stayed at a master suite and for the first time ever, we ended up staying in a lot, enjoying our big balcony. Jacqueline was nice enough to show us a bungalow with a private pool and it was quite an amazing space as well. A note about past reviews - the road to this hotel is fine! Based on past reviews we were going to rent a Jeep to get us here, but rented a typical car and drove a normal speed down a road that happened to be dirt instead of paved - big deal.

I opted to take a lovely 10 minuiut stroll in either direction along the beach with my fiance (we got enganged at Le Reve - more on this in a few) to a more suitable swimming area. If you would have done your research prior to booking you would have known this was a potential issue. Would I have prefered being able to swim right outside the hotel - yes but I was specifically looking for a boutique hotel so you take the good with the bad (not bad in my opinion). I initally booked the trip so my GF would think we are taking a quick trip to get out of the NYC winter - however the real reason was to propose to my GF. Prior to booking my trip I sent an e-mail to Le Reve asking if the proposal plans I had in mind would be suitable at their hotel, if they had any additional ideas or could assit in my proposal plan. I must have had a least 20 e-mails back-and-forth with the hotel - always with a warm greeting, quick reply and full of great ideas and feedback. I decided to opt for the romatic dinner on the beach which was AMAZING. My GF was blown away. At this point in our trip ALL the employees knew both of our names and room number. For example, after we got engaged and enjoyed our amazing dinner under the stars (with the rest of the guest in awe) we wen to the resturante area and had a bottle of champagine. We ordered a second bottle but decided to take a walk on the beach and I asked if the bottle could be brought to my room - and he said \"yes sir i will bring it right away to room...\" It was amazing - like the staff was reading my mind. The night we got enganged we went back to our room and the turndown service had an amazing display on our bed - full of roses and towels shaped live swans. Additionally, everynight there are treats (amzing chclcate and pastries) in your room with a wonderful fortuen or words of insight (kind of like a forutne cookie but not corney - very heartfelt).

We spent the first 4 days in a Beach Bungalow and we had such an amazing time. From the moment we arrived we received personalized and attentive service like we've never experienced before. We even showed up way early and they worked so hard to make sure our room was ready for us. First and foremost, it's small, intimate and very romantic. If you're looking for a huge all-inclusive resort with tons of screaming Americans, this isn't the place. You turn off of Federal Highway 307 and drive through some greenery for a few minutes. You then take one of the bumpiest roads in all of Mexico for about a mile or so, only to end up at the small, boutique-style, paradise with a small open air lobby overlooking the beautiful water. I noticed alot of people on here took the bumpy road as a negative for this place, but it's municipal land, and the hotel has no say in getting it fixed, so they have no control over it. Second, the food was fantastic. I read some reviews that said it wasn't too good, but ours was fresh, authentic and our waiter service was wonderful. We dealt alot of Ishmael, who took very good care of us throughout our stay not only in the restaurant, but when bringing things to our room and getting us drinks while on the beach. The restaurant overlooks the Caribbean and we loved it. Third, our service was so personal, we felt like at the end of the stay, we knew everyone. They called us by our names all week, the personal touches they paid attention to in terms of our turn down service and little gifts and desserts they'd deliver each night, made it such a wonderful experience. Fourth, if you are on the fence about room choice and can pay a little more, the Beach Bungalows are amazing, so spend the money and get one. We stayed in the bungalow suite named Boca Del Cielo. The king size bed was so comfortable, the bathroom and shower were fantastic. At night when we went to sleep, we'd leave the bathroom light on just near the toilet section and when we'd lay in bed and stare up, the ceiling looked awesome since it's a pitched straw roof. Absolutely awesome view. Other than that, we'd swim in our private plunge pool during the day, sit out on our private deck at night, and fall asleep to the sound of the wave crashing only 30-40 feet from our door. In the morning we'd open the shades and lay in bed and have a perfect view of the sea. Absolutely great. There is no TV in the room, and as someone who watches TV every night before they go to bed, my wife and I didn't mind it at all. Finally, the beach is rocky, Yes. But they don't tell you to bring water shoes or anything like that because they provide that all for you. As soon as you walk down to the beach there is a whole rack with water shoes, snorkel gear, all that stuff. Don't let the reviews citing the beach is too rock-ey scare you. Also, we highly recommend the cab ride to downtown Playa del Carmen. Very safe, tons of shops and restaurants, and just a really good way to immerse yourself in the culture. only about a 15 minute ride. All in all, this place was flat out amazing. They've received multiple awards and recognition, as well as a Conde Nast Recommended places award. We got the Honeymoon package and the private Dinner on the beach was perfect and all of the small details made the trip that much more enjoyable. We will definitely be going back here. We've never been more relaxed in our lives. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly with any questions or info about it.

The plus side is, once you're there you never want to leave! We wanted to take tours and visit Coba and Rio Secreto, but none of the tours would pick us up at the hotel because of the road. The solution that we found is to be picked up at Azul Five which is located next to Le Reve. Rather than walking down the dirt road to the hotel, we walked on the beach and through the back end of Azul Five without any issues at all! The food was delicious, and although we never only eat at our hotel, we didn't want to leave and try the mostly sub-par food in Playa del Carmen. Although the beach is rocky, if you walk 10 minutes in either direction there is beautiful turquoise water without rocks to swim in. When you see the huge resorts blasting trashy music you'll be so thankful that you stayed at Le Reve.

This hotel has blown all of the others away. We arrived at Le Reve after our trash the dress and jewelry photo shoot in a cenote. We planned on the second half of our photo shoot at sunrise on the beach and pool at the hotel the next morning. Immediately upon stepping into the stunning open air lobby, I knew we were in for a treat. Refreshing glasses of iced tea were brought to us as we breezed through check-in. On the wall in the lobby there is a plaque that indicates it is one of the top 100 Sexiest hotels...for good reason. Dramatic steps (perfect for a wedding) lead down to the zig zag sleek infinity pool with a straight view to the sapphire ocean. Onto the details: ROOM: We were taken to our room and our jaws dropped. It was a modern design with sparkling white floors, a huge vanity area and separate glass shower. A large closet was available to hang our clothes and a safe for checking valuables. Further in was a beautiful bedroom (which happened to have rose petals, wine, fruit and swan towels (we indicated we were there celebrating my birthday and belated anniversary). Rose petals were even sprinkled in a towel design by the glass shower. The most impressive feature were the floor to ceiling windows which looked out perfectly over the infinity pool and ocean (talk about an absolutely incredible sunset/sunrise opportunity!). The door was easily opened to the patio where wooden recliner chairs and a table were placed perfectly to enjoy our bottle of wine as the sun set. SERVICE: From the staff at check-in to everyone else that we encountered, everyone truly seemed to love their jobs. There really wasn't anything that you could request that couldn't be fulfilled. The waitstaff was so friendly and even when we requested another bottle of wine to have on another night, it was quickly brought up to our room and opened on our balcony. Each evening a little treat with a sweet note was brought. It's those special details that make a boutique hotel even more charming. FOOD: Amazing! The breakfast was included and very good. We tried a few different dishes from the club, hamburger, nachos, guacamole, and chicken parm for lunches and all were great. They also had 10-12 different ceviche dishes at lunch time that we definitely want to experience next time. Each evening we tried something different from the Duck, warm octopus salad, orange chicken, Tampiquena and various sides. We were never disappointed. We typically stay at larger hotels but heard so many great things about Le Reve. We had our sunrise trash the dress session on the beach and at the pool. Even with the hotel being full, we still had so much privacy and we never felt like we were on top of anyone. There were always plenty of lounge chairs both at the pool and on the beach. A wedding had been there the day before we arrived so there were still guests (but again, it never felt crowded at all). With the attention to detail and super romantic vibe of the hotel, I can only imagine how amazing it would be to have a wedding there. It's a hidden gem in the hungle with a fabulous stretch of beach perfect to celebrate...anything! This completely changes my mind about a boutique hotel.

The king size bed has four posts and a pretty white net all around it. The entire wall on the beach side is glass with sliding doors, and overlooks the gorgeous infinity pool and pristine beach and ocean. The bathroom has a rainshower with wood floor, so lovely. The entire hotel is comprised of only 25 rooms and we NEVER felt crowded at the pool, beach or restaurant. The hotel provides huge beach towels, shoes for going in the ocean and snorkeling gear if you're interested and the ocean water is so nice to swim in. The pool is very clean and cold--this was very refreshing. The restaurant is top notch and offers a great selection of gourmet food. The staff is very friendly and accomodating and will bring food and drinks to the beach, pool, outdoor lobby area or your room if you'd like. We had breakfast on our second floor deck one morning and it was breathtaking. One thing to keep in mind--it is a place for relaxing and soaking up the sun, not for a crazy party. Some nights all we wanted was quiet so we stayed in but other nights we wanted more of a scene so took the 15 min cab ride to downtown Playa. We also walked left up the beach to some of the other resorts for a drink just to explore. Overall, I wouldn't change a thing. This was exactly what we needed after a crazy wedding weekend.

The reasons we wouldn't go back? Well we had a beach front plunge pool suite and were eaten with mosquioes... including inside the room after spraying inside and outside with home and garden 24 hr repellent, because there's standing water draining from the plunge pool and LARGE gaps (like finally stuffed toilet paper in them) in the window sills. This means a plunge pool is unuseable at night.We seriously decided that the garden rooms or the new 'spa' suites would be the way to go- because there was no way for us to sit out at the plunge pool at night... The food is good, but very expensive and you are asked not to bring in outside food or drink .. The pool chairs are really!!!! close together...shade is hard to come by...on a day where the beach isn't great it gets crowded fast...and the beach isn't a swimming sandy beach Finally, the gardener who started watering from the hook up next to our plunge pool at about 6:15 in the morning... coudn't sleep through it... seriously, he hooked up within 20 feet of the foot of our bed... so couldn't skinny dip, leave curtains open for sunrise, etc...

However, if this was important enough to me to request I'm positive they would have accommodated me. When we turned off the highway we noticed the road deteriorated. There is about 5 minutes of bumpy dirt road that makes you think, \"What did I get myself into?\" When you reach the hotel all of our doubts evaporated. We were greeted in the open air lobby and while we were checking in we were served fresh juice. The service was excellent. The price of the food in about the same in town if you go to any of the nicer eating establishments. The quality of the food was ALWAYS good. I thought the cost of the water was a little steep but if you consider that everything needs to be hauled into the Cancun area this is understandable. On the third day my wife and I figured out that it was going to get expensive buy lunch and dinner everyday so we went into town and took a trip to the grocery store. We bough some lunch items to keep in our room so we could eat a mid-day snack and save about $30 a day on food. Remember pick up Ziplock bags and containers and clean up after yourself if you eat in the room. This is a tropical environment, people, and there ARE going to be bugs! We had some leftover bananas at the end of our stay and we took them to be bar and they made a wonderful rum drink for us.

Tips are included in food and drink, but we felt very comfortable tipping more. Great concierge that would plan activities and set us up for wonderful adventures. The View: Seriously, it's perfect. The Pool/Beach: Cleaned every day, plenty of places to lay, hammocks, can order a drink every-where. The Food: Very good, good variety, we reccommend dinner on the beach (amazing), and the tacos from the pool side lunch menu. What we didn't love: -No door on the bathroom in the suite, it is tucked in a private corner -The internet signal was not strong in the suites by the beach (but of course, who really needs internet when you are 30 feet from the ocean)", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place for a wedding and holidays\u201d", "Author": "2MIMI3", "ReviewID": "UR115391179", "Content": "Our friends selected this hotel for their wedding and we decided to make it our holiday destination.

The ambiance at the restaurant was nice, with great lounge musing playing in the background. One nice thing was that they would leave a small 'surprise' desert on the bed every evening. The beach is nice and, although the rocks make it a little difficult to swim in the ocean, the pool that is right on the beach is an excellent substitute (plus the bar is also right there). Overall we liked our stay at Le Reve. Of course there things that could be improved (such as placing a more visible sign on the main road, having a paved road instead of a true off road experience or having just 1-2 additional pieces of furniture so that the bed is not the only thing that you can sit on), but all these things fade relative to the nice things the hotel has to offer.

You would need water shoes. But the sandy part of the beach is very nice and quiet. And if you're really up for a swim, there are lots of options for that a quick 3 minute walk over. It is an adults only hotel so that could limit you from bringing everyone for a family get together. And that's part of how Le Reve maintains the environment it does.

The bar didn't offer a certain type of beer that we had asked about and the next day one of the staffers had gone out and picked up a six pack to stock the bar for us. It was a very nice above and beyond type of move and we appreciated it. The two women at the front desk we interacted with the most were both very helpful and knowledgeable. One of the two recommended an all inclusive golf outing at Playacar that was awesome and a highlight of the trip. On the negative side I got a massage at there open air platform above the pool bar and while a bit apprehensive about the location ended up not minding at all being so out in the open. More so it was the quality of the massage--I felt it was too strong and thought the male massage therapist wasn't as good as other massages I've had. There was also very loud music coming from a beach bar the resort to the south on two of the nights. I walked around a bit and think it was only certain spots on the property where this noise was very loud, so it wasn't likely affecting most people, but it was pretty loud for us. Overall, the resort really had a beautiful look and feel, never felt crowded although it was full while we there, had friendly staff and a nice big beach out in front and beautiful Caribbean views. We also went out in Playa a couple times and were recommended a terrific restaurant in a cave off the strip by the Front Desk and stumbled upon an asian fusion place on the main strip and both dinners off property were great.

Our driver, Henry, was great. His SUV was comfortable and he was punctual, professional, and happy to answer our questions about the area. We stayed in a Garden Room. The room was well designed and modern with a minimal amount of furnishings. The bed was cozy. The room would definitely benefit from a small table and chair(s) and some type of iPod dock for music, certainly not necessities, but would be nice. The view from this room is just so-so. Not bad, you just look at the back of the ocean front bungalows. We loved the food. Breakfast was fantastic. We were not disappointed in the selection like some other reviewers have mentioned. I do think that some of the lunch offerings were a bit overpriced. We were the first to order from the new Mayan menu and it was quite tasty. Each night the chef would prepare an amuse bouche and it was always amazing. Also delicious were the treats left in the room at turndown service. Nice touch. The bite of Tres Leches cake was something particularly special. The property is well-maintained and offers spectacular, do-nothing-but-stare-at-the-water-all-day views. The gym is certainly not a strong suit of the hotel. While the view is beautiful, the ventilation was poor. Therefore, exercise was hard to maintain for any extended period of time without being smoking hot. My husband and I had relaxation massages at the spa that were very nice. I also had an Organic facial. The massages were great, the facial just ok. The sun was blazing in my eyes during the facial so it wasn\u2019t the most relaxing. Our massages also started an hour late and although I asked, no one seemed to acknowledge it or provide an explanation. I attributed the lack of communication to the language barrier. Did I just complain about my spa day in paradise? My apologies. The clientele of the hotel while we were there was mostly young professionals.

From the charm of the hotel (no tv's or clocks to be found anywhere) to the courteous and friendly staff you cannot beat this place. There are 25 rooms which were all rented out by the wedding party so essentially for the 5 days it became our home. The great part about taking over the hotel is I did not know too many people attending the wedding but by the end of my stay I not only had a chance to chat with most of the people but could not help but really get to know everyone and share some great stories, laughs, etc. The staff was great! Extremely friendly, attentive to everyone's needs but not overbearing. A couple of items to note to avoid any disappointment. I stayed in a Horizon Suite which was very nice but if you're expecting a full ocean view you might want to double check which room you're staying in because there are definitely partial views. The other downside was the lack of sand in the ocean directly in front of the hotel. It is almost all coral and wearing some protective shoes is a must if you go swimming or snorkeling. Now you can walk a couple hundred yards down the beach and find a sandy spot to swim in the ocean. However, you will not find a nicer, more relaxing pool with an incredible view than at the Le Reve. The rehearsal dinner, wedding and reception were all held on the beach and the backdrop could not have been nicer. I normally take these things for granted having never been married myself but to watch how hard Arlenis and Mariana worked to make sure everyone was happy and having a good time while getting their work done was downright incredible. These ladies always had an upbeat and friendly attitude while probably being stressed out from time to time but you would never had known it. Everything was always very well organized with amazing attention to detail from the table settings to the layout of the wedding itself.

We were longing to get away from daily routines, kiddos, and work, and we were able to do exactly that at Le Reve. The name really does say it all-- upon entering the hotel and walking around the gorgeous (and beautifully manicured) grounds, it feels dreamlike. The driveway-- I get why other reviewers had complaints about this, but my husband and I completely agree that the approach takes you off the beaten path and reminds you that you are away from all the tourism of the area...the hotel is so peacefully secluded. Upon arriving, we were brought delicious iced tea with lime while checking in-- delicious! The rooms--For the first two nights, we stayed in a Garden Suite as the Master Suite was unavailable until our third day. The Garden Suite was very nice, although somewhat small for our taste. There was easy access to the pool and grounds from the Garden Suite. We had the first suite near the pool, and on one occasion, we could hear a loud girl (a guest) at the pool and dishes in the kitchen while we were trying to nap-- this was definitely not routine though. Now, for the Master Suite- if you are trying to make a decision between rooms, the Master is AMAZING!!! It was so roomy with high thatched ceilings, gorgeous blowing curtains, a huge private balcony, and the shower in our suite overlooked the ocean and grounds (not to mention it was huge!). The Bungalows were not in our budget, so I can't speak to those, but the Master Suite may even be a better option with it's gorgeous view from the top of the hotel, plus you feel especially secluded from the other guests. The service-- Perfect. I agree with other reviewers that it was just enough-- not checking on you every minute, yet not keeping you waiting. All staff were very cordial and professional. We especially thank Roberto, Freddy (who carried an enormous & heavy breakfast in bed all the way up to our suite one morning), Jacqueline, and also the hotel manager-- but we never got his name unfortunately. They really went out of their way to make sure we were happy, and they very much succeeded. The restaurant-- Breakfast was AMAZING, the kind that makes you not want to get in your bathing suite afterwards... but we were on vacation! After eating that breakfast, we were good to go until dinner. We ate at the restaurant for dinner most nights and enjoyed the food. There were so many layers of flavor in the dishes-- loved them. I would like to see even more local/ traditional entree options on the menu. I know that you can ask for them, but if you're a foreigner and don't speak much Spanish (thus don't know what to ask for), it can be kind of tough. We would definitely go back to Le Reve.

The pool is gorgeous and designed around the property's original palm and almond trees, and the beach is lovely too - rocky where the water begins as I think others have said, but perfectly swimmable with water shoes (provided). And as a bonus, the rocks make for interesting snorkeling (snorkeling equipment is also provided). The type of service is something I feel like Le R\u00eave has just right. The folks who work there are friendly and available but unobtrusive - Jesus, Roberto (makes a mean margarita), and Antonio and others made us feel well taken care of. Our room - a garden room - was just right: comfortable bed, plenty of hot water, and a lovely porch that opened onto a partial view of the sea even though it was on the ground floor. The garden surrounding the room made it feel secluded even though we were in the main building. We slept well every day, and woke up rested each morning at sunrise, which is totally out of character for me! Breakfast was great (and included) and the rest of the restaurant's dishes were fine to good (we ate the delicious guacamole for lunch pretty much every day) . . . and if you ask the chef will prepare Yucatan specialties off-menu for dinner. We had cochinita pibil - a slow-roasted pork dish. Yum! And maybe the best thing about this place is that it feels emptier than it is - you feel as though you have the whole place to yourself even though it's relatively full. The design of the hotel seems to be the key: there's plenty of space for everyone at pool and beach and both are equally nice - and when you're at the pool you don't really see down on the beach (you just see the sea) and when at the beach you don't notice the pool.

We were in the jungle, and I certainly would not have preferred that the hotel chemically fumigate the property to save us from ourselves.

The staff were not hovering around us, watching for any sign that we needed something, which was a relief to us but could have made someone else feel ignored (to clarify, we NEVER felt ignored and never once wanted for something, it's just that we weren't constantly fending off intrusive waitstaff when we didn't need anything).

Check in was effortless and we were given a quick tour of the hotel by the very friendly concierge. Rooms were good sized, clean and included your own grassy yard, outdoor tub and literally a couple feet away from the beach. The pool, poolside bar and spa area were tastefully designed and the beach was beautiful with nice huts, a hammock and free snorkels and water shoes available for use. The beach around the hotel though is rocky and isn't particularly suited for swimming unless you walk a short distance upwards. Hotel staff overall were courteous and helpful. Ismael made great cocktails and you have to ask for the coffee flambe (quite an experience). Food at the hotel's restaurant Naay was overall pretty superb. Daily homemade breads and yogurt with honey as well as the chef's own special habanero sauce is to die for. There is a daily turndown service as well which includes a different small desert treat waiting for you every night. Things which could be improved on would be the gym. The weight machine is essentially a piece of junk that doesn't work, and the area itself is pretty small and cramped, but I guess people don't go to resorts to work out till their nuts explode. Overall, great value for money, considering we payed less then 1100 for 5 night stay, and pretty much took care of food and beverage for the entire trip.

We stayed in a ground floor garden suite that felt incredibly private. My only minor complaint is that the outdoor roman tub in the garden suite takes about two hours to fill up and so is cold by the time you do actually get it filled up, its not particularly usable. We purchased the room through Jetsetter.com which was a great deal - Le Reve is a total bargain for what you get. The food was very good, especially lunch where you had a choice of about 15 ceviches among other selections. Breakfast is included in the room rate and is excellent with a lot of choice. We ate several dinners at the hotel and the food was reasonable priced and very good. The beach is lovely, in its own little area that is uncrowded. The shoreline is very rocky in front of the hotel, but we just walked north about 5 minutes to a stretch where there were no rocks whenever we wanted to jump in. Proximity to Playa Del Carmen is great. Had dinner at the Banyan Tree one night to mix things up which was lovely but very expensive. Worth doing once while you are there.

First, It has a cold pool. Secondly, we were paying a lot to be there and felt more than a litttle nickel and dimed. They should consider an all inclusive package, especially for weddings when the hotel is bought out by a group, which would make for a more relaxing experience. We understand that it was not an all inclusive but it still felt negatively because one of our boys got sick likely from the food while there, and after getting a bowl of broth sent to our room, I was annoyed to be charged $10 US for the soup. I would feel more positive about our experience had they sent the soup gratis with a nice note from the staff saying that they hoped he was feeling better. They knew he was very sick and we became trapped inside the room for two days with him. Simple gestures would have been nice and would have gone a long way with us. We also got constantly nickel and dimed about drinks (for example, being asked to sign a ticket for even untouched bottles of water, and even at the wedding when there was an open bar we got approached to sign a bill ticket for a cocktail).

We were wanting a peaceful getaway and that was exactly what we experienced. For one of the days there, we had purchased a vow renewal package that included a minister and ceremony, with set-up, flowers and a dinner on the beach. This extra package was worth every penny! Arlenis, the wedding coordinator, communicated with us regularly prior to our stay to get all the details lined up perfectly. Shortly after our arrival, she came out to meet us and let us know that they even had a room set aside for my husband to get ready in, so we could each get ready on our own, in anticipation of our renewal ceremony. We were delighted by all the sweet, thoughtful personal touches like this that we experienced during our stay. The ceremony was sweet, with lovely decor and flowers and the minister, arranged for by Arlenis, had also been in communication with us to have just the vows we wanted to say to personalize things. On a side note, I hired Doranna in Playa to come out and do my hair, which was amazing-can't recommend her enough-and we hired Ashley, with Blue Lens Caribe, to take photos of the ceremony and on the beach-again, amazing...highly recommend! Each of these individuals communicated with us regularly, promptly and professionally, always answering questions and giving ideas and guidance to make our day unique, personal and very special. We were very impressed. The dinner on the beach the evening of our renewal ceremony was romantic and lovely. We had Roberto as our own personal waiter and he was just the right person for the job. The set-up was wonderful and everything was done to make us feel very special and cared for. No assumptions were made on the part of the staff, rather, we were asked for our preferences in most instances, from the location of the table set-up to the menu to the wine. Lovely! We stayed in a Bungalow suite, with a private plunge pool and a direct view of the ocean. It was a joy to fall asleep each nite to the sound of the surf and breeze. We were able to spend what time we wanted in the sun right on the beach in front of our room and then cool off in our plunge pool any time we desired. The room was crisp, cool and the bed incredibly like sleeping on a cloud! There was ample storage space in a series of built-in cabinets so that we were able to make ourselves feel at home. The service at Le Reve is beyond comparison. The staff is wonderfully friendly without it feeling gratuitous and we were constantly met by wonderful smiles and gentle voices. I am amazed that they all wear long pants and dress shoes, even to walk through the beach sand to bring a drink or snack! Everyone looked crisp and professional. The location and grounds of Le Reve are really special. My husband and I walked both north and south quite a ways and looked at every hotel location we passed, since this was our first trip to the area. We didn't see anything that even compared to the serene beauty and crisp aesthetic of Le Reve. It was amazing to see the difference between Le Reve's unique combo of cozy and chic and all the larger resorts with their hundreds of beach chairs laid out in rows. I'm sure other places are nice to stay but we agreed over and over that we had chosen just the right place and were always so glad to return to our special room and hotel. Food at the restaurant was quite good. Some have commented that it isn't great and I would agree that it isn't superb for lunch or dinner but it is quite good and the presentation, location and service, I think, more than make up for any slight deficiencies. We thought the breakfasts were amazing and tasty, however. Finally, my only negative comment, and this is just a nitpicky thing, I realize: I was surprised, with the price of the room we were paying, to see that many of the towels and beach bed covers were in pretty shabby condition. The grounds were in constant focus, with the steps from the lobby being re-painted and the pool deck being re-stained, a little at a time over our stay so I know that the hotel appearance is of utmost import at Le Reve. But, our beach bed had a large hole in the cover a couple of mornings and many of our towels were frayed around the outside edges. There were also a few stains/snags on the mosquito netting around the bed. This is a very minute detail that in no way will keep us from coming back but was something I noticed.

The restaurant, which was under our room, faces the same way. Food was quite good and beautifully presented, but overpriced for what it is. Breakfast, included in room price, had about 8 items, but lacked any healthy cereal or whole grain options, not even whole wheat bread. Too heavy on eggs, cheese and white bread. Waitstaff was friendly but uneven. in skill Had to ask more than once for coffee, the check and even a napkin (once). One waiter we seemed to get stuck with kept filling one of our coffee cups but not mine, which was empty. Also, the waitstaff makes a lot of noise clanking plates and such when they set up early in the morning before breakfast. Since several rooms (including ours) are directly over the restaurant, this is a problem and woke us up early every day. The one significant downside is that there is not a single chair in the whole place (except at the dining tables) that provides any back support! Not in the rooms, not at the pool, nowhere. They all curve and lean back., except for some couches in the lounge that have very long seat depths -- too long for anyone but a tall person to be able to sit straight in and still have one's feet touch the floor. Chaises at the pool don't raise up far enough to support a person sitting any way other than prone. For a stay of 7 days, this became very uncomfortable and annoying.

Well, simply because it's hard to say unkind things about nice people. And that's what the people who work here are, nice people. Kind, attentive and would do everything in their power to please you so that you enjoy your stay. Unfortunately, there were some shortcomings that the kindness of the employees couldn't make up for. The food really is mediocre. It's not overpriced, but it's also not up to standard you'd expect from looking at the hotel. We arrived on Valentine's Day and had the special dinner. It was an 8-course extravaganza, but with some very strange dishes being served. A salad dish that I liked to refer to as a \"deconstructed Subway\" - served on a bed of pickles. A mint sorbet, which was supposed to be a pallet cleanser midway through the course, was so unbelievably minty (think mint-choc chip ice-cream, without the choc-chips) it left me feeling like i'd had dessert and was done with my meal. However, the main course was next and mine and my lady's dishes were both overcooked. A medium steak served VERY well-done and my lamb chops fully cooked, without a hint of pink. You get the idea, all the food was beautifully presented, but of average flavor. In our room, the bed was a Queen, and there wasn't much space for anything bigger than that. We had a beautiful view of the ocean, but the room was directly above the restaurant and we could hear noise early in the morning and late in the evening, which made sleep hard. The noise of the shutters being creaked closed to protect from the ocean breeze each night and then reopened every morning still shrieks through my body... The road leading to the hotel is a dirt track that is in serious need of paving. Everything is fine until you pass the entry big All-inclusive resort but then it just ends and you have to navigate a maze of deep potholes for the final half mile. I would recommend to Le Reve they get this paved ASAP, as they may get more customers from it. Without TV's in the room, if you want to relax and avoid socializing in the evening, you're left with little choices other than reading. There was a small DVD library, but there was a charge of $5 to borrow one for the evening, and they were mainly knock-offs! I thought this was a little cheeky. If Le Reve was a human, I think it would be a small-town beauty pageant contestant - beautiful to look at, warm-hearted and caring about her family, animals and the environment, but a little lacking of intelligence and trying to get through life on looks alone. We like to have freedom to move about and normally stay in a condo down in Akumal, on the beach, so maybe this was a little too claustrophobic for our travel tastes.

The concierge was great, they were at our service and helped us plan outings, and took care of details for us, such as renting cars, returning cars, calling local business, etc. The places where the hotel falls short was in the restaurant service, we noticed that the consistency of the service was just not up to par with the type of resort that Le Reve is, for example, the staff sometimes forgets small details about the order you made, (ie: forgets the bread, or forgets napkins, or your plate might come with a slightly altered dish that you were expecting). These by themselves are not a big deal, but for me, they break the spell that a luxury resort is weaving, and then i had to worry about asking for napkins, or asking for bread, etc, etc. Not a deal breaker, but i noticed. -- by the same token, alot of the staff does work extra hard to be friendly. -- The restaurant menu did not change for our entire stay, we highly recomend their apetizers, they were incredible .. but their main dishes were just ok, nothing worth writing home about. We also did have a non-functioning AC unit in our room for 2 nights, but I can hardly blame the hotel for that, once we reported it and demanded that it be fixed, it was repaired and we had no more problems with it. One comment that I left for the management, was to introduce themselves to the guests, and make themselves available, so in case things are not going 100% smoothly, the guests feels welcome to bring it up and have it handled. -- I only met the general manager after being at the hotel 4 or 5 days, and then it was only by chance.

We stayed in a garden room, and I think I would prefer it to the balcony room because there is a large outdoor soaking tub that gets hot water\u2014the Jacuzzi section of the *gorgeous* infinity pool does not appear to have heat, so if you are looking for the hot tub experience, this outdoor tub is great for just relaxing in the evenings with a drink or a book. The value of the service at Le Reve is amazing. The staff/guest ratio is so high, at peak times I think there was a staff member on site for each of the 25 rooms! The staff is extremely well trained to attend to your every need, but no one was at all overbearing, annoying, or sales-y. As far as food goes, I am used to Chicago food prices and these seemed reasonable to me. One thing to keep in mind is that all prices include tax AND gratuity. The chef was excellent. I was at first a bit nervous about the food as I had heard it was mostly American-influenced and I like authentic Mexican food. No problem\u2014each evening after dinner, our server Ismael and the Chef worked together to give us authentic options to plan the next night\u2019s meal. We had pork cochinita, a whole roasted fish for 2, barbacoa, chlles rellenos, chicken mole, and barbecue ribs. Our favorites were the barbacoa, chiles rellenos and barbecue ribs, but everything was excellent. We are not big drinkers, but the drinks were well prepared and the service again was excellent. The grounds are kept meticulously every morning and throughout the day\u2014there is not a stone or leaf out of place, ever. There are also nice touches like afternoon tea at 4:30-5pm and nightly turn down service with a little dessert treat. Room service is no extra charge, and neither is pool service, beach service or wherever-you-want-to-eat service. Overall this hotel gives the feel of a hidden gem with a relaxed, quiet atmosphere.

BEACH AND EXCURSIONS The gorgeous beach was literally just footsteps away from our beautiful, clean, garden suit. On the beach, courtesy of Le Reve there are plenty of hammocks and huge, comfortable beach lounge chairs. Le Reve also provides snorkeling gear. In the afternoon we decided to walk down the beach and we found a person selling excursions to nearby places such as the Tulum, Xel-xa, and Chichen Itza. We chose to do an excursion for the second day of our trip that included visiting Tulum and then spending the rest of the day at Xel-xa. Transportation was included in the $95 per person rate (and yes this is for BOTH Tulum and Xel-xa). Tulum is where the Mayan ruins are. We were provided with an english speaking guide and then were allowed to go roam the beach for a little bit. I wish we had more time to explore here. The beach was amazing and actually reminded me of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean. Next we were transported to Xel-Xa, an amazing amusement park that is home to the world's largest natural aquarium. Here we snorkeled, went tubing, zip-lined, jumped off of cliffs, swam in caves, and saw many animals such as manatees, dolphins, and parrots. Unlimited food and drink, including alcohol was included, in our $95 admission. DINNER AND MY WONDERFUL ENGAGEMENT If you would like, Le Reve can arrange for you and your special someone to have dinner either on the beach, or in the spa (which is an open structure that overlooks the beach). My fiance arranged to have a surprise dinner (and ultimately a surprise proposal) for me at the spa, which was amazing. We had a gorgeous view of the beach and the staff at Le Reve had tiki torches burning which made it even more beautiful. The food was extremely delicious! When we returned back to our room, we saw that our amazing Chief Concierge Jaqueline (who is absolutely wonderful), decorated our room with swans and rose petals. It was so beautiful and romantic. Jaqueline, thank you so much for making my engagement such a wonderful, unforgettable and unique experience, I cannot thank you enough!!!!! ROOM We had the Garden Suit as I mentioned before. Personally, I think these rooms are the BEST! We had a view of the infinity pool and the ocean, and we had what is called a roman bath. This is an outdoor bath that has both hot and cold water. That meant that we could sit in our roman bath at night, even when it was a little chilly. Around our little garden were Jasmine bushes giving us the perfect amount of privacy. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was beautiful. I loved the rainshower.

The beach is a delight, uncrowded, cleaned daily and the sand groomed. Just stroll 1/2 mile and check out the other beaches...though not inexpensive, remember you get what you pay for.

We traveled with another couple and had THE BEST time. We arrived to a tranquil spot, and could not believe the view. The beach was just magnificent. The staff were so accomodating on arrival and throughout our stay. The complementary breakfast was outstanding.. couldnt believe this was part of the price of the room ( which was very good to start with). We stayed in the master suite which exceeded our expectations. Huge wow factor and we highly recommend it. The view from the balcony and the spaciousness added so much to the experience. It was a wonderful each day to start with breakfast and then take a long walk on the beach which goes for miles each way. The beach changes shape and has a lot of character as you walk along especially going left out of the hotel. Yes there were rocks, in front of the hotel, but my husband brought water shoes and had NO trouble getting out. The hotel also provides these along with snorkel gear. We went into Playa to have dinner most nights and had a great time... COCO bongo is a must if you want to see what the hype is all about It really was an experience that I cannot explain, but we would not normally go to a venue like this, as it seemed too touristy, but it really was AMAZING. Check it out. Dinner at La Tourtouga was fabulous and so well priced. The bar and food at Diavliato in town was funky and cool. Ceveiche everywhere was great, but you MUST check out the ceviche and the Pizza as well as the very cool couple who owns Coco Cabana's near our hotel. It is walking distance from the hotel, on the beach if you go left. It is behind the Tides hotel. Very \"local\" and authentic and delicious. As far as the hotel, again the staff were so friendly, from checkin Amelia, and at the bar all the servers were exceptional. Roberto took great care of us, fabulous drinks and food. The staff made sure that my husbands birthday was acknowledged a few time throughout the day of, and the made it so personal, which was nice.

As many of the reviews have said, the Staff is amazing. The level of attention and care that you receive at Le Reve is something that can only be experienced at a small boutique hotel. We walked along the beach to check out the other hotels, and granted some had better beach fronts or larger pools, our hotel had an intimate feel and the staff treated us like royalty. We ate and drank on the beach pretty much everyday. Our drinks never ran too low and our plates were never empty before someone would come down to our lounge or hammock to ask if we wanted anything else. And at night, we would always find cute little desserts and inspirational quotes on our turned down beds. I can't even get into all the wonderful little touches that this remarkable staff did to make our trip special. My only concern with the hotel, and its one that I think the hotel should definitely take into consideration, is the road leading up to the hotel. Before we went on this trip, I read ALL of TripAdivsor's reviews and I was somewhat prepared for the \"dirt road.\" But it was so much worst than I imagined. So bad even, that we tried to cancel our reservation. The pot holes are the size of cars and it takes about 15 min just to get to the main road because cars/buses have to come to almost complete stops just to maneuver around the pot holes. I'm so thankful that we weren't able to cancel our reservation (no refund policy) because we ended up having the time of our lives, but Le Reve deserves a lead-up that speaks to the level of service and caliber of the hotel. Oh...last note. The food! The food is amazing! Breakfast is free and its crazy how many great options you have to choose from.

Since we went in slow season, we felt like we had the resort to ourselves. The hotel is only 25 rooms and at most, 8 rooms were filled during our stay. Arlenis, the wedding coordinator, was great to work with and helped us create the perfect, intimate beach wedding. She handled all the details and was on top of everything! The food at the hotel was mouthwatering. I was concerned that we would get bored eating at the same restaurant for most of our meals, but we found by the end of the week we actually preferred eating at the hotel versus going into town because the food was so AMAZING.

If you are looking for more interaction with other hotel guests, or a party atmosphere this is not for you.

The staff gets to know you, is extremely friendly and enjoys interacting with the guests.

We also have a difference in opinion on Le Reve and maybe he'll post his side. Couples huh.................. We booked the most expensive room in the house which was an oceanfront casita with private pool. When they said ocean front it truly meant ocean front. The casita was less than 10 feet from the beach itself. Incredible. Here's the list of \"a few more steps to excellence\" - At the price point of the casita using other 4 to 5 stars hotels we stayed at as a basis: The airconditioner didn't work, we moved to a different casita but the air conditioning couldn't keep up. Since the casita has a thatched roof I assume it can't cool. Talked to another casita couple from the Midwest and they had the same issue. Le Reve has room service, neither casita had a room service menu I had to ask for the large bulky menus from the restaurant and keep them in the room. Turn down service 1 night of the 3, never emptied the trash never left clean towels. The bathroom as in water closet/toliet has no door. My pet peeve might not bother others. The bathroom counter had two sinks so there wasn't any space to put down a makeup bag or shaving kit. Bottom line - improve turn down, leave towels and room service menu, invest in a better split air conditioning unit and for those shy gals who like bathroom time to be me time, maybe a door in the commode area. Here's the 4 star part : Food -Breakfast as in a \"full breakfast\" is including in our rate. NICE loved it and they will serve that comp breakfast in your casita. Food overall was good, one night not so good and they comped it and the staff was sweet about the comp. Staff- They are 5 star perfect. The perfect combination of friendly without overly in your face friendly, professional, talkative, accomodating and concerned that you have a wonderful experience. I can't say enough great things about Le Reve's staff. Love Jacquline the manager and Freddy our waiter for both food & drinks. Spa- I didn't exactly see a spa room per say but my husband and I had an excellent massage. Le Reve has a 2 story open air tower above the pool area where our massage took place so we had a nice breeze and the ocean in our ears during service. My massage was swedish and I put the massage itself in my top 5 list. Beach/Pool Area/Bar - Again this hotel is on the beach, very very close to the shore. It doesn't get any better than that. Nice pool, wish there were steps to get into the pool for those of us older travelers, it's hard on the knees. There is a slope on one side to walk in though. Great cocktails served by great staff. Location - 50 minutes to Cancun Airport. 15 to 20 minutes to downdown Playa Del Carmen. On the same strip of beach as The Tides if you're familar with the area. Overall - Small boutique hotel, a lot of heart & charm. Would I return.........yes but not at the casita rate since it didn't deliver the goods at that price. This hotel is ideal for couples, honeymooners. Great to hold a wedding where you rent the entire hotel.

Maybe it was the waiters who brought us drinks on the beach or breakfast in bed as we looked out over the palm trees and beach.

The beach was clean and well kept and not very crowded. This was definitely not the case at the large hotels near by. The ocean was warm and good for swimming if the winds were down. The hotel provide snorkeling gear and a sea kayak at no cost. They also provide water shoes which are necessary if you walk in the ocean as there is a little coral and rock. Breakfast was delicious. We highly recommend trying the local dishes on the menu as they are very flavorful and an nice change from traditional eggs and toast. They offer freshly squeezed juices which are also definitely worth a try. We only ate one dinner at the hotel which was okay and overpriced which we found common for other dinners we had in the area.

The site was promising and the rooms looked nice and chic. First of all, the access to the hotel is rather poor. Not only is the road bad, it's also not marked properly (unlike other hotels in the area), so one has no idea which exit to take from the highway. Finding it poses a problem even with local taxi service. The room was indeed lovely, spacious, with simple, clean design, wonderful view and perfect bedlinens (we had the Horizon suite, which is not a suite but a room). Yet, there was not a single chair in it, probably for fear it would clash with the design. So, nowhere to sit, one can just stand or lie. It is unfortunatelly impossible to bathe in the sea, because there are rather large and sharp rocks right in front of the hotel. We had to walk up or down the beach and bathe in front of other hotels, which were clean of rocks and, moreover, protected by a sort of breakwater, nothing we encountered at Le Reve. Having had no car, we dined at the hotel every night. The menu is rather limited, and can easily be exhausted within a week. After the first night I had bad stomach problems, not necessaarily related to the hotel food, but I had nothing else these days. Although the waiters were very kind, they were also pretty inapt. It was only on our last day that we got the breakfast right, although we just ordered the continental breakfast as noted in the menu. One day it was one fruit platter for us to share instead of one each, than no orange juice, we never got brown bread, although we asked for it, etc. And last, but certainly not least, the prices and the billing. Half of the costs was paid in advance. The other half was paid immediatelly upon arrival, which would have been no problem if it weren't charged in pesos, at a very high exchange rate. Naturally, my credit card was debited in dollars, at a regular exchange rate, so that eventually, the total price was 25% higher than expected, what with unexpected taxes and this shady exchange policy. One should think that our holiday was ruined, it was actually rather nice, but without these things it would have been perfect. The cleaning service always did excellent job, the room was spotlessly clean. The other personnel was also always attentive to our needs. I really enjoyed being far from busy Playa del Carmen and it's mass tourism.

We were sitting in the restaurant drinking coffee trying to stay warm when Freddy draped a cover over my girlfriend's shoulders. It was a really sweet gesture. The food was exceptionally good (and I'm a bit of a food snob from New York) and we ate every meal there except for a couple. The included all you can eat breakfast (get the chilaquiles with chicken and egg) and excellent coffee pretty much held us until dinner (try the delicious ceviche). And if we wanted a snack there was always beachside service. The hotel is beautiful and feels very exclusive, yet it's also homey and casual. And it's very romantic. This was the first trip my girlfriend and I took together and it definitely helped to solidify our relationship. If you walk down the beach a ways you'll find a mega hotel where the beach was as crowded as Coney Island on a Sunday. We were really glad to get back to Le Reve. The beach is gorgeous with soft, white sand but, swimming-wise, there is coral right up to the waterline. Fortunately, they provide water shoes, so if you just walk out a ways that's not a problem.

As a result, we encountered some challenges here and there, but after a few conversations with the general manager, staff and even the owners, everything was quickly addressed and ultimately turned out perfectly. The hotel's wedding coordinator, Katherine, was very helpful and nice and assisted us in finalizing the many details of our wedding weekend event. She was organized and proactive and followed- up to ensure things happened smoothly and correctly. As a future bride at the time, that was exactly what my wife wanted/needed from a wedding coordinator - especially because it was a destination wedding for 40 guests. Katherine was indeed a welcomed addition to their already outstanding team. We had our wedding rehearsal dinner at Naay (Le Reve's restaurant) and the courses were beautifully presented and were exceptionally delicious. The chef, Saul, utilized fresh and local/regional ingredients that provided the authenticity we desired. He was very energetic and creative and gladly offered to prepare several dishes that were not a part of the regular menu. That said, the regular menu items were very good as well and we and our guests enjoyed every dish we tried - and we tried them all. The shrimp tacos, fajitas and tirimasu were particular favorites as was a refreshing cocktail we named \"Jefecito!\" We held our wedding ceremony on the beach in front of the hotel and it felt like a private beach because of the secluded location. The team made sure the grounds were picture perfect and even assisted our vendors in setting everything up for the ceremony. As for the rooms, we stayed in a Bungalow and enjoyed it greatly because of the beautiful ocean view, the plunge pool directly outside and the king sized bed that was unbelievably comfortable. Naturally, the mosquito net certainly did not hurt things either. ALL of our guests loved the hotel, staff, food and the suites and many have still not stopped talking about their experiences at Le Reve. The entire team will do their best to accommodate all requests and to make sure that you receive excellent service. Before leaving, several of our guests suggested that we all should return to celebrate our first year anniversary. Overall, we think Hotel Le Reve is a wonderful and unique place to vacation as you can easily forget about the \"real world\" if you so desire. Obviously, if you are looking to have a special event or wedding, we highly recommend it for that as well. Fortunately, there are no TVs in the rooms, no night clubs on or near to the property but there are plenty of ways to simply rest, relax and vacate. We would like to thank everyone at Hotel Le Reve again for making our wedding weekend a perfect, memorable and highly successful event!", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cAn intimate hideaway that is incredibly relaxing and beautiful.\u201d", "Author": "Danville4", "ReviewID": "UR30851967", "Content": "We were there with several others to celebrate the wedding of dear friends.

The food at Naay (the in-hotel restaurant) was beautifully presented and very tasty; we discovered we could order from the snack/lunch menu in the evening and quickly decided the chicken skewers over rice were the perfect size meal after lounging all day by the pool.

Le Reve is definitely off the beaten path - see comments about the road, but I rather enjoyed not hearing traffic while relaxing on the beach each day. THE POSITIVES Service - the entire staff desires for you to be happy. Their smiles are contageous, and their 'no problem' attitudes make you feel like royalty. All you need to do is ask, or appear to need something, and you'll get it. Food - we ate the guacamole every day! The breads included for breakfast were wonderful, and we usually ordered a single breakfast entree and split it (to save money and because we don't usually eat a big breakfast). If you get a chance to have the cream of asparagus soup, GET IT! Environment - the resort is small, quiet, relaxed, and upscale. If you are looking for wild nightlife, don't stay here. If you want service, fine amenities, and a memorable vacation, stay here. THE NEGATIVES Mosquitoes - if you are allergic to mosquitoes, you should probably go somewhere else on vacation besides Playa. We were bitten nightly, and there was just not much we could do...we tried it all. Location - yes, I gave location 5 stars, and that's because it is quiet and on the beach. However, MANY taxi drivers in Playa do not know where Le Reve is. So be sure you get a business card of someone you can call for a pick-up or you may be stuck waiting a while. Tipping practice - I was not told upon check-in that tips were included, so we tipped on a regular basis. Granted, we received excellent service, and I don't mind tipping for excellent service. However, it would have been nice to be told up front so as not to spend 100's on tips unnecessarily. Spa - there is a small spa area, but it just isn't much. We got a 'couples massage' but were a bit underwhelmed. Plunge Pool - the plunge pool on our balcony didn't hold water, and had no hot water. We didn't use it once. I wouldn't consider it an amenity. I'm not talking about the beachfront units with the private pools. We were in the main building. BIG difference between the two. SUMMARY We will return to Le Reve, partly because it was the location of our honeymoon, but partly because it truly is a relaxing, upscale vacation spot. Lots of folks walking on the beach stopped when they saw the resort and took pictures or made notes for their next trip. If you like small, boutique hotels, this is a good one to add to your list of places to visit.

It was the most romantic spot, and we were catered to as if we were royalty by the gracious and elegant staff. The layout of the hotel gives the impression of complete seclusion. Even the pool has places for you to relax away from the other guest (if you are not using your own private pool) One evening they arranged a private dinner on the beach with a 5 course mayan dinner and chaises to cuddle on and enjoy the lights of Cozumel. It was a night to remember! And they are dog friendly!!! In fact, when we checked in, they had bones and a ball for our small dog. Sadly, Playa del Carmen does not allow dogs on the beach but our dog had a blast playing on Le Reve's gorgeous big beach! Le Reve's attention to detail is amazing. The owner told me that their goal was to cater to whatever the guest wanted even if it meant finding a place for their helicopter to land...and they have achieved this aim with their level of service. And the price is very conservative as you would expect such luxury to be quite expensive! But the most important part is the location...I, personally, would chose to stay in Tulum if given the option on the Riviera Mayan coast. However, staying in Tulum adds hours of travel time to the trip that we would like to avoid. Le Reve has the feeling of Tulum but hours closer to the Cancun airport so we can easily come for a weekend jaunt. Additionally, if you want a taste of nightlife, Playa's tourism is just a short trip (they provide transportation into Playa). Needless to say, I highly highly recommend Le Reve for a couple who is looking for everything Riviera Maya has to offer! Or if you are looking for a beach wedding spot.

The food that was a disaster the menu is limited and the food that the serve is inedible and expensive for what they serve you.The breakfast is again quite bad.. The entire finishing for the hotel is just as if the owners have picked out the architect from school and put him to do the job or they got conned..

The check in was probably the most pleasant check in experience I have ever had complete with a complementary welcome drink and all. The hotel itself is very small but pristine, friendly, unpretentious, and beautiful. The rooms are simple with no television or radio (unless you book a bungalow which comes with an ipod) and clean and very comfortable. There is one restaurant which serves all your meals and drinks in the open air dining room, in your room, on the beach, or pool side. I consider myself a bit of a food snob and I have to say the only item on the menu that I found questionable was the hamburger. Everything else was absolutely delicious. And to make it even better, the chefs, the wait staff, and the bartenders were very accomodating and even appeared to be excited to fulfill our special off-menu requests. The chef made us mocaljete...table side, two different kinds of tamales from scratch, a very special Mayan twist on a caipirina and they did these things and more with smiles and very friendly banter.

The rooms were basic, but one can find design and classy touches all over the place. I spent half of my stay in a garden room (La Paz) and the other part in a horizon room (Playa Linda), I must confess that I loved the views in Playa Linda. The pool is beautiful and so is the beach kept by the hotel, the staff is wonderful, so considerate and always willing to accommodate your preferences; but without being overwhelming. It does feel like home, and you get relaxed the moment you sit down in the so-called lobby facing the sea. Now, some things needing improvement: food, and more than that the smell coming out from the kitchen which was the main reason for me to move up to the horizon rooms. I had asked for a room away from the kitchen and that was indeed the case; however, one could not avoid that strong smell from the kitchen, which was also a real put off for any other meal taken at the hotel. Breakfast (at least the one included in the price) was simply not good enough; the sweets were not fresh, nor was the butter, and if you are more a person who likes salty staff for breakfast, then you gotta go for the dishes in the menu at an extra cost, and then again, those were tiring....(I spent a week @ Le Reve). Warm water was also a problem in the upper floor, did not complain about it, so I am not sure whether this could have been fixed during my stay....Finally, the charging policy is also an issue for me...it is a matter of taste, but I do not feel at ease when the hotel is so eager to charge half of the price of the stay right after a reservation phone call and then the other half the same very night of my arrival. Then again, I could understand the reasons, but frankly, with so much taste paid into details, I think this could also be brought up to the refined standards of Le Reve.

The place is beautiful, secluded, peaceful and quiet ; it has a home feeling to it and the staff really makes everything they can to make sure you're having a great time, while respecting your privacy. The size of the property also means they all know you and you know all of them and you get a very personal, almost VIP kind of service ! The property is located 15 minutes away from Playa del Carmen (when you take the right road, see below), but is away from the crowds - which is what we were expecting, so we were not disappointed. The road to Le Reve First important thing to know is that there are two roads to Le Reve : the first one, the old, original one, is the very bad dirt road that some travellers mention. It is indeed in a bad shape, full or holes and rocks, going in the middle of the jungle. We took it once, we were lucky it was not raining so did not experience any mud problem. It was at night and it was an eery drive, but we knew what to expect and we actually enjoyed it. We silenced the radio and listened to the forest noises. It gave us the feeling to get to the end of the world - which is what we had come for ! However when you're not so keen on jungle drive, or in a hurry, or with a moody taxi, you can take the other - very normal - road. From the highway you turn where the sign \"Azul Fives\" is. You drive all the way long, and you will first find Le Petit Laffite - another hotel on the same beach - from there turn right, get to another road that is along the Azul Fives, then to get to Le Reve you have to turn right on the dirt road, but you have like - 200-300 meters at most on this dirt road. The last night we went into Playa del Carmen and it took us exactly 14 minutes to get from the city center (we were parked at 10a avenida and 14a calle) to the hotel. Check in We arrived late on the Thursday night. Somebody was here to welcome us and take us to our room. We signed the paperwork (yes the other 50% is to be paid upon arrival but in other places you have to pay the bill 30 or 45 days before coming in... if not 100% upon reservation). I also have to note that I originally booked for 2 nights only, paid the deposit for 2 nights, and when I changed to 3 night they never asked for the 50% of the third night. They knew we were arriving late and that the restaurant would be closed, so they had prepared us sandwiches and salad and apples that were waiting for us in the room ! We had not asked for anything. We were never charged for them either. Our room We had a horizon suite on the pool side. We had a beautiful view. The rooms are very simple but still classy, and the bed is super comfortable ! The balcomy is furnished with two chairs and a table. The room had light enough for us - 2 bedside lamps, one ceiling lamp, some accent lights at the bottom of the wall which, left alone, was giving a wonderful romantic atmosphere ; there was also one light on the balcony, above the sink, in the shower, above the closet, and in the entrance. Plenty. We did have ONE mosquito on the second night - I must say I'm a mosquito magnet, one in a house and it will find me - and we did not have any problem for the whole stay, including when in the restaurant (which is on the ground level, with two ponds). Somebody mentioned there's no door to the bathroom - actually, there's no door to the bathroom but the toilets are separate and have a door - I think it is worth mentioning as people could get a wrong idea. The first night, we did not have hot water in the shower, which was strange because there was hot water in the sink... we mentioned it and it was fixed the second day - actually, the red and blue indicators were just on the wrong faucet ! The only critic I would have here is that there are not enough amenities. For instance, there is no shower cap for the rain shower. There are also no cotton balls or Q tips. They came on the first morning to ask if we needed anything and I asked for some but never got them. Just a detail to me, though. The restaurant and bars Again a great experience for us. The ceviche bar is to die for - all the ceviches have so many different flavors, you have to try the tasting one that comes with three different ones ! All the beef dishes we tried were so-so, but we live in Texas and are used to Angus beef so it's difficult to compete with it ! However we loved the fish dishes, as well as the soups. My fiance is fond of tres leches so we asked for it and the chef prepared one specially for him the next day ! As regards wines - they have a lot of wines that are not on the list. We drink wine by the glass because I do red and my fiance does white. If you don't like the one you first pick, they will make no problem in bringin you anther one ! They have an awesome selection of teas (try the rooibos !). At the bar - great experience too. We asked for mango juice and they just chopped the mango and mixed it in front of us - when we know they have bottled nectar that they can just open (the ones in the mini-bar). We found mini-bar prices to be as any other mini-bar prices (2$ for juice for instance). The rest is maybe a little pricey (for instance, count 11$ for a chicken cesar salad) but I must say that the last night we had dinner in Playa del Carmen and we ended up paying 20$ more than our other 2 dinners in Le Reve. And we had just 2 margaritas, ceviche, guacamole, chicken and fajitas so nothing exceptional. If you don't want to stay in Le Reve to eat, there are unexpensive options nearby. Le Petit Laffite bar and restaurant is a 5 minute walk along the beach (direction to Cancun, turn left when exiting Le Reve), and 10 minutes away from Le Reve is the Thai beach Club. The Thai beach club belongs to the Princess but is open to the public. They have 100 pesos hamburgers and salads. Otherwise Playa is just 15 minutes away. The gym I had an average experience at the gym. First I have to say I love going to the gym. I have tried the work out equipment of all the hotels I went to. So I have high expectations... The gym has a bike, an elliptical, a treadmill and a machine for the arms that does everything. There's also one mat for crunches of stretching. The machines were OK and doing their machine job. But there are no lose weights, for instance. Also, there is no a/c in the gym. We were in December and both windows were wide open - so there was a nice breeze, refreshing enough. I don't know what it would be like in May. Also, there are towels, but no water fountain. The spa You can either take your treatment in the open air spa, or they will come to your room. Having them come to your room is of course the best option for hair or waxing. We chose to have a couple massage in the spa. It was wonderful ! It was so relaxing, with the ocean noise, the breeze, the blue sky that you could peer at through the gaze, and the massage was great ! It lasted super long too, it gave the impression it would never end. Highly recommended ! At least once in your stay. The beach It is true, there's a reef on the beach. If you want to take a bath you need shoes. You also have to pay attention to the jet-skis that are in the area. When you walk along the beach, you can get to spots where the reef has stopped but there are still some rocks. If you walk as far as the Princess (10 minutes away), you will find a lot of people in the water there. However, there are also rocks there. We went jet-skiing and it was great, though ! There are a few rentals along the beach. The normal price is 50$ for hald an hour, so don't get fooled by people asking for more. You can get lower, too (we got 35 min for 45$). Check-out We did not have issue on check-out. To the contrary, they had forgotten a charge ! The rate they used was 13.5, when the bank-to-bank rate of the day (on Oanda) was 13.06.

I rented a car at Merida and drove stopping for lunch at Valladolida (great place) and since the sunsets at around 5.15 pm when we got to Playa del Carmen it was dark. I had done my homework with my GPS so I knew where I was going but my wife started to get concerned when we were driving through this dirt road to the hotel. She gave me this \"are you sure where you're going??\" look. Well we got there, the check in was quick , before going to our room we gave a quick tour of the premises, we just loved de place. The room was ok, the bed and pillows awesome, I mean really comfortable. One of the things I loved was there was no TV in the room, or as far as I know anywhere in the hotel. The staff very friendly and the restaurant was great, maybe a little too cool in the evening so take along a sweater or something because it's an open area. Sometimes we asked to have our breakfast or lunch at a palapa at the beach. Since the hotel has only 25 rooms you really get a more personalized service. I considered the prices for the food and drinks ok considering the place, setting and service. If you'd rather pay much less maybe you should go down to the Quinta Avenida at Playa del Carmen. The hotel has palapas, hammocks and a beautiful beach. The only thing is there's a reef in front so getting a swim at the sea is sort of complicated.

The grounds are immaculate, the design of the pool, restaurant and rooms is very chic. All the staff were very pleasant to us (Henry with his big smile especially). We stayed in a beach bungalow and the bed was very comfortable, with beautiful linens. The Ipod in the room was a nice touch. One other advisor pointed out the 'river rock' design in the floor, and I will say it was a little hard on my bare feet directly in front of the sink. It looks pretty but the river rock should be moved to between the sinks, IMHO. We had a beautiful view of the beach and the sun rise, while lying in bed. I would suggest incorporating screen doors onto the sliding doors, because there were times when the ocean breeze was lovely, and we would have preferred to keep our doors open, but without screen doors we would have let in mosquitoes. We heard no construction the 3 days/nights we were there. The beach is wide with very comfortable lounge chairs, covered with cushions and fresh towels daily. For people who enjoy the pool more than the beach, this is the place for you - the infinity pool is divine, and looks out towards the ocean. For people who want to spend a lot of time at the ocean's edge, and in the ocean directly in front of the hotel, you will need to take water shoes with you to get past the limestone/coral reef before you can get out to swimming depth. We were lucky enough to notice that after we had booked the room directly with the hotel, locogringo.com was offering the same room at a 15% discount. I asked Le Reve if they would extend the discount to our booking and they did without hesitation. We were aware from the web site that a 10% service charge would be added to our bill, so we only tipped above that if we felt the service warranted, which it always did. Food and drink is expensive, on par with prices one would pay in any big American city. The Naay restaurant is beautiful, the place settings are top notch. The food itself was very good, and presented nicely. Service was great. I particularly liked the Lime soup and had it twice. Evenings were very cool, and quite windy. There are no walls on the restaurant and the few wind guards did not keep the chill off me.

Our stay was really good, above average but it wasn't excellent. It was complicated to find the hotel and there are plenty of signs indicating how to get to the hotel, not like one person said in a review that we read here. When we first arrived at the property the security guard approached us, we had our car and we immediately told him that we were coming to stay and I gave him my name ... he looked at his notepad and asked if we were going to see someone, we mentioned again that we were staying there, that we had a reservation, and he kept looking at his notepad and asked again if we had an appointment or something like that, please note that we were speaking in Spanish and he didn't understand, finally some other security guard came and asked us again the same thing, so we told him again the same thing and finally he called someone on his radio and they told him to let us in. It's not the typical front desk area with desks or counters or anything like that, they just have like a little living room and that's where you check in, really nice and quiet. Our room was ready when we arrived, which was around noon, so we went immediately to the room to get changed and go down to the beach. We had a garden view room, we had a really nice garden view and from our room we were able to see the ocean too. The rooms are small but beautiful, very simple and clean looking. There's no TV, so be prepared. We both think that an iPod dock (or at least cd player) would be good in the room, it's nice to be in a quiet hotel, but some music would be nice. The bathrooms are beautiful, the shower is nice too. We were unpacking and getting ready to head down to the beach when I hear someone talking right next to our door and all of a sudden I see someone opening our door and with two other people they were entering, when they noticed I was standing right in front of them and I was like \"hola!\" the lady apologized and walked out ... didn't really bother us, however I did call the concierge immediately to let her know that someone from her staff entered our room, it seemed like she was doing a tour of the property to other clients. The concierge apologized as well, but no big deal, we are no high maintenance, but I'm sure anyone else would have been super mad! The beach is very quiet, the water is nice, although it's a little rocky is you want to go into the ocean. We ordered something to drink, the waiter was quick and brought our drinks immediately, however, he didn't come back to check on us, so I had to go to the bar to ask for a drink, then the waiter showed up immediately and we actually ordered some food as well. The service was pretty quick. In overall it was fine, but we also think that the beach/pool area is too quiet, again, as I said it's nice to be in a quiet hotel, that's what we were looking for, but some nice, relaxing, lounge music wouldn't be bad, there was no music at all by the pool area, we are not the salsa type people, we just think that some chill out or lounge music would be fine in that area. We had dinner in the restaurant, the food was great! the stuffed jalapenos with goat cheese are awesome!!! The staff is really nice, the waiter (I don't remember his name) was very attentive and constantly checked on us without being annoying. There was only one more couple in the restaurant, so it was nice. The beds are sooo comfy, we loved them! we both slept so well. The next morning we ordered room service, they were pretty quick. The continental breakfast is included, but my boyfriend also ordered scrambled eggs, they were good, but I think overpriced, honestly, for what they are, we just thought it was a bit expensive for scrambled eggs. We hung out at the hotel during the morning and left around noon. The checkout was pretty quick, no complications. Oh! the day of our arrival we noticed that we hadn't brought our toothpaste, so I called the concierge to see if they could get me one with housekeeping, they didn't have one but they did offer to go to Oxxo (c-store) for one. When we came back from the beach our toothpaste was already there, that was nice. Overall the hotel is great, small, quiet, relaxing, and beautiful, we really didn't find anything wrong, except for the things that I already mentioned.

The setting is tranquil, although with a large hotel being constructed about 200m to the north, it remains to be seen if this will be so in future. Our large room on the top floor was very clean and most of the staff do their best to please. There is a decent size pool and a small gym. On the other hand we felt there was room for improvement, for example:- There is no reception/concierge desk. Nor is there any directory of hotel facilities in the room [why not?]. This meant a phone enquiry for even the simplest questions. We had a spacious premium room. We knew there was no TV - for us, that was an attraction - but other furniture was minimal. No bath either, even though there was plenty of room for one. Not even a door between WC and bedroom! There was no overhead lighting on our terrace, and minimal lighting in the room. Remember it gets dark early in this part of Mexico! Poor lighting extended to the restaurant area where on some tables it was almost impossible to read the menu. The food itself was beautifully presented, but portions were small and prices expensive. The main menu only changed once in the 4 nights we were there. Sometimes there was a full dessert menu, sometimes there was not. On our final morning, we had to leave at 8am, and arrived for breakfast at 730, [we had been told on arrival that breakfast was served from 730 to 11am], only to be told that it was served from 8am! Result - unnecessary last-minute hassle and no coffee! On check-out there was no itemisation of the final bill, so no way of checking its accuracy.

We ended up in the area because a friend was having a destination wedding in the area. Guests were staying at a variety of hotels, mostly in Playa. Fortunantly, we found Le Reve, which really is a wonderful hotel. Playa We did not care for the town of Playa at all and frankly can't understand why in the world people would go there. Perhaps many years ago it was quaint. Not, it is very touristy (and low-end tourists at that) and filled with chain restuarants, t-shirt and tatoo shops, bad food, etc. It was like the Myrtle beach of Mexico. There was not one positive thing that I can say about Playa. We had to go into town far more than we would have liked for wedding activities. We were always so happy to get back to Le Reve at night. Hotel Le Reve Overall we were very pleased with Le Reve. The service was amazing. The staff is incredibly attentive and really looks after you. We booked a top floor room, but the first night we were placed in a beach-front bungalow bc our room was not yet free. The bungalow was very nice, but the top floor room blew it away. It is so large, has an amazing patio and a beautiful view. My friend stayed in a garden room, and it was pretty bad. It didn't even have a masquito net around the bed (which is vital). The bugs were so bad in their room, they asked to be upgraded to a 2nd floor room, which the staff did comp them to. The thrid floor room aslo didn't have any bug problems. Overall, rooms are very clean but they are a bit rustic.. Beds and linnens are very lovely, though. AC worked great. The beach & ocean wer very nice, though as others have mentioned, it is very rocky in the water and makes it really a bear to get in and out of the water. The food at the hotel was good. If it cost about 1/3 less, I would have felt I was getting my money's worth. But, the portions are small & the quality is good but def not great. Breakfast was probably the best meal of the day. We did have the chef prepare us an off-the menu entree one night, which was really lovely. The food quality was better than our off the menu items, and we had it served to us in the private massage area that overlooks the beach and water, which was really special. A must-do. Another must do is head to a restaurant called John Gray's in Playa. Its the only decent restaurant we found in playa (although Gray's is wonderful). We went there 3 times in one week. Highly reccoment it. There are two main problems with Le Reve - the masquitos and the road that leads into the hotel. The masquitos would actually be a reason I would consider not returning. Though the staff had plenty of bug spray to pass out, it was still a very annoying part of the trip. The road it is just terrible. It would take about 20 minutes to get from the hotel back to the main road because it was so horrible (making it a 30 - 40 minute cab ride to Playa). The cab company that the hotel would call for us to go into town was familiar with the road, so they would not complain. However, when we would get cabs in the city to bring us home at night, it was always a nightare. We would tell the cabbies \"El calle es muy mal\" (the road is very bad) but we would just get varying degrees of attitude from the drivers once we hit the road to Le Reve - some essentially yelling and cursing at us, some demanding more moeny due to the road conditions - and I don't blame them, it was horrible & really tough on the cars. You would have to ride through holes in the road that looked like landmines had exploded (no joke) and the water would be up to the floor of the car. On a few occassions, we thought the cabbies were going to stop and make us get out mid-way (which would have been VERY scary, although this never happend). On the last night we were there, our cab did get stuck in the mud on the way home. Thankfully, we were able to get in touch with the hotel (which was fortunante bc there is not someone answering the phone past 10 or so). They came and got us and promised us they would go back to help the cabbie. The road was really a detraction. Had we not had to go into town so much, it wouldn't have been as big of a deal. There are a few negatives to Le Reve, but I think it's all about being prepared (primarily about the road). If you can get past that & the bugs, you will have the most enjoyable stay.

No signs, no map on their website, phone wasn't answered when I attempted to call. Many Taxis didn't even know this location since it's so off the beaten path. After 2 more hours of driving aimlessly, I found it. The first night I stayed in a groundfloor/garden suite. More like kitchen suite at 7am with staff preparing breakfast next door. Small room with no locking doors leading to garden. The next room was like stepping out of the basement into a slice of heaven. Spend the extra money to select the top rooms or you will be disappointed. Not a swim friendly beach: nice sandy beach but reefs in the water make it a little tender on the feet.

We loved the hotel, and thorougly enjoyed our stay. Let me clarify a few things. If you have your expectations in the right place, this hotel is fantastic! Service: Wonderful service, attentive and friendly staff. This is not 4 Seasons type service, but more Bed and Breakfast type friendly service. The only \"non-positive\" thing I can say is that not all the staff were full knowledgeable about everything at the hotel. This was mainly due to the fact that there were 2 people working that had just started there. Rooms: We had a beach bungalow with the prvt plunge pool. It was fantastic, but its very simple. Very high end linens on an extremely large and comfortable bed. We did kill about 2 dozen mosquitos in the 4 nights we were there. We saw other guests joking about how many bug bites they had. This was not a problem for us, but if you're expecting 4 Seasons luxury, mosquitos and the odd roach may ruin your stay. Just know what to expect. There's a mosquito net around the bed, so use it when you got to sleep. You also cannot call out from the phone in your room. You'll have to call the office and have them place the call for you and transfer it back to your room. They were more than happy to do this for us, and they also let me use their computer. I don't know if the website mentions it, but there aren't any TV's (which for us was great!). There was an IPOD (with an eclectic mix of music) and IPOD docking station to play your IPOD. The AC worked great, but we really didn't need it. Temp was mid 60's at night. Food/Drinks: Overall the food was very good. Our rate included the continental breakfast (toast, juice, coffee) but other typical breakfast entrees could be ordered for a price. I was a little surprised by the food prices, but I don't think its really overpriced. Entrees range from $19-$40. The menu is pretty limited, but if you ask the servers for advice they'll often tell you about what else the chef can prepare. 2 nights I ordered entrees that weren't on the menu. Just remember that the food prices at the restaurant will be typical of any up-scale US restaurant in most US Cities. I was also surprised by the drink prices. Beer $4 and cocktails $9 and up. The $9 margarita was pretty unimpressive. We went to a local store and bought some beer and other drinks to keep in our room. One of the nice things is that all the prices for food and drinks include a 15% tip. This makes it convenient and makes the prices seem a little lower. If you're a wine connoiseur you may be disappointed. I'm not a wine expert so the wine list was fine, but its fairly limited. 25 btls of red and 25 btls of white aprox. Beach/Pool: The service here is fantastic. They put out cushions on all the beach/pool chairs every morning and then put towels down on top of all the cushions. They have 6 or so \"Palapas\" on the beach with beach chairs underneath them. We didn't have any problems getting chairs, but it may be difficult if the hotel is full. There was only 8 rooms (of 25) occupied while we were there and on Sat and Sun all the Palapas were taken (but there was still open chairs around the pool. They'll bring you drinks on the beach/pool and cool wet towels to cool off with. They clean the beach in front of the hotel every morning (and rake the sand too!?!?!?!?) It's not ideal for swimming due to the rockiness from the waterline in. They do have diving shoes/aqua socks that you can use to go into the water. We used these to go swimming and it worked fine (but I wouldn't recommend it barefoot). You can walk down the beach about 100yds in either direction and find less rocks and an easier way to swim. There are much larger resorts located fairly close by so you will see a number of people walking the beach in front of Le Reve. It was never a problem for us, but there is a huge resort located just South of the Le Reve. Language: I speak Spanish, but my wife doesn't . Just about everyone seemed to speak English, and most very well. There was also some French spoken (I think the owner is French). About 1/2 the guests were from the US/Canada, and the other half seemed to be French/European. The day we left there was a couple there from Mexico. All over Playa del Carmen, just about anywhere you go, someone speaks English. All our cabdrives spoke at least some English. If you speak Spanish, all the better, but you certainly don't need to. Playa del Carmen: We were somewhat disappointed with Playa. Its very touristy. The main street and the beach are dominated by bars/restaurants catering to Americans/Europeans. T-shirt shops, Hard Rock, Johhny Rockets, etc. We didn't realize Playa was so touristy. We managed to find two great authentic mexican restaurants to eat in while we there. El Fogon is one (its on tripadvisor). Just ask any taxidriver and they'll take you there. We also ate a great \"taqueria\" called \"Estilo y Sabor Mexicano\". The taqueria was great. I'm pretty sure they don't get a lot of gringos there, but its great.

I went there on my honeymoon and my wife and I were completely blown away with everything\u2026especially the food. A couple little highlights from our trip\u2026 We took a shuttle arranged by the resort in from Cancun and yes, you go down the craziest little dirt path to get to this place through the jungle that you can imagine. Don\u2019t be alarmed or worried that you\u2019re getting kidnapped or robbed or anything. As we said, it just added to the charm. Upon arrival at the resort, the gates opened up and we were met with absolute heaven on earth. CUSTOMER SERVICE We were greeted almost immediately with a waiter who brought us the freshest fruit cocktails imaginable and everything just got better from there. When we got to our room, (which was spectacular by the way) the biggest, freshest bouquet of flowers awaited us along with a huge heart made of rose petals laid out perfectly on the bed. My wife asked if I had arranged all of that and I wish I could have taken credit for it, but it was all Le Reve\u2019s doing. We had dinner that night and they set us up for private dining in the massage area because it was sprinkling a little and they wanted to be sure we didn\u2019t get rained on, but wanted to make it special and away from the restaurant and other guests. Since the massage area had an open roof, they actually put a tarp up for us\u2026just in case. We were told by another guest that they actually cut down some of the palm leaves on one of the trees so we would have a better view of the ocean during our meal. They did all of this unbeknownst to us while we were getting ready in our room. We leave our room to head to dinner and there is a torch-lit path from our door to the top of the massage area which had been completely converted to the most romantic private dinner you could ever imagine. Our waiter provided us with the best possible service you could ever have. And the meal was absolutely one of the best meals either of us has ever had. Not sure what the person who said the food wasn\u2019t all that great is talking about. We would put this and every other meal we had there up against anywhere in the world. The next day we had scheduled massages. The resort was only set up to do one person at a time\u2026I guess they only keep one masseuse on staff. But, we asked them if there was any way for us to both get it done at the same time since we were on our honeymoon, wanted to be together, etc. They actually called in another masseuse especially for us so we could go together. When it was time to get the massages, we opened the door to our room to find someone waiting for us with umbrellas to walk us up there. It was sprinkling a little and I guess they wanted our 20 foot walk to be dry. Very nice touch. PEOPLE I don\u2019t even know where to start with this. Every member of the Le Reve staff was so incredible and took such great care of us on every detail. In no particular order, the owner\u2019s name is Clemen and she is an amazing young woman who obviously gets how this business should operate. Her dream has always been to own a resort and she is living out her dream to the fullest. We could have spent hours talking to her as she was so welcoming and interesting and helpful with anything. Simply lovely!!! Eric, the Chef, was actually one of the first people to introduce himself. His meals were some of the finest food we have ever had. Everything he prepared was made with great pride and took on much more of the form of works of art than just food. From the freshly baked rolls for breakfast to the thermadore lobster for dinner\u2026he nailed every dish. Antonio was our waiter in the evenings. I touched on it before, but this guy completely bent over backward for us. He felt like more of a friend who\u2019d been working for our family for years than a waiter we just had for a couple of days. He was so pleasant and charming and witty. He was never on top of us and he was never very far away. He took such great care of us and could easily work in any of the finest restaurants in the world. Emiliano was sort of our morning waiter, although he was much more than that. He took great care of us for anything we wanted from the restaurant or bar throughout the day. You want coffee and breakfast on the beach? No problem. And poof\u2026he has a team of people setting up special lounge chairs with freshly tucked in towels and end tables with a breakfast spread and fresh coffee in a snap. Like Antonio, he was never on top of us, but never far away. He even brought us a bag of snorkeling gear in case we wanted to try that out\u2026not because we asked for it, but because he thought we might want to have it. Jacqueline was sort of our personal concierge\u2026or at least she felt like it. Although I\u2019m sure she felt that way to everyone. She was the one who took care of all of the scheduling and met us at the door with umbrellas for our walk to the spa. She lined up the double massage and rides to and from the airport. She made the check-in and check-out process flawless. She was amazing and was never far away for anything we may have wanted. Just let her know what you need and she would figure out a way to make it happen. COMPLAINT The only complaint I have is that I wish we were still there or I wish we could have figured out a way to bring Le Reve\u2019s amazing staff home with us. Can\u2019t wait to go back and visit them all again!!!

We booked the beachfront bungalow room with the plunge pool and it is totally worth every penny. If you want to stay in a less expensive room you will still have great views and a comfortable stay. The food was delicious, the staff was very attentive, and the rooms comfortable clean and gorgeous.
