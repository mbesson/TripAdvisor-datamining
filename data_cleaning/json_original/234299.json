The staff here is very accommodating, sharing personal stories and favorite destinations, breakfast is more than sufficient, and the hallways and lobby are decorated in a very artistic fashion. The only shortcoming we found is that the lobby is not very inviting; there are only two, stiff-backed chairs which does not make it a place one might want to sit, chat, mingle, or people-watch. Be aware that this hotel is directly on a noisy roundabout (Puerta de Toledo) and a fire station. On the other hand, it is quite close to the Metro and bus stops.

The prices is in the range of a Motel 6 and has every basic thing: a bed, closet, bathroom, hot shower, television and an elevator.\u00a0 It is quite conviently located a few meters away from the metro station and a kilometer or two from Plaza Mayor, the heart of the city. \u00a0To get there from the Barajas Airport, you must take the metro all the way to Mar de Cristal station, then take the number 4 (brown) line to Arg\u00fcelles and get off Alonso Martinez station and then take number 5 (green) line to Casa de Campo and get off at Puerta de Toledo station and on to your left you will the hotel. I recommed to purchase a \"abono turistico\" ticket at the airport, with it you can freely use the metro and bus in the city for three, five or seven days, it is a very money-saver!\u00a0 Some of the rooms have a very distinct smell of old so for the faint of heart I recommend to use a room deodorant that can be easily bought in a store or better yer bring one from the US, obviously much cheaper, and just plug it in the electrical outlet just don't forget to \u00a0buy your American-European converter because it will cost you double in Spain. Buy one from eBay, they're so cheap it's ridiculous and they work nicely.\u00a0 One of the best things is the hotel staff, they're very kind and welcoming, it just feels like a bed and breakfast, and they will help you with any questions you may have. Also, it is just a brisk fifteen minute wal to the cathedral, royal palace and plaza mayor but be wary of pick pockets because there are a lot of people walking in the afternoons and especially tourists who are easily distracted.\u00a0 The drawbacks is that it is a bit noisy because of the streets and the other rooms so, if you can, request a room from the back, those are less noisy, and the shower is so small I barely fit into it and I'm not overweight or very tall, just average but remember that this hotel was made a few decades ago so it will have a few drawbacks.\u00a0 Overall, I recommend this hotel for all travelers who just want a nice, private and centric room at good price. I will defintely will reserve again in this hotel next time I visit Madrid.\u00a0 FYI, \"Madrile\u00f1os\" are a bit rude by nature so they will serve you in such a way that it would be considered unpleasant by most standards but don't take it personal, that is the way they are.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cAdequate\u201d", "Author": "FoylesWar", "ReviewID": "UR121151216", "Content": "I stayed here 16 OCT - 05 NOV 2011 and had a double room on the outside of the hotel facing the roundabout directly above the taxi stand. There was a mix-up with my reservation as the travel agent booked a double room and I was traveling alone. When I asked to change to a single room at the reception, they would not let me change and said it was because of the commission they had to pay to the travel agent. I thought they should have tried a bit harder to find a way to accommodate my request, including letting me pay the higher commission out of pocket. The room was clean, the bathroom large but the air conditioning was not functioning at this time of year. So I had to open the window and the noise of a big city at night was enough to keep me awake and wake me during the night. Emergency vehicles responding to calls from their station just down the street with their sirens blaring were just the beginning of many sounds that came wafting into the room through the window. My colleagues were in single rooms in the interior and had almost no ventilation even with the window wide open. They also had a very small, corner shower in the single rooms that made it difficult to turn around in the shower. Breakfast was good and I felt at a reasonable price. The menu never changed though. The internet connection, while free was rubbish. There were times when it was so slow as to be completely useless. One of my colleagues have relocated to another hotel due to the continuing problems they have with the internet connection. The garage is very small. I would recommend their shuttle service to the airport. It cost 30 Euro for two of us which we split. Much cheaper than a taxi. Make sure you request it a day or two before you need it. There is no mini-refrigerator in the room, so forget going to the grocery store and saving some money on food. There is a small safe in the room, but it costs 1 Euro each time you use it. The location just across from the metro station and several bus stops. Lots of restaurants within walking distance.

The hotel does have a cafe next door, which is good to grab a cappuccino, as they only provide coffee at the hotel. The location is another matter. The hotel to my surprise was located about a 30 minute brisk walk to most attractions or 3-4 metro station stops. However, their is a train station (Puerta de Toledo) just up the street. Overall this is of good value if your bottom line is cost, but you definitely sacrifice location.", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pawleys Island, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat view of Madrid\u201d", "Author": "JPSaleebyMD", "ReviewID": "UR15328079", "Content": "The Puerta de Toledo met our budget for our trip to Europe (Spain was our last stop).

The city was much cleaner and more ordered (traffic wise) than I expected. Only disappointment was with much of the wait-staff in restaurants, where if you could not speak Spanish.. there was a lot of eye-rolling and sighing on their part. Wish they had been as friendly and helpful as the Italians. Breakfast was GREAT! Lots of choices and it certainly made the say.

Double bedrooms looked much better, but, overall, this is best described as a 2 star hotel, 1 star for its single bedrooms.

Now the negative points I'm afraid: the hotel is rather old and it is being to seriously show its age. We asked for non smoking rooms and got smoking rooms that were quite shabby. The smell of smoke was very overpowering in the room it seemed to have been embedded in the curtains and all the furnishings and also appeared to come through the aircon system. The shower was also very tiny and here we come to the issue of cleanliness. I located several hairs in the bathroom in general, specifically in the shower recess and also in the bed. My friend also found several dead moths in his room. This might be perhaps expected in a backpackers' hostel but not in a 3 star establishment. The mornings were pretty noisy too with the maids being very loud in their conversations when we were still sleeping (around 7.30am). The hotel location is also not that central, we had to walk for half an hour before reaching the main Madrid city centre. I suggest the hotel closes for total renovation and then I might be prepared to visit it again but only because of the friendly staff.", "Date": "September 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cwhat it must be\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2874366", "Content": "it is clean, cheap enough, in an excellent position, internet for free, unfortuantely people is allwed to smoke along the corridor.

First, my luggage never made it to Europe. One bag somhow made it around our southern states; I still can't figure that one out . I was searched from the time I arrived at the airport in Detroit, onto the International flight from Chicago, finally from Germany onto Spain. A total of six times; shoes and all. Needless to say I wasn't very happy to find out, not only did my luggage not make it, but they even ended up on a totally different airline carrier. Go figure. My first nine days in Spain was spent outside of the city in a hotel that was not so friendly. When I finally did make it back to the city I couldn't wait to get to the Hotel Puerta de Toledo. You see, these people have been taking care of my reservations for over a year now. I've had the pleasure of staying at their hotel for four different trips this past year. The last two however, have been for only a day. This is because my business takes me outside of the city far enough that it's impossible for me to travel back in forth everyday on business. I love the way they treat this American. From the bar next door to the fine dinning in the lower level of the hotel. The gentleman that work at the front desk are some of the most friendly men I've ever met. I only want to stay at this hotel when I visit this country and the city of Madrid. I hope to see them all next month for the Christmas Holidays.
