It has been my second stay. They are friendly, professional and the rooms are very large with a furnished suite. The location could not be beaten being right in the heart of Zona Rosa and steps away from everything central in Mexico. But there are some needed improvements. First of all the room and furnishings.The overall rooms need upgrading. The carpeting, bed sheets and furniture is old and musty and could use a more comfortable and contemporary appearence. The breakfast was plentiful but milk warm for cereal. I think it needs to be refridgerated. The waitress was terrible. I often had to ask her to come out to serve me coffee. The computer is something out of 1990 and badly needs upgrading with more of them.

The police stood outside of the hotel and for 3 days straight these fans would come and go at all hours. For starters I am not a picky traveler all I desire is a decent bed in a clean room with peace and quite. However, I got more then I bargained for at this hotel. Yes, it's close to all the boutiques, shopping, bars, Starbucks, Mcdonalds, and enough 711's your head would spin. To make a long story short this hotel is average for what you expect in Mexico. The rooms are clean however are small and the published photos are somewhat misleading giving you the perception the room is large.

I picked this hotel because I wanted to be in an area where I can find food and services 24 hours a day (I tend to get back to the hotel late at nights). This hotel is in the heart of Zona Rosa. You are within walking distance to dozens of restaurants and convenience stores, some open 24 hours. There is always people on the street (even at 2am). If you look like a male tourist, you will be harassed by touts trying to pull you into one of the many area strip clubs. I just ignore them as part of the scenery, but it may bother others. All the rooms are suites. They are huge, with a separate living room with sofa, coffee table, TV and mini-fridge, a bathroom area, and the bedroom. They are effectively one bedroom apartments, and can probably accommodate an entire family comfortably. The hotel itself is older, and appears to be a bit run-down. The bed and linens are spotless and clean, and the staff does their best to keep up the place. But the fixtures and furnishings are due for an overhaul. There is Internet Wifi, but it can be unreliable (hard to keep a constant connection up). It can be difficult to get to this hotel with taxi, since most taxi drivers do not know where it is. I usually have to tell them to go to the nearby Hotel Geneve or Plaza la Rosa. If that doesn't work, I tell them to go to Zona Rosa at the intersection of Londres y Insurgentes (it is a 3 minute walk from the intersection). The Metrobus is easier (a short distance to the stop on Insurgentes). If I were visiting Zona Rosa (or nearby Polanco and Reforma), I would stay at this hotel again.

Noise is a big problem if you are street -side--Londres. Try to reserve an 01-03. You stand a better chance of sleeping at night, especially Friday and Saturday, if you are a light sleeper. I was awakened, on occasion, by very loud music or police sirens. Keeping your window open in this neighbourhood is just not an option at night, especially if your room is 04-06. Remember, it's a business hotel, so there is no lobby to speak of, which means no people watching in the hotel but step outside the front door and it is overload. The things you will see in that neighbourhood will amaze you. The hotel needs an upgrade in the coming years or it will start to appear run-down, but for now it is in decent condition, great value and centrally located. Remember that every time some minor irritant occurs. It is great value, in decent condition and centrally located. The Metro is just two blocks away. Use it, it is wonderful, goes almost everywhere, and only 30 pesos a ride (27 cents). Walk the city if you can, it is the only way to see it. The neighbourhood is seedy, but in a good sense. It's name, Zone Rosa, means Red Zone, and on offer are all the carnal delights that money can buy. What is fascinating is you have all this heterosexual activity going on in the heart of what is now the gay district of Mexico City, and they get along just fine. Finally, I have never seen as many police officers in any city I have every visited, as I did in the areas I visited in Mexico City. I never felt unsafe and I walked back to my hotel from Condesa after dinner at 10 and 11pm. I took the Metro to Polanca and downtown without a problem. I heard someone say there was 1 police officer for every 10 residents. That cannot be but there can be now doubt that Mexico City has one of the highest ratios of police to civilians. They were everywhere I went. The greater the risk (neighboourhood, hour of day, etc.), the larger the police presence. I felt so safe and the locals remarked that they were there for tourists. I suspect there's more to it than that but I was happy to see them. Mexico City is safe.

When I was leaving Mexico I decided to spend a couple of days in Mexico City. I thought I'd try a new hotel so I went to Casa Gonzales because the reviews said it was nice. Big mistake. Drunken college kids. Dirty room on first floor with a broken window. I'm not paranoid. But, come on... someone could have climbed right in while I was sleeping. Casa Gonzales is for people (mostly American) who are afraid of encountering a Mexican person without an American to help them. So, I went back to Eurostars where the staff do speak English Thank God they had a room. It was $5 dollars more the Casa Gonzales. Eurostars isn't perfect. It can be a little noisy on a Saturday night, but quiets down fairly early. The building has decent sound protection. If you are bothered by any sound at night, Zona Rosa is probably not the best neighborhood to pick. And the breakfast could be better. When I go back which I will, I'll probably get breakfast someplace else, especially because there is coffee in the room. The service is good. They are polite. It's clean. The food is O.K. So, if you are on business or you don't want to leave the hotel for breakfast, it's not bad. It's just not great. The service at the front desk is great. I needed a taxi at 4:00 in the morning to get to the hotel and they arranged it for me. When you are a woman taking at taxi to the airport in the middle of night, you need a safe taxi and they had someone that the hotel used who was great. That said, Mexico is not more dangerous than it was a few years ago. It's a great time to go because the sensationalistic coverage of the border violence, has scared away a lot of tourism, so you can get great deals and even at the height of the normal tourist season, the sites are not super crowded.

Breakfast was included in $60/night rate, buffet offers a good range of food and fruit and eggs are cooked a la carte by kitchen staff. will definetly stay here next time in MEX. I prefer to walk around lively Zona Rosa than to stay in upper class Polanco, where a car is essential. The Hotel is a block away from major transport hub, and taxis are readily available. Just choose a taxi with the proper license featured on the passenger's window for safety reasons.

Eurostars Zona Rosa Suites is superb hotel, situated in a fantastic location in the heart of Zona Rosa. The area is full of bars and restaurants, it's cosmopolitan (you will see what I mean) and safe at night. Its surrounded by restaurants, shops and bars too. The Suites are large, consisting on a kitchen facility, sink and microwave, living room and bedroom with large queen-size bed. The bed is very comfortable. The bathroom area consists of a separate shower/bath room with toilet, behind of a frosted glass door. The wash basin and mirror are just outside, situated in a small alcove, off of the main bedroom. See my photos for more information. I note that the size of the different suites vary considerably. As you exit the lifts, if you are allocated a suite towards the left, there will be three suites. The one on the far left is considerably smaller than the others. If you are allocated this room, simply ask to switch. They know it is smaller and will switch you without a problem. The hotel itself is well maintained, with ice machines, gym and roof top terrace for those interested. There is also a business facility with desktop PC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. All room have Wi-Fi and pay-TV for those interested. The hotel decor is now looking a little dated, but not too bad. The other Eurostar hotel in DF looks more up-to-date and is only a short walk away in Reforma. However if you do select Eurostars Zona Rosa, unless you have incredibly high expectations, you won't be disappointed. There is a breakfast served in the hotel, however with so many nice restaurants around I would carefully consider if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it! The receptionists speak both Spanish (and a little English). All are very helpful. IMPORTANT: I booked this hotel, once again, via Hotels.com which is a service I have used many times before. Despite complaining about this on my last visit and being compensated for it before, they continues to do it!! There is only ONE class of suite at this hotel, yet they continue to offer different rates at hotel.com for the same thing! They call it 'Suites-European Plan' and 'Executive Double'. Book the cheapest one, they are identical rooms!!
