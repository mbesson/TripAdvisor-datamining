Far more inexpensive than many other comparable hotels, it is indeed a good place to spend a day or two. The hotel and the rooms are nicely decorated and clean, the bathroom well equipped. Breakfast is included and has some variety. The greatest benefit, however, is the very friendly personell. The sound isolation, what is very important for me, was stunningly good - we could sleep very well, although our room was just next to the breakfast room. Of course, in this price range, you cannot expect luxury. Among those small faults that are not really disturbing, but yet exististing, are the fact that the floor is of stone (or some similar material), which makes it quite cold (so don't forget to take your slippers!), that the heating is made through the airconditioning, that is quite noisy, and that the double bed is actually two beds bound together. But as I said, that was not really problem for me. The only thing that did bother me indeed was that the coffee in the breakfast room was really watered and tasted almost like tea! But there are bars next to the hotel, where you can have a good coffee, before you leave for Venice! I think this hotel is good value and would therefore recommend it for those who prefer to stay in Lido.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montego Bay, Jamaica", "Title": "\u201cClean, cozy, comfy.\u201d", "Author": "travellingman1352", "ReviewID": "UR125313896", "Content": "Located on scenic, beautiful, expensive Lido island across the lagoon from Venice.

An adequate breakfast was provided each morning and even on the morning we checked out at 5 am. a staff member prepared and packaged breakfast specially for us and this without our even asking. If you are staying in the Venice area for more than 4 or 5 days buy the 7 day travel ticket which gives you unlimited travel in the Venice area both by water bus and omnibus. If eating out and you are on a budget eat in Venice for a fraction of the cost of eating on Lido. Our one disappointment with Villa Orio is that it does not have elevators and we were on the top floor and had heavy luggage.

Our room was spacious with very high ceilings, individual tub/shower in a spacious bathroom (compared to European standards). Clean sheets, clean floors, a well stacked breakfast with rolls, meat, cheese, croissants, cereal, coffee, pomegranate juice, orange juice, milk, yogurt - the inside is well worth it. The hotel staff was friendly and the manager at the time help us change our tire when we got a flat and spoke to ADAC on our behalf to help us along. *Note: the parking accross the street gave us the flat since we drove in the high vegetated portion, but there is usually parking on the street). The downfall is that its at the south end of the island and you have to take the ferry (29 Euro minimum plus 7 Euro per person over 6 years old) from the Venice mainland to Lido Di Venice. To have a beach only a 10 minute walk away and at the same time have access to all of Venice, plus a small local grocery store, ice cream shop, bar, and pizzeria (although the staff there was less than enthusiatic) was quite a delight!

The en-suite WAS small, however, with a shower and no bath, but was perfect for our 3 night stay and was extremely clean and modern. Overall a lovely little hotel, efficiently run with very modern comfortable rooms (Tv, mini bar, seating area and plenty of wardrobe space), and certainly for the money it represented excellent value. As noted before, it is at the \"wrong\" end of Lido (in terms of getting the ferry to the island), but this does mean it's right next to a beach and local swimming pool. There is a bus practically on the doorstep of the hotel (about 1 euro) so getting to the ferry \"docks\" (it drops you right by them) wasn't a problem - although it was a good 20 minutes away from the main area of Lido, where you catch the water taxis to venice. This was fine during the day but at night when we were tired and just wanted to get to bed, it could get tiresome. It was certainly fine for the 3 nights we spent there, but if we were to visit Venice again we might try to stay nearer the ferry port. I would definitely stay on Lido again, however, rather than mainland venice. We thought part of the magic of venice was our ritual ferry ride to and from the Lido every day. Coming into venice by water with the sun on your back and the wind in your hair was something I'll never forget, as the views of venice this way are spectacular. We also stumbled upon Venice (completely by accident) during the festival of the redentore (3rd saturday night/sunday morning in July). This also happened to be my partners birthday, and we have wonderful memories of the street party atmosphere (it's traditional to buy a few beers and then find a spot near the water front to sit and just admire the celebrations) with the seemingly endless fireworks, while enviously looking upon the 100's of boat parties unfolding on the water... We had dinner by the Grand Canal that night, and while this was nice, it certainly wasn't spectacular, and definitely didn't represent good value for money (45 euros for 1 portion of fish n' chips!). We had a similar experience of the canal during the day about 100 yards from our evening dinner, where we sat on the canal side steps right by the rialto bridge eating a huge slice of pizza from one of the many takeaway stalls, all for about 5 euros! In any case, Venice is an absolutely magical place that's exactly like all the picture perfect postcards you see.

We were concerned about the hotels location as it is on the island of Lido and not in main Veince. The location of this hotel turned out to be great as it was nice to get away from the huge crowds in Venice at the end of the day. We were able to take our car to Lido and park for free by the hotel which was a money saver. There is a very frequent bus that stops right in front of the hotel and takes you directly to the bus boat docks. Therefore the location was not a problem at all. The hotel itself is very nice and well maintained. The rooms are VERY small, but clean and nice. The breakfast that is included in the price of the room is good and has a fair selection of cold foods to chose from. There are not very many restaurants around the hotel so I would recommend eating in Venice before returning to the hotel.
