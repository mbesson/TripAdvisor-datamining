Some improvements to the shower (corroded shower head & noisy pipes) would still be welcome. The room itself was nicely done, clean & spacious enough. French doors with nice hardware lead to a narrow balcony. The view was framed by rather nice curtains. Furniture was fresh and standard \"nice hotel\" issue. We tried the cafe and restaurant in the hotel. We had good coffee & mallorcas at the cafe, and a very nice meal at the restaurant. The one drawback for this hotel is the noise. The walls are indeed thin. Fortunately all the guests around us were polite and considerate. Our room was near the ice maker, and that was ok too, (contrary to an earlier post.)

My room was in the historic part. I reserved two weeks in advance so I got an excellent rate ($89.99). It was an quintessential Spanish room, with high ceiling, old style furnishing and an humongous bathroom which reminded me more of an apartment that a hotel room. I did not have wi-fi, but didn't matter in my case since I did not bring a laptop. The hallway afforded a view of the pool area and Lola Restaurant's outdoor dining area and bar. The noise from the live acoustic music did seep into my room but I booked so I could take a short trip to nearby Juana D\u00c3\u00adaz for a party so it did not affect me. The A/C's in the rooms on the historic part are controlled from reception so make sure it works properly if you book a room there. Ramada has an excellent restaurant (Lola) and a decent coffee shop (Melao) where I had dinner and breakfast, respectively. It also has valet parking for guest at an extra cost per day.

The nice yellow building houses the front desk, lobby, restaurant and kiddie pool (any adult would be embarrassed to get in this \"pool\"... VERY small... in the pic it looks big.. IT IS NOT!! There are 6 rooms in the yellow building which are the colonial style rooms with the checkered floor. There is another building in the back where the rest of the rooms are. My room was spacious and clean (very important). Bathroom was big as well. You can't control the A/C temperature in the room (bad job Ponce Ramada) The flat screen TV has your usual basic channels. You have a coffee maker in the room and housekeeping will bring you a coffee bag if you want to make more coffee. Valet Parking is 10 bucks a day, but they start at 11 am. I never needed my car before then though so it wasn't an inconvenience. The \"fitness centre\" is another joke like the pool. A padded floor with 3 little rinky-dink machines that felt like they were going to break when I got on (I'm 6'0\" 215 lbs, so it wasn't me) This property should not even advertise a pool and fitness centre. The restaurant of the hotel \"Lola's\" seemed a bit pricey even though I heard great things about it, I did not eat there. Wasn't in the mood to splurge, especially with all the kiosks outside for the carnival with a wide variety of foods dirt cheap, be warned-- I came to Ponce because of the carnival, for the most part this is a ghost town. No pharmacy within walking distance-take note. I checked out and discovered when I got home that I left the charger for my camera in the room. (ARGGGGHHH!!!!) Valle from the front desk was very helpful and coordinated with housekeeping to get it back for me. Good job Valle! In summary: I would have given this property an \"Average\" rating but it will get a \"Very Good' because of Valle's efforts to get my charger back.

So be aware, rush hour can be intense, therefore you may need to add some time if you have a distance to travel. This place is very clean, very new, expertly staffed, and has awesome rooms. Room 407 is a fantastic top floor suite with wrap around deck, if you are going for a romantic trip I would suggest requesting it (I'm not sure how I ended up in it). The hotel restaurant, Lola, is very good, and Archipielago is across the square. Ponce is a metropolitan city, so it is loud and busy. Also the cathedral in the square can wake you up in the morning; I would suggest a room as far West within the building they can give you. Be aware that Monday and Tuesday are the unofficial weekend for the entertainment industry in the town, so many restaurants, many bars, and some shops will all be closed for those days. The complementary breakfast is bare bones, but adequate, and the coffee does the trick. I don't know much about the nightlife around, but the two bars near the hotel I passed on the way back after a long day were packed. There is also valet parking with an entrance on the North end of the building. If valet is not your thing (I hate it), you can circumvent the process by finding the garage by entering from the alley in the West end of the building (off of Calle Mendez Vigo (a one way road bearing only north), and just before you get to Calle Reina Isabel). I do not know what this place costs, however I would come back here on my own dime with my wife, regardless of cost for a night. I say only for a night because the beaches in the South are not great, and I am not particularly into city life, but this is worth experiencing once in a while.

The ONLY negative thing I have to say about our stay was that the stained glass on the windows and doord does allow some light into the room at night, but the bed was so comfortable we didn't mind.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cBest thing about Ponce!\u201d", "Author": "Ange_from_cheshire", "ReviewID": "UR52670989", "Content": "In this weird and less than wonderful town where the only thing to really see is the main plaza, this hotel is a real gem.

I asked to speak to the general manager to address the situation and they told me they they did not have one, only an assistant general manager. What hotel does not have a general manager? Apparently this one!!!! After two days asking for the assistant manager which never shows up, I just quit looking for her.

I stayed with my husband and our 7 years old son. We picked this one, because we were attending my friends wedding and they gave her a special price due to a large group that made reservations at this \"newly open dump\". You made look at nice pictures of this hotel. but dont let this fool you. First, we were not able to checked in at the designated time because the toilet of our room was clog. Then when we finally made it to the room we notice that there were foot marks on the room floor, as if it was never moped. Then there were hairs everywhere the place :(. I found some hair pins on top of one of the tables. Then the toilet was still clog and no one was around to fix it. The wedding was the same day of the checked in and I dont even know how we ever were able to get ready in time after all this!! There is another situation with this dumpster, the contruction of this place is real chip that you can even hear every little sound from the next door rooms. Then the location is real bad. This place is located at the corner of a well transited street in the center of the town. Every little noise from out side, even the one from cars going by the street you were able to hear ten times louder than if you were actually in the street. So, this will not be a good place for a good night sleep. We were all unable to sleep when we return from the wedding that night. The people of the room next door were soo loud the administration almost called the cops on them. Then we were moved at 2:30 am to another room that was supposed to be better, but it was actually worst than the first one. The next day we packed our stuff and decided to stayed at the Ponce Hilton and casino which is a very good hotel with amazing service and comodities. Finally, all I can suggest you is to avoir staying at the Ramada Hotel, it was our very worst hotel experience ever!!!!!", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ramada Ponce Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g147323-d1519578-Reviews-Ramada_Ponce_Hotel-Ponce_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$109 - $137*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Reina</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Downtown Across Main Plaza</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ponce</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00731</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1519578", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/88/62/88628f02ece20e3b9e99ec03433256b25large.jpg"}}
