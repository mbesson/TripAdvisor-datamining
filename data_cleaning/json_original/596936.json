{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Best of all the hotels in our trip! We stayed in a few hotels during our week that stretched from Ciudad Juarez, to Cuernavaca and then Mexico City. There is a shuttle to and from the airport, even if you just want to go to the airport to shop! There is transportation between the two terminals, either a bus for 5 pesos or a tram that operates from 3am to 11pm daily for ticketed passengers. The hotel itself has a nice business center and small conference room, and the staff is very polite! Also was impressed with the items in the bathroom... shampoo AND conditioner, a shaving kit, and dental kit, and glycerin soaps. We were very impressed! For the cost, compared to what we spent elsewhere, it was perfect!", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR452013394", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "fleurdelis98"}, {"Content": "What a dump OK, booked a room with specific requests that are offered by the hotel, got none of our requests (king size bed, smoking, etc).

This hotel is clean and modern. We slept well as rooms are quiet. Be aware - THERE IS NO SHUTTLE TO TERMINAL TWO - which means if you arrive via Continental, AeroMexico or others - you are on your own. There is no notice on the website for this, and after contacting Ramada International and the hotel itself, we were forced to pay $20 roundtrip for a taxi. The hotel says it does not have permission yet to run the shuttle to terminal two, which I understand. Yet, they should make an arrangement in the interim. We chose this hotel due to its proximity to the airport, and the free shuttle. If you are arriving to terminal two, the Sheraton Centro Historico runs about the same for a taxi, and has a pool.", "Date": "Apr 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR154717975", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "jesandmimi"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel I stayed here for one night because I wanted a hotel close to the airport in order to meet up with fellow travelers who were arriving the next day. After arriving at the airport from DFW, I found the hotel representative with no problem (she was holding a Ramada sign). I was told to look for the hotel's shuttle at door #4 or door #6 in Terminal 1, and I found the lady holding the sign at door #6. She checked her list and found my name and told me the shuttle would be here in about 10 minutes. It actually took 30 minutes for the shuttle to arrive, but the trip to the hotel was only about 3 minutes. It's very close - just across the street - but not safe to walk - especially at night - so by all means take the free shuttle. I found the front desk staff very friendly and helpful, as was the shuttle driver, bell hop, bartender, and wait staff in the dining area. Breakfast was the only meal that I had and it was very good. The room was very quiet, clean, and comfortable. The only complaint I have, which is a minor, is that the light bulbs in the room seemed a little dull - like they needed to be a higher wattage. I like a bright room, not mood lighting. I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone who wants a place close to the airport., and yes I would stay here again.", "Date": "Mar 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR723338989", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "meauxb"}, {"Content": "highly recommended Great hotel if you need to stay overnight at DF. good breakfasts, comfy beds, super clean and modern rooms, very cool shower floor! good price, too.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR302807850", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "fonk24"}, {"Content": "Excellent for the airport Very clean, comfortable and convenient hotel for airport.
