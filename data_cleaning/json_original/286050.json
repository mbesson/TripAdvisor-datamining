Less than 20 meters from the Damrak street, and yet in a quiet location. The rooms where clean and very comfortable. We had a room on the front side of the hotel and the noise was minimal. TV worked and had english channels and the shower room was more than adequate and clean. I would defiantly recommend. We didn't have a breakfast there so can't judge but there is some very nice bakery's and cafe's round the corner. If you are going to stay in Amsterdam center and only looking to spend a small amount of money you shouldn't expect anything amazing but this out lived our expectations in all ways.

I will agree with some of the reviewers that the hotel can get very noisy due to its location. We did, however, stay in a room with a window overlooking the main street, so it was kind of expected. The people at the front desk are very easy going (we missed the checkout by two hours and they did not charge us extra, despite the busy season) and they were very accomodating. They've got a great little bar and will sit and drink with you as well. August is one of Amsterdam's busiest seasons- so we paid 95 euros a night (did not include breakfast). And the price was good, considering some hotels were going for 300-400 euros a night. Word the wise- the stairs are very very steep (so if you've got a broken leg or have problems climbing up places, someone is going to have to literally carry you up because their elevators are non-existant).

We didn't eat breakfast there so can't comment on the food but what we LIKED about tghe hotel is as follows:- * It had a fab location and couldn't have been in a better spot - it was a few minutes walk from the train station (for getting to/fron the airport), a few minutes walk from Dam Square, right on the canal just metres from the canal cruiseboats ticket offices and right in the heart of the red light/bar/club/restaurant/coffeeshop district. * It was clean and comfortable and had a television in the room, a nice view with big windows that open out to a \"balcony\". * It had a bar downstairs in reception and a few little outdoor tables - perfect for ending the night with a nightcap before going to bed. * The sdtaff were friendly, English speaking and helpful. *One of the staff owned a dog who slept on the pavement outside the hotel in the mornings and it was a pleasure to see her each day as we came out of the hotel (we missed out three dogs while we were away so seeing this dog put a smile on our face each morning). Now for thing we didn't like about the hotel:- * The room we were given was very small. You had to climb over the bed to get to the television and window - this wasn't aproblem for us as we use hotels only to sleep and store out things and we spend most of the days/nights on holiday outside exploring, but I woukldn't recommend this hotel if you want something more from your room then just somewhere to get a kip as it was so small. * There was no air conditioning in the room. We went in late June and there was a heatwave in the city for the three days we were there. Having no air con in the tiny rom made it suffocatingly hot. Even of a night with the large windows wide open it was too hot and having air con would have made out stay at the hoptel more comfortable. * The noise - the hotel is located right next door to a cafe and across the street from a busy bar/club and very close to many other bars and clubs. When the window was shut the noise was not that loud (we could hear chatting and music etc but only quite low and not enough to be intrudive to sleep). However, as explained above, when we stayed at the hotel the city was in a heatwave and, because there was no air con in the room, sleeping with the window shut was simply impossible. We HAD to open the window to make some attempt to coool us down but when the window wass open the noise was very loud. It didn't bother me as I quiet like that kind of noise to fall asleep to (chatting/laughing, cars, music etc) but my husband found it difficult to drift off. * The price. We found this hotel on a hotel website and it was advertied at 200 Euros for three nights. This was a very good rate for a hotel so centrally located in the city and it is why we booked the hotel. However, when we checked in, we were told the price on check out would be 220 euros. When we asked what the extra 20 euros was for, the guy mumbled something about city tax and didn't elborate even when questioned. We grudfgingly accepted this but the worst was when we actually checked out and came to pay. A different member of staff was on the reception then and she said our total for the room was 235 euroes - yet a further 15 euros increase! So the price went from 200 euros to 220 eurosd andf finally up to 235 euros! Considering we didn't eat breakfast and we had no mini bar in the room we were not pleased that we had to shell out hidden costs - it felt a lot like we were being deliberately ripped off! Overall, I would say that if you want somewhere in a great location to all the attractions of Amsterdam and you aren't bothered about sleeojng in a small room, then this is a great hotel. But bear in mind that if you go during summer there isn't any air con and the window being open is noisy. Also, make sure you know what price you are paying before they try to con more money out of you.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel, awesome location\u201d", "Author": "AnEnglandTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR112606796", "Content": "We stayed here for three nights.

However, due to the weariness of traveling, the late hour that I checked in, trying to get my bearings, getting over a cold, and figuring that all accommodations in Amsterdam were pretty much the same, I stayed. This hotel really soured my experience in Amsterdam, though. Again, my fault for not checking out and finding something else. I just stayed here for 5 nights in late Nov., the first few days of Dec. of this year, ('08.) Another poster said to call this a hostel, and advertize it as such, and I'm afraid they were right. It does not look like the picture on their website. Yes, the stairs are exactly like TA's pictures & like everybody else said. I'm up for adventure, & I realize that most everywhere in Amsterdam has stairs probably similar to this, but it felt like crawling up a ladder, to the point that I felt trapped several stories up & dreaded going down those stairs again. To be fair, the hotel is in a good location, just around the corner from the Red Light District. And around another corner and across the street to tour offices where you can meet their buses & take their tours. It is also a 5-7 minute walk to the main train station. Across from this station is where you catch the canal boat tours, as well. Also, it was not \"youth hostel-like\" in regards to a shared bathroom. It did have a TV in the corner of wall, near the ceiling; and it had a crisp down comforter/duvet, with down pillows; and they did come to clean, (although it did not feel very clean, except for the bathroom.) The room itself was tiny. Small does not bother me, as a huge part of traveling overseas for me is the charm of everything & the difference of things. But this hotel just rubbed me wrong in every way. Other hotels that I have stayed in, namely in Italy, had tiny rooms. However, they were clean, with amenities, & overall just very nice. This hotel just felt like a rip-off! I try not to take into account the Euro to the USD, but I paid the equivalent of 100 USD for this place that I felt was not worth it. After being fair about the good parts of this hotel, here goes the bad. There were no pictures on the walls of any sort, just a lot of scratches, & what appeared to be dirt or scrapes on the lower part of the walls. The walls themselves looked like someone needed to climb those \"ladder stairs\" with several cans of paint & put a few layers on the walls to spruce it up. Next, my booking said that there was a wake-up call available. This is usually not a big deal, but there were no amenities whatsoever at this hotel. No alarm clock. No telephone. And, I'm sure the girls at the bar were not going to climb 3 flights of stairs to wake up their guests. (My alarm clock stopped working & I had to search all over Amsterdam for a new one.) There was no end table, just a table in front of a mirror, with 2 stools pushed underneath it. I used one stool for an end table and wiped it with wet tissue paper, which came out black. Yuck! The other stool literally looked like it had a streak of dried vomit on it. Double yuck! There was also what looked like a streak of some kind of dried fluid, drink or some sort that dripped down the inside of the closet. The carpet was brown & just seemed dirty. Although I saw the girl with a vacumm, it just seemed like it needed to be ripped up & hardwood flooring put in. There was a safe in the closet as advertized, which I did not use. And a strange, almost industrial-like garbage can in the corner next to the door, which seemed dirty. It had a donut-type hole where you put your garbage in, which just seemed like it needed a good scrubbing. The shower got water out the door onto the brown carpet. So then it seemed like a dirty, wet carpet. A couple of days into my stay, I finally figured out how to arrange the shower curtain to be lower & hence try not to get the water out of the shower, as much. There were no drinking glasses, no tea/coffee, hot water kettle, no internet services. None of these things do I expect. However, I have stayed at places for a lot less that were wonderful, that you felt like you were on vacation and not \"slumming it,\" and offered such abovementioned things, which just made the stay pleasant and pleasurable. Not at the Frisco Inn. Maybe if I would have paid someting like 35 Euro, it would have seemed tolerable and somewhat worth it. Also, maybe if they would have advertized truthfully, then I would have know what I was getting myself into? I figure that it is just possible that Amsterdam is expensive, like Switzerland, and does not offer value for your $. So be it. At least advertize as such, so that the consumer can make an educated decision. I don't know. I do know that this hotel really soured my experience there and made me really mad. From the get go, they charged my credit card the minute I arrived. Very strange. And not normal. I stayed at 6 other hotels in the timespan of this trip & every single one of them did not charge my card until the end. Only one put a hold on my card for the amount. Other normal hotels also have front desk clerks 24 hours. This hotel seemed like they were \"double dipping\" with the bar attendents hanging out having no concern for their guests. The day that I checked out & waited for my airport pick-up one of the bar gals asked if I would like something to drink. When I said yes, tea please, I was given a tea bag and hot water for 2 euro! I think the whole thing just made me mad. The bar was empty, with 3 bartenders, two on their off shift, making themselves different drinks, coffee, etc. & they couldn't even offer a guest something. (Again, other hotels that want to provide value & a service to their guests, lo and behold, have even offered breakfast with their rooms!) My feeling about Amsterdam is that most people just go there to party. At least in this section of the town. It seemed like why should the Frisco Inn provide any sort of service, if people staying there are just going to get drunk & high? It's just my opinion. On the bright side, I enjoyed the hop-on, hop-off canal cruises, the Anne Frank House, the Rjkmuseum, the Rembrant House, the Van Gogh museum, and a tour outside of the city. However, there's got to be better accommodations for the price. I would stay away from the Frisco Inn, unless you get a really good deal, and you are aware that it is just a bed & a private bath, & not much else.", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location\u201d", "Author": "Cheeky79", "ReviewID": "UR22009072", "Content": "We absolutely loved our stay at this hotel.

The room was spotlessly clean, and despite overlooking the street, and having a bar on the main floor, was much quieter than expected. The only drawback was the stairs. Being on the top floor, there were several flights to navigate, but it was not that big of a deal. Luckily we travel with backpacks, but if you were hauling a lot of luggage around, it might be difficult. However, most small Amsterdam hotels have the same situation. The bar was very convenient if you want to pop in for a quick drink or two (or more) and the hotel seems to be run mostly by Brits. So English is always the native tongue. They even serve an English Breakfast in the morning. Most of Amsterdam is easily walkable, and while we weren't there for the nightlife, it is within easy reach of the hotel. For the price of accomodations in Amsterdam, the Frisco offers great value for the money, and the location is perfect. Regardless of if you are there for the culture and architecture or if you are there for the nightlife, and \"coffee shops\", this hotel offers a great base for both.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNice and Clean\u201d", "Author": "JoshNL", "ReviewID": "UR21485294", "Content": "Very central..

To get an idea of what these stairs are truly like, think Napoleonic ship and you'll have it! We never spend a lot of money on hotels as it's not the hotel room that we travel to see, it's the area...BUT...there are limits! The room we had was at the back of the hotel and small to say the least. There were an assortment of various lights both in the ceiling and the walls...one wall light was hanging off (rather dangerously with the switch smashed to reveal bare wires) and the other only worked if you banged the wall next to it (loose wiring). Opening the window we were almost floored by the intense smell of hash that came in....I KNOW that Amsterdam is a smokers haven but Sheesh, you should be able to get away from it in your own hotel room! Turned out that the A/C unit from the 'coffee shop' that backs on to the hotel (a whole 7 feet apart) vents right outside the window. So, good for a free high but not so good if you actually want to be able to remember your trip! The bed sheets were torn, the linen was decidedly greyish, the whole place gave an air of 'grubby'. Sound insulation between rooms was non existant and the wall had a huge crack running down it. 'Housekeeping' seemed to think it necessary to rouse the whole hotel at 8:30am each morning, regardless of whether you were checking out that day or not. Personally I go on holiday to be a lazy person and NOT get up at the normal time, especially after a late night. Not that there was much evidence of any actual 'housekeeping'....all that was done to our room in the 3 days that we were there was that 'housekeeping' opened the window....after we had purposely closed it to keep our posessions safe (see next paragraph). Smoking in the room was allowed as long as you opened the window. Well that's all very well but when you can almost touch the window of the building that is back to back with the hotel it's not so good. I don't want to be staring into other people's windows and I'm sure they don't want to be looking at me first thing in the morning! To me it was also a bit of a security risk to leave the window open when we were out of the room given that the buildings were so close. The 'safe' in the wardrobe lost it's code over and over...not that the code was much good anyway as you could clearly see the screwdriver hole for the code override. Would I go there again.....NO....90 euros a night is WAY too much for this type of accomodation, even in the city centre. Call it a hostel and advertise as such and it'd be more accurate.

Our room was clean, small (by North American standards...but certainly big enough for the two of us) and simply (but nicely) decorated.

Since it was a Monday and check-in was delayed by an hour while all the rooms were cleaned, we were allowed to leave our bags at the bar while we explored for a bit.

They're not a big deal...just be careful if you'll be stumbling back from the coffee shops, and maybe leave the wheelie suitcase at home :) When we checked out Tuesday morning, we weren't due to catch our train out of Amsterdam until the evening and wanted to spend the day exploring the city. Once again, the friendly lady behind the bar let us leave our bags there all day. We were no longer guests, and it was very kind of her to extend that courtesy. I doubt many places would.

We checked in (in the bar) and were given a room key each (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 deposit for each key) and told where the rooms were and how to use the key cards in the doors. To get to the rooms, use the door to the right of the door into the bar. We were then met by the dreaded steps of Amsterdam. With bags/suitcases this is an absolute ball ache, you really have never seen stairs so steep. After the first time you go up them it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem so bad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I suppose you mentally prepare your self for the climb. When we got to the room, it was better than I expected, although if you stay in a triple room, make sure your not the last up the stairs as you will get the mattress without a bed (not too much of a drama for us, the hotel was just somewhere to sleep for one night). The room its self was quite big, had a comfy sofa and coffee table \u00e2\u20ac\u201c basic really but sound for the amount of time we spent in the room. The shower wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most powerful but it always had hot water when I used it.

The main problem with the hotel itself is the stairs. Another small problem is how far away the closest tram stop is, for some reason there is no tram stop between Central Station and the Dam on the Rokin tram line so theres always going to be a bit of a walk getting to the hotel.

It was actually my Dad who recommended the hotel to me, as he'd been to Amsterdam in November 2005 with all his mates for his 50th - he loved it, and so did I. I went with my boyfriend, so it goes to show the hotel suits people of all ages. He's going back there this year and we wouldn't hesitate to return either. BOOKING: We contacted the hotel directly to book, and they got back to us really quickly. They do need a card number to book (you don't have to pay til you get there, just confirmation), but they gave us the option of calling them if we'd like, if we didn't feel comfortable giving card details over e-mail. I e-mailed a few days before to re-confirm our stay, something which I do at every hotel, and all was well. LOCATION: We caught the train from Schiphol Airport to Centraal Station (much better & cheaper than getting a taxi), and from here it was just a 5 minute walk to the hotel and it was really easy to find. Walk from the station, straight up Damrak past all the tour boats in the dock, and on the first turning left you will see a property decorated in green (glows green if you arrive at night) called The Grasshopper, turn down here and you will see Frisco Inn facing you. It was so easy to find! CHECK-IN: You go to the bar underneath Frisco Inn to check-in and a really friendly guy will give you your swipe card, and explain to you how everything works, and then you pay him. It was really easy and all the staff speak fluent English, so no language barriers there. FIRST IMPRESSIONS: When we walked up to the Frisco, we were quite impressed - it seemed very clean from the outside even and the bar and staff were very nice. We noticed the hotel next door was boarded up (see photo), maybe some kind of renovation going on, but this did not affect us in any way during our holiday. Also this was April 2006, it might not even be boarded up anymore. THE HOTEL: You enter the actual hotel through another door next to the door for the bar (You don't go into the bar to get to the hotel) and you have to use your swipe card to get in, which is excellent for safety. We had to laugh when we saw the stairs (see photos) behind the front door - oh my, they're steep! It was a hoot trying to get our luggage up them, not so much if we'd had bigger suitcases I guess! They looked more like a ladder than some stairs. Unless the Hotel has put in a lift in it's new renovation, I can safely say this hotel is not for the less mobile! The rest of the stairs were better (see photos) but nonetheless scary, especially after a couple of drinks! We didn't mind though - it made the hotel more authentic... it would be a shame if they've taken them away during the renovation. The hotel itself was really nice, and really clean. THE ROOM: We were really suprised at the room - everything felt so fresh and clean. The bed was really comfortable and the sheets were crisp and clean, we had enough bedding and pillows. There were a few goodies in the room, like a free lighter and some leaflets for local attractions. There's a TV with a remote control that you can watch in bed, and lots of English channels to choose from i.e. we watched Eastenders once whilst getting ready to go out. There are blackout blinds in the room which are so effective, almost too effective! We got a front facing room with a really nice view over Damrak, however we didn't hear any outside noise throughout our stay. You are allowed to smoke in the room, this didn't make a difference to us as we don't smoke, as long as you open the windows. The room also has a hairdryer and a free electronic safe, which we found very useful during our stay. The room was neither hot or cold, but just the right temp. BATHROOM: The bathroom was soooo clean, and the shower was very roomy - not an ordinary shower cubicle but more like a mini-wet room with a shower installed. There was shampoo/showergel there if you wanted to use it, and we had plenty of towels. THE BAR: The bar was really nice and cosy, and had a lot of selection. You are allowed to smoke in the bar. The bar has a 'quiz' machine and a pool table, which we made good use out of when we came home in the evenings. I don't recall what time the bar closes, but we went to bed before it closed every night so it must have been quite late. They do offer breakfast and snacks here (not included in hotel price) but we didn't eat here. GETTING TO OTHER ATTRACTIONS FROM THE FRISCO INN: We practially walked everywhere to where we wanted to go, except when we caught the tram to Heinekenplein which is just a couple of minutes away from the hotel. It's within walking distance of the [--] Museum which is just on Damrak, Madame Tussads which is on Dam Square, the Canal Tour Boats on Damrak, Anne Frank Huis, Amsterdam Dungeons, and just around the corner from the infamous Red Light District. There are some great restaurants (an awesome Argentinian Steakhouse springs to mind) and a few Cafes in proximity. There is a great little bakery next to the Grasshopper that does an awesome 'pizza hotdog'! CHECKING-OUT: Checking out is at 10am and was really straightforward. We didn't think there would be anywhere to keep our luggage (but we didn't ask either) and so we decided to store it in the lockers at Centraal Station, not bad value but *remember* to have the correct change as the lockers won't accept notes, and remember to write the codes down. OVERALL: The Frisco Inn was a really great hotel at a great value, and we were amazed at how close we were from everything. We were practically on Damrak, and just around the corner from the Red Light District, and many famous cafes. It was really clean and the staff were really friendly. It was really handy having a bar beneath the hotel for a nightcap. ROOM: 5/5 VALUE: 5/5 LOCATION: 5/5 STAFF: 5/5 OVERALL: 5/5 (For the price, great hotel!) BAD POINTS: There was a smell of cannabis constantly in the hotel - the Hotel had annoying guests who kept smoking without opening the window in their room, which also kept setting off the smoke alarm. However this wasn't really the fault of the hotel and they did keep warning them to open their window when smoking. GOOD POINTS: Everything else! WOULD WE RETURN?

It's clean, friendly and right in the middle of the action being on the edge of the red light district and close to Dam square. It's also a stones throw from Centraal station. The Frisco inn offers great value for money, nice en-suite rooms, comfortable beds, a nice bar that offers good food,good beer and a happy atmosphere with friendly staff. What more could you want? I would recommend the hotel to groups of lads ( and lasses ) who want to stay for a short break. But I wouldn't recommend it to the elderly or infirm because of the very steep steps up to the rooms ( which is quite common in Amsterdam hotels ). A word of caution to first timers to Amsterdam.Watch out for lads who pounce on you as you come out of the station offering you cheap accommodation,We fell for this one once and was shown some right dumps. These guys work on tips, so when you add this to the cost of the room you are paying just as much if not more than the Frisco inn or similar.
