This motel was built during the depression in the 30s so the rooms are small, the tilework in the bathrooms looks original. The positives - it's clean, the landscaping is very nice, the price is good, the location within walking distance of SF Zoo and close to Golden Gate Park and parking is free. Our room was small, a bedside lamp on only one side of the bed. An alcove and curtain for the closet. Small flat screen TV on dresser. Small bathroom, no kleenex in the room or bathroom. They did have a hair dryer but there was no clock. We borrowed one from the office. The management seemed very nice. Other people mentioned it was quiet and there isn't a lot of city noise or lots of people around. However, they provide earplugs free of charge because one of the streecar lines ends here and makes a racket as it turns and goes right by the motel. I had also reserved a room for my son and his family, two adults, two teens and an under 2 year old. The motel had mentioned a kitchenette so I thought perfect. I might have misunderstood because there was only a mini fridge and a microwave. They did have two double beds in separate areas and it was a tiny more spacious than our room. It was on the second floor up really steep stairs. The streetcar noise was worse than in their room so they did take advantage of the free earplugs. There is a nice little coffee shop around the corner and another larger restaurant around the corner in the opposite direction. We had lunch at the Java Beach Cafe and breakfast at the other place. Actually, the breakfast was tasty although the place is old, worn and a little depressing. I've stayed at worst places and possibly I was hopeing it would be quaint. I seriously doubt we would stay here again.

I found the place by accident because I was looking for hotels in San Francisco on an online site and someone happened to mention this place in their review of another. What a find! This place is 'old school' a family owned place that only accepts reservations over the phone. The owner and his wife gave us a discount since the weather was supposed to be somewhat gloomy/cold when we visited, though it turned out to be fantastic weather anyway. We stayed in a room with two beds and a full kitchen (yes a real kitchen with a stove/oven, fridge, microwave, coffee maker and sink that was perfect for our little family. The only drawback to the room was the floor heater (though authentic for the time period it was built) since at the time our daughter wasn't always walking, but she couldn't crawl on it so we just shut the heater off and it turns out we didn't really need it on anyway. The hotel has free (that's right in San Francisco, across from the zoo and a couple blocks from the beach!) parking, that was nice after a long drive there and playing all day to just come back and relax (and have a place to put left overs :)). We were able to walk to the SF Zoo and to Ocean Beach. We also went to nearby Golden Gate Park and took our daughter to the awesome playground they have there (sadly the carousel was closed). The folks at Ocean Park also gave us the names of a bunch of family friends restaurants nearby, as well as a nearby store and laundry since when you have little kiddo you sometime need both.

We are a family with younger kids vacationing in SF for a week. The Ocean Park Motel was a great option for us. Here are the pros and cons: Pros: --Clean, safe, and ample parking. --Our room had a fully functioning kitchen (not sure if they all do), but the full sized fridge and gas stove allowed us to make breakfast in and pack lunches most days, and offered a good place to store leftovers,etc. --Is 10 yards from a MUNI trolley that goes directly downtown (no need to switch and trolleys were very frequent) --Within walking distance of the Zoo, the beach, and a good cafe and pizza place. --Easy to drive most places from here and very easy to find/get to. Cons: --Very loud. That trolley I mentioned is convenient, but also goes directly by the building, and if you have young kids it can keep them up/wake them up the first couple of nights. --WiFi is totally unreliable. With our smartphones this wasn't a huge issue, but if you are in any way planning on relying on the WiFi, don't. --Little small. This is a good spot to come back to at the end of the day after dinner, and get up an go in the morning, but if you think you'll be spending any significant amount of time in the rooms, just be advised they're small. Our rooms didn't have desks or anything like that and no real space for kids toys or anything like that (although the kitchen had a 2-person table).

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t settle on our final trip dates until the weekend before and were understandably confronted with few affordable options in San Francisco for the 4th of July weekend. We \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdiscovered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the Ocean Park Motel on TripAdvisor and immediately contacted them to see if they could accommodate us. Marc got back to us right away and told us that he could get us in if we were flexible. He was able to get us into a 2-queen kitchen unit for the Saturday night stay and then we moved into a 3-queen family suite for the final two nights. We really enjoyed both rooms. The first room was a little small for ourselves and our 3 young girls, but we loved the full kitchen. There was only one thing that was very tough for me. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 6\u00e2\u20ac\u21222 and the bathroom was about the size of a postage stamp; my knees hit the sink when \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcusing the facilities.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Overall, though, the room fit our needs very well. We missed the full kitchen when we moved to the larger room, but the additional space in the bedroom and bathroom area more than made up for it. I preferred the location on the second floor as it felt somewhat more private and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspecial.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The mini-fridge was actually a fairly large one and all of our cold items fit easily. The location was terrific. The motel is only 2 blocks from the beach and 2 blocks from the zoo. The cafes on Sloat Blvd. are very close and very high quality. If public transit is needed, well, the L Taraval train runs right out front. The parking lot is small, but we never had any problem finding an open space for our minivan. The motel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kids play area was really cute and very very San Franciscan. Watching my kids play there reminded me of my time growing up in San Francisco! The staff was great. When we arrived, we were greeted with a smile and given a great information sheet that came with recommendations for local walks and dining options and personal reviews from the staff to help guide us. They moved our luggage from our first room to the second room for us and we never had any problems to report to them. There are a couple of things that people should be aware of when booking rooms. The larger 3-queen suite has only 1 TV and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the room with 2 queen beds in it. I think most families will put their kids in there, which means that the parents will be left without a TV to watch when their kids are asleep. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconvenient, but not a dealbreaker by any means. Also the second floor is reached by narrow steep stairs with a curve. Disabled or less-able individuals may find this difficult to deal with. If neither of these minor issues bothers you then the Ocean Park Motel is a terrific option.

One bed was used for luggage.The dresser had a broken drawer, the TV was place in a such a position that you had to cock your head to observe the screen The closet which contained a microwave and refrigerator set on a board had no light in it. I used a flash light. The only chair was stuck in a corner of the room well away from the TV. No desk/table or chairs, the telephone was not operating, there was no alarm clock in the room. In addition a lamp came apart when I turned it on, the wall heater next to the bed made noise all night. I requested a TV guide and was told to use the \"guide button\" on the TV control. Had a hard time finding local news, the golf channel and CNN and Fox news and other programs. Had to scribe thru 100 channels to find what I was looking for. Parking was available but crowded, especially when a small moving van blocks an entrance. My recommendation is to remove the queen size bed and install a King size, making space for a desk/table and chairs and maybe add a recliner or two. Purchase a TV stand and end up with a nice size, comfortable room.

The quiet streets are pierced by the braking / turning noise of the transit cars, and you can hear it through ear plugs. If you are a light to moderate sleeper, this may not be the place for you. Some serious low-lifes managed to get a room while we were staying there. Smoking outside, loud talking at three a.m. in the small courtyard, cops, ambulance for the ride to detox, etc. To the owners credit, they did what they could to keep things under control, they were only there for one night, and a carpet cleaning company was seen the next day getting the place back into shape. It was good to see that they cared about the room and the next occupants.

Easy parking, a kitchen, and good public transit are also things I look for in a hotel. And on my most recent trip, I had my dog, so a place that was dog friendly and near the beach was essential. I found all this and more wrapped up in a gorgeous little package at the Ocean Park Motel! The proprietor is as friendly and personable as can be. He and his wife have maintained this GORGEOUS art deco property impeccably, with its lovely gardens and courtyard, beautiful paint job, a great original neon sign (facing out to the street, so not a problem), and festive white lights framing the entryway. I got the sense that there is a wide variety of room setups, some with two rooms, some with one, so I can't speak to all the rooms. However, I was pleased with mine, #6, right at the head of the courtyard. The room was a little small, with just a bed, a dresser (with great cable TV including the digital guide, which you never find in a hotel!), one bedside table, and a small chair. I'd've liked another bedside table with another lamp. The mattress was divine and I slept really, really well. The kitchen was totally cute, and came with everything you'd need, though no mugs to go with the coffeemaker (just small disposable cup things). There was a table with two chairs in the kitchen. The bathroom was really big with a nice shower. No hairdryer, FYI. There was also a really big closet which was great for storing stuff, though it could use a light for finding stuff! The property also has a hottub, though I never had time to use it. The location is, in my opinion, great. It's a block off Sloat, so it's really very quiet. It's just a block from the ocean, which is great. There's a great coffee shop a block away as well. The best part is that the L Taraval streetcar line picks up right by the hotel, so you wouldn't need to drive much at all! (But if you do, there's ample, easy parking.) The zoo is also right by the hotel, across Sloat. I would definitely stay here every time I come to SF.

The location of the OP is perfect if you like to walk and during the week I was there I walked to the Harding Park Golf Course - site of the 2009 President's Cup Matches, The SF Zoo is across the street, Fort Funston - great if you have a dog, Golden Gate Park - spectacular in every way and, of course, the beach that's only 2 short blocks away.

Mark put the 'Closed' sign in the window and drove me to the airport himself, apoligizing for the lack of service by the Super Shuttle even though he was not affiliated with them in anyway.

Staying there is one of the highlights of my visit, and something I always look forward to. I recently had the opportunity to visit The Ocean Park in the company of my husband and teenage daughter when we drove up to San Francisco for a concert, which gave me the opportunity to experience more of the motel's amenities (and to see it through the eyes of my family, who had often heard me express my pleasure in the motel), which gives a fresh perspective, so on the advice of my husband, I'm writing another review. I had reserved a room with a queen bed and a twin, but was pleasantly surprised when we arrived to find that we'd been upgraded to one of the motel's small suites, with two queen beds, a full bath, a kitchenette and a dining room. As soon as we stepped into the room, my husband said \"wow...I'm impressed!\" I have to admit, I was too...I've always stayed in one of the smaller single queen rooms on the courtyard, which are lovely and comfortable, but small...this room was HUGE by motel standards! A small dining area branched off the main/sleeping room, connecting to a nice little kitchen that was better-equipped than any other self-catering accommodation I've stayed in. The bathroom featured a tub as well as a shower, with the deco styling I expect from The Ocean Park. The decor throughout was tasteful and attractive, featuring the diagonal wood paneling that is a hallmark of the motel, set off by soft peach and cream accents. We had plenty of time before we needed to get downtown for our concert, so my daughter immediately set off to enjoy the hot tub (which she says is \"really nice!\"), while my husband settled down for a nap, and I took the opportunity to read through the hand-outs they give you when you check in. I really wish more hotels/motels did this kind of thing! There was an extensive list of area restaurants, categorized by type, with directions how to get to each (including information on parking and public transit for those that weren't withing walking distance), directions via public transit to major tourist attractions, an area map, and even a suggested city tour using public transit that would hit the major tourist attractions in San Francisco. Speaking of public transit, a lot has been said here about the L-Taraval streetcar, which runs directly in front of The Ocean Park. Yes, it's there, and yes...if you're sensitive to such sounds, it can be noisy (it has never bothered me, even during this most recent stay, when we were in a room right on 46th...and my husband snoozed happily through several passes of the streetcar that afternoon). That said, it only runs until midnight. After that, the L line becomes a regular city bus, which is considerably quieter than the streetcar, and which only comes by a few times during the night. If a bus going by is going to bother you, you're unlikely to be happy in ANY lodging in San Francisco. But, if you are sensitive to sounds like this, and if you plan to be in bed before midnight, you can always request a room near the back of the motel when you make your reservation. We used the streetcar to get into the city center for our concert at The Fillmore, and it only took us 35 minutes to travel from the motel to Powell Street Station (near Union Square and the Cable Car Turntable) at 5 p.m. on a Friday. That's not bad travel time at all in a city of this size. If you're planning on a late night, you may want to make alternate plans for getting back, however. As I said, the streetcar becomes a bus after midnight, which is slower because it runs entirely on surface streets, and it runs much less frequently (about once an hour). In San Francisco, calling 511 will get you info on when and where you can catch it, but it's not a bad idea to have a city cab company's number on your cell phone, just in case you'd rather not wait. That's not going to be an issue, however, unless you're attending a late-night event. The other motel amenity that has gotten mention here is internet access. I do have to say that it can be pretty spotty. My understanding is that the 1930s construction (the very thing that gives the place much of its charm!) is to blame...some of the materials interfere with wireless reception. I've not been able to receive it in the single rooms. In our suite, my daughter was able to get a good connection with no trouble using her regular, full-size laptop, but my netbook just wasn't able to stay connected. The info they give you on check-in does offer suggestions for maximizing your chance of getting a connection, but if it is absolutely essential that you be able to connect to the internet in your motel room during your stay, this might not be the place for you. That said, a coffee place just up the block also has free wireless, so even if you can't get connected in your room, you're not entirely without recourse. What this all comes down to is that, after four years of staying at The Ocean Park, it remains one of my favorite motels in the world (and I've stayed in a lot of motels!). Unless you really need to be right in the middle of the city; or prefer cookie-cutter, plasticized, chain-motel lodgings; this is, in my opinion, the best place to stay on a budget in San Francisco.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Sunset Discovery\u201d", "Author": "DotgirlBoston", "ReviewID": "UR49133758", "Content": "The Ocean Park motel is the best place to stay in the Sunset area of San Francisco without question.

Rooms: It is hard to beat this motel in terms of value. The hotel rooms are nice and clean - ours was pretty large because that was all that was available on short notice. The bathrooms are on the small side, as this is a historic building. The beds were what you would expect for a motor inn; very clean but not 4-star hotel quality mattresses. The windows are original, so you may here some street noise (our room was toward the back of the hotel). Service: The desk clerk was very friendly, helpful and chatty. He let us know about great places to eat nearby (see below). We only stayed one night, so I can't comment on the quality of the housekeeping. The room was spotless when we arrived. Since this is a motor inn, other service items like a business center, room service, etc. are not provided. On the plus side, having free parking makes all of these short-comings worth it. Hotels in the city center charge an arm and a leg for parking. Location: The motel is located on the L-Taraval MUNI line that goes directly into the city center along Market St. (all the way to the Embarcadero). It is a relatively short walk to the San Francisco Zoo and a medium-length walk to get to the ocean front (bring a sweater!) Some other reviews mentioned the noise from the MUNI line, but I didn't notice. Compared with other cities of similar size, this motel is located in a relatively quiet area. Several blocks away (probably too long to walk) there are a few blocks of cheap, excellent restaurants serving primarily Asian cuisine. Bottom line: The hotel is an outstanding value, located in a relatively quiet residential area of San Francisco. If you have a car, want a low-cost place to stay, and don't mind driving a few minutes to get into the city center, this place is perfect.

The suite was on the garden side, which I would strongly recommend as the tram runs past on the street side, and included two bedrooms with their own access off the hall, and a communal bathroom. The rooms were very nicely finished, clean, comfortable and homely. There were other options which included a kitchenette and seating area, which would have suited parents with children well, but to reach one bedroom, you have to pass through the other. They'll be very happy to assist you in your choice. In our suite we had a fridge, microwave and coffee making facilities. The owners are always on hand to answer questions and offer advice, and are extremely courteous. They provide a helpful compendium of information on arrival with reccomendations for eating, drinking and sightseeing. There is a communal hot tub in a gorgeous sheltered courtyard area. They only give out two keys, so it's likely you will have it to yourself, as we did. They provide extra towels and the temperature is simmering point! Location wise, the Motel looks a little far out from the centre, but the tram runs from across the street and connects throughout the city. You wouldn't need a car to stay here, but there is parking. The beach is just a short walk, great when the weather plays ball, and there are numerous cafes and restaurants in the immediate area to suit all budgets and tastes. The upside of being a little further from the centre is that the area feels safe and friendly, a family neighbourhood. Overall, the Ocean Park Motel is a great choice for a visit to San Francisco, a personal, homely motel with style, lovely owners and a great range of accomodation.

Furthermore, it's not only handy to San Francisco State Univ. and the airport, but within walking distance of the Zoo and the magnificent Pacific Ocean beach. It's easy to forget that the Ocean Park is 70+ years old. My second-floor room was both spacious and cozy; with a warm-colors decor, a flat-screen TV and an amazingly comfortable bed, a clean, bright black-and-white tiled bathroom and a full walk-in closet. Though it's true that there are only a couple walking-distance diners, there are some wonderful neighborhood resturants, including authentic Chinese, and the unique Bashfull Bull Too a short hop (via driving or trolley) away on Taraval.

Our plan was to stay in one place, and go from there to visit central San Francisco by public transport and to spend two or three days touring the Napa Valley and places within easy driving distance from the city by car. We were very pleased that we decided to stay at Ocean Park. We had a room with a kitchen, and the overall cost was US $ 1,232 for 8 nights. (US $ 154 per night) We thought this was a bit expensive, but we did not want to stay in a seedy place, or pay a lot more for a hotel in central San Francisco. With the kitchen facility, it gave us the opportunity to relax, cook, or bring in take-away meals after the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sight-seeing, or go out to a restaurant for that matter. This was a saving and a nice flexible feature in itself.

As other people have commented, Ocean Park is at the end of the Muni L streetcar line, and though it takes a half hour or so to get to downtown San Francisco, one can be always assured of getting a seat going, and if you have the time, can board it back at the other end of the line at Embarcadero station and get a seat on the way back, even in the rush hour. We had a rented car as well, and Ocean Park Motel is very conveniently located for travel by car across the Golden Gate Bridge to Napa valley to the north, or to Santa Cruz and beyond to the south, along the ocean-side highways. Most of downtown San Francisco traffic can be avoided. We were first time visitors to San Francisco from Nova Scotia, Canada.

If you're driving discount this point as the motel offers easy access to the 280 interstate or 101 if you're going up north. The MUNI that passes the front of the motel is pretty noisy so we had requested a back room which was better, however could still hear it at all hours. The owners/grounds were great , owner very helpful and give you a great map of the area/restaurants/etc. The room itself looked nice, however we had real issues with the bathroom as the shower was extremely tempramental and took a good 5 minutes of fiddling to get a constant temparature - not something you want to do each time you shower. Also the toilet / basin were hardwired into the shower as if you used either it would completely throw the temperature you'd so carefully got right out. The bathroom was also VERY small, basically a walk-in toilet with basin and then an alcove for the shower. Overall not bad but I wouldn't stay there again and would advise anyone looking to spend a few days in San Francisco to do some research into closer motels as the commute in is a bit of a hack (27 stops from embarcadero to SF Zoo stop).

Being the first motel in San Francisco, you can't expect the polish of a franchise hotel, or the super smooth edges of the super expensive places. I like the history. Art Deco/Art Nouveau of this place is really charming. The rooms are a little small and awkward. But the beds were super comfortable! I don't sleep that well on my own bed (mostly because the cat walks on my face). It was very clean inside and out. Please do not include the sidewalks outside the establishment. That is city/county responsibility. The muni on rails can be heard on the street from some rooms, which I thought was romantic. It woke me up but it didn't piss me off. And the neighbor garden with all the gnomes! You can only see this from certain rooms, but boy, what a trip! And come on, they have a hot tub. You can walk to the beach and the zoo.

What a fun experience! We had a two room unit with a kitchen - and while it was small, it was charming and just fine. There were two queen beds, a tiny 1920s bathroom and a tiny 1920's kitchen (w/apt. range and 3/4 size refrigerator) that was perfect. My children loved that I could sit at the end of the tiny table and reach EVERYTHING in the kitchen while sitting down! I am sorry to read that a few people had bad experiences here - the comment about a lack of an elevator had me laughing however. Any homework on this hotel would have told you that! :-) Most of the rooms were on the ground floor - and the buildings are actually on a \"campus\" of sorts - some surround a courtyard and are in single story buildings - and some branch off on the same property around the on-site parking and garden area and are two-level buildings. Our unit faced the courtyard which was nice and quiet, and we got a nice breeze when we opened up the kitchen window and the front door. There are even covered parking places (first come first get), although they are old fashioned small carports. If you have a big car, it will be a tight squeeze! They do have a little garden area with a \"playground\" that is really a simple wood play structure with a swing and slide. And it was just fine for two little kids who occasionally wanted to burn off some energy when I just wanted to sit down. The motel is right on the Muni train line (N-Taraval) and a block from the beach and the SF Zoo. There are many fun neighborhood restaurants nearby and a couple of grocery stores within short driving distance (or take the train to 18th and Taraval). There is a killer gelato place (Marco Polo gelato) around 23rd and Taraval (might be off a few blocks) and it has standard and unusual flavors -- all of which are divine! The owners print up a list of recommended restaurants, close-by things to see and do, and services (laundry!). They are kind and nice, and the place is well kept for its age. If you are looking for a place with character in the Sunset, w/easy access to transportation, and a kitchen -- this is a great value for the money.", "Date": "October 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle wa", "Title": "\u201cWhat a dump!!\u201d", "Author": "luv2travel108", "ReviewID": "UR10002614", "Content": "We use tripadvisor all the time, and I don't recall ever seeing such misleading reviews. This place is really dreadful. Art Deco my eye! More like this makes Super 8 look good! You check in outside through a bullet proof cage, haul your luggage up 2 flights of stairs (no elevatiors, of course), and into a room that you can barely turn around in. The refrigerator and coffee maker (broken) are in the closet (no other room for them), The hotel is right in front of where the trolleys turn around so be prepared not to sleep much -- the noise is awful. Not a glass in the place to brush your teeth, no clock, no hairdryer, no desk for a computer (but not to worry, the wireless didn't work most of the time), no food anywhere (not even a vending machine), etc. Everything in the place was old and smelled musty. That we were charged over $120 a night for such an awful place (our room was an \"upgraded one\" even) still infuriates me. Plus the location is awful if you want to go anywhere but to the beach.

The Ocean Park is a great motel for the right kind of folks. The art deco style and beautiful courtyard are refreshing in an age of cookie cutter motels. We had two rooms, which provided plenty of space for our family of five. The owners of the motel are friendly and provide plenty of useful information on check-in. We loved being a couple blocks from the ocean. We could run on the beach after a day of sightseeing or collect sand dollars and watch the sunset. The zoo was about a block away -- we could hear the monkeys in the morning. The motel is located in a neighborhood, which we enjoyed. There was no air conditioning, but the windows opened -- very refreshing. The first stop on the L line was across the street, so it was easy to get into the city. It took us about a half hour to get to Market and Powell, but we enjoyed the trip. Our only issue was with towels -- housekeeping never left enough for five people, so we had to retrieve more from the office. On the last day, they were out of towels.
