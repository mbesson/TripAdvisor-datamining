{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Small, but very cosy, clean and terrific location Stayed in this business hotel from 8 to 10 Dec 2007 in a twin bedroom with my spouse. Size of room is is small, no wardrobe. They provide clothes hangers which are hooked onto a ladder. Writing desk is small as well, and they uses a flat screen TV to maximise whatever little space there is. An advice for couples, i will suggest u opt for two single beds rather a queen sized one. i was glad i did that, as the queen may be a tad too small. There is free internet as well.As mentioned before by other reviewers, bathroom is small and is a fitted modular unit. The toilet comes with the high tech bidet shower, so that is a pleasure. Another piece of advice. If you find the toilet a little too cramp, u can use the toilet at the lobby next to the reception. Its very clean, fitted with bidet and most importantly, spacious. Although the room is small in size, i would say that the rooms are very cosy, clean and well maintained. If you need just a room to sleep in at night, this is the place. you can be sure of clean carpets and simple but yet modern decor. The aircon has the option of heater as well. In my 3 days of stay there, i recall seeing the housekeeper steam the carpet everyday. So that speaks about the cleanliness of the hotel.Good location, as Tokyo Station is just less than 5 mins walk. A few reasonably priced cafes are around the hotel. Starbucks is across the small road, just less than a minute walk away. Lots of convenience stores are sited within 3 mins walk of the hotel. So its really convenient to get small bites around. There is an entrance to the underground shopping arcade just a few steps away from Starbucks, which also leads into the Tokyo station (where u can board the Shinkasen (bullet train) or all local trains within Tokyo metro area)). Lots of eating options and shopping to do in the underground arcade.Daimaru (a huge multi storey departmental store) is sited at the Tokyo Station. Takashimaya, another premium departmental store is about 7 mins walk away.Overall, a very satisfied stay in a very convenient location. As mentioned, rooms are small but if you just need a very clean room to sleep in for the night, then this is the place. If you plan to lounge around the room for half the day, then you might find it a little claustrophobic.One more thing. Their check in time is 1pm. If your flight arrives early and you hope for an early check-in, chances are u may not get it even if your assigned room is vacated early. This is to allow the housekeeping to clean the rooms and common areas (including steaming the carpets) between 11am-1pm. So the earliest you may get the keys to your room is 12.30pm.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR864854068", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "singaporeflyer"}, {"Content": "Yaesu - small but good I stayed at the Yaesu Terminal with my son recently, having booked through the hotel's website. I was very pleased with it. Location is good for those arriving at Tokyo train station - directions on the web site are fine if you follow them. There is a Starbucks, a number of small restaurants and a convenience store within 50 yards and its a very short walk to Takashimaya Department store. (In fact there seemed to be a number of high class shopping areas nearby.) Room was small, as mentioned by others, but very nicely furnished and very clean. Non smoking rooms are available. We stayed in a Twin type B room which was fine for us - I suspect the smaller one (a type A) would be a bit cramped. Rooms have a televsionand a nice, though compact bathroom with all amenities - and the aircon seemed to work fine. Hotel staff were very helpful - loaned us both an umbrella one day when it was raining and we were unprepared. There is a small cafe/restaurant for breakfast (about 10 AUD/1000 yen each) if you so choose. I would definitey stay there again. This is not a luxury hotel but very good for tourists making their own way and not wanting to stay in the big 5 star chains.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR400792366", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jeffm123"}, {"Content": "Great Value Hotel Stayed here twice, once for two days, once overnight. Great location, just across from Tokyo Station down a tree-lined side street. From there, great subway system to everywhere. Small, but nice lobby on second floor. Desk staff friendly and helpful. Rooms have all you need and are spotless, but get ready, they are small, even for Tokyo. There are two cafes nearby. Plus two convenience stores that make tasty ready-to-eat food (which would be awful in the American equivalent). I mention this because the hotel restaurant is pricey. We got rates for under $125/night, so terrific value overall. In New York, this hotel would close to $300/night by the time they slathered on all the taxes.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR883627242", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "F.O.B.-traveler"}, {"Content": "Good rooms Central location       The bathroom", "Date": "Feb 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR107513029", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KJ_Tex_Aggie_83"}, {"Content": "Very small but nice rooms, good location, ok service Pros: Convenient location, simply 3 minute walk from Yaesu North Exit of the Tokyo Station. Rooms are modern, well equipped, spotlessly clean, and quite quiet.Cons: The room is seriously small. I paid an extra 2,000 Yen to get a twin room A (should be bigger than the semi double already) and it was still very small, and I have stayed at various Japanese hotels before. Service just ok for Japan. On check-in, there was hardly a friendly face which was surprising by Japanese standards.Overall: Location cannot be beat. For such a small room and spotty reception of the staff, the rate is a bit high at 14,000+ Yen.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR558766956", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Sammyfloyd"}, {"Content": "Good location, convenient hotel Transitting Tokyo for the Tohoku region, it made sense to stay overnight rather than increase the fatigue. Saw this place on a travel industry website and thought it might be good. Certainly the location (about four minutes from the Yaesu North Exit of Tokyo Station) was a big plus in its favour. Wasn't disappointed - stayed in one of the Type A single rooms and while these are small compared to what most travellers might be used to, they are more than adequately furnished, have Grohe fittings in the bathrooms and are very clean as you would expect from any Japanese hotel room. Given Tokyo hotel rates and its closeness to Tokyo Station, I think the rates are reasonable. Check in is from 1400 hours and check out is 1100 hours. Reservations can be made with the hotel direct via its website - [-]. There are English webpages as well. I would happily stay here again when passing through Tokyo.", "Date": "Dec 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR422819587", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TITraveller"}, {"Content": "Petit mais propre et bien situ\u8305   showReview(21665885, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR472903110", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ScootR47"}, {"Content": "Klein, aber fein!   showReview(20685652, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR246710785", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ChristelBerlin"}, {"Content": "Pratique et impeccable   showReview(10234237, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR236387906", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "charutaud"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d619181-r12145826-Yaesu_Terminal-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "619181", "Price": "$207"}}
