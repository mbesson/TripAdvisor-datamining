Sure enough turned up having carried cases over Rialto bridge - no mean feat but we were prepared- only to be given the usual bluff \"owing to problems beyond our control ...... plumbing.... moved to another of our buildings 15 minutes away\" . So we waited to be taken to \"other building\" turned out to be the Hotel San Moise on the other side of the Grand canal in San Marco. We were told to make up for the inconvenience we would be placed in a superior room, if that was the case I do not know what a good room looks like . At top of hotel up 2 flights of stairs and then when room door opened more stairs, stained carpet, light hanging by a thin wire above head tatty unpainted shutters and mosquitoes. There is quirky and there is grubby and down at heel. This was the latter. On a positive note very near St Marks Square and good for ferry to airport home . If you want to know where you are going to stay do not book this hotel. I often write reviews and have never before felt the need to advise against using a hotel but this experience set a very bad note for our time in Venice. If you book this hotel say no to room 26 . Others lower down in hotel looked better - at least shutters were painted and looked well kept. The location is good as so close to square but that is the only plus. Breakfast ok but no more. \"Juice\" was concentrate that was then watered down leaving it tasting only of bad cordial.

Our room (4) was a decent double but had an extra bed in for our son. Despite this we managed fine. The room and bedding was clean as was the bathroom and everything worked well. We had clean towels each day. Murano glass lighting and mirror added that Venetian touch. The double was two singles together but ours were very comfortable and we all had really good nights sleep. One of the windows in our room looked over the beautiful canal and yes there was construction going on underneath us but why stay in bed when there is the beautiful city to explore! The construction certainly didn't last all day and when we came back mid afternoon for a rest we were serendaded by the gondoliers instead which was magical. The breakfast was in a room just around the corner and through a courtyard - still part of the same buiding but no access from the main reception due to the canal I think. Breakfast included a selection of meat and cheese, fruit, cereal, croissant, juices, yoghurts, coffee, tea and toast. The staff at breakfast and in the hotel were always very pleasant and helpful. We had taken cash with us to pay for the city taxes up front when we arrived as we had noted this in the research we had done. Any hotel will ask you for this. We found the hotel very easily by printing off the larger map on the hotel website but a word of guidance - when you get to the Gucci shop turn right down an alleyway (if you look up you will see an old lampshade with 'Hotel San Moise' written on it on the corner of the alleyway). At the end of the alleyway turn right again and you are there. It takes approx 5 minutes to walk from St Marks Square.

He'd been planning it for ages and wanted everything to be perfect. Verona, thankfully, was perfect, but the San Moise hotel in Venice was awful and he was devastated. He'd booked a superior room and we were really looking forward to relaxing on our first night in Venice after a long journey on a freezing cold day. When we walked into reception we just knew it was going to be a disaster. There were tacky multicoloured glass light fittings everywhere and the interior was shabby and desperately in need of refurbishment. The room, where do I start? The bed was 2 single mattresses pushed together with a double sheet over the top. They kept separating during the night and we woke up with backache. The bedspread had cigarette burns in it, the floor was dirty and had sticky patches, there were dead swatted insects on the ceiling which had obviously been swatted by some other poor tourist in the summer and the hotel hadn't bothered to clean it. The pillows were still in the wardrobe and we had to get them out ourselves, the hairdrier in the bathroom was broken so couldn't be used, the towel rail was rusty, there was paint peeling off the ceiling in the bathroom and I could go on. We asked to be moved as this couldn't possibly be a superior room and we were assured it was a superior room and they couldn't move us anyway as the hotel was full. I dread to think what the basic rooms were like! The breakfast was basic and stale.

Made us go get cash out at ATM around the corner. His arrogant,extremely unhelpful and wanted to double charge us for the internet when leaving.I had read other reviews so I was aware that they may try to over charge.(Beware aware) The room was ridulously very very small,had no balcony and no view this was stated we got on our itinerary,we could hear the guest next door urinating in his toilet, and couldn't sleep because we were in the rooms that are situated under the stairs so we could hear the guest above us walking around, the blankets were disgusting and I was itching and my fiance had an asthma attack which he hadn't since he was a child. As soon as we got in the room he felt unwell. There is no housekeeping,sheets not changed and no clean towels,no kettle or tea or coffee nothing. The bed was two singles pushed together extremely uncomfortable,couldn't sleep. Breakfast is a joke, a horrible unhappy old lady that tells you were you have to sit, I looked across the room to see a young lady crying,seeming upset about the breakfast it was old & cheap quailty & watered down. Venice is dirty,it smells the people are rude we had no english speaking TV channels it is a very unfriendly and over expensive place. I wish the place will hurry up and sink that would be the best thing for tourist.It's a money pit they take your money and give nothing back.

If you're looking for a charming, one of a kind, antique, clean hotel room right on the canal with a great location to make the most out of sightseeing around Venice, then I would highly recommend this hotel! If you're not familiar with the area of fully aware of the signs, it is tucked away down a small alleyway, but the building itself is clearly marked. The property fits in just like a typical, colorful, artsy Venetian building and each room in the hotel is unique. My friend and I had a double room that overlooked a charming courtyard where breakfast was served (see pictures below)- it was like we were living in a fairytale room for 3 nights. The hotel is just a mere 5 minutes walking to Piazza San Marco- a must-see attraction in Venice, where the famed St. Mark's Basilica and Doge's Palace are located, to name a few iconic landmarks. It is also very close to Calle 22 Marzo, a main street with Gucci, Chanel, Fendi and other designer shops. Looking to get lost in the city and find a truly unique gift or souvenir? Hotel San Moise is a perfect base for all your sightseeing around Venice. It's just about 5 minutes walking from Teatro La Fenice, where there are opera shows. Gondola rides are right around the corner. Get lost in the winding streets just a few streets over from the hotel and follow the signs on almost every street pointing towards the famed Ponte Rialto (Rialto Bridge). Getting lost in Venice will almost inevitably happen, and it's part of the fun. There are plenty of cute boutiques and shops to stumble upon in close proximity of the hotel. The front desk at the hotel was very hospitable and helpful! They gave us a card with the address of a recommended restaurant about 10 minutes walking away. We loved our dinner experience so much at Ristorante La Feluca the first night we dined there we decided to go back 2 nights later! The service was attentive and friendly and the checked to make sure we were enjoying our meal. We were thrilled they recommended such a great restaurant to us! One of my favorite parts of staying at this hotel was the plethora of options at breakfast! Where most European hotels tend to skimp on breakfast, this hotel does not cut corners with their breakfast. They offered delicious pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt, a couple kinds of cereal, cold cuts, and coffee. The buffet was consistently being stocked which was appreciated since the buffet had a tendency to get busy around 8-9am.

It is down a dark ally but it's not dangerous, and it's lit up at night. The hotel is exactly what you expect from 3 star, it's clean, warm and comfortable. The rooms aren't massive but the bed was comfy and there was a decent shower. All we wanted from a hotel in a city like Venice was somewhere to sleep and shower. If you are overly fussed by fancy hotels then pay more and stay somewhere else but if you are just using as a base it's absolutely fine. The front desk staff weren't overly helpful but OK. The breakfast was your typical continental - Ok but not amazing (however food in Venice is plentiful so you'll never go hungry!). the room was decorated in a typical Ventian style and was really 'chinsy' but it's all part of the fun really! We booked through booking.com and paid just over Euro 100 per night and considering it's a stone's throw from everywhere you cant really complain. Venice is truely amazing and I can never understand why people get so stressed about minor details of how a hotel is decorated or what the breakfast is like - you need to be out and seeing and experiencing this wonderful city, not worrying about what the hotel looks like, just don't spend very much time in it - if you are then you are missing out! The Gondoler ride was amazing, it's expensive and touristy but who cares - you have to do it. The Vaporetto (water taxis) are brilliant and run with military precision. We took a Vaporetto back to the airport which was the best way to end our trip - it takes just over an hour and is really cheap - you can get the blue line and it runs every half an hour, would definitely recommend it. Enjoy Venice, it's wonderful. The Hotel San Moise is fine- it's not fancy but it's a great base close to everything you would ever need or want.

The room at the Ateneo was so small we could barely squeeze between the bed and the armoire. After spending the night there, we inquired at the desk about why the change was made. A VERY RUDE young blonde woman at the desk was not interested in our plight and told us to \"get out!\" When we asked to see the manager (numerous times) she refused and then admitted he was not there (or perhaps was hiding out in the back room??). She even threatened to call the police. If I were the manager or owner of these hotels, I would find someone with better people skills to be at the front desk. We returned to the San Moise, received an equally rude response and were told that they had the right to \"substitute\" a different hotel for the San Moise, plus we would have to pay for two nights at that dump with the blonde monster.

Another couple we know took 2 hours!) we were met by a friendly recepetion lady. All was fine until the phrase we were dreading came out \"This man will take you to our sister hotel where you will be staying\" We point blank refused. We said we had paid for that hotel and were staying there. The freindly woman did not stay friendly lets put it that way. After about 15 minutes of argueing, she agreed to let us see a \"standard\" room in that hotel and then we could decide whether or not to go to the other hotel. We were taken to a room which was literally a single room with a squashed in double bed. It was a ridiculous size! We agreed to go to the other hotel with the porter. (We did not let him carry our bags as know they charge for this without warning.) On arrival we were met by another reception lady who showed us to our \"standard\" room. I have never seen anything less standard in my life. They basically gave us thier biggest deluxe room available and posed it as a standard. She kept repeating (without us asking) \"this is standard, you pay no more.\" We moved. Safe to say, if they don't want you in that hotel, you wont be staying. When they ask you to move, kick off a little and then agree to see both hotel rooms. You will find you are offered the worst hotel room available in the first, to then compare with the best available in the other hotel. (Dont be too rude though, just make your point.) Hotel san moise claim the hotel is \"the same\" (see how many times you can get the receptionist to say this. She must have said it about 35 times to us) It really isnt. It is not on the same street like they claim, but it is only about 4 minutes different. If you get a better room out of it. It is worth the move! (Read my other review for the Hotel Ateneo) Hotel San Mosie itself if you do get to stay here, is a very good location. (So is the other however) It is 5 mins walk to San Marco square. Private water taxi gate. Clean, tidy. And I guess the other rooms will probably be more adequate than the one we were offered. Nice furnishings. Just a tip.

We rang reception again only to be told milk could not be supplied, the kitchen was closed......blah, blah, etc etc.......... The following day we discovered that the heating in the bathroom was not working, rang reception again and a man arrived and proceeded to clunk around with a screwdriver for two minutes and then leave.........heater remained broken for the whole stay.

We had a small flat screen TV and a comfortable 3rd bed (a twin) in the room for our teenager to sleep on. The breakfast is great by Italy standards -- they actually had scrambled eggs and meats, along with yogurt, fruits, cereal, and juice options. The front desk staff was not overly friendly but they were always present and we had no complaints about the services. There is a small bar and the bartender was very attentive and eager to help us relax with some drinks and small snacks after a long day of walking. We would definitely go back to 'Ca Anise/San Moise again, and will recommend it to all of our friends. One caution is that there are no elevators so carrying luggage up the stairs could be a problem.

We requested TWO SUPERIOR TWIN ROOMS WITH CANAL VIEWS.There were confusing errors in their emails, quoting different prices etc. and then they confirmed TWO DOUBLE rooms. I emailed again asking for two rooms with TWO beds in EACH room.We eventually got our correct confirmation and arrived on the 5th of February 2007. Upon registering we were taken out into the street, round the corner and shown into another building and there we were shown Two Double rooms!!! The Receptionist bluntly said there was nothing he could do as he was on his own. He pointed out a couch against one wall and suggested this as a single bed. He then said he wouldn't charge us for a Triple room.! ! The following morning they changed the double beds to single beds. My sister complained about the noise each night in her room, but not until the 3rd morning would the Receptionist on duty go to her room and explain that it was the \"heating pipes\" and moved them to an attic room without view and a DOUBLE BED!! Guests sleeping preferences are clearly not important. Being in a different building meant that one us had to keep walking back to the Reception desk in the Hotel to leave in or collect the keys (as they demanded we do )whilst the others waited in the rain. Throughout all this we had asked on many occasions to see the Manager who was never available. Eventually we were told he would be there on Thursday morning, we waited after breakfast to be then told he would be there at 11, went back again at noon, to be told he was not due. We were told he had 4 hotels and was too busy to come. The reception staff eventually got him on the phone and following a conversation with his receptionist the phone was handed to me...he introduced himself as the owner and said \"what do you want?\" I said I was sure his staff had filled him in and asked what he proposed to do regarding the poor service we had experienced. I explained we were unhappy as we had reservations for TWIN rooms but had been given Doubles, and then there was noise issue which had made sleep impossible, At this he began to shout that he had 8 hotels and was far too busy for all this. He was actually yelling at me. My sister, who was standing quite some distance away, could hear him clearly shouting and yelling. I asked him to please stop shouting at me or I would have to cease the conversation. With very bad grace he offered 15euro off per room , I felt this was not a fair offer due to the distress he had caused all four of us. I mentioned we had booked his hotel because of Tripadvisor. At this he yelled \"if you write anything about me I will get the most expensive lawyers in Italy after you.\" As I could not get a word in I gave the phone back to the Receptionist and said we would be back at 5pm as they had booked our Water Taxi for 6pm and our luggage had been moved to the Reception area. When we returned we asked for our account, we took out our credit cards etc. and then noticed they had deducted the 15euro offered per room. We did not wish to accept this sum as we fully intended complaining to the tourist board. Two sleepless nights, and two nights forced to share a bed we felt deserved more recognition. The Receptionist grinned and said \"your bill has been paid.\" They had actually \"drawn down \" the total from the credit card details I gave as Security to reserve the rooms in December. I was very upset as I had not authorised this and in fact we had intended splitting the bill as I am sure is usual for 4 people holidaying together. We then put the 75euro , they had deducted , on the counter , the receptionist refused to accept the cash. He said he was Not Allowed Accept it. We said fine and left it there. As we waited for the taxi ,a man arrived, spoke to the Receptionist, picked up the money and said \"I dont want this\" opened the door of the hotel and THREW the money into the street!!!!!!

And then we were told that they don't have any rooms in the main building, only in the building \"next door.\" Just like many other guests before us, we were misled. A 5 minute walk later, we were at a totally different hotel, on a totally different street, in a different part of town than was originally planned for, and most importantly, NOT ON THE CANAL. We were really disappointed. Their advertisement talks about the \"gondola-filled canal\" that we'd dreamed about. The incredibly sweet and courteous manager tried to convince us that this hotel was even better than the one we booked, and repeated the same practiced sentence that I'd read in other reviews \"It's a better location because it's equidistant to the Rialto Bridge, the Academia, and San Marco's Square.

Are we rating the same hotel??? Before I made my decision about this hotel, I kept an open mind and was not expecting lavish or nearly anything spectacular as I have been told by other people that the hotels in Italy are rather small. I choose this hotel based on the reviews and it sounded to be the best for the price in comparison to some other ones. Upon our arrival, the room that was assigned to us had the worst smell ever (kind of like someone had urinate in it). I immediately went to ask to be moved to another room. Luckily, there was an extra room of the same size. The size of these two rooms had to be approximately 10 x 6. Now with that said, can you imagine what the bathroom looked like? It was literally like a closet and there was no room for both of us and our suitcases. There was no way that two people could fit in there at the same time. Then when my husband tried to turn of the TV for a quick relaxation before we began our journey in Venice, the TV it did not work. He tried calling the front desk for assistance but the gentlemen did not answer his call. After the third try, my husband walk down to the front desk to confront him and the gentlemen apologized for not picking up our call. This led my husband to believe he was avoiding us as he was already unhappy that we had complained about the room that smelled like urine. We had hoped to at least be able to use an iron at their hotel but we were told that they did not have one. They offered to pressed my skirt at a cost of 4.50 euro. I now know why they do not have irons in their rooms. Needless to say, my husand and I had to walk around in wrinkled clothes for dinner that evening. To top this review off, I would like to comment about their daily breakfast. The only word to describe this breakfast is \"disgusting\". I'm the furthest from being a picky eater ( I can even eat plain toast) as long as what I'm eating looks like what its supposed to be. Now, this buffet breakfast did offer a variety of things, one of which is scrambled eggs which I love having for breakfast in the morning. Unfortunately, this was not the case, the eggs were green It just did not look appetizing, especially first thing in the morning. One morning, my husband who is a bacon fanatic asked the waiter if he was going to bring out anymore as there was no bacon in the pan.

This year I\u00c2\u00b4ve organised a journey to the carneval for 14(!) persons and 10 of them had standard rooms reserved in Hotel San Moise, 4 were booked for Ca fortuny (in superior rooms) (the second building of the hotel). First to say: the emailing with the hotel was always fast, friendly and correct. We were informed, that Ca fortuny would be 200 meters away from San Moise. The day before our arrival one couple had to cancel, because of illness. I informed the hotel by telephone about this cancellation. When we arrived we were told, that all of us would live in Ca fortuny. At the first moment I was irritated, but soon I realised that it would be very nice, when all of us would be in the same building. Ca fortuny is about 3-5 minutes to walk from San Moise near the lovely Campo S. Stefano. AND we were upgraded for free: the superiors to luxury and two of the standards to superior! On friday evening we had our masquerade ball and got a make up for free! Although I\u00c2\u00b4ve phoned only (I had no more possibility for sending a fax or email) the couple which canceled, had just to pay one night cancellation fee and got the rest of the money back. Some critics: the breakfast room in Ca fortuny is too small for all guests (which never had been a problem for us).

I should not have worried at all, the annex was brand new and immaculatly decorated with marble and fine furniture. The room was fantastic and judging by the small amounts of building dust and some odds and ends of builders waste (wood shavings and electrical insulation) we were the first guests to stay in the room. An assumption that was confirmed by the door man later in our stay. The very small amounts of mess vanished by day two and we went on to thouroughly enjoy our stay. The room had great lighting, a major problem in a lot of hotels. Hom many times have you got into bed only to find out that you can't turn the bloody lights off!! The air con was fully electronic and worked very well. Breakfast was excellent and vast self service, typical Italian with very very strong coffee. The annex has no facilities, such as bars and resturants etc, but you are in Venice!!! Go and explore. Excellent hotel, right in the middle of everything, would stay again.

Our recommendation is twofold: First of all, my husband and I stayed in the Hotel San Moise in 2003. The hotel is wonderful - a 17th century home, very well located with a most pleasant and helpful staff. Our large room faced a small canal and was complete with tall French doors opening onto our small private balcony. Our lovely accomodations made our stay in Venice a most memorable one. Secondly, we were so pleased with Hotel San Moise, we booked the same room for our daughter and granddaughter in October 2005. After staying six days in Rome, they had planned to take a train to Venice when they were notified of the tragic auto accident which resulted in the death of my daughter's husband. They of course flew home from Rome immediately and it was necessary for me to cancel their two night reservation on the very day they were due to arrive at the Hotel San Moise. Because of such short notice I fully expected to pay the full amount. Instead the management E-mailed me extending their condolences and advising me of their decision not to charge anything, neither the first nor the second night of this reservation. I feel this was more than generous and they should be highly commended for their compassionate customer satisfaction policy. I would certainly urge anyone traveling to Venice to book a room at the Hotel San Moise - it is truly a very special hotel in every way.

We felt fortunate to stay at the San Moise for several reasons. We researched hotels in Venice carefully because we were traveling with our 3-year old daughter and 4-month old son. With all our luggage, we wanted a hotel that was right on a canal and accessible by water-taxi - so we wouldn't have to lug our suitcases and two children around Venice to get to the hotel. Being on a canal generally means the most expensive hotels (a la Hotel Gritti, Danielli, Bauer Palace). After reading many reviews and studying maps of hotel locations, we decided the Hotel San Moise was the only hotel both on the water and near Saint Mark's Square which didn't cost $400 Euros a night. And our guess proved right. The Hotel San Moise is right on the side canal directly to the west of Saint Mark's Square - about 3 blocks from Saint Mark's - in the San Moise distict (named after the Cathedral San Moise about a block away). It is also one block off the main street \"Larga 22 Marzo\", which is sort of the Rodeo Drive of Venice - with stores of all the major Italian designers (Fendi, Prada, Gucci, Cavali, etc.). The San Moise neighborhood couldn't be better and, as expected, there is a boat launch directly in front of the hotel - so that bell boys literally took our bags off the water-taxi and carried them up to our room. Heaven. Unlike other hotels within the San Moise district (like the Kette and Saturnia), many of the San Moise rooms look directly over the canal and you are serenaded by gondoliers going by on the canal all day long. It pegs the meter for Venice ambiance and romance. Our canal view room had a large picture window and balcony overlooking the canal - and it was sumptuously decorated in Venetian furniture and fabrics. It was a large \"family room\" and accomodated us and our two children easily. Breakfast was good and the staff were very courteous. Note: I took a previous review here as a cautionary tale and did not book through Bookings or any other internet site. Since I was up at 1:00 a.m. anyway researching hotels, I decided to just call the San Moise directly (at 10:00 am Venice time). I got through immediately, was greeted by an english-speaking concierge, and was quoted a rate 30% less than Bookings for our room!! I faxed them our information that day and they faxed back a reservation confirmation within hours! It all went fantastically! I called again before we left, just to confirm our reservation, and they were right on the ball with it. So, I would generally recommend phoning directly, regardless of which hotel you decide on.

When we arrived at this hotel we were told that our room would be ready in one hour. We smiled and said 'that's fine' and went for an hour and a quarter walk. When we came back we sat quietly in the corner of the reception room and waited because the concierge/desk clerk did not say anything to us. We waited for around twenty minutes at which point my wife enquired, in a very friendly manner, as to whether the room was ready. The attitude of the concierge/desk clerk (Julianne? my wife thinks this was the name he used on the telephone) changed abruptly, he became dismissive and told us that rooms became ready for occupation at one o'clock. Some time later the same concierge/desk clerk informed us that the porter would be coming to take our bags to our room which was in another building not physically attached to the San Moise Hotel. At this point I remembered reading a review posted on this site where another traveller warned of being involuntarily switched to another hotel. I queried the arrangement presented by stating that we did not wish to stay at any \"sister hotel\". Well folks this is where things started to go badly wrong! There was no one else in the reception area and the concierge/desk clerk became very hostile saying that the hotel we were going to be escorted to was not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sister hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but the same hotel. We pleaded that we had booked to stay in the hotel in which we were sitting but he became most aggressive and stared at us in an extremely antagonistic manner, repeating his claim that it was the same hotel. He said that we would be able to see all the same sights and that we were not entitled to object because it was the same hotel and the building was only a short distance away. This was our vacation, so realising that there seemed to be little to be gained from the exchange except further unpleasant opposition, we agreed to see the room in the other building. Even after we did this the man continued to stare aggressively and repeated his question about whether we wanted to see the room or not. I said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcokay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 twice but he carried on with this performance! Anyway, a very pleasant porter arrived and took our heaviest case while I carried the two smaller ones.

She then admitted that alright it was not part of the San Moise Hotel but had the same owners! It turned out that she had been there for only two months and had obviously been fed the preposterous lines to dictate to anyone who objected to the treatment. We ended up feeling sorry for her as she had been put in a most unfortunate situation by the management of the two hotels. To cut a long story short, we went to the room in this modern/totally refurbished building which was totally lacking in atmosphere.

The rooms was clean and nice and the staff was helpful and friendly. But it just puts a slight damper on your vacation, that we had planned for 2 years, when you don't get the room that you specifically reserved or even in the same hotel as you specifically reserved. They had my email address and phone number, so I would have appreciated a quick email or call letting me know that the room we had reserved would not be available after all.", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton,Alberta,Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful & Classy\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3798238", "Content": "My friend and I stayed only one night at this lovely hotel but wished it could have been longer.

I booked the hotel through \"bookings dot net\" (never book with them EVER!), and there was a dispute in the amount I was to pay because neither the hotel staff nor \"bookings dot net\" made it a point to notify me of the hotel rate when I added an extra day. I got an oral confirmation through \"bookings\" that the hotel rate would be the same for all three nights (200 euro per night), for I was traveling around Europe and had no form of communication with me. When I checked out of the hotel, the hotel staff member (who was really nice - the only nice thing about the hotel, really) said that it was 460 euro (I know! Outrageous!) for the extra night. And then he had me speak on the phone with the director, named Gianluca Serra, who then proceeded to tell me that it was HIS hotel and he can do whatever he wanted and that he would charge my credit card that amount if I did not agree to that amount. Then, he cussed me out. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, who in their right mind as a customer service staff would cuss out a paying customer? I was being civil; I just had a problem with the amount so I was little ticked. The staff member then called \"bookings dot net\" and told me that they would handle it while I go sightseeing. When I returned, Gianluca was there and he told me that it was settled, and that I would be charged that day and that \"bookings dot net\" would refund me the extra 260 euro. Well, now that I'm back in the States, both \"bookings dot net\" and Gianluca take no fault and I am out that 260 euro. It's a terrible hotel with an even more terrible director. Please choose another hotel chain. Also, we were sent to another hotel on the first night because there was some leakage. So, we had to pay extra and were stuck in a worse part of Venice.

DO take loads of cash..this is not the place to worry about cash...go with the flo..we all know its billions of \u00c2\u00a3 to get a drink, but somehow getting ripped off is all part of the experience!! ....they say everyone should go to Venice once in their lives...thats because u can ONLY afford to go once!!! DO NOT just stay around St MArks....Rialto area is great...lovely food markets DO go the hotel Danieli for lunch on the rooftop terrace...Amazing....not cheap.( u see now where the financial side of the holiday went out the window!!!!) Go to the hotel Monaco and grand canal for waterside views and great staff. Have a late night drink on the hotel Bauer terrace...very stylish and right near the hotel..when i am richer i will go and stay here....SUPERB GO in the Doges palace....well worth it, and i dont like museums much DO try and speak a little Italian... i was appauled at how most fellow brits and Yanks could not be bothered to try even a little hello/please/thankyou.

You can't beat the location, the cleanliness and the helpfulness of the staff. One word of advice, ask the front desk what restaurants to AVOID close to the hotel. We failed to do this and we got ripped off by a place down the street. As soon as we told the staff what happened to us, they knew what we were talking about.
