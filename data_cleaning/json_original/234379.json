The location was perfect; from our room we had a great view on Venice and it took only about ten minutes to get to St. Mark's Square. There is a small supermarket just around the corner from the hotel and various places that sell AWESOME icecream and pizza. The staff of the hotel/b&b was very helpful too. One night my girlfriend had a severe headache but we didn't have any painkillers. A member of the staff (I don't remember his name) gave her one. We were also given a device to keep the mosquito's out. The room itself was small and looked dated, but it had everything you need and, more importantly, it was clean.

The hotel itself is located on LIDO a small island opposite ST Marks Sq. The Island is reached either by private taxi (very expensive or 12 euros for public boat, which takes an hour from Marco Polo airport) once you reach LIDO the hotel is only a 2 min walk. Hotel itself is well located in terms of main town area, and restaurants, basically on main strip which feels very safe and the beach is right at the end, a 5 to 10 min walk. But hotel is quite shabby, old musty feel think brighton style hotels, with funkily padded walks, i assume to cover the damp or stains, bathroom as said by other reviewers is tiny, like a walk in closet. Bed wasnt to bad, linen was clean, didnt try the breakfast, literally cornflakes, tea and a few crossiants no toast or fruit or usual hotel fare.

After being assured that it wasn't a problem we were shown to a tiny double room where we were told they would fit in a cot. This room had had water stains on the wall and smelled terrible. After talking to hotel staff they assured us it would be fine but we were not happy to be paying a triple rate for a double room with a flimsy cot. My wife spoke to the maid and she was the one who convinced the manager to give us a bigger room. We ended up with a two bedroom room where each room had a double. While this was much better, if it wasn't for the maid the manager would have been happy to keep us in a tiny double with a cot but charge us the same rate as a bigger triple room. The hotel is in Lido, not in the main islands of Venice. Its a 40 minute busboat ride to the train station and twenty minutes from the main square in Venice. You can buy day passes or multi-day passes at the train station which make sense. Breakfast was poor and coffee comes from a vending machine rather than being freshly brewed. In retrospect I would spend more on a hotel in the main part of Venice, thereby saving by not having to buy a bus pass.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LIVERPOOL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "LS16", "ReviewID": "UR10070117", "Content": "Booked Venice for a short break for myself and husband to celebrate my birthday, and also because of the Ryanair sale!!

On arrival the trip to venice from treviso was great, 9 euros return. Once we arrived in venice, managed to get our travel pass and find the right boat to take us to Lido (staff in P.le Roma not very helpful). Would recomend if you aged between 14-29 to purchase a Venice Rolling Card for 4 euros this knocked 20 euros of the price of a 3 day travel pass. Once in Lido the hotel is facing the vaporetto stop, behind the massive monkey (if it is still there!!). The staff were very polite and helpful, rooms basic - but we weren't planning on spending much time in the room. Paid 5 euros for breakfast which wasn't anything speacial but done us until lunch. Had a great nights sleep, the beds are comfy and the rooms are quiet. Lido is lovely, with bars and restaurants (at half the price of Venice). It was very quiet and relaxed compared with Venice, which was great after spending all day fighting through crowds.

The room was very very small, as was the bathroom, so if you're planning on swinging any cats, don't got here. However, it was clean, the bed was comfortable, and there was a fridge, tv with CNN and a safe. So it was still comfortable and secure. To be fair, most rooms in Italy are small anyway. We paid additional 5 euros for the breakfast, which was simple- juice, coffee, croissants, bread, cereal, yoghurt. The Italians aren't that big on breakfast so don't expect a fry up anywhere. The staff were fairly pleasant and the stay- check in, check out, payment was straight forward and without problems. The room was quiet with no disturbances despite being right opposite the boat stops. Air conditioning was easy to control and the room was nice and dark with the shutters closed so you don't wake up at 6am with the light! The hotel is ideally located, 15 mins boat journey to the centre of Venice and right next to the boat stops. Also close to the main road in Lido which has plenty of restaurants, little shops and ice-cream parlours and leads to the beach. Personally I wasn't that impressed with the beach, was a bit too commercialised, I like beaches to be natural, but its a good beach if you have young kids, very clean. Tip- If at night you don't feel like spendng loads on a meal, go back to Lido, get a couple of beers and a take away pizza from the place on the corner and sit on a bench facing venice to watch the sunset. Overall, good if you're not wanting to spend loads on a hotel that you are just going to sleep in- comfortable, well located, clean.", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location & low on price\u201d", "Author": "YveyCorkIreland", "ReviewID": "UR8237207", "Content": "This hotel is a real gem in island of Lido just 30 mins from P. de Roma, ideal for Ryanair flights in from Treviso airport.

My husband and I spent four nights there this January the weather was sunny with a marvellous blue sky even though extremely cold.

The hotel does not have a lift so is not recommended for older customer and family with loads of baggage and kids. The room have a small toilette and shower everything in the room was functioning the stuff was helpfull and quite friendly compared to the rest of Venice. I am Italian myself (Romam) and I must say that Veniciance are not the friendliest people I came accross to. In fact the service we've received was horrible in most of the places we have been. Restaurants are extremely expensive, the service is absolutely awful and the food portions are ridiculous, they are not even enough for a bird. If you go to Venice on a small budget Giardinetto at Venice Lido is definitely the place to go, especially in summer, 5 mintus walk to a beautiful and huge beach, the boats run every few minutes for any other destination outside the Lido for a resonable price(22 Euros for 4 days travel pass)also here is much more quite than the center. The best resaturant we found is The Spaghetti house in Burano where food, service and prices were spot on, then there's one restaurant at the Lido on the main street that leads to the beach I don't remenber the name unfortunately, but is the only one on the right pavment next to a little bar. Also quite good are the bars run by Chines they serve cold and hot food at a good price with a better service.
