It is on a main street, but a quiet one -- a short walk from a number of tourist spots (and shopping) and on streetcar lines that serve many others. One thing to keep in mind -- this is essentially a \"boutique\" hotel, not part of a chain (although I believe that the Belleview Hotel on the same street, but a bit closer to the train station, is a sister property), and it is in a couple of old buildings that have been linked together, so if you are hoping/expecting a \"Hilton\" type of experience, you'll likely be disappointed, but I have always found it more than adequate, even when I can pay more, and it's the hotel I choose even when I'm paying out of my own pocket. The rooms that I've been in have been on the small size, but the hotel has been frequently upgrading their quality -- there is now wifi available throughout the hotel, and the television has a great many channels. My bathroom had a shower, essentially open, in the bathroom (no tub), so the floor can get quite wet. But that's no big deal. I don't think there's a restaurant or, really, a bar, but, hey, this is Amsterdam and there are ample places to eat and to drink. Breakfast (included) is a buffet featuring an excessive array of cold cuts for someone who should watch his/her cholesterol, plus eggs and bacon and Dutch pancakes plus juices and breads (plural) and rolls. There is no reason to leave breakfast still feeling hungry! I think that rates may be somewhat cheaper if you go through a booking service, but I have found the hotel to be responsive in tight times when I have contacted it directly. The hotel is fairly small, so not infrequently it sells out. I've found the front desk staff to be helpful. Please note, though, that there is no bellperson, so you have to bring your bags to your room yourself. For me, that's not been a problem, since (a) I can take care of my own stuff without need of help and (b) as so many other people do, I leave my luggage in a locker or in the left-luggage area at the airport and just take what I need for the length of time that I'll be staying.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "J\u00c3\u00b6nk\u00c3\u00b6ping, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cJust what I want\u201d", "Author": "HenrikSMRN Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR118471208", "Content": "I don't like large, fancy, luxurious hotels, but I don't like dirty, cramped rats holes either.

It is a few minutes walk from Centraal Station and neighborhoods such as the Jordaan are an easy walk. For our last stay we booked a double room. Upon arrival we were taken to a decent size room with a very small bathroom. There was no tub and only a curtain separated the very small shower from the toilet with little room to move. It looked out on a shaft between buildings. We requested, and quickly received, a room change to one with a tub. The front desk said that we should have requested a room with a tub and not just a shower. We had no idea such tubless rooms existed in the hotel and we have stayed at the hotel several times. Our second room looked out over the alley to the right of the entrance. It was light and airy and fairly quiet but the free wifi did not work. I had to go into the hall or to the lobby to get access. We again asked for and the next day were given another room where the wifi worked. If wifi access is important you should make it clear when reserving a room and avoid rooms toward the back of the hotel by the alley. Our third room was much larger and very comfortable. The breakfast was better than other three star hotels we have stayed in Amsterdam and the staff was helpful. There is a safe in the lobby for valuables, which you can use for a small fee per day. The building above the entrance in the photos of the hotel is not part of the hotel. The buildings to the left in photographs are part of the hotel with rooms facing the street. The hotel is put together from several odd shaped buildings and size of layout of rooms varies tremendously. The Tram stop for lines 1, 2, 5, 13 and 17 is less than a block away.

The toilet is in the corner behind the door and tough to get to even with the door closed, and there is no actual shower - just a curtain that wraps around a portion of the floor. Water ended up getting everywhere, and I was afraid to use the hairdryer for fear of getting electrocuted. The other issue we had with our trip was with the front desk staff. We had family in Amsterdam that dropped off a welcome package for us, including champagne and chocolates. We never received the package - did not find out about it until a couple days later when our family asked what we thought of the champagne. Fortunately we were able to retrieve the package the day before we flew home, as it was still sitting behind the desk with our name and room number on it. Disappointed that it never made it to our room during our stay! Otherwise our stay was fine, had no issues with bedbugs or cleanliness like some other reviews. Breakfast was good including a variety of meats and cheese, along with hot cooked American items like eggs and bacon. Getting around the day we left town was a bit of a challenge as there was a transit strike, fortunately found a cab driver willing to take us to the edge of town to retrieve our car!

The double had a tub/shower combo and the single was shower only. Carpets were new and clean (other reviews had mentioned \"sticky/stained carpets\"). From conversations with others staying at the same time, it appears that some rooms are not renovated, and have older bathrooms; more worn appearance. I did not see these rooms so can only state that the two rooms we were given were quite satisfactory and good value for Amsterdam, which is pricey. The breakfast buffet is outstanding: a bright and attractive room on lower level; assortment of hot dishes (soft boiled or scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausages, potatoes); cheeses and sliced cold meats; fresh sliced fruits; yogurt; assorted cereals and breads, as well as tomatoes and lettuce, and unlimited coffee or tea and juices. The lift is secure: you must enter your room key card to use it. The convenience of a lift rather than the steep stairs in some of the hotels at this price becomes very important after you've hauled even one backpack up or down a narrow flight or two. The locked luggage room was great for storing our backpacks as we arrived early in the morning before check-in was possible. Also we never encountered any unpleasant staff, so can't comment on some negative statements others made. All in all--the pluses definitely outweigh any minuses. Good Value...

We had to keep the window open but there was a problem - it opened directly onto the kitchen roof and there was an extractor fan/generator on its roof (see photo) which was on 24hrs a day so you either had to close the window and sweat or leave it open and try and sleep with the noise. The carpet was appalling obviously someone had been sick on it as you could still see the stain and all over it there were black stains you had to keep something on your feet all the time. The bathroom was more like a wet room as the shower didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a tray so water went all over the floor even up to base of the toilet, tip take a pair of flip flops with you and wear them all the time. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any point of asking for another room as there obviously couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been another one available as you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have put paying guests into 202 if you had another one available in the first place!

Went back later to reception and asked if we could have a safety box he gave us two keys and explained what they were for I offered to pay but he said it would be added to our bill that was all he said. On the day we were leaving we went to the safety box only to find my passport missing so immediately went to reception and explained what had happened and said I would need to contact the British Consul to which the receptionist said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I explained I would need a replacement passport, just then one of her colleagues (who had seen us the previous day) arrived she said there was passport under the counter sure enough it was my passport (some honest person had found it on the floor and handed it into reception) but it had my room number on it and had been there since we arrived - no one from reception had bothered to tell us!! I said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthank you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as I very, very grateful although still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how it came to be on the floor.

The hotel really needs a refurb. I stayed in the quad room with my husband and two children. All beds are singles and the room was very smelly and dusty. Also very noisy to the front. The beds were small and uncomfy and the towels almost threadbare and had the filthiest carpet I have seen. If it was half the price, I'd think it was fair, but overall it was really bad value. True it is central but not a nice area for families. Ideal for a stag night perhaps. Shame because the the room itself could have had character. Also lots of dodgy guys in the hotel and the luggage room has a stack of x-rated movies piled up, just at the right height for an 8 year old. Also, beware families, my daughter fell down the stepladder and broke her arm. Reception were not rude, but really didn't care. We had just completed a wonderful cycling holiday (Cycletours) and the Avenue experience really spoilt it for us. Don't understand why other reviewers say the lobby is nice.

After a long search for the right hotel, I decided to book the Avenue Hotel for a 5 night stay in Amsterdam. I have been to the city previously, but stayed in a hotel far outside the central district. This time around i was looking to be closer to the action. The Avenue offered very reasonable rates in a good location. This is the perfect hotel for those looking to see Amsterdam on a budget, but do not want to deal with the hostels. it's a clean, modern hotel in a good spot. If you're looking for a 4 star luxury hotel, this isnt your place. A short walk from the train station, the hotel is in a central spot for walking the city. Restaurants, bars, cafes, museums and shops are all within walking distance.. we had no need for trains or cabs for our entire stay. The rooms are typically European - clean, but very small. Our bed was at best a double size (definitely not a queen) but my girlfriend and i got used to sleeping in it after a night. The bathroom was modern, and the room was kept very clean by staff. We had no issues with any noise- but since we were in the back of the hotel, i cannot comment on the front rooms. The included breakfast buffet standard, and a good way to save a few $$$.. the typical scones, muffins, eggs, teas and coffees were offered... if you get tired of the same old, try one of the breakfast cafes on the block.. there's one right up the road run by a woman from Seattle.. she was friendly and the food was great. The hotel also features a small lounge/bar area with internet connection. You have to buy internet access to use the computer. The connection (as of 2005) was very slow, and generally not worth using if you could avoid it. The bar area was generally not crowded, and closed before midnight every night. Overall, I was extremely happy with my choice of the Avenue. I wasn't staying in Amsterdam to hangout in my hotel, so all i wanted was location, value, and cleanliness.

(However, I did walk around the red light district to get to my place of business.) I would recommend it.

The Avenue was recommended by a local travel agent, so I checked out the comments on Tripadvisor then returned and booked it. Staff were very friendly, polite and helpful with queries and questions. The Hotel is owned by a group which has other Amsterdam Hotels also and whilst there is no restaurant on site, a complimentary ticket for one in one of their other nearby hotels (2 minutes walk towards the Railway Station away), giving a ten percent discount on meals, is part of the welcome pack in the rooms. There is a bar on site open 5pm to midnight daily where we were able to buy Bombay Sapphire gin and bottles of tonic, a double cost 10 Euros (for her indoors, who didn't want to try the local gin - Jenever). Pizzas can be ordered in the bar but as the streets all around are brimming with cafes, take aways, restaurants etc, we didn't try this service. I settled for a \"medium\" glass of Heineken at 2.50 Euros! My travel agent told us that only \"Continental\" breakfasts were served in the hotel. Continental breakfasts have changed since I was a lad! This used to mean a croissant and a cup of coffee but breakfast catered for all nationalities with a help yourself choice of: 4 cereals, fruits in syrup, a great bowl of yoghurt, croissants, hard boiled eggs, hot scrambled eggs, bacon, beans, frankfurter sausages, tomatoes, a choice of salads and cold meats, grapefruit juice, orange juice, cold milk, piping hot coffee, hot milk, tea, marmalades, jams, bread rolls etc etc. We ate until full and didn't need to eat again until evening, and we used up a lot of energy walking all over the city! There is enough food at breakfast to make up packed lunches if you so desired without denting the constantly re-filled dish quantities. The only negative I could give was that one of the two showers (yes, TWO) over the bath was badly set so her indoors flooded the bathroom floor in spite of having pulled the curtain round as far as possible, (AND tucked it inside the bath) and soaked the floor towel rather extensively! Another small problem we encountered was that we struggled to turn the lights on in our room and to re-open the door once we'd got in until I figured out that the credit card key had to be put in to a small slot alongside the light switches by the door, after which everything worked fine.

It was a cold, wet night when we finally arrived at 11.45pm after a delayed flight to Schipol. Being close to Centraal Station the hotel is a short walk. Our twin room ( I was sharing with a girlfriend) was on the 3rd floor at the end of a long twisting corridor. I had emailed the hotel direct a few days previously and asked for a quiet non smoking room - which we got. The 3rd floor is completely non smoking. The room was small - the 2 single beds were pushed together and no room to separate them - so make sure you share with a good friend. One pillow and a duvet for each bed was provided. There is a TV (which we didnt use) and very limited storage space - just a small wardrobe with 2 shelves, not great if staying for longer than a couple of days! The radiator was off when we arrived but gave us enough warmth when we wanted it & to dry our towels. The bathroom had a shower, wc & wash basin. The shower was a problem as mentioned in previous reviews. The floor is on one level with just a curtain rail in the ceiling around the shower head, from which the shower curtain hangs. The shower head is fixed and when the shower is on (its very powerful) the water sprays through the gap in the side of the curtains and soaks anything on the washbasin's side. The floor is like a lake as the water doesnt drain away as fast as is necessary, so on stepping out of the shower the bathmat is saturated. Whoever designs this had NOT thought it through! BUT still..... we managed, although we didnt spend long getting clean! I have to mention the low level of lighting in the room too, which was very frustrating when trying to read & unpack in the smi darkness - we made an attempt at removing a lampshade from a bedside light but couldnt budge it! Breakfast was good - as mentioned by previous reviewers, cereals,juices (not fresh squeezed) fruit salad (though tinned) plain yogurt, cold meats, cheese, tomatoes, cucumber, assorted rolls and bread. There was a hot choice too, bacon, baked beans, rather solid scrambled eggs, sausages (frankfurters) small pancakes (which looked rather like ravioli) and boiled eggs. Coffee was provided in large hot jugs and was very weak! Tea bags and hot water was available too. You could easily fill up before you went out to see the sights. We found the reception desk staff helpful with advice on trams and tickets. We didnt try the small bar at the hotel. We had prebooked by email, a retaurant off Dam square called Brasserie Harkema - I would recommend it for a great meal in a buzzy atmosphere. Its housed in a converted tobacco factory and has an excellent if short menu. price for 3 courses and a good bottle of wine \u00c2\u00a356 with service. We saw all the sights - Van Gogh museum, Anne Frank House and did a canal boal trip - catch it from outside Centraal Sation. Love Amsterdam - my 6th trip and my friends first - we will be back and despite the niggles think that the Avenue Hotel is good value & in an ideal position to see everything - a tram stop virtually outside the door helps.

The reason for the choice of this particular hotel was because we wanted a hotel that was within walking distance from the train station & one that was based around a traditional Dutch warehouse design or traditional townhouse . We especially did not want to stay in a modern thrown-up monstrosity that seems to be frequenting many big cities around the world these days! (You know the saying:- 'When in Rome do as the Romans do!!') The hotel was in a very nice area of town, quiet & not near the seedy or rowdy areas & approximatley 200 metres from Dam Square; the main Dam when Amsterdam was first dammed all those years ago. Within the Dam Squaure area is the Royal Palace. The Hotel staff were very kind & pleasent when we used them to check in & for buying tickets (at a later time) to use the expansive tram network that stops convientiently 100 metres down the road. The room we stayed in was on the 6th floor reached by a lift. It was plesant with both bath & overhead powershower with plenty of very warm water. It also had a hairdyer & razor socket. The room was nicely decorated with twin beds. It had t.v with Dutch, German , UK & U.S stations mainly news networks to keep you in touch with affairs back at home if you wish. As we stayed in November we were worried that the hotel may be a liitle cold, but we needn't have worried as it was toastie warm & cosy. Next on to the breakfast.The breakafast was out-of-this-world!!! It was a self-service affair with the choice of:- fruit, croissants, bread & rolls in both brown & white, conserves / jams, juice , tea , coffee, warm milk, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, small dutch pancakes, tomato, ham, cheese (plain Gouda & one which i especially liked was the Gouda with cumin), lettuce, cucumber. I've probably forgotten loads as there really was that much to choose from. Amazing!!!! Most people in previous reviews commented on the noisy trams, but to be honest they never really distrubed us. To be fair if you want to stay in the centre of Amsterdam you would be hard-pushed to pick a hotel that avoids any tram noise as the tram network is that good; which can only be a good thing whilst you are travelling around & visiting the many various places of interest.

The bathroom was tiny and we had problems while using the shower as water sprayed all over the bathroom floor when using the shower.

I was told that the hotel was completly booked up and the manager would be in at 9:00 and there was nothing he could do about the situation. Needless to say, this made for an interesting evening. At 6:00 I went out walked around and found us a room at the Renaissance hotel, a 5 star hotel, two blocks away for less than what we were charged at the Avenue. We checked out at 8:00 in the morning. At the check out time the hotel manager first tried to charge me for the entire amount for two nights, then offered a discount. But I was firm about paying only for the first night. Hotel Renaissance was wonderful, their personnel were extremely helpfull and we ended up having a wonderful time in Amsterdam. For those interested, Rijksmuseum is under construction, and more that 2/3 of the art work is not available. Canal Bikes are wonderful for kids and the floating flower market is beautiful in the morning.

The hotel is very close to the train station - you just turn right at the big Victoria hotel and take your next left at the major road, which is the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal, and the hotel is about 3 blocks on your left, just beside the Crown Plaza. Note: when taking the train from the airport to Centraal Station, buy your tickets from a person. The machines are only in Dutch and do not take credit cards, only Dutch debit cards. We requested a room at the back, having heard the trams are noisy (they are), and that worked out well. Pros of the room: decent size, lots of wardrobe/desk space, 2 English channels on the TV, quiet, super location. Cons: no AC (didn't need it in April but could imagine it would get hot in the summer), non-smoking rooms are right next to smoking rooms so we kept getting wafts of smoke (had to stuff towels against crack under door), \"sheets\" consisted of a duvet thing which was hot, and as there was no separate sheet, you just had to either use the duvet or do without, and also there is this giant clock in Dam Square that rings incessantly, we're talking every 15 minutes, even at night. Obviously not the hotel's fault but annoying, and you can hear it all over the city, so no escaping it. The hotel had a SUPER breakfast buffet - hot and cold foods, fruit, cheeses, you name it. Amsterdam itself was fabulous. LOVED IT. Things to do there: Van Gogh museum was great; Anne Frank house is a must-see; rent a bike like the locals do! Heineken Brewery tour was fun as well. We thought the Rijksmuseum was boring and overrated; wouldn't recommend unless you really are into the Dutch masters.

The rooms were clean but worn and were horribly designed. The room phone did not work when trying to call the states and my wife could not get through to me either. Thankfully I had a quad band cell phone that I just had to switch the sim card to be able to communicate with home. The front desk staff was average at best. One of the front desk people was very nice (a woman - forgot her name) but the rest seemed irratated at the 3 questions I asked them in the 8 days I was there. I noticed they seemed very put out when other guests were talking to them. There is a small bar but never had anyone in there. There was one computer in the bar for internet service.

We were told that no double room would become available. Our room was tiny. The twin beds were pushed together and there was no space to separate them. Both beds kept sliding away from each other though. The TV sat snug between the ceiling and the walls, clearly because there was no space to fit it else where. The bathroom was an absolute disgrace. I could tell it was clean but it looked filthy with the moulded and broken tiles. The shower was just a showerhead spraying on the bathroom floor. The breakfast was hot buffet and okay. I wouldn't rave about it though. The location was perfect. It is very close to Central Station and a short walk away from the Dam. I have always stayed near Central Station but I think it has become very gritty in the past years. Next time I'll go to Amsterdam I'd rather stay in the Jordaan which is by far the greatest location in Amsterdam and not all bulldozed by hen and stag parties.

Having said that, I think your experience of this hotel will very much depend on the type of room which you are allocated. As the hotel is made up of old canal houses, the rooms vary widely in size and many of the rooms are oddly shaped. I had a single room which was very small and poky, with no window and a bathroom which could do with some updating. However, I had called up the hotel in advance to request a nice room for my parents and they were allocated a spacious double room which was clean, well furnished and very pleasantly decorated. Their bathroom was fairly small but clean, modern and perfectly functional. Their room did overlook the street so there was some noise from passing trams etc but they didn't find it too bad. The public areas of the hotel are pleasant, well decorated and clean and, as other reviewers have mentioned, the complimentary buffet breakfast is a great bonus. This hotel is in a good location for trams, and for the dam square end of town, plenty of shops, bars and restaurants etc in the immediate vicinity of the hotel and not too much of a walk from the other nighlife areas such as Rembrandtsplein. The tram from just outside the hotel will also take you right down to Leidseplein.
