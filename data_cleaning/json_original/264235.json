We paid around 30 euros per night for a room with private bathroom, which is pretty good for Madrid. Check-in went smooth, it is owned by a family and everybody was really friendly. The building is old, the room very basic but spotlessly clean!! We always had hot water, the bed was made daily and it was very comfortable. One day there seemed to be a party going on next door, so we complained at the reception and she politely asked them to keep it down and they did. But the best about this place is the location. The hostal is right in Calle de las Huertas (and close to the Pl Santa Ana) which is full of cute bars and restaurants, Just next door you have El Hecho, where they serve you delicious torrijas de miel! Transport from the airport to the hostel was easy peasy, we got off the Airport Express bus at Pl. de Cibeles and from there it was just a ten minute walk. The Prado museum, Antocha station, retiro park and Puerta del sol are all within walking distance. If we ever come back, we'll stay here again!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wilts,uk", "Title": "\u201cVisiting daughter for weekend\u201d", "Author": "keithabroad", "ReviewID": "UR119826882", "Content": "As my daughter had just started a year at University in Madrid in August, she decided it was time for someone to visit her and Dad volunteered She lives in the Latina area so wanted to be a short distance away from her flatmates for a few days This Hostal was chosen based on her not wanting me to pay too much & at 51 euro for a twin bedded room it was good value We had a street facing room which was no problem for me as I can sleep through most things, particularly after decent food & wine The Hostal was easy to find, no pressure to pay by a certain time, keys to come & go when we wanted, room was clean, tidy as was the bathroom Prior to leaving I was told I could leave our bags in reception on vacating our room if required", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Torpoint, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and quiet\u201d", "Author": "Cara T", "ReviewID": "UR119729119", "Content": "It has been years since I stayed in a Hostal, but I recently stayed for 9 days at Hostal Lopez in Madrid and it has restored my faith in them. I will certainly be loathe to pay for pricier options in future. For approx 39 euros per night I had my own very clean room with a fan. My only complaint was that I was only issued with sheets and was a tiny bit cold, but the manager later informed me I need only have asked and blankets would have been given. The room is spotlessly clean and serviced every day. The family who run the hotel were so honest, I left valuables and cash in my room without thinking about it. Very close to the Anton Martin metro (two stops from Gran Via). Main shopping district 5 mins walk, on a lively pedestrianised street with lots of super cafes and tapas bars. The nightlife in the area isn't as heavy as in some other areas (Chueca, for example), but is still full of life and local colour.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bridgetown, Barbados", "Title": "\u201cVery basic, very clean, great location, warm welcome, terrific value\u201d", "Author": "Forgot_my_2thbrush", "ReviewID": "UR110739950", "Content": "I know we're going to sound like relatives of the owners - we're not. My teenage daughter and I stayed for 4 nights the week before Easter and had a great time. We wanted to spend our budget seeing galleries and drinking & eating, so the central location suited us well. But for 25 euros a night I expected a hell-hole. I was prepared to strip a plastic mattress-cover off the bed, and buy myself a decent pillow. I packed earplugs. The hostal is on the 4th and 5th? floors of an old apartment block. The reception area (next to the owners' apartment) is nothing snazzy, but you won't spend any time there, apart from paying your bill (after you arrive, in cash: they take card details over the phone / by email just to secure your booking), or collecting your luggage (they were happy for us to leave it after we checked out on our last day). Our room on the next floor up was as small and bare as a monk's cell, but I hate kitsch hotel-room-artworks, so that suited us! Crispy white sheets, pillows were fine, plenty of hangers in the cupboard, and the room and en-suite were spotless. Enough hot water for 2 toasty showers each morning. What's even more amazing (for 25 euros each) was that the room was cleaned and made up and the towels changed every day. Lopez madre y padre speak very little English but padre was very welcoming. Their adult daughter Nuria speaks excellent English and was warm and charming, recommending a great restaurant around the corner for the (late) night when we first arrived. The weather was unseasonably rainy the week we were there (though we still loved Madrid). One day when it poured during the day, Sr Lopez checked our room and closed the window so our luggage didn't get soaked. And they lent us an umbrella! Las Huertas was fantasctically central for post-prandial siestas, and great tapas bars are a gentle stroll away at either end of the street. We loved trying different cafes for breakfast. I had been worried about noise from the bars on the street, and had asked for a room at the back (which overlooked the central light-well). We never heard a peep from fellow guests, or from revellers in the street (perhaps subdued by rain?). As we were leaving I commiserated with Nuria that it had been a very quiet week and she was perplexed: she assured us the hostel was booked out! It wasn't glamorous, or even characterful, but we arrived with low expectations and were absolutely delighted. Our in-laws are planning to stop over here in summer, en route to southern Spain.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok", "Title": "\u201cHostal Lopez-good location, good people\u201d", "Author": "I_am_Fira", "ReviewID": "UR8044046", "Content": "We've just returned from a 10-day trip to Madrid and Barcelona.

Aside from small grocery shop, there's a supermarket \"Macardo Anton Martin\" near by, across street fromo metro station. Lopez family is nice, but only s. Nuria Lopez (the young lady) can speak English. The room is clean enough and towel is changed every day. Aside from good hot water, there's a central A/C if it's too warm. However, there is no elevator, so we had to climb to the thrid floor (which is on the 4th floor actually, they do not count ground fllor) We got a room on 3rd floor with one window face \"Calle Huertas\". There're lots of bar along the street around the hostal, so it's a bit noisy at night, but we managed to sleep though.
