The staff is completely incompetent and insulting. Here is my story. I booked a reservation for New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve with my girlfriend. I called the number on the website (on hotels.com) and told them I was looking for a room that overlooked the Space Needle so we could see the fireworks. The guy said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any rooms overlooking the space needle but he would give us a room where we could see the fireworks. I made it clear we were only interested in reserving a hotel room if we could view the fireworks from the room. As we will later see, this was not the case. We got to the hotel and found street parking. When we arrived at the counter the staff seemed very nice. I asked them if there was hotel parking, because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to have to move my car before the next day. They told me street parking was free on New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and they also had free hotel parking in another lot. Later I asked for one of these passes before I left to eat at a restaurant. The staff seemed good intentioned, but completely incompetent. My girlfriend is Japanese and one of the staff members told us there were a number of good restaurants in the area and then told my girlfriend there is bubble tea if she wants some. Neither of us said anything, because we both were surprised by the comment. He then continued to ask her if she likes bubble tea. It seemed like a weird and completely unprofessional thing to say, but I just thought \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whatever.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Next, we went up to the room. I looked out the window and it was a view of the other side of the building. There was absolutely no view whatsoever of fireworks or any park of the city for that matter. It was a completely blocked off view. I went back to the desk and told them we specifically asked for a room with a view of the fireworks. The lady said that there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any rooms with a view of the fireworks. I asked her why the hotel staff member on the phone said there was. She said I booked the reservation through hotels.com and they were the ones at fault, not the hotel. She said they have had problems with hotels.com in the past. She said there was nothing she could do and that I could try to cancel my reservation through hotel.com if I wanted to. I told her we had nowhere else to go and we were promised a view of the fireworks (it actually said we wanted a view of the Space Needle on the reservation printout she gave me). I said they need to take responsibility for hotels.com mistakes if they are going to contract with them. After attempting to reason with her for way too long she finally told me I they would tell hotels.com they would grant the cancellation and that I could still stay in the room. When we finally got to the point of speaking with hotels.com and giving her the phone to grant the permission she said to me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so we are going to cancel your reservation and that means you are going to have to check out of the hotel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At this point I was extremely frustrated. I told her she just told me a second ago that she said I could stay in the hotel for free. Long story short, it got to the point where I finally reasoned with her. She called her manager and asked him if I could stay in the room for free and the manager granted that (side note: while she was on the phone with the manager the bubble tea guy was telling me in a very illogical, confusing way that the hotel was full and I might not be able to stay there unless the manager granted it. I told him we already had a room. Long story short, these two hotel staff were complete idiots). The next day\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I went to checkout and there were two new hotel staff at the counter (these two were middle age, so I figured they might be a little smarter due to life experience). The lady took my room keys and parking pass. She said she was going to charge me $15 for parking. I told her the hotel staff told me it was free and that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even use the pass because I was lucky enough to find street parking again. She said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I see on the computer what happened last night. Parking is $15 and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m charging it to your card.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I told her again that the hotel staff told me it was free. In a very aggressive tone she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a con artist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was shocked. She told me she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to listen to my side of the story. This business does not deserve to stay in business. If you believe this situation is unacceptable, then please do not support this business. If you simply just need a place to stay and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deal with the hotel staff, then this place is just fine. The rooms are clean and comfortable.

It's nearly as loud with the window shut. I started with a room that faced north towards the next building, a new blue 5 story. The people in that building were INCREDIBLY LOUD. It turns out it's a home for recovering drug addicts. They stay up late and play music and have loud arguments. After 5 nights of that I moved to a room that faced the inner courtyard. It was even noisier because now I was listening to the people and TVs from the 20 other rooms that faced the courtyard. On the bottom floor of the courtyard they rent to people with pets. One night an unattended dog barked all night. Almost no sleep for me. After staying here for weeks, I would say that it only gets quiet enough to sleep at about 1 AM. I had to get up at 6:30 for work, so this was not good. Most nights it was like trying to sleep at a fraternity party. Lots of young people staying up late, talking loudly, laughing and drinking. Personally, I love doing that from time-to-time myself. Just never at a hotel with others who don't want to listen to me. Also, the neighborhood is VERY BAD, and I've lived in Alphabet City in Manhattan. On 2nd and Bell (1 block from the hotel) there are drug dealers on ALL 4 CORNERS all night. There are also prostitutes and drug addicts. I spoke with a beat cop about it, and he was fully aware and strongly suggested I avoid that area at night. Said it was a huge problem and dangerous. He said they are trying to do something about it, but wouldn't elaborate. I'm not trying to bash this hotel. Like I said, it;'s clean and nice. Also the front desk is as helpful as they can be.
