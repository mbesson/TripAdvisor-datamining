The Regal Hotel was not at all what I was expecting after reading some of the negative reviews on TripAdvisor and other places. Many complained about the hotel\u2019s night clubs\u2019 noise reaching the upper floors, disturbing sleep. Well, truth be told, the real reason I decided to stay here was out of curiosity of seeing what those clubs were about. Getting to sleep would not be much of an issue though. Where I work, loud aircraft and unexpected explosions are quite normal, so a light bass thump is relatively benign for me. Ironically, I never made it to clubs, nor could I hear them. And this was on a Friday night. Check-in was fast and efficient, and the employees were easy on the eyes. The room was clean and comfortable. Hot water worked right away. Climate controls, no problem. Room smelled pleasant. On the negative side, it was a bit smaller than what I was expecting, and there was a small amount of mildew (see pic) on the shower tiles near the faucets. This area is very central. A grocery store (Spinneys) is nearby, and there is plenty of shopping within walking distance.

We got to the hotel about 6 hours before check-in, the lad on reception would not let us check in early or use any bathroom facilities - rubbish service here, considering we had been traveling on an overnight flight that took 8 hours and we were both very tired. But they did lock our suitcases away. We got back later and got to the hotel and our suitcases were left outside in the foyer next to the entrance!!! Anyone could have taken them - rubbish. Check in was swift and they gave us some fruit juice when we checked in. We specifically asked for a room on one of the top floors - we had read reviews about the noise coming from the night club on the 1st floor. And they gave us a room on the 6th floor. The baggage lad was very friendly and did his best with our suitcases. Our room was ok, big room, loads of space, nice firm bed, the air con was spot on. And during the nights we could not hear a thing - brilliant. My wife noticed that the mini bar was missing some items, so I notified reception to ensure that we did not get charged, and the lady on reception noted this. Our room could have done with a good vac, I found a dead beetle ext to the curtain. The shower room was an interesting place, nice and clean, very bright. There was a drain that water from the water hose went down, this drain had flies coming out of it - I just killed them and it was ok. The toilet flush was not very powerful, so I just used the water hose next to the toilet in the toilet. On one night the hot water system for the entire hotle stopped working, but this was fixed the next day at 10am. The electric plugs will give you a fright - I managed to get sparks coming out of one, when trying to recharge our camera. I phone housekeeping and they were up in 5 mins to show me how the plugs worked. The location off this hotel is fantastic. Only 5 mins walk to one of the main underground stations, which take you all over Dubai. Only 5 mins to the Burjman shopping centre. There are loads of small good value shopping centers all within 5 minutes walk. They were building another underground station right outside the hotel. The Indian area is only about 10 mins walk away - loads of bargains. 15 mins walk to the creek. We found that if you speak the lingo, then you get more attention. It's really a hotel run by asians, for asians. The breakfast was okish, just make sure you get there early, one the food has gone, they don't bring any more out. The bar on the ground floor was excellent - cheap food and drink and they had Sky. The nightclub on the 1st floor was an eyeopener. Some interesting ladies coming and going. But form what I could see, the club was a dive. There is a guy in the foyer who sells excursion tickets, eg desert safari. Barter HARD with him to get the price that YOU want to pay, we booked all of our trips with him including a day trip to the capital. The swimming pool (or big bath) looked dodgy. Overall, we had a good stay in the hotel, it was quiet and secure. I would recommend this hotel to a friend, just bear in mind that it's not the Ritz.

The room was a double supreme, and they were going to put in a another single bed but the bed was more than large enough for three. Nice big flat screen TV with a range of satellite channels. Plenty of cupboard space. Breakfast - there is a good spread of food, they always have English fry up items, an Indian option (alloo puri, dosa etc) American pancakes and then your usual cold items - cereals, toast, croissants, pastries. Location - If you are going to Dubai and you are wanting to be close to Meena Bazaar than this place is for you. It is practically across the road and we went every day.

McDs and KFC opposite and plenty of other eateries open till early hours of the morning. General \u2013 As some other have mentioned, this hotel does mainly cater for Asians as it is Indian owned and run. The club is a little loud and so I am glad we requested a room on a higher floor. We were on the 5th floor and the disco did not disturb us. The swimming pool is a little abandoned and looks rarely used \u2013 not very inviting.

As many of the reviews note, the hotel is merely 'ok'. It covers the basics which we have all now come to expect from international standard hotels: tv, minibar, bathrooms with extra towels, soaps etc. basic cupboard space, small desk and chairs, in-room safe. What made the Regal somewhat different from other hotels in this class (in my experience) is the size of the room - it was really quite large and boasted a king size bed. However, from this point on, things dont look quite as good. Upon arrival, the man at reception did not acknowledge us (I travelled with a colleague) as we stepped up to the counter, nor did he for several seconds afterwards... he just continued his work. With a mouth hanging open (no jokes), he looked up at me and said hello and asked for our booking details in a most matter-of-fact way. The first impression left me tainted. There was just no extra mile attitude and I felt like I was bothering him for the entire stay. The other reception ladies were all from Eastern descent and could not speak English well, so I was often diverted to the 'English speaking gentleman' for queries when calling reception. Things just always felt hard to achieve. My colleague requested a wake-up call and they missed it by 1hr! All service was not bad. I needed the in-room safe opened and this was done promptly and staff was friendly and well spoken. Staff at breakfast was also very polite. Breakfast is served in an extension of the lobby (weird) and is quite tacky really (American Bar at night). There is also an pub in the lobby and it is clearly a local sport hangout as multi-national flags grace both the entrance and the lobby. On the next level there is a club that is extremely loud. Book for floor 7/8 at the very front of the hotel as any other room must surely be blasted by that noise. (i cant actually believe that they alow it to be so loud). Hotel sits in a good neighbourhood, with easy access to Taxi's. The Dubai creek is 10 mins walk away. The building however sits on a large traffic circle that is currently under construction. Dont expect any pretty views. Rooms have old carpets, broken, burnt and dirty in the corners, so if you look close, you'll find ample eeekkk moments. Lastly, the fitness room is fine, but the pool area and \"health spa\" is just gastly. The creepiest I've seen in a long time. This hotel seems to run on a mix of local support and the need for budget travelers to find accomodation in Dubai (of which there is plenty).

OK but no frills. Good sports bar serves plenty of brands of alcohol including Stella. The bar food was suprisingly very good. Breakfast is poor but I guess OK as it was included in the room rate. Pool is small and doesn't get sun all day. Location is good - I walked to the nearest Mall most nights to eat also walked to the creek.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cFalse advertising on internet-hotel area under construction\u201d", "Author": "couple1", "ReviewID": "UR16463034", "Content": "No Jacuzzi-Broken, covered in plastic. Looks it has not been used for for long time. No coffee shop. Not suitable for vegetarians. Swimming pool-half full-poor condition, dirty. Bollywood cafe has 6-7 girls dancing on stage every night and men giving them money. Only suitable for batchelors. Internet picture of hotel is false.On internet hotel is next to buildings. These have been demolished and turned into a roundabout with construction work. Bur Dubai is under construction as a railway is being built until end of 2009. Roadworks. Evidence attached in pics. No taxis available in bur dubai. One taxi driver told us that they do not go to bur dubai as it is congested with diverted traffic and due to the building work. Hotel said more than 2 hrs wait for a taxi and will not chase this for you. Hotel has 1 driver for airport transfers but this is not free. 'No easy access to banks, business and shopping'.'Pool is not temperature controlled'. Very congested traffic in Dubai and not a holiday destination. Good fofr shopping only. Bathroom-cracks on floor and tiles. Little holes in the bathroom tub. Toilet seat broken when we arrived. Dvd player not working in room. 'No spa tub or turkish bath'. 'Hotel does not offer a shuttle bus to and from the airport'. 'Taxi is not available 24 hrs a day'. Have to wait more than 2 hrs. Window in room has no lock and is open at all times. Dangerous if on top floor. 'A bus service runs to city centre' Have to wait more than 1 hr due to roadworks. Whole of Dubai is under construction and hotel is located on a roundabout. Would not advice any holidaymakers to visit Dubai until end of 2009.
