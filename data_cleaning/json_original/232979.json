I took my daugher on a 10 day, 3 country trip to Europe in March, our first European trip. We booked the Malaspina thru a Travel Agent in advance for 3 nights. Unfortunately, the reviews we read about Malaspina prior to going were pretty spot on....that the hotel was OK and decently located but the desk staff were very unfriendly. The hotel is located just a short walk from the train station. It's also an easy walk to all the major attractions and shopping in Florence. The market was just blocks away. We never took a cab. The hotel is pretty basic. We did get a comfortable room on the first floor that was directely behind the front desk...it was very spacious and looked out on the park across the street. There was little noise even though we were at street level. Our room came with a breakfast buffet which was just average in comparison....Spain was about the same and France was much, much better in terms of breakfast. The front desk staff at Malaspina turned out to be not very friendly just as others warned via TripAdvisor, and in particular Luca was downright rude and arrogant. He was ok the night we checked in when we asked where we could eat some decent pasta nearby. He said the name of a place but said it was often busy so he would call to check if there was a wait. He spoke in Italian so we had no idea what he was saying, then sent us on our way. When we found the place, the menu was posted but we wanted simpler fare as we were tired from traveling all day. We went to a different place. The next night, Luca very rudely asked me why we didn't go to the restaurant. I told him, and he shot back that he had made a reservation for us. He NEVER told us that and we never asked him to make a reservation for us, we only asked for a recommendation. Apparently he lost his kickback for sending us to the restaurant. After that, he continued to be rude and even went so far as to not assist a visitor/friend who was trying to find us in the hotel. We had even gone out to talk to Luca to tell him we expected a visitor that last night. Yet somehow he could not connect us. This caused a lot of heartache to our visitor and to us. We complained before we checked out to the manager as we felt Luca was retaliating over the restaurant issue. The manager basically said there was no way that Luca would do such a thing and of course Luca lied his butt off. In all of our trip, this was our worst experience with customer service. Every other hotel we stayed in in Europe was extremely helpful and friendly just as we try to be wherever we travel. I will say that the manager at Malaspina at least was helpful in storing our bags that last day...seemingly to make up for Luca. Too bad, one bad employee has to spoil an otherwise pleasant experience. Luca has no business being in a customer service job and management should recognize that.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR600643435", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Love2Travel052"}, {"Content": "A Cozy Getaway We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights recently and loved our stay as the room was clean, well decorated and spacious enough for a 3 member family.

While the location of this hotel is near a park - Independnza (a calm and peaceful location), its not easy to locate and navigate to this hotel from the station as the streets from station to the hotel are narrow, were dug up and crowded. On the brighter side, there is a nice flee market near the hotel that opens everyday from 9.30 am.

Decent accommodations. The only bad memory for us is that the front desk person got us confused with another female group and we were meeting a friend who is Italian and he kept telling her we were out when we were waiting in the hotel room for her call.

It is close enough to walk to from the train terminal (unless you have a ton of luggage). Florence is a pretty easy city to get around and we had no problem at all walking to all of the sights around town. It was only a 5 minute walk to the Accademia Museum. The hotel room was nice but nothing elaborate. There was kind of a funny smell in the air but once we opened the window it went away. The bathroom is small but perfectly acceptable. Room was clean which is what's most important.The breakfast is good but minimal. You can get a drink there but there is not really a bar so to speak. There is one girl on the staff that was very helpful to us but the rest of the staff that we spoke with were not especially friendly or helpful. The one thing that really upset me about this hotel is that we did some laundry while we were there and they charged us a ridiculous amount for it. It was certainly less than a full load of laundry and they charged us over 99 Euros for it! I complained and asked for a manager but there was nobody in at the time. Apparently they had prices on the 2nd sheet of the laundry form but no prices on the first page. I felt like it was trickery and told them so. I expected it to be expensive to do laundry at a hotel but I found this charge to be way out of line. The guy at the desk at the time didn't really care that I was upset either.

However it is a bit farther away from some of the main Firenze attractions than many of the other hotels (which is a plus in my mind, you're out of the 'storm')- our room was on the via Nazionale side which has car/truck noise 24x7 if the window is open (none when window closed, but then the room was a bit stuffy). Possibly the rooms on the Piazza Indipendenza are quieter, it's worth asking (and also you'll have more of a view, with trees)- the hotel is only a five minute walk from the train station if you walk very fast, not possible if you are lugging bags. Closer to 10-15 minutes especially if the sidewalk is crowded. Same to the Duomo et al- we liked the unpretentious spaghetteria (there's a nice garden-ish room in the back) right down the block on the via Nazionale as well as the little cafe across the piazza from the hotel (corner of Nazionale)- 2 out of the 4 front desk staff we interacted with were not friendly, although one seemed to warm up after the first couple of days. One was on the phone (not with customers, seemingly) almost constantly. The others were fine.- the towels were indeed great, fluffy, large- our room (a triple) was fine, nothing amazing but good for a 3-star- the breakfast was also fine, better than some, worse than others. On the first morning no one came by to offer espresso/capuccino so we didn't know it was available, and the other coffee is not good.

The hotel was very clean and the room we stayed in was very spacious - bigger than rooms in hotels we've stayed in for three times the price. By the way, do not book direclty with the hotel. We used an online agency and it was less than half the price that it would have cost direct with the hotel.Breakfast was included in the price and was a very well laid out buffet style with pastries, cereal, yogurts, eggs, fruit, etc. There is no restaurant there, but with so many only a few minutes walk away, it's not an issue. There is a lovely small bar on the ground floor though. Parking is dealt with by the hotel - you drop the car off, they park it for you and when you want it again you have it within ten minutes.

Anytime we asked a question it was like we were putting them out of their way. The breakfast was just okay; but the worst of our four destinations. The staff entered our room severals times a day, even if we had the Do Not Disturb sign up. We did not feel like guests. Our room was large, but empty and very plain. The bathroom looked nice, however the lights were broken and their were sewer fumes coming into the room. When we mentioned this to the front desk, their response was to just keep the door closed. We were not impressed with Florence in general. We heard many similar complaints from other tourists we met. If you're not into art, the only good thing about Florence is Piazza Michelangelo where you can see the beautiful skyline of Florence. We tried to get out of Florence, but the trains were on strike so we were trapped. We recommend staying in the countryside of Tuscany and taking a day trip or two to Florence.
