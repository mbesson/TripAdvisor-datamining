Although it is called a suite, it is really 1 room, but the desk area is separated by a partition from the sleeping area. There was plenty of space, especially closet space and the bathroom was nicely appointed. Hardwood floors were a plus. It appears from hotels.com that there are 2 types of suites but I think they are all the same. Big TV with some movies in English with Spanish subtitles, coffee in room and a refrigerator, A balcony from our room looked out over the street. We would stay here instead of the zona rosa because it is much quieter. The staff is very helpful. There are English speakers during the day, but the night staff mostly spoke only Spanish. They appreciate it when you attempt to speak Spanish.It is a short walk (3 blocks) to the Zona Rosa, and about 6 blocks to the metro. Buses run all day to the Zocolo and Chapultapec Park along the Reforma. Very safe neighborhood, even late at night. There is a nice pastry store if you continue away from the Reforma on Rio Amazones and turn right at the first street. It is about 2 blocks down on the left side of the street.", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR736531934", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "avid_gardener"}, {"Content": "Execellent Place for short/long stay this hotel located in the center of Mexico City, just right across street from shopping center Reforma 222.It's extremely clean, new and convenient.price is also a bargain, $80-85USD/daily.I highly recommend this hotel yet hope this hotel will not become overbooked due to so many people have written good thing about them~", "Date": "Oct 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR438861693", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ontheroadTp"}, {"Content": "A nice little minimalist hotel at a great price I stayed here for 4 nights in October and found the front desk staff to be super. I arrived very early in the morning and they let me check in to my room even though it was hours before check in time. The only problem I had was the housekeeping forgot to make up the room one day. I had a superior king room. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had no trouble sleeping.The hotel is on a quiet street just off La Reforma and its a few blocks walk to Zona Rosa.", "Date": "Oct 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR279730177", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ncalad"}, {"Content": "Great Place To Stay in Mexico City! Contrary to many of the previous review I had a marvelous experience at this place. Maybe things have improved but some of the poor reviews were quite recent. The junior suites were fabulous value for money and the service from the staff was truly excellent, and I have stayed at all levels of hotels all over the world on my business trips. The suite was excellent with a large flat screen TV and DVD player at the end of the bedroom. There was no breakfast included but what do you expect for $65 per night when you get a suite!I will be staying there again when I next visit Mexico City. A great central location as well and near to mall the local public transport which is very low cost. Just don't get into a street taxi - order one from the hotel and pick up a business card for them.", "Date": "Sep 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR253944017", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PhillRidgway"}, {"Content": "great location  We chose to stay at this hotel because of its contemporary design shown in pictures. Once checked in, we realized that it was also situated in a great location. Our main problem was that the staff did not really speak English. It was very tough to communicate. They meant well and were all nice but they never understood our requests. One night we asked for a plate to be sent up to our room and it took them more than 30 minutes and 2 phone calls. Our friend asked for a Taxi 2 hours in advance to take him to the airport at 11:30 am, and when we went downstairs, they hadn't even called for a car yet.The maid services were not impressive at all. Our towels had holes in them, and they would not leave kleenex, soap or water! This hotel does NOT have a kitchen regardless of what you read. Their idea of room service was 3 menues from Chilli\u9e93s, a sushi joint, and a Mexican restaurant. Their Breakfast Buffet was very small and costed $12 per person. Definitely not worth it.One really positive note I should mention was the VERY comfortable bed and pillows. The rooms are also greatly designed and pretty large.Overall, it is an adequate hotel if you speak fluent spanish and don't mind slow/non-existent room service.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR510939001", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mitsu55"}, {"Content": "Good Hotel       View of Bathroom", "Date": "Apr 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR262218924", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "dls251"}, {"Content": "Excellent hideaway amidst the chaos of Mexico City Great location between Reforma and Zona Rosa.
