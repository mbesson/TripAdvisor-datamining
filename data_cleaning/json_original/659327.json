{"Reviews": [{"Content": "\"Dirty Anini\" My wife and I spent a few days in Aniniraka. A small boutique hotel with nice pool behind the property, and nice rice field view from each room. But sorry Aniniraka, we didn't like the room, it was dirty, dusty and not well maintained. The hard mattress was only covered directly with bedlinen, it was slippery and for sure not comfortable. Toilet and bad were not well maintained and even smelly. Behind the bed I found dust and dust and again dust.Not to forget, though we are actually easygoing people, but this was not acceptable, every day we had to fight with thousand insects and ants in our room (bed, dining table, toilet). My wife complained this also to bell boy and receptionist, but they just brought us an insect spray - Baygon, and we had to solve it by ourselves.Our breakfast was so scanty, and cheap made. The good thing was only the fresh juice.One night we caught a voyeur in front of our room, it was approx. at 11pm , the guy was trying to look into our bedroom. As we complained, he mentioned he was the hotel security and was looking for cats. Ridiculous!Again sorry Aniniraka, you still have to improve your service, quality and cleanliness.", "Date": "Dec 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR260758371", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Franka_8"}, {"Content": "we will be back! for sure......... our travel arrangement (my balinese friend) choosed this resort for us. we spent 4nite at this 'peace n quite' resort, this place is nearly hiding frm ubud 'hectic' area.. the rooms, the staff and its facilities are excelent.. we are really enjoy to stay n will be back again soon! as soon as we open the door we will see the green rice terrace in front of us.. while we spent our morning time in the cozy pool.. when we feel bit sturfing.. the hotel staff bring our breakfast for us in the pool area what a simple way!
