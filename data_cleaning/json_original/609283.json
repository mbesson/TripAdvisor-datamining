{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Like Fawlty Towers without the humour Without doubt the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. We paid for three nights in advance and left after two, without bothering to ask for a refund on the unused night. The food was terrible, location ordinary with decor lifted from an early James Bond film.Like most travelers, we are used to the the occasional rudeness and indifference of hotel staff, but this was the first time for us where we actually felt threatened.My wife is Italian, so at least we were able to comunicate. People who can't speak Italian would find this place impossible. This place has nothing to recommend it. If you're really stuck in this town without a bed, you'd be better off sleeping in the car.", "Date": "Apr 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR689168659", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "AustraliaWanderers"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d609283-r5017144-Hotel_Ebe-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "609283", "Price": "$128"}}
