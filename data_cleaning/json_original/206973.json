The distance is walkable if you feel like wandering around with no predetermined destination. It would take about 45 minutes to an hour. The good thing is that the route is downhill. Nevertheless as I mentioned before the metro is quick and efficient and the metro entrance is located in front of the hotel entrance. The hotel occupies a compound of buildings. The reception and some rooms are in one block, the bigger rooms / suites (where I stayed) are in a different building and the restaurant is located on a third building. It is quite nice having to walk out into the fresh air to move between buildings. The exterior of the buildings themselves need some cleaning and paint. It actually gave me a bad first impression when I arrived, but on the next few days I didn't care for this so much, perhaps it reflects the general condition of the city and rather than run-down it looks normal after a while. The interior on the contrary is impeccable, furniture and spaces in good condition, good air quality and cleanliness. Our room was a superior room. A small suite with entrance hall, reception room, bedroom, bathroom and two closets. TVs in both rooms, minibar (expensive), stereo, safe and bathroom with full set of toiletries. The bed was very comfortable, not soft but firm. The window view, facing to the south was questionable. On the mid distance there was an amazing old brick tower of great architectural interest, but right under our window there was a parking lot/distribution centre for the street cleaning rubbish collection service of the city. To be fair, we never opened the window and didn't get any smells and during the daytime the shutters had to be down to stop the summer heat so there was nothing to see anyways. I would say that the best aspect of this hotel was the personal service and the breakfast buffet. The restaurant space is beautiful and comfortable. The food was plenty. Eggs, breads, pastries, cereals, local cheeses and hams. Fresh fruits, cakes, churros con chocolate, several types of fresh juices. The attention of the ladies in the restaurant was excellent, always smiling and helpful. There is free wi-fi but only in the lobby space. I would also like to add that I appreciated the fact that the hotel uses energy from renewable resources and seems to have a number of initiatives that reflect its care for the environment.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tribiano, Italy", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel with home as room & full range of breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "IngLele", "ReviewID": "UR131765834", "Content": "3 building form NH Hotel Prisma which are standard flats as hotel's rooms.

About 15 mins into the centre of Madrid via the excellent and cheap underground system - however if I go to Madrid again I will staying at a hotel in the centre. NHS Prisma is not suitable or designed for kids. Flew in from Edinburgh with Easyjet - excellent flight - no delays, arrived early. I have had several flights with Easyjet now and was apprehensive about using them at first. I have never had a problem with them. Landed at Madrid later than the other blokes I was with who were flying from London - got my way from the airport to the hotel by Tube - pretty easy. I think it only cost E2 which is amazing value. The weather was a bit cold and wet but we found plenty to do - walking round the town, having a look at an art gallery, watching sport in the various and numerous pubs we visited. Ate the lovely ham till it was coming out of my ears - lots of restaurants to choose from. Had an interesting \"lunch\" on the Saturday when we wandered into the old town and found an old sherry bar. It was a beautifully run down place - decor about 40 years out of date - bar tab written in chalk on the counter - bottles of sherry filled directly from barrels. Wonderfully surly barman - wouldn't let us take pictures of his bar. A peculiar lunch but a great experience. As seems to be the norm, one of our party was pick-pocketed on a late night wander round town. No violence just 3 guys \"offering advice\" on which club to go to - a pat on the back here, a tap on the shoulder there.

Per the other reviews, we asked for a room \"away from the fire station\", and I think we insulted them, so they put us right next to the fire station. Sigh. Our air conditioner wheezed out a few gasps of coolish air, and after a fitful nap (post flight), we went to the front desk and asked to be moved. The a/c in the second room was perfect, and the second room was now on the side AWAY from the fire station, so we were very relieved. We stayed for 4 nights. A comment on the restaurant: we ordered two bowls of gazpacho, and the price was 27 Euros. Say what? I'm still mad at myself for falling for that. The next day, out for a stroll to explore the area, I took a right out of the hotel and walked for a couple of blocks, and stumbled on this cool little juice bar, where you can get gazpacho, fresh juice, and mineral water for 9 Euros. MUCH better. And they have beer. In the morning, we'd take a left out of the hotel, walk by the fire station (make sure to take a peek at the fire trucks...hysterical! Covered with pretty cool graffiti), and a block down there's a little bar on the corner where you can have the world's best cafe con leche and pastries. if you so much as use just a couple of Spanish words, you'll be rewarded with a big grin.
