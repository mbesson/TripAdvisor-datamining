We booked before reading TripAdvisor reviews so were in some trepidation when we did seeing the negative comments re room size. We needn't have worried. Yes the rooms are not large by any means but they are fit for purpose, clean and functional. Perhaps those who found their rooms too small couldn't see that the location (less than 5 minutes with heavy cases from Paddington Station) and so close to Hyde Park (a 5 minute stroll) and the top end of town i.e. Marble Arch easily outweighs this minor glitch. The price too should be considered, we paid \u00a384 per night for a double on the third floor and had seen similar rooms nearby for much more than that. The staff were unfailingly friendly, helpful and approachable, nothing was too much trouble and all done with a genuine smile and grace.

It is an older hotel and looks very worn away from the desk area, internet in mediocre at best and very intemittant WIFI.

Very small rooms however they were clean enough but very dated and in need of updating. I travel in my proffesion and i stay in very good hotels most of the time with helpfull staff. The hotel provided an iron in a room next to reception, my boyfriend ironed a top of mine and it had a sticky substance on it which evidently ruined my top, i called recetion to inform them and ask to talk to a manger; there wasn't one available and i advised them about the incident. I unfortunalty didn't take photoraphic evidence which i should of as when we checked out the management were very unfriendly and rude to me accusing me of trying to get away without paying the bill, i never wanted that i jus twanted them to take responsiblity of this and at least deduct the cost of my top (which was 3 weeks old) off the bill. They told me there wasn't a problem with the iron but i assume they cleaned it when i called down the night before to cover themselves, not wanting to address the situation!! As this then made me late for a birthday party due to me having to change my outfit i didn't take a photo of the iron.. Lesson learnt don't stay in unproffesional hotels with staff from different countries who treat you very badly and do not communicate well or have the same standards as you woud like to receive. I have been in the service industry many years and would never treat a customer the way the manager did me she needs to go on a management training course and attain some people skills..", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dresden", "Title": "\u201cGood rate for London Hotel.

Hotel is small but fine with us. Near to Paddington underground and main station (3 mins walking). Was given a room next to the lift and too small for my family. Request a larger room and was given the following day. Request room not next to lift. Human noise. The room is fine and clean ut small. Toilet is very small. You cannot really moved around while showering. Maybe because of the price. Breakfast was simple, cheese and ham with plenty of tea, coffee, oj and bread. In fact, there were many food outlet around the hotel and shops too. Near one of the tourist attraction, St Mary's Hospital. Love the fish and chips from Mickey nearby. Very fresh. You need to walk around the hotel to explore the shops nearby. Plenty of taxi if you near but remember to take only meter taxi. My boy and wife enjoyed London. We travel on an open bus top to visit places of interest. It is very safe to travel by train but there are many lines and you near to understand how the system works. Purchase whole day pass which is cheaper for train ride. Try their chinese food. Visit their China town in Oxford street. Like their chinese food. We were from Singapore and food to us is important.

The bathroom though was tiny with your knees virtually on the washbasin when you used the toilet, however this was cancelled out by the fab shower which was always hot! The cleaning and doemstics were also good. The breakfast wasn't great with the usual fair cornflakes, bread, butter, jam, cheese and ham! Not great for a wheat intolerant veggie like me but more than adequate for the price. The staff were generally ok but on a couple of occasions we were ignored at the reception desk while a conversation was carried out in a foreign language behind the desk!

I have never refused to stay in a hotel room before in my life, but here the decision was instant. The room had to be accessed via some kind of service elevator at the rear of the building and was so far up in the rooftop that I couldn't stand up in half of it. It was damp & rickety with wallpaper peeling & a view over slums - oh hang on, that was the rest of the hotel I was looking over. I had to leave the room so my friend could turn around & follow me out. The bathroom was so small I actually laughed when I saw it. Mind you it wasn't the size that bothered me so much, it was the 1950's decor. I don't mind \"old and clean\" but this was so old it was impossible to even tell if it was clean. I had just given up a fantastic large room in Covent Garden for 50 pounds a night & here I was checked into a scene out of wartime poland for 55 / night. I returned to reception to say I refused to stay in the room & the staff were actually fantastic. They offered me an upgrade into Aspen Suites (within the same building & run by the same staff) for a 8 pounds extra and it was delightful in comparison - freshly refurbished, kitchen, washing machine, dvd player, iron etc. Anyone thinking of getting a single room in this place should seriously consider doing the same. There was a note on the door however which had me perplexed, forbidding guests from cooking in their rooms. Strange considering I had an oven, hotplate, sink, benchtop, fridge... frying pans...kitchen. Location wise - I don't think Paddington is as good as people say it is. Convenient to Heathrow - yes. But it's nothing like being in the theatre district. Praed St is busy, a little rugged & devoid of atmosphere. You'll be lucky if you hear another english speaker during your stay. There are 200 identical-looking hotels in the same street (90% of them with bed bugs I'm sure) - and although there were no bed bugs in Abbey Court, of the 3 London hotels I have stayed at in the past 3 weeks, that single room was worth 20 pounds max. The staff however are cheerful & positive and can be fun late at night. The lobby is great - neon waterfalls & clean. If you sit on the edge of the waterfall and put your bag on the seat someone will tell you off for being sloppy. Laughable considering what they are tring to sell upstairs. There is a great sandwich shop 2 doors around the corner that sells fantastic egg & bacon ciabattas. And the Halal fish & chip shop is also surprisingly good after a few too many nightcaps in one of the nearby pubs. I will never stay in a single room at the Abbey Court again. I might stay at Aspen Suites again if my other favourites are unavailable.", "Date": "December 12, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Abbey Court Hyde Park", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d279517-Reviews-Abbey_Court_Hyde_Park-London_England.html", "Price": "$109 - $228*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">174 Sussex Gardens</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Hyde Park</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 1TP</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "279517", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ea/16/ea16590d4dd412ec5faf96fc04edc5ff7large.jpg"}}
