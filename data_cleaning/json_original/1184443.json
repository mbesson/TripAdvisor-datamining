I had a three night stay at Hotel Evsen. It was my first journey to this town, but not the last one. Before my journey I read very many good reviews about this hotel, so I decided to book a room from there. I made my room booking via internet travel agency and chose in the beginning the standard room with quite cheap price. After I read some Tripadvisor recommendations I changed my room to deluxe one with small balcony and a view to the street. It was late Friday evening when I came to the old town in Istanbul. I came to the city from Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk airport by metro and by tram. The nearest tram stop to the hotel is G\u00c3\u00bclhane. The hotel is located about 200 meters from the tram stop but for me it took a few moments to find the hotel, because the there were not any lights on the hotel sign. The location of the hotel was nice. During the evenings and night times the old city is peaceful and quiet area. But If you would like to have an active night life in the bars the old city is not the best area for that. In that case you should maybe choose the hotel from Beyo\u00c4\u0178lu area. But for me the hotel location in old town was perfect. All the major sights were in the walking distance. The reception personnel in the hotel were warm and welcoming. But the deluxe room was a quite disappointment for me. The room was clean and updated. But the size of the room was very small. I am not sure that the change from the standard room to a deluxe one was worth of it. Even the room was renovated there were still few small things where you noticed that the room needs either more renovation or quality of renovation made was not the best one (f. ex in the bathroom). Also the locking of the room door was not the perfect one (the locks are very easy to broken). In the room there were wifi (from the wifi unit from the corridor), tv and heat pump air conditioning unit available. Also there were empty and quite dirty and non working mini fridge. The breakfast was included in the room price. Breakfast room was located next to the reception desk. The breakfast room was very small but surprisingly not very crowded during the breakfast hours. The buffet breakfast included some tomatoes, cheese, bread, cold cuts, coffee, tea and fruits. As a summary I should say that my stay in this hotel was ok. Anyway, maybe I expected that deluxe room would be much better than it actually was (because the price of the deluxe room was much higher comparing to standard one). It would have been nice to see the quality of the standard rooms. The town of Istanbul was very nice and safe. I will go there again, but next time I will choose another hotel.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Larnaca, Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cApril 2012 at Hotel Evsen\u201d", "Author": "Sam H", "ReviewID": "UR128259502", "Content": "My wife and I spent a lovely week at the Hotel Evsen just after Easter.

We did have lots of issues which could have been avoided and that would have meant a much better stay-we booked our cab from the airport to the hotel via the hotel but they sent the cab to the wrong airport so we waited for 90minutes at the airport and still paid the premium price which was not a good start. On the next day we booked for dinner at a fish restaurant that they recommended but we never got picked up and after 45minutes of waiting we made our way to another restaurant.

We were welcomed with a big smile, a nice drink and one of the staff had given us a map of Istanbul, explained every single location on that map, it really helped me alot. The staff has the answers of all my questions, just ask them what goes on your mind. I had a problem with the WIFI signal on the THIRD floor where I stayed, the problem was solved the following day. Do not expect much from the breakfast... just remember how much you paid and you'll be sooooo satisfied like what i did. You'd find variety of food like : bread, 2 kind of cheese, boiled eggs, vegetables, olives, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, milk, cereal, 3 kind of jam, honey, butter, & cake.

Essentially an 8ft by 8ft box with a double bed taking up most of the floor and very little storage space. The shower/toilet is even more cramped. I'm not big but I had difficulty getting to the wash basin without twisting sideways. As mentioned in other reviews the walls are thin and all the sound carries from the next door rooms. The front rooms looking onto the street may be better but there are only four of these out of 24 so you have only one chance in six of getting one of them! I suppose it may be ok for a few nights if all you want to do is sleep in it and you do not mind confined spaces but there is no way I would recommend this hotel.

The aim of our coming to Istanbul was to explore the city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to go sightseeing, to visit places of interest and to enjoy the beauties of this wonderful city. So we were not planning to spend a lot of time in the hotel that is why I was not seeking for a luxurious 5-star one with a swimming pool and restaurant on the roof. We needed only a place to sleep and to take shower :-) So on our arrival to Evsen hotel we were agreeably surprised to find a very nice modern hotel just in the very heart of Istanbul. The hotel has an advantageous location: 2 minutes from G\u00c3\u00bclhane station and right in the center of tourist attractions - Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia, Topkap\u00c4\u00b1 Palace, Basilica Cistern, Archeological Museum as well as Sirkeci, New Mosque, Egyptian Bazaar, Galata bridge etc. Everything is within a 5-10 min walk. The hotel is really neat and clean. The rooms are small but very comfortable with all the necessary amenities: satellite TV, refrigerator with the mini bar, air-conditioner (which we actually hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected for the price we paid for the room), free Wi-Fi, 24 hrs hot water, hairdryer, shampoo and soap, sleepers, room cleaning every day. Maybe the only thing missing as compared to other hotels is a kettle. But as there are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the area you would not probably used it anyway :-) I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read that some people complain about having no daylight in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Maybe there are some rooms without windows in the hotel, but these are probably the cheapest ones. As the prices in the hotel are quite reasonable I think a window (or a balcony as in our case) is worth 5 euro extra :-) Breakfast in the hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprise us with the variety of food but was really nice and could satisfy different tastes: fried eggs, several types of bread, two sorts of cheese, vegetables, watermelon, muesli, some kind of cake, butter, jam, honey, tea, coffee and milk. And I am sure that even those people who got used to a greater variety at breakfast buffet in 5 star hotels would 100 % be loaded up in Evsen. And of course, I cannot but underline the fact that the multilingual staff in Evsen hotel is very friendly and hospitable! So in general the hotel surpassed all our expectations and left an extremely pleasant impression.

In march when planning the trip I trawled Tip Advisor for suitable hotels, and Hotel Evsen came out in my top 5 choices, not and it was really a matter of picking out of a hat, since all I wanted was a middling hotel with a nice standard of room, of course one would presume a window to the outside, and nice friendly staff. I chose Hotel Evsen as well because they offered a free Transfer from Ataturk Airport, which was great since I wanted the trip to be as stress free as possible, given the trip being a special treat for my mother and the fact that she walks with a stick and therefore I didn't want to be messing about with Buses or Taxi's on arrival. Our flight was delayed since we had to stop over in Budapest due to a fault with our plane (another story) and we arrived in Istanbul 5 hours late, but I had made contact and was very pleased that our transfer driver was waiting to greet us even after the delay, this was a very good start. Unfortunately that is as good as it got. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by friendly staff who were very quick to offer their set menu from the hotel restaurant, we were of course famished and duly accepted. The food was curious, but palatable, and we ate it up and enjoyed the relaxed feeling of the glass covered seating, looking out onto the tourist packed streets and the section of Istanbul skyline. so far so good. Then we got to our rooms, and they were small but seemed ok, and they said that they were the only rooms that they had next to each other. I didn't specifically ask to be next to my mother, but was pleased that they had made the effort to apparently make us happy. When I entered the room and felt the heat I immediately opened the window, it was to my horror that the window opened to a shaft that was pitch black and had Water pipes directly outside, at first I thought the heat was getting to me, so I put my head right outside the window to see if I could see the sky, no all I could see was pipes, humming to the sound of other peoples excrement running down to the sewer, which by the second day seemed as if it was specifically in my room. I complained to the Hotel staff and asked if at the very least they could move my mother since her room was exactly the same, and they said that they would do all they can to accommodate us, and to their credit they moved my mother to what they call a Deluxe Double, which means that it actually has a window that leads to the outside. in fact it had a French balcony which was nice and made me more comfortable with the situation. They told me that they may be able to move me the next night, but I decided to save the hassle and make do, even though my room had begun to smell of excrement as the drain was letting off the most acidic fumes, and it was not my doing as I may have eaten a lot of Kebabs and exotic Mezes, I generally spent little time in my own bathroom, and definitely not enough time to create a smell of that magnitude. The cleaners also didn't seem to be able to read the Do Not Disturb signs, even though they were written in about 10 languages, and they on two occasions entered my mothers room when she was in there, luckily for me they didn't attempt to get into mine (maybe lucky for them too given the heat and my lack of clothes when sleeping) I could go on, but I think you get the picture... On the plus side, There was one member of staff who was very accommodating and seemed genuine in his want to please and help, and his recommendations and hospitality were great and refreshing given that the rest of the staff fluctuated between painted on smiles and not giving a damn. One last thing, As I was unhappy with the bill when I was checking out I asked to speak to the manager and was informed that he was in Bed, Eventually the guy behind the desk called his manager who told his staff member that he would not speak to me and we would have no discount for our trouble. Eventually I got to speak to the manager who seemed completely disinterested and would not take ownership of a problem in his own hotel, I was disgusted by his tone and lack of professionalism, eventually we were given \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 off the total which we imagined would cover the transfer back to the airport. But instead we were given a minibus transfer, which would cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 per person, even though we had paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25. All in all this place is a rip off, with horrible food and mostly miserable staff, most of the rooms have no access to air or day light and what they charge is disgusting given the conditions. On the plus side it is very well situated for the Trams and all the sites in SultanAhmet and surrounding areas.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a dodgy hotel manager speaking very broken English. The first impression was not good, but we thought it was mainly because of the renovation. We reached the room using a REALLY DIRTY elevator, but nothing could have prepared us for the shock. The room, or better the cell, was so small that there was just enough space for the bed. The walls were dirty (probably because previous guest kept hitting the walls trying to move around the bed) and the smell coming from the bathroom definitely not attractive. In the cell there was just a tiny little window that turned out to be a fake one which opened onto a hole filled with pipes. That was it. No natural air circulation at all. The bathroom was definitely small, with horrible and poorely fitted tiles. The toilet was stuck between the shower and a wall, the space was so small that it was honestly difficult to sit down. Given the tiny size of the bathroom, there was no room for a toilet holder, which was instead graciously placed in the bedroom. Sometimes we used to say: \"I do not care if the hotel looks ugly as long as it is clean\". Well this one was not even clean. The stairs and the lobby were disgusting, in part because of the construction work, but also because it looked like nobody could be bothered to clean. The room was a bit more decent, but still way below the average. In addition to this, the sewage smell from the bathroom really disgusting. Never mind, we went out for dinner and tried to have good time. Back to the hotel however, it was impossible to rest. Our room was placed right in front of a storage area where people seemed to work all night. The walls were so thin and the door so poorly insulated that we could hear every whisper. The best has been the wake up call of our neightbouring guests using the toilet in the morning - not a great start to the day. Needless to say, that even though we had three nights booked, we checked out the following morning. I would definitely not reccommend this place to my worst enemy. It does not even suit a young backpacker, as I have stayed in hostels much better and cheaper than this horrible place.", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHotel from hell , do not stay here.....\u201d", "Author": "JSSLondon", "ReviewID": "UR28273442", "Content": "Mmmmm..... where do I start? Let's just say I have a lot to get off my chest! Let's start with the airport pickup service when we arrived from London. When charged EUR 20 for the service one would assume that you'd be collected and whisked off to your hotel, but no - we were kept waiting for nearly an hour whilst we waited for other passengers to arrive, who, incidentally were not even staying at our hotel. OK, not the end of the world we thought, but then we arrived at the hotel..... Firstly I have to say the website is thoroughly misleading, looking back I can't believe how duped we were. The look and feel of the site www.hotelevsen.com (at the time of writing) gives it the look and feel of a new, edgy boutique hotel. The dimly lit pictures.... and the \"Our Rooms\" preamble which now makes me laugh out loud....\"Hotel Evsen is offering an extraordinary ambience with the architecture and the innovative design of 26 rooms.\" Let's break that down shall we.... \"Extraordinary ambience\" - yes it certainly was extraordinary to say the least! The hotel (hereafter called crack dungeon) was certainly in no fit state to be hosting guests, partially due to the construction going on upstairs, but more importantly due to the fact that it is not actually built to the standards of a hotel, or even a hostel for that matter. We were taken up to our room (I believe it was 404) in a dirty elevator, and before entering the room I noticed it was situated opposite some sort of random service area full of toilet paper and buckets, so I tried to remain positive and felt that perhaps this was all part of the boutiquey theme. Unfortunately that was not the case and we were led into what I could only describe as a chamber of horrors. The room was about as big as my suitcase (I exaggerate, but you get my drift), the bathroom had a simply stunning aroma of sewage which would not go away, oh and the view was breathtaking - and I mean literally breathtaking as the only source of oxygen possible was through this tiny window the size of a pin head (OK, it was slightly bigger, but you get where I'm going here), which opened up... wait for it... onto a series of water pipes! OK - we took a deep breath (close to the window to ensure we didn't get our noses burnt from the aromas emanating from the bathroom), and we decided, at least for that evening, that we would try and accept our predicament and enjoy the \"architecture and the innovative design\" (their quotes, not mine) of Hotel Evsen. So, we went out for a few beers and some fabulous food in the Taksim area. Whilst we were out and about I figured that a night in a Turkish jail or hospital would have been preferable to an evening in our hotel, so I did my very best to throw myself under a bus, or at least get arrested by the Turkish police, but to no avail. So, we returned to the crack dungeon, somewhat weary, however sleep was not going to feature highly that night due to the fact that the entire property is seemingly made out of paper mach\u00c3\u00a8. We could hear every single movement, not only of the elevator going up and down all night, but of every guest, every toilet flush, every voice. By 3am I thought I was going to kill myself, but thankfully sleeping tablets eased my pain. We awoke early the next morning to the sounds of our Swiss neighbour expectorating, and it was then that we realised that we had to make a swift exit. Even though we had booked for 3 nights, we hastily logged onto the wireless internet (the one positive thing about this hotel) and reserved a room at the The Lady Diana nearby which was double the price but a true saviour of our Easter weekend and our sanity. So, as you can probably gather from my review, I would sooner eat my own young than return to this crack dungeon of a hotel.", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cEvsen has potential but I would for construction to complete\u201d", "Author": "TheBiffs", "ReviewID": "UR27975869", "Content": "Rooms are small and clean but the hotel is fresh and new and the location is good.

The rooftop restaurant is under contruction so breakfast is served on fold up chairs and tables in reception. Breakfast consist of fresh bread, jam, cheese, tomato, olives, cucumber, pink polony, orange squash / cordial, pre made strong tea and instant coffee and powdered coffee \"whitener\". Fresh milk would have been nice. The hotel arranged us an aiport pick-up, who did not pitch (so i suggest you just catch a metered taxi from the airport - it costs less). The lift was out of order on arrival, no hot water on Saturday night and the heating did not work for 2 nights. The hotel staff did address each complaint quickly (most of it seemed to relate to the construction that was going on). Bathroom could do with a hook / shelf or something to place toiletries on towels on, as your toiletries have to go on the floor. Fresh towels are provided each day and the room was tidied nicely. Construction next door and on the rooftop restaurant does not allow you to lie in.

The room we were give was tiny, it was a struggle to open the door as it was almost hitting the bed. The bed itself was pushed up against the wall at one side. There was very little storage space in the room and what little space there was in the room was taken up by our luggage. The room also stank of cigarette smoke despite it being a non-smoking room (there was an ashtray in the room). Also, there was only a tiny sliver of a window which opened up to the centre of the hotel and was blocked by pipework. Unhappy with this we asked to see other rooms. The next room we were shown had almost the exact same problems as the other, although you could actually get round both sides of the bed. However, the toilet seat in this room was broken and the shower leaked very badly onto the floor. There was also nowhere in the room to hang used towles and as there was no toilet paper holder, it was kept in the bedroom. Despite all this we thought it will do as it was a city break and we weren't planning on spending too much time in a hotel room - that was until we tried to get to sleep! We heard everything that happend in this hotel including every use of any toilet in the hotel. Needless to say this was not conducive to a good nights sleep so we done the right thing and checked out the next again morning.

We got our free pick up at the airport and it was great. We picked this hotel n stayed there for 5 nights because it was cheap and affordable in the low seasons; plus, it has free Wifi internet, which is crucial to my freelance work! But we wished we would have stayed 3-4 nights, because Istanbul wasn't so vegan friendly :( and yet a stressful city most of the times to newcomers!! CONS: * The breakfast was not so surprising. We are vegetarians/vegans so it's really difficult to eat in Istanbul. We only had cold pieces of breads with sour cherry jams and tea/apple cider (green) while the rest had buttery bread/bagels, boiled eggs, salami, salted cheese, tomatoes/cucumbers, and sour concentrated juices. * It was really noisy all morning-early afternoon due to construction (they are building a restaurant on the roof, I believe). It was all the hammering, drilling, and even buzzing onto our walls--it was annoying! But we got through the noises. But it was usually quiet in the evenings--except that since all hotel rooms have thin walls, we can still hear others coming to the elevator, or the next room. That was a bit of privacy invasion going on. *We had windows, but they are blocked by brick walls, with little light. It would be great if we can have views, but since there's construction going on, it might not be ideal. * We had a smoking room because the rooms with windows are intended for smokers, but the rooms without windows are intended for non-smokers. But we ARE non-smokers, so we still smell cigarettes under the front door. That was a bit frustrating, yes. *Since we came in the coldest month of the year, the heater sometimes shut down itself, and came back on few hours later. It's inconsistent, so you'd better wear something warm in pajamas or something like that in the room while the heater's out sometimes! There are pros about this hotel. It's budget wise, clean, new, and it has really functioning wifi internet. I had no problem with it, but if you are downloading something, it might slow your Internet down. The room is cleaned everyday. Nothing is stolen from our room, so that's great. The maid was nice, friendly and loud, that's how Turkish people are :) I really like their service and how reliable they are, despite their poor speaking English skills. It was certainly in a good, secluded location (very difficult to find if you're to ride a cab), for sightseeing and visiting the mosques and famous historical buildings, but honestly, for us, we are more like a city people, we like seeing how the city runs busily with cafes and young-mature people, restaurants, and shopping arena such as the Taksim Square. We would have stayed a hotel in Taksim Square since it's more vibrant than this hotel in Sikerci area. But it's near the tram (metro area), which is beneficial for us to ride on it, but we had to ride on it daily to Taksim Square (our favorite place to shop, eat out, and blend in). To be honest. I wouldn't return to Istanbul, but I would return to this hotel for budget-wise vacation somewhere else. I wouldn't recommend Istanbul for vegans or vegetarians (strict), but the service is great at the hotel.
