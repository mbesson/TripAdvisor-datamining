The reception area is unimpressive, smallish, dated, tired. The rooms are very basic, with old furniture, an ancient TV set, inadequate bathroom facilities. It is a hotel which remains untouched for the last 15/20 years. The TV channel selection was extremely limited, there were no amenities at all in the room, the carpet was dirty, the beds squeak. Really, not a lot can be said in its favour other than they were nice enough to give me a free ride to the airport early one morning. It is a pity because the hotel location is good, better than some of the 'modern' areas. It is more the real Dubai, a mixture of old shops, real restaurants, and a decent mall all within walking distance. There are, of course, much better hotels in the same area as the Lotus and in the same category. The Lotus is a no go-zone and should only be used as a last resort.

Not quite as good as the first stay. The room - 2nd floor, facing the street - is a bit on the small side and a bit worn. The bed was just OK; the mini-bar leaked (fixed). The closets are adequate for two, but are not very deep (same problem with our other room). You cannot put a suit, dress, or shirt in the closet without turning it a bit sideways; not a major problem, but not great either. Room had a king sized bed, desk, bureau, TV, small table and one chair. The pool on the roof is small; OK for cooling off, but you're not going to do laps. There is also a jaccuzzi, some loungers and a bar. Not too big, but OK. The reception staff tries, but is a bit under-trained. Had a scare as they misplaced our passports (kept overnight); took about 30 minutes to locate them; recommend collect your passports as soon as possible. Did not use the bar, but there were a small number of prostitutes hanging around the small lobby at night. Bellboy services were indifferent; asked to get a taxi in 20 minutes; when we got to reception, no taxt (didn't even try). We did not have many problems with taxis at Lotus, but some of the taxis we got were \"private\" taxis (guy with a car/van moonlighting; no meter, agree to the price before you take the trip). We haven't had problems with private taxis, but there could be problems. Overall an OK stay. The price is competitive with other mid-range 4* hotels in Dubai. The place is a bit worn, reception mediocre, but if you have business or want to be in the Rigga Road area, it's adequate (as long as you are not expecting the \"Dubai luxury experience.\"", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran", "Title": "\u201cterrible\u201d", "Author": "jasmin123", "ReviewID": "UR14178968", "Content": "The room was not very clean. there was a bad smell in the room.The toilet was out of order.

The first room we had unfortunately had a mattress which sagged in the middle and the 1st night was a bit uncompfy. But we told them the next day and they changed our room without hesitation.
