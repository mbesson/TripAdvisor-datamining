I will focus on some details which are I personally find of relevance. BED - Confortable for european standards, and seemed almost new. There are two pillows available for each guest, one with feather stuffing another anti-allergic so you can choose which one fits your needs best (or even take both!!). Note that for american guests, accostumed to have another matress for the basis of the matress one actually sleeps in, the bed may not seem as fluffy as the base is from flexible wood boards. I personamy prefer this model (as presented in this hotel) because it allows air to circulate under the mattress thus buildup of alergens. SMOKING - smoking is pretty big in Turkey and is allowed in almost all restaurants, cafes and public spaces. Also allowed in the hotel, so if are a non-smoker like myself, do remember to book for the non-smoking floor prior to arrival I forgot to do so and had to spend my fist night in one of the smoking floors so air quality was not so nice. WINDOWS - all windows open to allow refreshing the air in the room but this obviously means loosing sound insulation provided by the double glazing. And yes, the streets are pretty busy starting from six AM till over midnight so the trick is to leave the window open during the day as one goes out and ask the maid to keep it open. TEMPERATURE - there is central heating all over the hotel which made room temperature a little to high for the nice springly weather I was having there. Also i disrupted my sleep. Calling reception fixed the problem really fast, as immediatly tech support came to the room and closed the local dispenser of heating (water-based irradiator). Then room temperature could easyly be adjusted with the air conditioning (turning on the air-con while central heating was running had led to a mutual anihilation of effects... not productive). STAFF - very friendly, helpfull and fast in solving our difficulties with the room. Not ideal as travel guides, but then again, no one in this city seems to know the nubers of the buses going to a articular destination (not even turist information desks). BREAKFAST - wide assortment of cheeses and ham, but one must bear in mind that pork is not consumed here so ham and sausages are made from chicken or veal. Nice flavor and interestingly exotic. Also available eggs, scrambled or boiled, veggies (cucumber and tomato), fresh herbs (parsley and mint), fresh and jammed fruit and freshly squeezed fruit juices. Then of course the typical assortment of cereal, breads, muffins and croissants. Great start to the day! All in all i was very happy with the hotel and will certainly consider coming again.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "milano", "Title": "\u201cGood position for business, but not for tourism\u201d", "Author": "biancaf", "ReviewID": "UR126702300", "Content": "The hotel is jus one metro stop from Tacsim, which is an important business area and 5 minutes by taxi from the new sultan's palace.

Facing the hotel is both a metro station which can take you all the way to the Istanbul's Ataturk International airport (you need to change 2-3 stations). Many authentic Turkish restauarants are around the hotels and you can a decent cooked and tasteful Turkish meal for as little as US$ 10.

The people from main desk or concierge/ breakfast are well trained. They could arrange for hotel taxis, important thing because in Istanbul you can be easily fooled by dishonest taxi drivers who speak only Turkish. The beautiful lady manager ressponsible for client service is always there in the morning asking people about service quality. The only bad thing happend (first time for us in so many countries visited) a hotel employee entered our room and stole from my wallet which was into a backpack and not the room safe but only for a short time. I reported the situation and I got surprised the staff solved the situation very quickly and discreet. They apologized telling us the guy was newly employed and not sufficiently verified. They gave our money back together with a fruit basket and a wine bottle, the manager wanted to assure that we are pleased, in a word they acted as they should: quietly, discreet and efficiently. If you need a five star convention center and you are not so interested in city attraction this hotel is perfect but if you are a tourist first time in this beautiful and different city maybe you could choose a hotel near the Bosphorus in the old city.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cA Great Hotel, with big nice rooms and excellent service!\u201d", "Author": "JoaoGuerra", "ReviewID": "UR113860902", "Content": "I went for a mix of a business trip with a Family long weekend, and for both purposes it was perfect.

The lobby , very charming atmosphere, had coffee one night at the bar, the waiter offered a free complimentary cake, and it was just yummy ! I loved the pieces played by the piano player which varied in mood between cheerful but not noisy at all, and clam soft but not sad . It was nice to set in the lobby at mornings waiting for our tour bus and observing Istanbul wake up and watch people harrying up to their works and shops open for a new happy day :) The receptionists, bellboys were all cooperative and very friendly. Touristic magazines in the room were very helpful. Metro station was only a few steps away ! Very convenient for people used to metro systems. The neighborhood was very sophisticated.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by a jovial bellboy who took my suitcase to reception on the second floor via escalators. Check in was trouble free, and I was even upgraded to a room with a \"king size\" bed as I informed the clerk that I would much prefer a comfortable double bed instead of a single. The bellboy took me to my room and explained the basics, breakfast from seven to ten, room service, spa etc.etc. and would not leave the room without a tip in hand. The double room on the executive floor (6th) was fairly spacious, with a nice view of derelict housing over the road and the road below. Unfortunately, the bath/ shower was dirty, so I had to clean it before being able to use it as room service didnt answer. The bed is quite uncomfortable, the mattress having seen better days. Entertainment on the computer screen/ tv in the English language is extremely limited to say the least (mainly BBC news) unless you are willing to pay dearly to watch a movie or listen to music. Mini bar is average, yet again, exorbitantly priced, as are room service food and laundry services. After finally falling asleep in the early hours, I was suddenly woken by the Moazin calling the faithful to prayer at six in the morning. This mosque was using Rolling Stones grade amplification, so dont forget to close your windows ! Breakfast selection was fair, with basic salads, eggs, pastries etc. served on buffet basis. Again, if you want that small espresso for breakfast instead of the dull coffee served, get ready to pay that pretty penny again for this \"extra\"..... I would personally class this hotel in the three star region for business travellers, yet as it is so centrally located, this would be considered a 4 star \"location- location-location!\" class hotel for tourists. There is a spa / sauna etc. in the hotel, but I was too cold and tired to try it out and maybe a good massage would have made this short stay a little more pleasurable.
