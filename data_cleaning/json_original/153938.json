Breakfast was included, but they presented me with a paper to sign and expected a tip. By the way, the breakfast buffet is rather on the small side. The noise: In my reservation e-mail I insisted on a quiet room. They gave me a street room (Durango). Not that much traffic, but enough to bother me. At 4.30 a.m. you will have the garbage collectors, and they do make noise. Furthermore, the first morning at 7 a.m. when I was trying to sleep out my jet lag, the bell boy called me by mistake. Not my idea of a peaceful night.

Our room had a strong shower -- important for blasting off the smell and grime after a long day of exploring D.F.

The first day, the person seemed almost bothered when we had questions about the hotel or advice on getting around. The next two days, though, the service improved. The bedding was acceptable, but was not of the quality I would expect if paying the full rate of about $180 per night. This applies to both the mattress and the covers.
