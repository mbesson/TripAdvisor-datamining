The Hotel is located away from the main attractions, but it's just around the corner from Cornelia Metro stop, providing excellent access to everything we wanted to see. We bought Roma passes which gave us three days of unlimited Metro rides and entrance to several of the sites around the City. The only problem we encountered with the hotel is that Yahoo Maps shows it in an entirely different location, so we wasted a considerable amount of time looking for it when we arrived.

I must say that the hotel both met and exceeded our expectations in almost every respect. The hotel itself cuts a striking image as you enter with wonderfully ornate sculptures, pieces of art and general decor from the entrance right through to the reception, foyer and dining area, lending a sophisticated and distinctly Roman ambiance to the place. The staff were warm, welcoming and extremely helpful, going out of their way to meet our every request. A special word of thanks should be given to one of the reception staff, Renata, whose constant cheerfulness, enthusiasm and helpfulness made our stay infinitely more pleasant. Our room was clean, very nicely decorated and in excellent condition. Not particularly spacious but perfectly adequate for two people. The bathroom facilities were perfectly acceptable and the shower was very powerful and effective. I must also make mention of the free WiFi access granted to all residents of the hotel. My friend and I found this facility to be invaluable as we looked to keep up with all the latest developments back home on our laptops and smartphones. The breakfast provided was excellent with a wide range of food to suit all tastes. Whether it is a fry, continental breakfast or simply a cup of coffee and a croissant, there is a comprehensive selection to satisfy any appetite. The hotel also boasts a modest size gym room (treadmill, bike & weights), hot tub, sauna and steam room which we took full advantage of, especially in the aftermath of the marathon! It was also very nice to avail of these facilities to relax and unwind after a long day's walk on the tourist trail through Rome's many sights. I must point out that we paid a very reasonable rate considering the quality of the hotel, the standard of service and the range of facilities outlined above. The location of the hotel is not absolutely ideal, as it is approximately 15-20 minutes on the metro line from the centre of Rome. However, the hotel is located only several minutes' walk from the nearest metro station so we found that this did not hinder the enjoyment of our stay in any way. I have never posted a review of hotels I have stayed in on sites such as Tripadvisor before. However, my wonderful experience of Hotel Aurelius has compelled me to do so here. In short, I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. It is one of the best, in fact, probably the best hotel I have stayed in, when I weigh the very reasonable rates against the overall quality of service and facilities. Having thrown a coin into the Trevi fountain during my stay in Rome, it is said that I am sure to return to Rome.

We had a wonderful time and the Aurelius was the perfect choice for our stay! First of all, the hotel itself is very well maintained, clean and filled with all of the amenities one could ever need. Breakfast was great! Eggs, bacon, cheese, salami, fresh mozzarella, yogurts, cereal, croissants, fruit, breads, etc. plus a coffee/cappuchino/hot chocolate/whatever you want machine. Additionally, the breakfast room is really cute with an arched brick celing. Next, the hotel staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful, especially Alessandro at the front desk. Everyone was very warm and accomodating. We had booked a standard, double room and while it was small (typically European), it was very nice, clean and had everything we could ever need. The bathroom was actually a decent size and had a very nice shower. Oh and there's also free Wifi, but you need to get the code from the front desk. Finally, the location was really good. I read a few reviews saying that it is out of the way and inconvenient. I would have to disagree. While admittedly the hotel is not in the very center of Rome, the Metro is literally 2 minutes away around the corner and you can be at the Vatican in 10 minutes or further into the historical center in about 15 minutes. We used the Metro everyday except for Christmas when it shut down early and on that day we actually walked to the city center. Considering the great price and what you get from this hotel, I would think a 10 minute Metro ride is no big deal. The neighborhood of the hotel is in a safe, busy, vibrant area, but we never found it noisy in the hotel. Right around the corner close to the metro stop is a lovely little restaurant called Gustosando that we went to a couple of times. The food was excellent and the prices were reasonable.

We paid around \u00a3250 for one of the superior double bedrooms, although the room was slightly on the small side it was more than adequate and the bathroom was huge. The double bed was 2 singles pulled together but we had no complaints about that, there was also a single spare bed in the room, ideal if you have an arguement with the missus. Room had a tv with cable, only a couple of english channels but no ones really there to watch TV, we certainly weren't. The room was properly air conditioned and fully controlable which was brilliant as we went in september and it was scorching outside, so always pleasant to come back to a nice cool room and be able to adjust when we wanted with no restrictions. The bathroom was superb, the shower was amazing the bath had bubble jets you could turn on, hair dryer, plenty of space. Our room was at the back of the hotel which has been previously mentioned was great as the hotel in on a main road and it can get noisy, outside, inside our room we couldn't hear any traffic at all. The included breakfast was brilliant, obvuiously they've checked over older pooer comments on the breakfast and really worked on it, served from around 7-10am, we went around 9:30-10 every morning and there was still enough of everything to eat. The food itself was lovely, no complaints there. There are 2 co-joined breakfast areas, which are small but cosy. The hotel and the room were everything we needed, infact alot more than we expected, at the end of the day your in Rome and probably won't be in your room alot but it's certainly nice to come back to a Hotel like Aurelius after roaming around Rome all day. We'll definately be going back next year and definately using Hotel Aurelius again. The staff were polite and chatty, atleast until we paid the city tax using a bag full of 1 and 2 cent coins ;) He said he'd get his own back when we returned next year, he'll definately get the chance. Although we couldn't smoke inside the rooms, there is a small seating area at the back where you can smoke, literally just outside our room. Bottom line, room was great, food was great and the staff were great, even the people in the room next to us were great, so hello to the Canadian couple next to room 346! There's free wifi in the hotel, you just ask for a login code at reception and they validate it for however long you need it, free of charge. The Hotel is located 1-2minute walk from the metro (Cornelia). This enabled us to get everywhere we wanted with ease. One of our worries before going was how we were going to get everywhere, from the airport and back and too all the sites, it turned out it was really easy, so i'll explain in brief as comments others left on getting about prooved really useful. We flew into Fiumincio Airport (Terminal 3). Once we got off the plane we took the airport shuttle to get from our gate to the main terminal building. We then followed signs for the train, which is literally quite a picture of a train (very straight forward), we didn't speak or understand Italian but we had no problems getting about. It was about 5-10 minute walk to the train station from the terminal. Basically you want to take a train to get to the metro station, Termini. We bought our train tickets at a small shop called Tobbaci which looks like a small newsagents. We bought 4 tickets as recommended elsewhere, these were basically return tickets for both of us. The tickets have no expiry so it's easier just to buy 4 when you get to the station then not worry about buying tickets on your return. Once you work out what platform your train is on, via the screens or asking, there are machines at every platform that you have to validate your tickets, so validate 2 of them for trip now (you just pop ticket into the machine and it stamps it), then do the same with the other 2 tickets on the way back. The train journey is about 30-35 minutes. When you arrive it's a few minutes walk to the metro Termini station, you literally just walk all along the train platform and you'll see signs. We bought our metro tickets from machines when we got there, we paid 11 euros each for a 3 day travel card, this allows you to use the metro as long as you want for 3 days. The machine has an english option so it's easy enough to use and buy what you need. However long your staying for I'd recommend buying a ticket for each person for that length of time, it saves you money and time. We used the metro every day, the metro was great for getting everywhere we wanted, and not even as daunting as getting on the tube in london. Termini is on the same line as Cornelia and is about 7-8 stops, relatively quick trip to get to the Hotel. There's only 2 lines at the moment, Line A and B, C was being made while we were there which meant during weekdays the metro closes at 9pm and is replaced by a bus service MA1 i believe. When you get to Cornelia follow the exit signs, when you go through the turnstile, turn left, you'll get to a T junction with 2 exits, take the right one (can't remeber what it was called). This takes you outside. At the top of the stairs walk straight ahead, you'll see a McDonald on your right hand side, this in on the corner of the road your hotel is on, so turn right after McDonalds and Hotel Aurelius is about 1 minute on the right side. All the main attractions in Rome, except the Colosseum are on metro Line A between Cornelia and Termini, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Vatican City, The Colosseum is on line B, you basically go from Cornelia to Termini change to Line B here and it's 2 stops away, again not far at all and straight forward to get there. So travel card covers all the lines. Out train tickets from the train station to the metro (Termini) cost us 54 euros in total which includes the return (4 tickets in total for 2 of us). This was significantly cheaper than getting a taxi or hotel transfer option, which we were being quoted as 50 euros each, each way!", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGood quality modern hotel with easy access to central Rome\u201d", "Author": "Williamek", "ReviewID": "UR111700031", "Content": "This is a solid 3-star hotel with modern and clean rooms, located at the outskirts of central Rome but with easy access to all major landmarks. The price we paid (\u20ac100 for double room) was a good deal compared to what we\u2019d have to pay in other similar hotels. We certainly recommend it. Location: hotel is not within walking distance from central Rome so you need to take metro but we found it a very convenient location. Metro runs often (every several minutes) and getting to the main train station Termini or all major Rome landmarks takes less than 30 minutes. Vatican is only 4 stops away. Note that currently they are doing engineering works in the metro so if you arrive after 9pm you need to take a replacement bus MA1 instead which follows the metro route. Getting here: from the airport take the train (from Fiumicino) or shuttle bus (from Ciampino) to the main train station Termini, then metro line A. Get off at stop Cornelia. Hotel is 5 minutes away, on Via Aurelia. Rooms: hotel is not very big (26 rooms) so gives a cosy feeling. It consists of the main building with maybe 20 rooms and a separate small annex in the back. As we wanted a room overlooking the back (hotel is next to a busy road) we got one of these annex rooms. It was actually very nice: our room had its own entrance, in the back yard there were some tables and chairs we could relax in, and overall it felt much more private than your typical hotel. Room decor was modern, trendy but elegant, and it seems that all furniture was brand new. Bathroom was clean and had a shower cabin and a bidet but no bath. Room had flat screen TV, air conditioning and free WiFi (get access code from reception). Hotel facilities: hotel has very limited shared facilities, which is why I would rate it more as a solid 3-star hotel than a 4-star one. Breakfast lounge is small but adequate in size to the number of rooms so does not feel crowded. Breakfast itself was good but selection is limited so after a few days of eating the same things I was yearning for some variety. There\u2019s a little internet corner (computer + printer) in the lobby. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a parking as we didn\u2019t need one. No spa, swimming pool or gym.

We found it to be quite surprising compared to other european cities like London, Paris and Venice. However, the city and the sights make all these irrelevant :-) Tip of the year - Take the guided tour at the Colosseum arranged by the Colosseum authorities.
