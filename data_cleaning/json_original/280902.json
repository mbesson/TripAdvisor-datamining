It was a nice surprise to find a Marriott in downtown Dallas. Formerly a Westin (I believe), it is adjacent to an urban mall / office building with an indoor ice rink in the center. Self-service parking is available; however, this is not affiliated with the hotel and is fairly pricey. I left the ramp twice - $18 after a few hours and $11 overnight. By contrast, I parked in valet at The Fairmont a couple blocks away and it was $18 for the entire day. The bar / restaurant in the lobby is nice and the service is great. No Guiness on draft, but they did have it in bottles. The concierge lounge on the top (16th) floor is reportedly the largest in North America and offers a view of downtown.

Big enough to move around in, for once the vanity had space to hold a woman's beautification tools, the tub worked easily with no nonsense fixtures that you don't need a degree in rocket science to figure out and the water was the correct temperature. This hotel is very convenient to DART and back with Pearl St. station right there. It was drizzly rain and we were fine with coat and umbrella in hand.

The carbs were fresh, the eggs weren't watery and the staff were very helpful and nice. We had a nice sit down before leaving back to the real world.

The hotel staff gave us a number of recommendations for dinner on our 3 nights - they were good recommendations and we enjoyed them all. Our one gripe, if you choose not to use the valet parking service is that the carpark in the adjacent office tower (nothing to do with Marriott) re-sets the weekend rate at midnight on Sunday.

My king size room was well appointed, a decent size, quiet and quite comfortable, but most important it was well maintained. The lobby was still ungoing renovations during my week long stay, but if the rest of the hotel is any indication it should turnout nicely. If you are valet parking a car call at least 20 minutes ahead to have it ready for you or you risk waiting at least that long while the car is being retrieved.

We booked the \"Family Escape\" package deal which included 4 sodas, popcorn, in-room move, valet parking and breakfast - all for the same price as a normal night (go figure). Hotel was easy to find and easy to get to. Valet staff was friendly and even ran back to get my sunglasses for me when I realized I'd left them in the car. Lobby was rather plain, but it's quite clear that's only because of the renovations. Speaking of renovations, we saw no dust or debris and heard no construction noise at all. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Room was superbly clean and new - it really felt like we were the first ones to use it! Bed was a little too firm for me, but linens and pillows were nice and soft. Shower had plenty of hot water and pressure, and a large head. Our room faced the street (rather than the atrium), and was relatively quiet. The only noise we heard was somebody on the street yelling in the middle of the night - and you certainly can't fault the hotel for that (plus we were 2nd floor...a higher floor room probably wouldn't have heard it). As another reviewer said, there is a funky smell in the hallways that I think is coming from the new carpet. You don't notice it after a few minutes, but I'd expect it'll go away soon anyway. Breakfast was strangely across the atrium, a 3 minute walk from the lobby (I think a temporary location due to renovations). The food was good (usual hot food, breads, and cereal), but selection was limited in my opinion. Waiter on the first morning was curt and boring, but the waiter on the second morning was very friendly and attentive. The entire building is mixed-use, with the hotel on one side, parking garage on the other, and offices on the other two sides. The enclosed atrium has the ice skating rink and retail & food shops on the bottom two floors. Nearly everything was closed during the weekend, so don't expect to do much other than walk around and look. Access to the State Fair was a breeze. There's a DART rail stop literally adjacent to the hotel, and another station at the entrance to Fair Park. Couldn't be easier. My main gripe about the hotel? I requested room service for our popcorn and drinks and after waiting for 30 minutes without anyone showing up, I called back and canceled the order (no apology either). Would I stay here again? If I needed to be downtown, absolutely. The location can't be beat, and I felt like the value was very good.

We met with the top brass when we left and were promised a 20% refund for guests and removal of parking an internet fees. This has NOT occurred and instead a form letter was sent to guests to \"apologize\" for the problems with their stay. Wow. Unbelievable for a Marriott. We were determined to not allow this to ruin a beautiful weekend for our daughter and many guests but it added undue and unneeded stress. The hotel simply should have said that there was construction. We scheduled the block of rooms a year in advance (we are from out of town) and were not told of the problems.

I'd like to give a great, big gold star to this Marriott Hotel's staff for how awesome they were. On the Saturday night of our stay, one of our party experienced a blood sugar emergency. As it was the middle of the night, we figured the kitchen was closed, and her tummy is a little persnickety usually at that point anyway. We pulled out one of those microwaveable dinners that don't require refrigeration we always carry for those times when she over does and popped down to the front desk. The desk clerk immediately ushered us to use a microwave in the hotel kitchens, no questions asked. I was so grateful and impressed by that kindness! Thanks to that meal, everyone was able to return to full activities the following day. I don't think I can say enough for how much we appreciate the kindness of the night staff. I really hope someone at that hotel reads this and posts a copy just to make sure the night staff know even though mostly we're asleep when they're on duty, it is in those unexpected moments of need when one really appreciates good people.

I'm a frequent business & leisure traveler so I'm reasonably particular about hotel experiences while being realistic about the hotel rating and what I'm paying. 1. Hotel is under major renovation. If you enjoy the sound of drills and sledgehammers from 9-5, go for it. For a business trip if you're not in your room all day, not a big deal. There is no mention of this on their website that we could find, nor was it verbally disclosed at check in (apparently there's a flyer sitting on the counter but we missed it). Our first room was on the 11th floor directly above where work was being done on the 10th. Noise was insane. 2. First inquiry after being wakened by demolition, guest services advised us of the renovation, told us that calls were coming in even from the 2nd floor, and comp'd us for breakfast. After hearing this for a solid hour while getting ready we asked for another room on a floor away from where work being performed. Great, no problem, they did so. (Same thing for my pregnant daughter & son-in-law). Several other guests, same. We thought hotel put oblivious guests in these rooms and just waited to see if they would complain or not, and then deal with it. 3. Next room - directly over lobby/main entry/restaurant. 3 doors down from fitness center. Across from laundry area and meeting room where construction services people met. Quieter, yes, with the fan on full power 100% of the time. 4. Speaking of fan, temps outside were 96 degrees. A/C, set on 60, did not keep room at 74. We asked front desk to check this, to our knowledge they never did as it never cooled off to our level of comfort. 5. Light bulb out on nightstand lamp. This is just annoying. 6. Tissue box had about 5 tissues left in it, no refill, see #5. 7. We were out all day from 10:00 AM to 4:30 PM. Room was not made up when we returned. Called guest services, said they'd send someone right away. Advised we had to get ready for wedding, please come after 6:30. Response - \"we don't do rooms after 5:30\". So, we said, okay, 5:15. 5 minutes later, knock on door, while one of us in shower...guess who? Went to front desk and said okay, please do it now. Waited for 1/2 hour in lobby. Returned to find room still unmade. Manager then came up with clean towels & box of tissues, said he would personally assure the room would be done when we returned. Okay, it was. A box of 4 truffles for our rush to get ready. Didn't need the stress. Other guests in party had same problem. 8. Staff was pleasant but apathetic. They're probably overwhelmed with complaints. Waiter in restaurant was very nice. 9. Location is good, 1/2 block from train to West End attractions. 5-10 min to Uptown & McKinney restaurants, shopping. Recommend waiting until renovation is complete. As a Marriott Rewards member, I've had way better experiences elsewhere. If you're a business traveler, gone before 9 and back after 5, with no other needs than a bed and breakfast, just hope for a quiet and clean room when you return.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cStrangest Explanation Ever\u201d", "Author": "Travel_2_Texas", "ReviewID": "UR105422394", "Content": "The hotel rooms have small refrigerators that appear to be former mini-bars. my wife, daughter and I go out to eat and my daughter brings back some leftovers, thinking she could store them in the fridge to eat later. Well, it turns out that the fridge doesn't work, so we call the front desk and they send someone up, who says that they will see if they can find a working refrigerator and replace ours. We never hear back, so my wife calls the front desk again. This time, she is told that the non-working refrigerators are actually \"coolers\", and that while they won't keep something cold, they will keep things 'cool, like around room temperature\". This is apparently the official line, as someone we were traveling with (we were there for a volleyball tournament) was told the same thing! This is supposed to be a high quality business hotel in downtown Dallas. Having a refrigerator that doesn't work is one thing, but coming up with the ridiculous explanation that it is actually a 'cooler' is offensive, not to mention D U M B. While the hotel is clean, there are a number of other niggling issues that would prompt me to stay elsewhere. For instance, the room we were in had two double beds, when there was more than enough room for two queen beds. The walls are paper thin, and we could hear everything, and I mean everything, that went on in the room next door. And while the bathtub had one of those clothesline thingies above it, it didn't work either. We didn't call the front desk about that one either, but would have loved to hear the explanation of what it is there for. Lastly, on our first night there, my wife discovered that she had forgotten her toothbrush. She called the front desk and was told one would be sent up. Bedtime rolls around, and still no toothbrush, so she called downstairs and cancelled her request.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisina", "Title": "\u201cRoomy, but typical\u201d", "Author": "travel4workAA", "ReviewID": "UR96572116", "Content": "This is a typical Marriott property, nothing too special.
