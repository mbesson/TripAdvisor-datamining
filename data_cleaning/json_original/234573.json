We tried one of the restaurants recommended by previous travellers, namely La Fonda. This proved to be very good value but get there early to avoid the queue. They also have one at the Olympic Port, we didn't try this one but it looked great. The hotel receptionist was very helpful and on his recommendation we bought a two day ticket for the Tour Bus. This was a very good move. We spent the first day travelling both routes and the second going back to places we wanted to see in more detail.

Noticed a few guys hanging around but more conscious of the pick pocketers out on Las Ramblas. Thankfully we didn't fall victim to that but be on your guard - there are suspicious looking characters and they are just eying up their prey - you can see them right before your eyes! La Boqueria was fantastic so fresh fruit a plenty of the most tasty fruit drinks - my favourite, coconut and strawberry. 48-hr ticket for hop-on-hop-off bus is excellent value and well worth the tour. Don't rush off to see the Magic Fountains though as they are apparently out of order until November - no one told us so we made out way over like many others only to be disappointed.

We had no problems with the men who seem to frequent the square during the day and evening and we (two females) were never approached by them and there was no sign of them late at night. The bedroom was a reasonable size with a good bathroom and the beds were comfortable. There is a room safe - you pay a small daily charge as well as paying a returnable deposit for the key. We had an internal room which could be stuffy at times but OK if the window was left open. Instructions for the Aircon would have been helpful. Breakfasts were adequate - but some fresh fruit would have been welcome. I agree with comments about the dour gentleman at breakfast but give him a smile and he will reciprocate! 9am - 9.30am is very busy so tables fill up quickly. Buses leave from Catalunya Square to various places of interest but we found it difficult to work out from which stop each service actually went from. There is a tourist booth on the Square and they will help. If you get a T-10 ticket this is for 10 single journies on the Metro or buses. Very good value as 2 people can use the same ticket - just put it in the machine twice as you get on the bus. (Get on at the front and out in the middle). El Corte Ingles have a huge store on Catalunya - go to the top for a reasonable priced snack/meal and look over the city for wonderful views. Also check out their supermarket in the basement.

The hotel is in a square, just off La Rambla, so good for accessing the sights. A dismal area which managed to escape the sun all day. The square was full of old vagrants from about 7am, swigging alcohol and at night the queue for the hostel opposite seemed to consist of male immigrants look for somewhere to sleep, quite intimidating. There is a heavy police presence day and night - I don't know if that is reassuring or not. Reported to be one of the oldest hotels in the city you would be hard pressed to find any old world charm left in this place. Whereas the facade gives a hint of what it was like, once inside it is a bland modern space with no atmosphere. The first room we were given was so dirty and cramped. The air conditioning switch and other electrical fittings were hanging off the wall, the bathroom walls and tiles were mouldy. We asked to be moved and we were put in a room which was kitted out for disabled travellers. A larger room, still shabby but at least it was clean. The walls are paper thin, we were treated to loud music all evening on our first night then shouting at around 4am as the boys in the next room to us returned from their night out. They disconnected our key at one point so we couldn't get into our room! The lift is scary, shakey and the doors take an age to open and is best avoided, particularly if you are not really fond of lifts. The staff were decidedly unfriendly. They never looked up from the reception desk when you came through the front doors - a little worrying at night as you could be anyone entering the building. Handing in our key on departure was met with a grunt! The breakfast - same every day. Stale croissants, bread, more bread pretending to be brioche, cake, 2 large lumps of scrambled egg in a metal container and hot dog sausages cut up into small pieces - did you see the programme Jamie Oliver did about mechanically recovered meat?! The coffee was absolutely disgusting and we tried every combination out of the machine to see if we could get a decent cup. The dining room was lit by what can only be described as industrial lighting - how many halogen spot lights do you need in a room? They must have got a job lot! Our advice would be not to stay here but choose another hotel in a central location, even if it costs you a little more.

We also dined there twice , found the food excellent value- E9.50 for tourist menu, E12.50 for an authentic Catalan meal (including large jug Sangria!) Shame about the \"down&outs\" inhabiting the Placa San Agusti in front of the hotel though we did notice that the placa was sometimes hosed down (by the local council?)during the early hours which temporarily cleared it! A WARNING - beware of lost \"Greek tourist\", he stopped us on a quiet street, asked if we were English and could we give him directions.Then appeared a smartly dressed man who produced a badge, claiming to be the drugs police. He told us we were in a very dangerous drug-dealing/using area and implied we were committing an offence.This was very scary! He then insisted on examining our wallets and wanted to see a credit card as identification. The Greek produced a card, the \"policeman\" then said he also needed the PIN for ID- to be keyed into his mobile phone! This the Greek pretended to do (by now we realised this was a scam)and the policeman expected my husband to do the same. My husband held tightly on to his wallet and insisted he had no credit card, I think the men then realised they had been rumbled and disappeared! This experience was most unsettling and we are now very wary when approached by strangers.Apart from this we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday and would certainly return to the Hotel San Agusti.", "Date": "April 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat pre-cruise spot, friendly staff and near the Las Ramblas action\u201d", "Author": "CarolineT08", "ReviewID": "UR4729241", "Content": "My brother and I stayed here for one night to recover from jet lag before we boarded our cruise ship. The courtyard-square entrance to the hotel is charming, the rooms are comfortable (although we requested a move, due to a/c problems, which was promptly arranged by friendly staff) The bathroom was clean and modernized, and the breakfast was quite good. Highlights: Ambiance and historical feel, proximity to Las Ramblas and friendly, albeit quiky, staff. The gentleman at the front desk suggested a small restauraunt around the corner and down the alley for Paella... off the beaten tourist track, and obviously a place for locals. Our meal was reasonably priced, and the Paella was superb. I can still see the sizzling pan with fresh seafood and saffron rice in my mind's-eye... What a start to the wonderful family trip! Barcelona is a wonderful and friendly city, and this hotel is a great frist stop!", "Date": "March 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bamberg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4695192", "Content": "The location is the best thing about the Hotel. It's just off Las Ramblas so you get very little street noise. It's also very close to a metro stop. Yes, the walls are paper thin but the only noise is at a reasonable hour in the morning. I didn't come to Barelona to sleep!! The clientel are older. Not a party crowd which would explain the morning noise and not the evening noise. Very clean and comfortable. Good continental breakfast which was included.", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Sant Agusti", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d234573-Reviews-Hotel_Sant_Agusti-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$116 - $185*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "234573", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fe/fa/fefa3897a65edcc53bea8d51e3964b308large.jpg"}}
