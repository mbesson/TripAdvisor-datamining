The rest of the bathroom was very small but it was fine. I really liked it. Towels were very white, thick and fluffy with very nice smell. The bedroom window had no view, only a grey wall, but the advantage was that I didn't hear a single noise in the night (or in the day either!). Since the hotel is in a small, hidden street, I think even the front rooms must be quiet. Also we had double door, so it was very sound proof. Breakfast was ok, the usual continental, bread, ham, cheese, butter, jam, fruit salad (not homemade), croissants, coffee, milk, juice, etc. Everything was tasty and very good. And very nice the lady who served it. The only thing missing was a lounge room or space, but I think it was because of the remodelation.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cFantastic holiday - great location , accomodation and staff\u201d", "Author": "LPDublin", "ReviewID": "UR60414186", "Content": "Very central location , easy to walk to many of the top attractions or if we found it necessary to take the metro - plenty of stops nearby .

It's central location is great, within walking distance to the Louvre and Notre Dame in one direction, and to the Madeleine, Opera and the main department stores and boutiques in the other direction. Two different Metro stations within 2 to 3 hundred meters makes it very convenient to connect to almost anywhere within minutes. There are several options for breakfast along the Opera Avenue, as well as for dinner all around and in the main avenues, like Capucines. Staff were polite and very helpful, always ready to answer our questions and offer advices when requested. The rooms are comfortable and well lighted, clean, but...small.

There were two very small wardrobes, which was enough for a 3 night stay, a safety deposit box (3 euros a night). Clean towels and bedding 'every' day.

The hotel is located 5 minutes walk from Le Louvre and near the metro station on a lovely quiet road. Very safe.
