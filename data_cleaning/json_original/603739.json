Don't be put off by the outside as it looks a little cheap - not so much like the picture they give above! But once you step inside, you will be greeted warmly by reception staff who speak a number of different languages and are happy to help. We had a standard double bed room. There was a comfy bed, desk, chair, mini bar, wardrobe and a decent flatscreen TV attached to the wall. The bathroom was small but there was a bath in there. It was a little annoying that the toilet was located behind the door but a small problem. There was a slight toilet smell in there from time to time but only mild. I would advise taking a pair of earplugs as if you are located facing out onto one of the two busy streets, you will hear a lot during the night with trams and other traffic. It was rather warm in the room but this may have been because it was in between seasons so the heating may have been on when not needed some days. The wi-fi connection was really flaky in the rooms so using the lobby might be wise. The room was kept spotlessly clean which was great. Breakfast was very pleasant. Hot food could have been hotter at times but the selection was brilliant - cereals, toast, croissants, bacon and scrambled eggs, meats, cheese, rolls, bread, cakes, fruit and yoghurt. The coffee machine was excellent and there was a good selection of fruit juices. We walked from Termini (the main train station) and it took about 25 minutes to get to the hotel which was reasonable. For location to the Colosseum and Roman Forum, its pretty unbeatable. 8 minute walk at most. Go and see this at night when it is all lit up. And in the day walk to the top of the Palantine gardens to get a photo of the whole of the Colosseum (a worthwhile tip I read in my city secrets book!) The metro station Manzini is literally opposite the hotel which made things very easy to get the Trevi fountain and The Pantheon. Would recommend taking the metro to the Vatican or you will be in for a long walk! Buy a day ticket for the metro which is cheap as chips but beware that you need a 5 euro note or change for the machines. Can recommend restaurants Li Rione on Via dei SS. Quattro Coronati and Hostaria Isidoro on Via di San Giovanni. They are both located five minutes from the Colosseum. Would highly recommend the chicken in gorgonzola sauce at Hostaria!", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMosty good but with a few reservations\u201d", "Author": "Rose of England R", "ReviewID": "UR126218169", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights. First disappointment was no kettle in spite of this having been checked out with our Travel Agent beforehand. When I queried why it was still on the website the receptionist told me that they had decided against kettles that very day! This was obviously not true as I have now read other reviews. It's a pity to have someone lie - it destroys confidence. We know Rome quite well so knew where to go to buy a kettle. There are two supermarkets in the Termini station, just two Metro stops away. Location was ideal for us - as we like to walk and the Forum and Coliseum and several important churches were within a short stroll. The Metro is simple to use as there are only 2 lines and most of the tourist sites are situated on Line A - outside the front door. Our bed was extremely comfortable and we were not disturbed by the traffic noise. If you want a peaceful retreat don't go to a major city. This is about our tenth visit to Rome and we have had much much noisier rooms in other hotels. Our double room was Ok in size, but our son's single room made me recall that this was once a convent as it was similar to a monastic cell. However, the lighting in our room was among the best I have found anywhere in the world. This is very important for ageing eyes wanting to read small print in travel guides. Well done on that, Hotel Milton. The breakfast was extensive with pretty well everything you could imagine including scrambled egg and bacon. However on the last 3 mornings this was so cold as to be inedible. The linen was very clean, and the room was serviced regularly. The staff were generally helpful and requests eg for a chair in the room, were dealt with fairly quickly. There are several restaurants and cafes in the roads around and we were able to dine well in different places each night. The bar opposite makes a good cup of tea.

It is about a 10 minute walk from the Colosseum, so not bad for a day spent around there and the Forum, but it is quite a way from Piazza Navona, Campo De Fiori etc... however the Manzoni Metro station is outside the front door. There are many horror stories about the metro, particularly around Termini, but Manzoni is not a busy station, the ticket machines are in English, and everything tourist-y is along the same line, so all you need to do is get on and get off, no transferring trains required! We used this to reach the Vatican museums & Spanish Steps on different days, and then meandered back towards the hotel, which was ideal. The only slight let down was the breakfast, which was fairly basic, plus coffee out of a vending machine, so we abandoned this for a lovely little coffee bar - head down Via Emanuele Filiberto, towards San Giovanni, and it is about 4/5 doors down.

In fact, we only booked it for the first lag of our trip and was gonna look for another hotel in Rome on the second half of the trip but we ended up just booking with them because we really enjoyed it! 1. Hotel is extremely convenient and located in a relatively safe neighbourhood. It was important for 2 girls traveling in Europe. It is located two stops away from Termini train station which is pretty shady, but the station it is located right above is Manzoni, situated in a quiet Italian neighbourhood with everything you need within 5 minutes - Cafe across the street, drug store, cheese and deli store, local pub, bus stop to Colosseum (or a 10 mins walk) 2. Both rooms we stayed at were at a comfortable size, especially in a large city. The bathrooms were clean but there was no door so showering was kind of interesting to try to keep the water in the tub. The first time we flooded the bathroom because we werent aware, however everything else in the room we had no complaints for. 3. Wifi is only available in the lobby for a cost, it wasn't a big issue for us because there were a lot of internet cafes located in Rome. No real amenities except the small hotel bar. Very neat and clean. Both our rooms faced the \"busy street\" however it gets very quiet at night and we did hear a few trucks going by in the morning. 4. Service was absolutely great. I think with any country the key is to try and learn/adapt to their customs. We had an Italian app on our iphone and tried to check in speaking Italian even all concierges we encountered speaks fluent English. They were all extremely helpful in teaching/helping us with our Italian and any general info on Rome. While we were there, a lady checked in speaking only in English rudely and not bothering with adapting to any Italian mannerism and the concierge was cold and impolite. I think you give and you take. 5. The breakfast buffet was also absolutely amazing! Best one in Europe by far. It has a relatively large selection of juice, a coffee machine (however can be more amazing seeing we were in Italy), danishes, desserts, deli meats, cheese, veggies, cereal, yogurt and other breakfast foods. Some reviews said that food was almost always gone, which didn't happen to us the 3 nights we were there. The staffs are very attentive and replenishes quickly. Overall, I am sure there were a million other hotels in Rome that can be more amazing, but for the price we got (about $130USD maybe?) it was a great stay and well worth the price.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were happily greeted and promptly checked in. The gentleman helping us provided us maps and explained, in detail, how to get to the main attractions easily and even provided areas to avoid at night, all without us even asking! The hotel is a bit older, but is nonetheless clean and maintained. When we entered our room we were pleasantly surprised! The room was quite spacious, despite what we've heard about European hotel size. Overall, the room was clean. However, the carpet near the bathroom was water damaged/stained. Speaking of the bathroom, the shower was a bit difficult to shower in. There was a glass partition that only shielded half of the tub and could be swung in/out from the tub. This being said, you had to shower at the one end of the tub that was shielded, while directing the spray of the water towards the shower wall to avoid getting water on the floor. Aside from this minor inconvenience, the bathroom was clean, had plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Man oh man! What an amazing location this hotel has! A 10 minute walk from the Colosseum, right beside a subway station and a bus stop nearby! In addition to this, there is a little cafe across the street to grab a nibble and drink. Just a few doors down is a cheese and deli shop where you can pick up some olives, cheese, prosciutto, a loaf of bread and some wine for a rustic meal. In terms of service, we were always happily greeted whenever we came in or left by the staff. They patiently listened while we awkwardly tried out the Italian phrases we knew and they even taught us some phrases too!

All things just went downhill. At first they gave us a corner unit away from the main building, and directly across from the staff room, you can hear people going in and out every 2 minutes and speaking quite loudly. We demanded to change room after a while, they are nice enough to gave us another room in the main building. And this one is a little better, except everything in the shower seems broken. The towel hanger seemed it could fall off any second, the showerhead holder was loose so you have to either hold it or lean it against the wall. If you take shower longer than 3 min, the spilled water will sneak around the toilet and drench the carpet outside the bathroom. And also the room we had seemed to be quite close to the main road outside, and everytime when a train or a bus went by, the floor started trembling. I would give this hotel a 5 star based on my first stay, and 2 star on my second. So a split calls for 3. It's a decent hotel, if you are lucky enough. Additional info: There's a 24 hour vending station just across the street from the hotel, they sell cheaper stuff than most of the stores here.

There was a rail above the cubicle where the shower curtain had been so I guess this was one of the rooms that had been fitted with a cubicle last Autumn - on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it about a 3.

The rooms could do with a bit of TLC - carpets are faded and marked, furniture and walls are scuffed, and housekeeping could be improved - the room was not vacuumed for the duration of my stay. AC was not functioning correctly, but the temperature was reasonable enough. TV in the room consisted of French and Italian language channels, CNN being the only English language option.

The hotel is situated on the edge of the Latereno area of Rome, and is a reasonable walk from St Giovanni's Basilica/Lateran Palace (5 minutes) and the Colosseum (15 minutes). The walk from Termini station (20+ minutes) is through one of the rougher areas of town, and I wouldn't recommend making this trip at night unless in a group. The hotel has a bar/restaurant, and there are a couple of grocery stores in the immediate area, along with a snack bar, pizza shop, chinese takeaway, ice cream shop and cinema.

The breakfast is very nice; bread, ham, cheese, eggs, bacon, fruits and pastries. The only bad things were the coffee (which tasted like water) and that the juice wasn\u2019t real fruit juice, but more like a non-carbonated soft drink or something. Luckily there is also tea, which is hard to mess up! The beds where very comfy! It\u2019s a little noisy with the street right outside, but we had no problem sleeping at all.

There is a very cheap Internet Cafe about two blocks past the Lazio Cafe directly across the street from the hotel. Use that if Internet is a necessity. The hotel is located just across the street from the Manzoni subway station (Red Line). It's very convenient for getting to all of Rome's major attractions. The hotel is also within moderate walking distance to the Colosseum. The area the hotel is located in is somewhat of a question. Be careful when walking around at night. And, absolutely do not walk to the hotel from the Termini station. It is much better and safer to take the train to Manzoni. The hotel's breakfast is outstanding. I wish I didn't have to leave early on the day of my checkout so that I could have had the breakfast once more.

The first thing we noticed about the hotel was how clean it was. The rooms and common areas were spotless. The air conditioning was very effective in the bedroom at all times and made a welcome change from the searing heat outside. The room, although a double, wasn't huge, but had all the amenities you need - except that being English, we would have liked a working English news channel on the TV. Instead we had to make do with CNN without a picture as it was impossible to tune in. So it may as well have been US radio news we were \"listening\" to. Apart from that, the room and bathroom were cleaned thoroughly every morning whilst we ate breakfast, so that when we came back up to our room again it was all done. As for the breakfast, we were very pleasantly surprised. I read in the previous review that the scrambled egg and the bacon were cold and congealed. This was far from true. The very friendly staff in the breakfast room and kitchen were constantly replacing any food that had been left standing, or was running low. There was plenty of choice from fruit and cereals, to cakes and pastries, cold meats, egg and bacon, to choices of bread and rolls with various cheeses. A self-serve coffee machine provided lattes, cappuccinos, espresso, etc and was hot and delicious! Basically, we were delighted with the breakfast! The location of the hotel was approx 25 metres from the nearest Metro \"tube\" line Manzoni which couldn't have been more convenient! Once on the Metro, you can travel to all the main sightseeing areas for a single flat rate of \u20ac1 per trip. The main station Termini is only 2 stops away. We hired a scooter from there from a great company called Treno e Scooter Rent, Rome Termini railway station - Piazza dei Cinquecento, [--] [--] for the whole time we were in Rome and the hotel kindly let us park it safely in their car park for free. So to sum up, the Hotel Milton Roma is a no-frills hotel, but well-located, spotless, comfortable, great breakfast, friendly staff (especially Rosanna Canzonieri on reception) and good value for money - we booked through Expedia. If I had to mention ONE small gripe, and it is small, that was being charged a minimum fee of \u20ac4 for 15 minutes to use the Internet in the hotel lobby when we only wanted to look up an address. If they have Broadband running anyway, I think it's a bit steep to charge a minimum of \u00a33.50 to use the service. But as I say, that was my only gripe! Having said that, they don't charge for using the safe in the room like some hotels! If I was to visit Rome again I would definitely go back to the Milton Roma.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel and location - a few niggles!\u201d", "Author": "Spanglor", "ReviewID": "UR39431631", "Content": "Stayed for a long weekend at the end of August.

The breakfast was probably much more over the top to be considered true European. They had a full buffet from pastries, fruits, mini sandwiches, and the typical continental breakfast elements (cereal, toast, eggs, etc) Everything was fresh and my fav were the blood tomatoes with mozzarella balls drenched in olive oil. The neighborhood was very safe, we walked around the nearby blocks many times and there are tons of trattorias and pizzarias along with mini deli/markets. I would stay again for the value and location, but the room was a bit too small for me even though the bathroom was fine.

There was also a sfe in the room.The bathroom was very nice and updated with marble and they provided soaps,shampoo and a working hairdryer. I was quiet surprised by the lovely breakfast buffet that had everything from fruit,pastries,eggs, bacon and of course coffee,tea and juices. The hotel staff was very pleasant they were very accommadating. I came back from shopping and was in hurry to catch a tour and the staff offered and took my packages up to my room for me. They were very nice. They have a computer in the hotel lobby with internet but you need to pay for the internet for a small fee. I had my labtop but the wireless internet was not working. The hotel also has bicycles for loan if you are interested in taking a stroll around town. This hotel was not in the center of anything but it was a 10minute straight walk to the Colossium. They Metro station was right across the street which I thought was great.-(Manzoni stop). The hotel provided me with a map of all the great tourist attractions to visit and they were all metro stops along the A line-(very simple to get around). Now I'm from NY so this was a piece of cake and they subway was soooo much cleaner here in Rome. I was very determined and I basically went to all the major tourist attractions in a 2 days and was very pleased with the location of this hotel. They also had the Hop on Hop off bus stop right next to the hotel if the train is not your thing. When it was time to leave the hotel was nice enough to call me a taxi to FCO airport which cost 40 euro however it is also very easy to take the train to airport as well but I a bit too much luggage and I was by myself so the taxi was easier.

It was a 'secret' hotel on Last minute.com, which means you are not told where it is until you have paid! The list of amenities described were all technically there, but as others have said, the room was very compact, mainly because this hotel used to be a convent according to the receptionist. We asked to change to a bigger room, but were told we were already in one of the biggest! What must the others be like???? Also, a very strange arrangement in the bathroom - the shower at one end of the bath with the screen at the other. Also, a heated towel rail fitted over the bath. A new modern suite & tiles though.The main drawback for us was that the 'climate control' was not working, and reception told us it is only for the summer, and just to open the window. I have come across this before in Italy, where summer does not officially start until mid June regardless of the temperature. As others have said, Rome is very noisy - sirens, cars honking, church bells, dogs, you name it and even dustbins being emptied at midnight! We had the choice between baking or being kept awake ( the noise only reduces slightly between midnight & 5am) , but fortunately had brought my earplugs with me! In fact, I slept very well, but not so my daughter. The good points - very clean, good breakfast & smack opposite the Metro. Near the Colosseum, but not much else, but the Metro got you to the main sights. The bad - the area not the greatest, (grafitti absolutely everywhere), small rooms (that seems par for the course in Rome though), and the lack of air con.

A leisurely 10-15 mins walk from the hotel and you\u2019ll arrive at the Colosseum/Roman Forum/Palatine Hill/Arch of Constantine (all these 4 attractions are right next to eachother). It\u2019s situated on a crossroads which has led some reviewers to complain about the noise. I have to say we had NO trouble getting to sleep - and after a busy day sightseeing followed by some vino in the evening, I doubt you will either! Service Staff at the hotel front desk were very helpful. More than happy to arrange cabs/give directions/hand out maps and point out where all the attractions were situated. Room Our room was small (I think all of the rooms in the Hotel are cosy) but was well proportioned and had everything we needed. The bathroom is a decent size (something that\u2019s very important to my girlfriend!). One tiny gripe is that the only english TV channel is CNN. Room was cleaned daily to a high standard. Food Didn\u2019t have an evening meal at the hotel but the breakfast was superb! I had enough yummy bacon and eggs to kill a cow! Great selection of fruit/cereals/cakes etc for vegetarians too.

Apart from most of the other comments the hotel also offers complimentary push bikes for all its guests ... this for me was an unexpected added bonus which I'd not known beforehand although your not provided with any helmets or the like, its no different to cycling in any other major city and resulted in me seeing masses more in the 4 days than I'd have expected. No one seemed to have made use of the bikes as whenever I returned all the other bikes where in place and both Saturday and Sunday where perfect sunshine cycling conditions ... both buses and the underground metro seem frequent so you takes your choice I guess. From my experience the Navonna Piazza and Campo De Fioro were the areas that had that chill out factor where you'd happily spend the evening eating, drinking and people watching, possibly taking in a nightclub if that's your choice.

For me, a hotel needs to provide just two things: 1: A clean room where I can get a nights sleep 2: Somewhere that I can safely store my belongings while I'm am out. When I travel to a city, especially one such as Rome, I don't expect to be in my hotel room for a great length of time, as there is so much to see and do. After the long days of walking around, sightseeing, in the city, all we really wanted to do was go back to the hotel and go asleep and get up, refreshed, the next morning and head off early for another day of wandering around. Like most/all hotels, there are pro's and con's with them and the Milton Roma is no different. Its then up to you to decide whether the pro's outweigh the cons or the other way around. PRO'S: Location: From either airport, you can make your way to Roma Termini Station, jump on the Line A Metro and get off at the Manzoni station. The hotel is directly across the road. Very easy. Five minutes walk down the road from the hotel is the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. For almost anything else, the Metro across the road can be used and there's a regular bus service and an over ground tram system that run by the hotel also. I didn't use the bus or tram but I'm sure they can ferry you to areas that the Line A Metro doesn't. All in all, very easy to get around the city beginning from the hotel front door. Rooms : Small but clean. TV with one English language channel (CNN). A safe, minibar and air conditioning. No complaints about the room. Hotel Staff: Very nice, friendly and helpful. While this would be expected in any hotel that you stay in, it's not always the case but no complaints here. CON'S: No hotel restaurant - I didn't mind this but others may not like the idea of a hotel not having an in-house restaurant. No room service - I must admit, I like hotels with room service, especially when you get back after a long day and just want to something quick and easy to eat, like a freshly made sandwich. Having said that, I didn't mind this too much either and there is a snack bar across the road that opens late enough. Noise from the traffic outside - This is the sole reason that I will not return to this hotel. We were on the 3rd floor, facing out to a busy junction and the noise from the traffic was incredibly loud - ALL NIGHT! The beeping car horns, police and ambulance sirens and the screeching trams was relentless. It was like the window was wide open. I am not a light sleeper but found it impossible to get a full nights sleep without waking up 8 or 9 times with the sound a tram going by. It sounded like an earthquake at times. The police and ambulance, complete with wailing sirens, were whizzing by every 7 or 8 minutes, which I was very surprised by as the Rome that I saw was very peaceful and non threatening. Its a shame that this was the case as I would have no problem in recommending this hotel to anyone who was travelling to Rome for a sightseeing trip. The location is excellent so if you are already booked in for a stay, bring earplugs, unless you're a very very heavy sleeper. There are a number of rooms facing into the courtyard away from the noisy junction so maybe that's the answer to the problem I encountered.

We managed the walk a couple of times, but the Metro is so cheap (1 Euro for 75mins of travel) and convenient that it seemed to make more sense. The ticketing system is an absolute breeze to use. I had read the reviews before travelling that said the hotel was quite noisy and expected this to be people just over-reacting.

The staff were exemplary, and couldn't have been more helpful.

We went on the Rome by night tour. We were picked up from the door and dropped back again later. It was nice to see all the attractions at night as some of them look twice as good. The square around the Pantheon is great for evening meals. The Pantheon itself is illuminated after dark and the square comes alive with street performers.

The hotel was easy to find, we caught the terravision coach from Ciampino Airport which takes you straight to Stazione Termini (Main station in rome). From here we caught the Metro to Manzoni station which is directly outside the hotel. The Metro was 1 Euro for a ticket valid for 75 minutes or you can buy a 24 hour ticket for 4 Euros, either way its cheaper & quicker than a taxi. Our flight was delayed by an hour so we didnt arrive at the hotel until about 730pm. We were greeted at the front desk & given our room key along with a map of Rome. Breakfast which was complimentry is from 7am until 11am & consists of toast, crossaints either plan or with Jam or Chocolate, Sweet pastries, and one morning they even had pizza!!

Breakfast was very good indeed with choice of cereal ,juices, fruit, yogurt, bread rolls, cooked meats ,cheeses, jams, toast , bacon and eggs with tea and coffee plentiful. Unfortunately like most hotels the drink prices were extortionate. May I suggest removing hotel drinks contents from the minibar, go to supermarket 10 min. walk and purchace beers, wines and water and keep them in minibar at a fraction of price.eg. bottle beers less than 2 euro.

The hotel is located 1o minutes walk from Colosseo. You have the subway station right outside the hotel door, just across the street. The red line, Manzoni station. The red line is also an important line cause with this line you can get to the most of the sightings. We arrived at Fiumicino and took the Leonardo Express to Termini. From Termini we took the red line, two stations. You need to walk a bit to get to right platform at Termini and with big bags it can get a bit heavy. A ticket and the subway costs 1 euro. The hotel is at a crossing with trams, buses and cars. So if you\u2019re a light sleeper ask for a room away from the road. The rooms 320, 321 and 322 is the onces you need to stay away from. It\u2019s right at crossing and you will get a lot of noice. The hotel staff were kind and informed us about two trips with buses. But we also got a map over Rome were they informed us to get the red line as good way to see all things. Breakfirst was ok, were planning on eating as much as we cold before we got out on town. The had a buffet with, fresh fruits, eggs, ham, cakes and a couple of more things. Hotel has internet but it was expensive, it costed 4 euro for 15 minutes. I recommend to use the internetplace located if you go left out from the second door(not the door that face that subway) at the hotel. It is only about 20 meter from the hotel and they have internet, fax, telephone service. On you first visit you need to bring your passport. You will get a username and password that will last the hole time you are in Rome. If you go there a second time you don\u2019t need to bring a passport. Just walk inside and login, you pay when you\u2019re done. The price is better. 0,50 euro for 15 minutes, 1 euro for 30 minutes. The best Ice cream bar is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel, it's located at Via Principe Eugenio 65. It dosen't have a clear sign outside so you can miss it.

The room did get quite a lot of noise from the street, particularly on Saturday night when everyone was out - but we took earplugs so it wasn't really a problem. 2.

I was a little woried about the location of the hotel having read many reviews on this site complaining about the poor location, however I was delighted at how convenient the hotel was. Ok, it was a little far to walk to many sights, but it was very handy to the Collessum (max 15mins) and the nearest subway, which I found the best and cheapest way of getting around Rome, is only a five minute walk away - this, of course, will change when the Manzoni station opens and will mean that the nearest subway will be less than a minute away. I mean, what more could you want Our room was perfectly adequate. When we booked the hotel (via Venere.com), I asked for rooms facing onto the courtyard (an attempt to avoid the din from the noisy streets running alongside the hotel) and I'm happy to report that our request was granted with an added bonus for my sister and her partner who managed to get a room with a large balcony. Our room also faced out onto the balcony (the only one in the hotel I think) but we couldn't access it unless we climbed out the window! Our room numbers were 128 and 130 (as far as I can remember) and would be ideal if, like us, you are travelling in a group of four as we were able to sit out on the balcony at nighttime and enjoy the warm night air. On the topic of warmth and heat, the only real downside to this hotel is the noise of the air conditioner and, as we stayed during July, it was necessary to have the ac on all night in order to guarantee any kind of sleep. My advice to you is to bring ear plugs otherwise you could be in for some very restless nights. Breakfast was included with our booking and, again, was perfectly satisfactory. Of course, the now infamous coffee was a little disappointing but, hey, we were in Rome and could find a perfectly good coffee just about anywhere so were easily able to make up for the lukewarm and watery offering elsewhere. There's not much nightlife around the hotel so we forked out on a taxi most nights to the Trastevere area (an absolute must when you go to Rome - delicious restaurants and incredibly lively). The taxi fare was anything from 10-15 euros each way(depending on traffic), but this was shared between four of us so didn't work out to be too expensive. There is a gorgeous restaurant just a stone's throw away from the hotel called Romantica (or something along the lines of that), it wasn't overly expensive and the profiteroles are absolutely to die for!! Just head towards the Vittorio Emmanuelle subway, walk about 100 yards from the hotel and its on your right hand side (I promise that I don't work for this restaurant or anything, I'm simply plugging it because of those heavenly desserts!!)

The service was good, with helpful staff, from the front desk to the bar lady; all responded well and were keen to make our stay enjoyable. Walking to either metro station was not a problem (the one opposite is still being repaired). We did walk miles, or so it seemed but then this is Rome and not London, so with comfortable shoes, water and a map you should be fine. I'm almost 64 with knees that are a problem to me. The youngest of our four was 59, and we all did OK with managing the many steps, queing and standing around taking in the talks and views. We used the train to come into Rome from FCO airport, and a taxi from the main station in to the Milton, and then the shuttle back from the hotel on Sunday leaving Rome. The queing, almost wherever you go, is considerable. We were told that a few years ago 400,000 visitors came to Rome, now due to the film Gladiators and Dan Brown et-al, this figure has grown to 4,000,000. We gave up on the Friday trying to access the Vatican Museum (VM) having arrived at 10.20! Succeeded on Saturday but this time arrived at 9.00, having breakfasted much earlier. Talking about food the hotel is only BB, but the BB should be read as Big Breakfast! They are good! We walk from the hotel to all the sights having prepared the night before with the map provided by the hotel and a guide book we took with us. We did see the Colosseum many times on our way back to the hotel. To visit the VM (both times) we used the Metro, changing at the main station, which was very simple to do. My italian is about four words, but what a difference it makes to try. So, do greet people and say goodbye, it is appreciated and does wonders for the service received. Small complaint, no observation about the hotel, the rooms are fairly hot at night and openning the windows is great for fresh air BUT does let in the road noise. Otherwise a great stay, both at the Hotel MIlton and Rome.", "Date": "February 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cVery, very pleased\u201d", "Author": "CRDUSA", "ReviewID": "UR6835616", "Content": "We are a family of four (with two children ages 4 and 7) and spent Feb 18-23 at the Hotel Milton. We thought it was a great place. We were given an outstanding room in the back of the hotel with a queen-size bed and two twin beds. The room was a great size. The children had their own little area across from a spotless bathroom with nice fixtures and a hair dryer. Noise, because we were in the back, was never a problem Plus: 1. Cleanliness of hotel, size of room, newness of hotel. 2. Breakfast (I've read on this site where the breakfast was said to be \"outstanding\". I wouldn't go that far. It was okay, the pastries were uninspiring. But, there is enough choice to satisfy most anyone. The children were content with the chocolate rice krispies). 3. There is a telephone/internet place a few doors to the left if you exit on Emanuele Filiberto. This is an unbelievable convenience if you need to call internationally. It was rather cheap (if calling the U.S., you have to dial 001, area code and number, press the button on the phone after connection, then pay the attendant when done). 4. Additionally, right next door, and to the left on Emanuele Filiberto, is a Tabacchi where you can buy bus, tram, and metro tickets. Also, you can buy little souvenirs. Minuses: 1. Coffee. I have stayed in pensions and little hotels in Italy before and the morning coffee was outstanding. At the Milton, the coffee is self-service, comes out of a machine, and it was not good. I would have preferred, for breakfast, no choice and instead, been given great coffee in individual pots, with fresh pastries and various Italian breads. 2. Area. Don't let this dissuade you from staying at the Milton. It isn't all that bad. However, you are in a little bit of \"no man's\" land. It's a good 15-20 minute walk from Termini, and a 20 minute walk to the Colosseum. However, there is a bus, right across the street, and to the left, on Emanuele Filiberto, that will take you to Termini, and from there you can go anywhere (with a free transfer to bus or subway, 75 minutes after you initially validate your ticket in the yellow machine in the back of the bus). To the right when exiting on Manzoni, you'll find an assortment of buses, some that will take you to the Colosseum. The Manzoni subway stop across the street is still closed (if you have read prior reviews, you know this a thousand times already). However, the subway does not help very much for the historic sites. We took it once to go directly to the Spanish Steps. Other than that, I don't think you need the Metro at all. Stick to the buses. Miscellaneous notes: 1. We contracted with Rome Shuttle Limousine (do a Google search) to get us from Fiumincino (da Vinci) to the hotel. It was 35 Euros, an excellent bargain from what I've heard, compared to regular taxi and other services. I would have taken the express train to Termini, but since I was told I was going to have to pay for the children, financially and practically, a car service made much more sense. 2. I found the bus situation very confusing. I was never able to find a schedule, although I learned, on the last day, that I could have purchased a \"bus route\" map at the Tabacchi which gives a listing of the bus routes and numbers. That may have helped, although the map is so tiny that it was difficult to read even in the best of light. On my next trip to Rome, I will be better prepared for the buses. Do some work on the buses before you get there. 3. My face was in the city map so much, it was ridiculous. Walking around was the best, but the streets can be so confusing (they change names frequently, they end suddenly, they do whatever, etc., which makes Rome so charming). The map from the hotel is good (I had at least two on me at all times and got fresh ones everyday, because by the end of each day, I destroyed at least two). I would carry another map that you find beneficial. Maps are not always they same, and different ones can help you find different things. Also, when it gets dark, the maps become difficult to read. Rome is one dark city in the evening. Bring a small flashlight for reading the map at night. I wish I did. Also, a flashlight always seems to come in handy in a hotel room, especially if you want to get out early while others are still sleeping. 4. Eating. Since we over-ate at breakfast, we just had a small snack for lunch (slice of Pizza, folded together, and some espresso at various times during the day). Even though we are a family with young children, we tried to be like Romans and eat late at restaurants, although we still got there on the early side (around 7:30 when most re-open for dinner). If you want a real Roman experience that will bring tears to your eyes, eat at Ristorante der Pallaro, a block south of Corso Vittorio Emmanuele, located on Largo del Pallaro 15, north of Campo de' Fiori. There is no menu; they bring you courses of what they have cooked that day. It was an unbelievable experience and the proprietor, a woman who wears a kerchief around her head, will make you really feel like you've chosen the most authentic place. Rick Steves recommended this restaurant, and now, I am a big fan of his, and trust his judgment on food (that's how I found all of my restaurants and loved every one) and other matters. 4. Money. Be vigilant of pickpockets. I was very careful, looked around a lot and tried to not look like, or act like, a tourist (although the map being stuck to my face may have given me away a bit). My ATM card worked fine, although make sure you only have a four digit PIN, as I was told that more than that will not allow your card to work in foreign (non US) ATMs. Let your credit card companies and bank know that you will be away so they don't freeze you up, fearing fraudulent activity. 5. Kids (you can stop reading if this doesn't concern you). We live in NYC so our kids are used to walking a lot, and they were real troopers as we ran them around this fabulous city. We got our kids \"journals\" and they pasted/taped post cards, restaurant cards, sugar packets, leaves from Villa Borghese, etc. into the book. They did drawings, and writings (the 7 year old did a real diary). This kept them occupied at various times (especially during the witching hour when we were waiting to be served in restaurants) and allowed us to relax in a square while the kids worked on the journals. We didn't go to the children's museum (what's the point? We're in Rome). We didn't do the Time Elevator, although that may have been fun, especially if your children are older. Children, under 10 are free on public transportation. Our kids got in free at The Vatican Museums, but had to pay at the Colosseum. Children have to pay at Galleria Borghese, I was told (we did not go there). I don't know the rhyme or reason as to when children pay and don't pay. But, they did not have to pay on the 110, Hop On, Hop Off bus, which is a good way to see the city. If you get on very early in the day, it's worth it, although, the stops are hard to find and the bus only runs in one direction. Again, if you master the city buses, you probably won't need the 110. Our kids did all right adjusting to the time, but slept late every day. Not too bad (if you are a two parent family) to have one parent stay behind and allow the other to go out and explore early. That's what we did and it worked out great.

Elevator ride to second floor to a very clean carpeted newly decorated room. Very comfortable bed with with flat screen TV. The room was tight but big enough. Bathroom was a good size very clean bright lighting big sink with a real hair dryer for my wife and a shower curtain which could of been wider to keep water off the floor. Location to the sites was great. Short walk to the Colosseum and the forum. Pantheon and Trevi are also all within walking distance. Alot of geat places to eat, drink wine or get gelato in Pantheon/Trevi area. The breakfast at the hotel was the best we had during out trip throughout Italy. Big bright dining room with tablecloths.

The hotel is situated on the corner of a busy crossroads, and yes, the noise carries on throughout the night between cars, trams and buses. However we managed to sleep as our home is situated on a busy street so it was fine for us, but do take earplugs if noise bothers you. There are 2 metro stations nearby, both on the Metro A line, and a 10 minute walk either uphill or downhill depending on which one you go for. The hotel will benefit greatly when the Manzoni Metro station opens because it is literally across the street. We found a couple of really great Pizzeria and Pasta places nearby and the food was fabulous. The hotel was within walking distance to the Colosseum, approx. 10 - 15 minutes away. The reception staff were fantastic, very efficient and greeted us with a free map of Rome and told us how to get to the nearest attractions. They also helped us contact our airline when our luggage went missing. Our room was spotlessly clean, not the biggest room I've stayed in but we were in Rome to sight see not stay in our room. Ample storage space for luggage and a small safe (no use for a laptop). As well as CNN we also discovered MTV which had some english speaking shows on our LCD tv. The bathroom was great, very clean, no shower curtain but again this didn't bother us, its a minor inconvenience that's all. The hotel bar opens in the evening, and is very small but service was great with a good choice of drinks and light snacks. You can either charge it to your room or pay, as we did, direct. On the whole the hotel was fab, staff were very efficient and the hotel was very clean. The only thing that we noticed that had been advertised as being in our room but wasn't was a coffee tray - so what!

I was generally very pleased with my stay. Location is a little bit out; the Colosseum is the nearest major tourist site & is a 10 to 15 minute walk away. I'm usually a very fast walker, but in the heatwave of late July I couldn't do anything at speed! Termini Station is a 15 to 20 minute walk away. Manzoni metro station is directly opposite, but is closed for restoration until later in the year. To be honest I only used it once to go to Ottavia for The Vatican, & just walked up to Vittorio metro station to get on. Staff were very polite and freindly, without exception. Room reminded me of a Thistle Hotel (if you're from the UK that'll hopefully give you an idea of the quality). As others mentioned, it's not so much a minibar as a fridge full of a few soft drink cans & bottled water. Room was fully air conditioned, but was quite noisey throughout the day and night, as it is located on the corner of two roads. Reception is 24 hour (I came in at almost 2 AM one night). My bathroom DID have a shower curtain, but due to poor design water still leaked out on to the bathroom floor, so by the time I'd finished there was a paddling pool to mop up with spare towels! Breakfast exceeded my expectations; a choice of fresh fruit, cereals, yoghurts, sliced meats and cheeses, toast, juice, coffee and various pastries. Cheap way to fill yourself before setting out for the day. I fully intend to visit Rome again (it's the best city I've ever visited, & I've been to a few now) and will definately choose the Hotel Milton again.", "Date": "July 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSo what there was no shower curtain....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5416055", "Content": "Ok so it is weird not to have a shower curtain but once you get over this minor detail, the hotel had everything else going for it.

Just a shame the hotel did not fit the bill. Previous reviews outlined a few teethng problems such as shower curtains/screens which were not really a problem. The buffet breakfast is great and the location is a wee bit out but not bad and close to the Colosseum and Forum. It will improve when the Metro opens accross the road but if you are walking about probably not the best hotel to stay at. The area around the hotel is not the best and there is even spray paint graffeti over the front of the hotel. The mininbar consists of two bottles of water and soft drinks and is not really a bar in any sense of the word. The hotel bar has no atmosphere is closed during the day and you must charge everything to the room! Minor points, but what really disappoints is the refusal of staff to place a surprise engagement ring in the hotel safe because it was 'full' even when I showed them the tiny ring box and the failure of the hot water sysytem so no warm showers or shaving etc, not my idea of a good holiday! To add insult to injury the 6 Euro discount offered by staff was a disgarce. What a disaster! This hotel does try but I'm afraid is not there and will not be for some time...

I admit I was a little skeptical that a 4 star hotel with such a great location was so reasonably priced. At the time we made our reservation there were no comments about the hotel, as it was about to open. After I made the reservation with Hotels, I called the hotel and spoke to Claudia. I explained that I booked a room for 3 Adults and a child. She said that she would look at all the rooms and to find out which room would accommodate our needs. I called her back in a couple of days and she said she found the perfect room and she did. I had also told her the flight we were arriving on. As soon as we had got our luggage and started wheeling it out I saw someone with our name, at that point I knew that I had chosen the right hotel. The hotel was everything that Claudia had promised. Because of the central location of the hotel, we could get everywhere easily. Directions from the hotel staff helped, especially from Emanuele the front desk man. He will go the extra mile to make sure you get to your destination. Everyone was friendly and the afternoon happy hour was great. The breakfast was fresh and plentiful. The maid service was as good as we have had anywhere, if not better. Of course not anything is ever perfect, but all things considered this hotel comes very close. The showers did not have curtains. I asked Claudia why there were no curtains for the shower, she said the enclosures had been ordered and will soon be installed. One thing is for sure, you can not go wrong by staying at The Hotel Milton Roma.

As the hotel was only just recently opened still a a couple of cosmetic things to happen, but nothing major. The room was very well appointed. Another thing that impressed me was that I was quite unwell during my stay and travelling alone, which can make one feel quite depressed. The hotel was aware that I was resting in my room and checked up on me to make sure that I was ok. Even organising a staff member to bring me tea and a light meal.
