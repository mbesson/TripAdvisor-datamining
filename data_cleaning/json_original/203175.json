Both rooms had the same quality of furnishings and fixtures, so the main difference was size (and travertine floors in the suite vs. carpet in the classic room). Often the less expensive rooms at hotels tend to be of inferior quality. Beds are very comfortable. The rooms are small by American hotel standards, but the website accurately states the measurements of the rooms--so it was what we expected. Americans would refer to the Suite as a 1 1/2 bath (so the extra half bath was a nice surprise). Breakfast in the morning is also excellent.

A few minutes later, we were shown a deluxe room and were told it was ours for the same rate. Excellent customer service and gorgeous room! Spacious room, beautiful furnishings, clean carpet (I walked around barefoot- big deal for me), king sized bed, large marble bath, quiet location.

The room had double windows, so you would have to open one to get to the outside window and open the other one.

We stayed at a hotel that even though it was rated four stars, I must say that it currently stands at a two star rating IMO. From filthy carpeting to poor lighting and broken mirrors in the room to poor recommendations from the concierge. People in general were rude. We couldn't wait to get out of Paris and leave to Rome. We knew that it couldn't get any worse plus we had a good feeling about Rome. We arrived via taxi to Hotel Barocco and were so pleased from the moment we set foot inside. Check in was a breeze. We got there a lot earlier than our check in time. The front desk assured us our room would be ready in 15 minutes and kindly asked us to wait in the lobby. We were so surprised that we didn't have to leave our luggage in a closet and wait for hours until check in time unlike the hotel we stayed at in Paris. When the room was ready, we were taken in the elevator which is quite small. I say maybe five slim people fit maximum. Our bags were to follow separately. We stayed on the first floor in lucky room number 13 which was a room very near Piazza Barberini. The room had windows--each window consisted of double pane windows so you had to open two windows in order to hear the outside street noise. Since the hotel controls the central a/c, you don't have access to adjust the temperature in your room. If it's too warm, you would need to open the windows. The room was perfect only for two people. It provided enough space for each piece of luggage we brought along with a carryon each. The bed was very comfortable. I couldn't use the down comforter they provided because the most I sleep with is a thin blanket plus I found the room to be a bit hot for a down comforter unless you slept with the window open. Pillows were comfortable as well. I loved the bathroom--so spacious, with great toiletries, and a bidet. The shower was very nice as well. My only complaint about the shower is that if I tried to make the water hot just how I like it, the pressure kept decreasing. It decreased to the point where it barely had pressure and it was a rain shower head which you can adjust. As I adjusted it, the water just dripped downwards rather than sideways. The safe was super duper tiny. We could only fit a few pieces such as wallet, weddings bands, small camera, iPad, etc. Our professional Canon camera and MacBook had to stay outside. We felt very safe there, so we knew it wouldn't be a problem. Our room rate included free breakfast buffet plus wifi. The breakfast buffet was incredible! As soon as you walk into the dining area, you are greeted by your friendly waitress and you get to choose where you would like to sit. The center table had a spread of various cheese and bread, luncheon meats such as ham and prosciutto, pastries such as glazed croissants and cannoli, butter, jams, and honey. The back table had a spread of various cereals, juices, and milk. You also had the option of ordering eggs from their menu. Every morning I had scrambled eggs with bacon and it was delicious. Now, when it comes to their wifi, it pretty much is terrible. Many sites I tried visiting could not be opened, most site that did open where directed to their European affiliation, and every time the laptop went idle, the wifi connection was lost and the access code had to be reentered. My husband had to turn off and on the wifi on his iPad over and over again in order to get it working properly. We read in an announcement the hotel left in our room that Italy has one of the worst Internet connections in the world with very slow speeds. Quite frankly, it's true. They are working on improving it. Concierge service was excellent! All dining recommendations were fantastic! Not one restaurant was mediocre. Every place we dined at had excellent food and top notch service. We are looking to come back to Rome with our family since we had such a fantastic time, so we asked if they had suites for a family. Unfortunately, they don't provide rooms for over three guests which is quite a bummer. We loved everything about this hotel except for the wifi issues. Guess we will need to look elsewhere with a family suite. :(", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome !\u201d", "Author": "Mohsinx", "ReviewID": "UR121333984", "Content": "Outstanding Location and very helpful front desk if you are a tourist you won't go wrong in this hotel.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Randall4867", "ReviewID": "UR121250169", "Content": "Nice hotel, well located and staff in general was good and helpful.

It also had a balcony with some lounging chairs and a table, oh and also the outdoor Jacuzzi. Whatever time we left the room to go out, it would always be made-up, clean and tidy on our return. If shopping is your desire, then Via Condotti (not far from the Spanish Steps) is a great place to go, as my good little lady will vouch for and is also within walking distance of the hotel so that you don\u2019t have to carry all those designer shopping bags too far! Also plenty of good eateries all within a few minutes walk of the hotel. I really can not pick any faults with the Barocco and I\u2019m very fussy where I stay!

I used my american airline points to book the room, classic double, and it was perfect. We had room 52, great bathroom and rainfall shower. Beds very comfortable and enough room to move around the beds on both sides. Did not feel cramp even with 2 large pieces of luggage. Best part, they actually had a few english channels on the cable box that showed variety shows so you are not stuck watching CNN the entire trip. I took my 71 yr old mom this trip and we mostly walked everywhere. Since I had been so many times, we visited areas we had not been before. I would HIGHLY recommend if you are going to be there on a Sunday to check out their Flea Market at Porta Portese. It is held every sunday from 7-1 pm - we got there about 8:30 am and it was not too crowded but did get very congested by 11. You will find the same scarves and jewelery there that you find on Via del Corso shopping street. I am sure you all know how to haggle, but what worked best for me is as soon as I made my counter offer, if they said no, or tried to negotiate, I put the merchandise down and walked away. Every time they yelled after me and gave me my price. You have to let them know that you do not feel it is worth more than the price you mentioned and you will not negotiate, it will save you time. Also if you are new to Rome, I recommend the hop on hop off bus. You can walk to everything, but the colosseum is a good walk and all the buses stop there. (or take metro, there is a station right next to the hotel) Also, it is great to take around at night to see Rome with all the lights on. The hotel can accommodate with tickets, same price as the vender down the street selling it. There is a travel agency right next door for any train needs or other things. We decided to book a train to Florence for the day since it is only a 1.5 hr direct ride. We left at 8:30 and returned at 7 pm. That is enough time to spend there - make sure you go to the san lorenzo market - mainly leather purses, but some pretty leather bound note pads. They offer free wi-fi and if you do not have a laptop, they have one by the front desk that they let you jump on and check your emails - no charge. But the BEST thing about the hotel is the BREAKFAST. The best spread I have had at any hotel in Europe. Fresh eggs & bacon cooked to order, prosciutto platters, cheese platter with 4 different kinds to cut from, sliced tomatoes and mozzerella balls, etc. Stay here, rooms are quiet, beds are great, staff is very helpful and the breakfast is wonderful.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201c\"Very Pleasant\"\u201d", "Author": "SteveAndi", "ReviewID": "UR120629137", "Content": "This hotel has a great staff and cozy rooms.

Remember to try the eggs cooked to order. We had two superior rooms (double and twin), average size for Europe so fine for us. Bathroom and room was clean and tidy. Only thing that took a bit getting use to was the large abundance of light switches - they were everywhere. The room had SKY TV which showed BBC news; the majority of other channels were in Italian. There was an electronic safe in the room which was big enough for camera and passports (but not large enough for a netbook). The double room was quadruple-glazed so with both sets of windows shut, the noise from the square was cut right down, if you are a light sleeper you might want to ask for a room that doesn\u2019t face the fountain and square. Only challenge is, you will need to investigate the wider city for \u2018authentic\u2019 places to eat, as the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain areas are rife with generic places trying to pull you in, avoid these when possible and if you pre-plan with Trip Advisor you can find some great places. We found one nice place just down the street the hotel is on, called Osteria Barberini. Very handy place when you first arrive. Barocco was actually our second choice as the first choice was full, but in hindsight after seeing the location of the other hotel, we lucked out. There\u2019s not much else you can ask for.

The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. There were shutters to keep the noise and the light out. The bathroom had a decadent rainfall shower with colored lights, and it included high quality toiletries. Our room was kept very clean. The most pleasant surprise about the room was the terrace! It was hard to believe that we were in the middle of a busy city while we sat and drank wine on our terrace. We received a complimentary fruit basket on arrival, and the night before we checked out, we received a thank you note from the manager with a platter of cookies. The breakfasts were fantastic. The tables were set with linen tablecloths, and the buffet was delicious. Breakfast also included cooked to order eggs and omelets. The breakfast staff were accommodating and professional. The concierge was incredibly helpful. We can't thank Christiano and the two Fabios enough for their friendliness, restaurant and touring recommendations, and their professionalism.

Perfect location...we walked everywhere, only taking a taxi to the Vatican, we could have and probably would have walked those days too, but it was extremely hot (90's) while we were there in September. 2. Very friendly staff...anything you asked for or needed they were able to provide. 3. Excellent Breakfast...traditional Italian items in addition to freshly made eggs to order. 4. Possibly the best cappucino I have ever tasted! 5. Beautiful rooms with fully renovated and quite spacious bathrooms. The best part about staying at Barocco that plays to it's location was that each night as we'd walk back from dinner we made it a point to take the route past Trevi...there isn't anything more spectacular than hearing that fountain in the background and then stumbling upon it just walking back from a night out in Rome....", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States", "Title": "\u201cSandy C.\u201d", "Author": "Sandy C", "ReviewID": "UR119397355", "Content": "Our first trip abroad was enhanced by the beautiful accomodations of this jewel of a hotel.

It is a nice hotel, older but remodeled and nice. Our room was nice, but we noticed it didn't have a shower. I called the front desk and inquired. We were asked if we had requested a shower and I said that our travel agent had booked this hotel so I was not sure. I was told that they would look into it but that a shower needed to be a request. (if you want a shower and not just a tub, be sure to be specific when making your reservation) well, our agent must have requested it because we were immediately moved to another room, the mini suite, which was very spacious and we were told that the hotel was going to be full that weekend so they were making the change now while they still had availability. I truly appreciate that they made the switch. The only negative about the suite is that is is right on Barberini Square, which means NOISY. However, we were so exhausted from our travels during the day that once we fell asleep, it was just fine so this might not be a problem for some people, just letting you be aware. Also, our shower was very slow in draining, but we let the managment know upon check out and they said they would take care of it. Everyone was very nice at the front desk and the breakfast that was provided was also very good and adequate for our needs. Now for the real negative: as part of our hotel booking, a free transfer to the airport was included so the morning we were to depart for the airport, I called down to the front desk and asked if we could leave a little earlier than the 9:00 am time and they checked and said that we could. The driver arrived at 8:10 and off we went. Well, I will tell you that this driver drove so incredibly fast to the airport that I was a wreck!! I saw the speedometer hit 170 kilometers and that is just way to fast, on a Sunday morning with plenty of time to get to the airport. Traffic was relatively light. There is just no reason to drive like that and endanger lives that way. I told the driver 3 times that were were flying on Delta. He seemed to understand and dropped us off at Terminal 3. When we went in, we discovered that we were at the wrong place and that we needed to take the shuttle to Terminal 5. That took some time so it was a great that we had left the hotel earlier than planned!! What I want the Hotel to be aware of is the incredible speed with which this driver drove and the fact that he also didn't seem to know or care where he dropped us off, just that he got us to the airport at any location he could. If the Hotel is going to offer a free transfer, they need to be sure their clients arrive at their destination safely and at the correct location or really, what good is it??", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "FlyingFinLin", "ReviewID": "UR118560079", "Content": "My husband and I were only in Rome for one night and we wanted to stay close to most sights and shopping, since that is what we wanted to do.

We opted for an upgraded room and it was very nice, albeit much smaller than I had expected. The room was nicely renovated and appointed, had a really nice washroom and looked out directly over the statue in Piazza Bernini.

With 2 suitcases at 24\" plus two backpacks, we (meaning me) had to place one suitcase on top of the bar fridge (no other place for it) with the other one placed on the room luggage rack.

We booked the annex room which is located in a separate buildoing literally 8 seconds away from the main hotel. Room 50 was very spacious and comfortable. I have included a video review of the room so take a look. Annex room 50 was WAY bigger than the regular rooms in the hotel. The price is actually lower than the rooms in the main building which makes the whole thing even better. Hotel is a small boutique type hotel but with a touch for luxury. Service was very good throughout although there were a few odd situations regarding room service. FYI, since the annex rooms are in a separate building, local regulations prohibit the hotel staff from bringing alcohol as they would need to exit the main building and enter a \"public space\" where alcohol cannot be displayed. If you are staying there, just buy your own wine in one of the numerous shops on Via Veneto and you are set. The breakfast at the main hotel was very adequate with a selection of fresh fruit, pastries, fresh juices and cheese. They also offer a menu from which you can select hot dishes. All this is included in the price of the room, including espresso, cappuccino and other coffees. Location is great as you are within 7 minutes walk to the Spanish Steps, 10 minutes to the Trevi fountain and 30 seconds away from Via Veneto street where you will find the tourist traps and high end shops. Walking from the hotel to some of the major sites like the Forums and Colosseum will take about 20 minutes. Everything is within reach. Around the hotel are nice trendy bars and restaurants but most of the ones on Via Veneto will offer over priced food in a setting that has limited charm. The hotel did however recommend some restaurants about 5 minutes away that were of great quality. So overall, I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.

The room was not as nice as I had expected. Based on pictures from their website and information regarding their recent renovations, I was expecting something different. We were put in room 15 which was definitely not a renovated room. The headboard of the bed even had an old in-headboard radio/intercom system that looked like something from the 1970's. The main wall of the room was outfitted with dark wooden cabinets, desk, and wardrobes which also did not give it the \"contemporary\" feel that I had envisioned based on their website pictures....overall the room had a dark and drab feeling. The size of the room was small but comparable for the area. The bathroom was nice and that did look like it had been updated more than the main room. We had no view to speak of from the windows (just a view of alley's between buildings). For what was basically a $300 a night room for us (in USD), it was dissapointing compared to rooms we could get for the same price in other large US cities. The location of our room was also near the flight of steps that gets used a lot and also right next to the breakfast room, so it was noisey, luckily I had earplugs with me. It is unfortunate that guests coming in late in the evening are not more respectful of the people in the rooms they are walking by... and we had one particularly noisy family during our stay that found no problem yelling back and forth to each other up the stairs early in the morning or late at night, but of course that is just their rudness and not a fault of the hotel staff. The staff was friendly and spoke very good english and were always willing to accomodate us or answer questions. They also arranged our transportation to and from the airport which went smoothly. The complimentary breakfast was also very well done and a good way to start a busy day of sightseeing.

Furthermore, the staff all spoke excellent English, were very well mannered and as helpful as they could be when called upon. Special mention should go to Danielle who was particularly helpful, managing to arrange dinner reservations, transport and the like. Our suite was excellent and all that I'd hoped it would be having opted for the Junior Suite with terrace and 'love pool'. It really was perfect for a couple on honeymoon and I would highly recommend it to couples looking for somewhere romantic to stay whilst in Rome. The room was more than we needed with good en-suite facilities and held at a pleasant temperature by the air con. The real value of this suite though is the outside terrace. You could easily have held a party for 10-12 people due to size of the area and it provides a perfect viewpoint to look out onto the Piazza Barberini at the centre of which is the Fontana di Tritone (Fountain of Triton). Moreover, there was a set of table and 4 chairs (2 large armchairs and 2 standard) with a large parasol for shade which was great for just hanging out and enjoying the sounds of Rome. I knew that the hotel was central but didn't realise quite how central! Situated on one side of the Piazza Barberini, we were literally a 15 minute walk from a lot of the main tourist sites (Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, the Pantheon etc) and a 7-8 minute underground ride away from the Vatican which we visited on our full day. Though we didn't get enough time to do the Colosseum, that was only a 10-15 min walk as well.

As an avid globe trotter, I have stayed in many hotels all over the world. This was not my first time visiting Rome. I have to admit how impressed I was with the level of cleanliness of a city hotel. The hotel signatured bathroom amenities were a nice touch. I did not expect that. However, upon arrival to the entrance of the hotel, I was quite surprised to see how small the lobby was. It literally fits one sofa and the small front desk. There was a huge line of people trying to check out while there was only one staff taking care of one customer at a time. My husband had to stand right outside the sliding door, because there was not enough room to stand in-line. I realize that the hotel operates out of a prehistoric building, which was beautiful. But I have never seen such a small hotel lobby especially with this kind of price. The elevator was very claustrophobic, 2-3 people max, not including your luggage. They did not have a service elevator. Many times, we had to wait for the maid to drag the laundry out of the elevator in order to get in. By the way, even though the metal plate on the elevator buttons showed \"Ferrari\", do not expect any speed when calling for one. Most of the time, we just dove for the stairs. They only had the elevator on every other floor. So you either have to take a flight of stair up or down after you exit the elevator to find your room. I know we are very spoiled by American standard. My husband and I stayed in the Grand Suite during our cruise trip. Our pricey hotel room was merely a third of a size of our ship room, a little bigger than our ship's bathroom, which was difficult to get used to. There was no view. But knowing that we only have to stay for one night, we didn't let it bother us. The staff was very helpful with giving us directions to various places, gave us a map of the city, and made our dinner reservation for us when asked. They were very friendly and courteous. Breakfast buffet was adequate. The ordered coffee was very delicious. I wish they had more Protein options. Although you could order cooked eggs from the waitress.

Book Hotel Barocco for the most wonderful hotel experience in Rome. Every part of the stay was perfect. The location: on a lovely side street off of Piazza Barberini where you can walk 50 feet to a metro or bus stop or a 10 minute walk to the Spanish Steps or 10 minute walk to Trevi Fountain and if you're into walking just keep going and you can get to Pantheon and Piazza Navona. The ambience: absolutely silent! It was incredible during crowded, busy, noisy July in Rome we heard nothing from our room. You can barely even hear other people's doors close. The breakfast: order your eggs and your coffee any way you like and then add to it with fruit, breads, cakes, proscuitto, cheese......oh my, it was hard to decide. The staff: we were greeted with notes and gifts for our anniversary and they were always so helpful and friendly when making our dinner reservations and giving walking/metro directions. The room was a comfortable size and the marble bathroom was a good size and done beautifully - great shower head but wierd shower door so water splashes out a little. Had an adaptor for my hair straightener but the outlet still killed it. No clock in the room - bring one if you like to have it. It was a luxurious, very special experience that we recommend to everyone. We went on from Rome to Positano.....going to give another excellent review to Hotel Palazzo Murat. The food in the south was better than in Rome, in our opinion, but some restaurant comments in Rome: Ninos (spanish steps)- too expensive for what it was Ditirambo (campo di fiori) - mediocre food and the most unfriendly waiter Gusto Osteria (via del corso) - very good Cul de Sac (navona) - only go if you really want meat Le Namauchie (colosseum) - our favorite Rome meal Also, if you're looking for walking tours I hope I can spare you hours of research.

We were able to walk to the Coliseum and it took us about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad. The subway or Metro train station is right across the street from the hotel. We used it to get to the Vatican which is just a few stops away and also to get to Naples when we were heading to Sorrento. The subway was very easy to use. The hotel was very helpful and responsive before my arrival. They helped arrange a pickup at the airport for 50 Euro before our arrival. I think if you book directly through the hotel's website it's cheaper but I had booked through a different website. The staff was very pleasant. We arrived and they upgraded our room for free. The room was perfect. It was small but the bathroom was large and we had a large bathtub. The beds were 2 twins together and super comfortable. I found the linens (nice big duvets) to be very clean and comfortable. We actually stayed at the hotel at the beginning of our trip for 4 nights and then we came back the last night of our trip to fly out of Rome. The last night we were not upgraded so we got to experience the classic double and it was also very nice. It was very similar to the upgrade but without the bathtub. The free breakfast was perfect too! There was a large table of pastries, meat and fresh fruit and bread. You can also order an omelette or scrambled eggs. The waitstaff was very friendly!

As a practical matter, one could not stay for any length of time as there is no space to unpack - no drawers or closet space. The bathroom, although large, was poorly designed with no vanity space or hooks of any kind. The room overall was much smaller than a typical cruise ship cabin.

The car we arranged through Barocco Hotel to pick us up from the airport was a huge blessing. We just had to get our luggage and the car/driver were waiting for us when we got to the curb and took us straight to the Barocco Hotel. We were a bit sheepish with our ability to speak Italian, but the folks at the front desk spoke amazing English and couldn't have been any nicer with helping us check-in and get settled. When we checked in the porter was so sweet and attentive and brought our bags up right away. The lift was very tiny, but we loved it as it was an old building, so it was fitting. We stayed in the Junior Suite which was well worth the price. The room was small compared to what we're use to in the States, but we were prepared based on the reviews and we were very comfortable and loved the private terrace that over looked the plaza below. The terrace actually made the room feel larger. We also loved that we were able to get English speaking channels via the satellite TV which pleasantly surprised to us. The bed was so comfortable and the room was tastefully decorated. The lay-out of the room was very unique. Bearing in mind that the hotel was built in 1900, you could see a lot of attention had been given to the floor plan and the space was very efficiently laid out. The hotel has a very unique character and has a very warm fuzzy energy about it that made us feel very relaxed and comfortable staying there. The bathroom was a bit different. We loved the marble in the bathroom, it was beautiful. The novelty of choosing which colored lighting we wanted to shower in was a first for us, but again it all added to the experience which was wonderful. We also enjoyed the jacuzzi tub on the terrace as well. It was a bit surreal to sit and relax in this private jacuzzi on a hotel roof top in the middle of Rome at night. It really was a lovely experience. OH! And the breakfast, which was included with our stay was AMAZING! Fresh eggs, cooked the way we wanted, fresh breads, cheeses, pastries, fruit, juices, etc. It was a great start to our long days of sight seeing while we were in Rome. We were considering staying at a hotel outside of town as we were concerned with the city traffic/street noise, but we were glad we spent the extra to stay in the city, because it saved us money big time in the long run when it came to transportation. We would have spent so much more in cab fare traveling in and out of the city anytime we wanted to go some place or see something. Turns out the noise never was even a factor. The hotel was so well insulated that when the terrace door was closed you couldn't really hear much going on outside at all. What more, the location was very central to the places we were touring and there were so many yummy eats and treats all around the hotel. We were able to walk to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain, which was really nice and it enabled us to really see more of the local sites. The concierge was extremely helpful from giving us directions to local sights, to arranging a car to get us directly to our cruise ship, they couldn't have been any nicer or more helpful.

From the second you step in the cosy reception you are made to feel welcome, without the hotel team being over the top. The room with the \"love tub\" is fantastic. The bathroom is very well equipped (2 sinks and a shower where you can select the colour of the lighting!), there is a mezzanine floor with a desk and a very, very comfy bed with windows that let in very little noise (incredible for such a central hotel). And then there is the outside area. You can see from my photos how great it looks, and you are right in Rome! You can lay in the tub (which is covered) with the rain crashing down and not care - we put in some of the bath gel and it was fab. Or you can sit in one of the 4 chairs and listen to the world below. Absolute amazing. And then there is the food for breakfast. We didn't know about the cooked options until the 3rd day when we found a menu - up till then we were very happy with the continental breakfast. You can eat so much but being Rome you will walk it off. Also fantastic coffees. Location wise you are bang between St Peters and the Coliseum so everything is within walking distance, or you are bang on a mtero station (tip: it is actually easier to walk than get the metro at Termine - so many stairs there!)

The hotel was very easy to find from the Barberini metro station even though we arrived at nearly midnight and it was dark. The check in process was fast and painless and the front desk agent was friendly - speaking in English and Italian with us. We found all of the staff members to be welcoming and helpful throughout our visit. We had a room in the annex section which we quite enjoyed because it was quiet although it would have been nice if the front desk agent had explained how to find it the night we checked in! The room overlooked the street and we could see the Piazza Barberini if we looked out from our window to the right. The traffic noise got to be a little much at times but it wasn't unbearable. The room was cleaned regularly and we liked the turn down service we received in the evenings. The room itself was comfortable if not a little small but quite normal for European standards. The bathroom was clean and spacious although I am quite short (5'3\") and had trouble stepping in and out of the tub with very high sides. The highlight of this hotel for us was the breakfast. You can easily pay 30 to 40 Euros for breakfast in this touristy city and having it included in our rate was a welcome bonus, not to mention that it was wonderful not to have to hunt for a restaurant first thing in the morning. The food was fresh, plentiful and delicious. We didn't realize until the second day that we could have eggs made-to-order, which we took full advantage of! They also offered made-to-order hot beverages (try the hot chocolate - so decadent!) and had a nice variety of teas and fruit juices as well. If you can't find something to please you with all the different hot and cold items available then don't bother typing a review that says \"I'm not a picky eater but...\" because there is plenty to please all. The hotel was an easy downhill walk (5 mins) to the Trevi Fountain and maybe a 10 minute walk to the Spanish Steps. There are lots of buses around as well as the Metro A right close to the hotel. The front desk staff are happy to help figure out what bus you need to take to get where you want to go (not just tourist attractions - we needed to get to a non-tourist place and the front desk agent directed us perfectly). The only negative to our stay was on the last night that the fire alarm (or maybe security alarm - not sure) went off several times between 3am and 5am. The front desk staff the next morning told us that it was some kind of issue with the whole neighborhood although I can't imagine what since the power didn't go out...but we were deffinitely dragging our feet a little the next day due to the interrupted sleep, not to mention being a little nervous for the rest of the night not knowing what was going on. My boyfriend was convinced that every little sound was a burgler trying to break in. Speaking of safety - there was a safe in the room although we did not make use of it. You leave your key at the front desk upon departure each morning and pick it up when you return.

We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel, that was in a good location. The hotel far exceeded our expectations. In terms of the hotel, the staff were amazing. Everyone at the front desk was extremely polite, knowledgeable and spoke English fluently. Cleaning services were fantastic - twice a day. And breakfast was a perfect size with a variety of options. The room was very spacious, especially for Rome from what I understand. We stayed in two rooms. The first one was an upgraded room thanks to our upgrade certificate from TripAdvisor. This room was amazing with a balcony over-looking the Bernini fountain. The room was updated with a large washroom, and rain shower. It was at the end of the hall on the first floor, room 14 I believe. The bed was very comfortable, and it had a new TV. The second room we stayed in was a more standard room. This room was extremely spacious, yet slightly dated decor. It had a renovated washroom, and a very comfortable bed. Very little sunlight, only a small window with not much of a view. Regardless, for the money - you could not beat this hotel. Besides all of the amazing hotel amenities (free internet, breakfast, and great restaurant and tour recommendations), the hotel location is incredible. The hotel is located within walking distance of nearly the entire city. Within 10 minutes you can be at the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain, the Villa Bourghesse and many other tourist attractions. If you are up for a walk (maybe an hour) you can even walk to the Colosseum. One day we took the bus to the Jewish quarter and walked back - without stopping, it would not have taken more than an hour and a half. Bus stop for tours is right around the corner. STRONGLY recommend a bus tour. Take it for 48 hours, it can get you three partial days of travel around the city and every tourist attraction is nearby or within walking distance of the stops. Do not spend much time evaluating the companies that offer tours, most stops are standardized for all tours. Lastly, take the hotel's restaurant recommendations. Tritone is amazing. Alfredo is a must. Every restaurant they suggested was great - definitely a bonus to their great customer service. Overall, great hotel. Loved Rome and loved the Hotel Barocco. Would definitely stay there in the future. Strongly recommend for couples travelling, young or old.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Valletta, Malta", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, close to everything...\u201d", "Author": "raybon56", "ReviewID": "UR99412077", "Content": "We spent two wonderful days in the Hotel Barocco in the beginning of February.

For this trip we wanted someplace romantic - so staying in a big chain hotel (Hilton, Mariott, etc.) was out of the question. The Hotel Barocco was perfect in every way. As for location, it is perfectly centered around the major historical sites in Rome (almost all within walking distance), and is across the street from the Metro (to get to the Vatican). It is on the Piazza Barberini, but on a small cross street so the rooms are quiet and isolated from major traffic. In our opinion, the best coffee in Rome is across the street (Pepe's Bar), and the best pizza in the world is around the corner on Via Veneto (Ciao Bella). The rooms are impeccably styled in Roman decor. Our bathroom was huge, all marble, with a wonderful bathtub for soaking after spending the day walking, eating, and taking in the sights of the eternal city. The bedlinens are of exceptional quality, as is the mattress and pillows. I am a picky sleeper, and got the best nights rest in this hotel. The windows open, which is a rarity in hotels these days, so you can sleep with the sounds of Rome in the background. The included breakfast is wonderful and traditional Italian, with the option for more \"American\" eggs and bacon if you wish. The staff provides exemplary service, speaks fluent english, and tolerated my marginal Italian so that I could improve during the trip. Nick in the bar is great, as is Danielle at the front desk. To sum it all up, for five days we did not want for anything. Every little detail was taken care of invisibly by the staff. From directions, restaurant recommendations, or even an umbrella when it was raining, we truly felt we were \"home\" during our brief stay. We will stay here again very soon.

When we arrived at this hotel we were a little put off by a 'cat urine' smell, but quickly discovered it is not in the hotel, but just outside the entrance. Something to do with a sewer grate, we decided. Every day we had the front desk staff help us make plans. They happily reserved for us at the Borghese Gallery, though they didn't tell us you only have two hours, then the staff at this former villa kick everyone out and let a new crop of visitors in. They loaned us a guide book to Rome in English, as we didn't have one. They found us a private car to take us to the airport for our departure. They delivered our laundry on time when we had them do it for us. They answered questions galore, always with a smile, and our room was fantastic. If you can possibly get room 19, it is one flight up so you don't have to wait for the small elevator; it overlooks the beautiful Triton Fountain; the double windows keep all the street noise out and it is really a two - room suite with a huge bathroom with separate jacuzzi bathtub and stall shower. Sky TV is included if you care about that. We thought the wood on the furniture was a little tired and worn, but we quickly overlooked that as the bed was huge, comfortable, they left us SIX pillows and many blankets and we had a walk-in closet with tons of room in it. Fantastic for a hotel in a big city. We enjoyed breakfast, where eggs were made to order and three different juices were provided in addition to yogurt, fruit, many sweet things and rolls, cheese and meats coffee, tea, etc. More fresh fruit rather than canned and fresh squeezed juices would have been nice, but we understand why they don't offer that. As it is, breakfast is quite busy, but there is always a table in the pleasant breakfast room when you show up between 7 o'clock and 10:30 for breakfast. Till 11 o'clock on weekends. We found the hotel to be excellent, but the location a little far away from many of the sites we wished to see. Yes, it's near enough to Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain to walk, but there isn't much to see once you've been there. Piazza Navona is more exciting, and a bit too far to walk. You are very far from \"colloseo\" and Vatican City, but Rome is big and you can't be near everything you wish to see. There are some great restaurants in the Spanish Steps neighborhood, but if it is rainy or you have delicate shoes on, you're probably going to want to take a cab because it isn't 'just around the corner'. Also, this neighborhood is on one of the famous Roman Hills, so in one direction or another, you're walking uphill. Someone who lived in Rome said to me \"Romans don't go there, tourists do\" about this neighborhood, and he was right. But given that we were tourists, it worked well for us. To start our day without becoming overheated, we often took cabs in the morning to our destinations. The cab rides in Rome are not cheap and the jerkiness of the ride, the air pollution in the city and traffic sometimes made me a little nauseated. For those who are willing to take public transportation everywhere, the Barocco is a perfect location. It is right on Piazza Barberini with a Metro stop and major bus line stops; there is a taxi stand right on the piazza as well when you want the comfort or security of a cab. The front desk will sell you as many bus tickets as you wish and the Metro system is very easy to negotiate as it has only two lines and they converge at the conveniently named \"Termini\" station. We did wait a very long time one morning at Termini to switch from Line B to Line A and it would have been difficult for someone with claustrophobia. Hundreds and hundreds of people were waiting on the platform when a train finally came. A real 'Roman' experience! The Barocco staff provided us with a welcome basket of fruit when we arrived, which was a nice touch, and they didn't care if we put leftovers or our own drinks in the fridge/minibar. They have a bar from 4pm on and newspapers if you wish to keep up with the local news, so if your room is a little small, there are public spaces to hang out and relax and maybe meet other guests. I have close to four hours of internet time I can give someone the code for if you are staying at the Barocco in the next three months because we bought five hours of internet time for 15 Euro, a very reasonable price for a big city, and didn't use up our last bit of internet time. Contact me and I can give you the codes if you see this in time to use it. The internet service was excellent, by the way. We brought our own netbook computer. There is some terrific shopping in the area. I particularly liked a boutique around the corner called Roux for women's accessories and clothes and this hotel is located very near the eerie/weird Cappucin Friar Cemetery, which you can visit for a donation of 1 Euro and you will not quickly forget. Always felt safe in this area at any time.

Good location right off one of the metro train lines at the Piazza Bernini. Just about any direction you walk you ran into amazing sights, shopping, and food. Couldn't have asked for a better value. I warn you against visiting in August, though, because it was so very hot. We are pretty tough travelers, but we still took a mid-day break each day to escape the heat. There is a reason the pope leaves Rome in August - it's HOT. Wireless internet is available for a reasonable fee.

We asked for a driver from the hotel to pick us up at the airport, which was wonderful after flying all night, and he was waiting for us outside the terminal with our names on a sign. From the moment we walked through the door of Hotel Barocco we were warmly welcomed and well-taken care of. Our room was not ready, so they brought us coffee and fruit in the sitting room by the front desk. It was raining, so after the coffee, they gave us an umbrella to take a walk while the room was being cleaned. The hotel location is wonderful. Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps just 5-10 minute walk away. Our room, #49, was exquisite! Loved it! Had a balcony overlooking Bernini Square and fountain. Extremely comfortable bed, nicest bathroom we had on entire trip (4 hotels). Fruit plate was in the room for us. Beautifully decorated. We spent 4 nights, and each morning we really looked forward to breakfast! Lovely, delicious. Perfect service. Excellent coffee and made-to-order omelettes. Fabio at front desk was delightful and professional. He took excellent care of us and was very helpful with every request and question. If you are Catholic, there is an English speaking Mass on Sunday mornings at 9 a.m. just a 5 minute walk away at Saint Susanna. It was beautiful, both the church and the Mass. Our last night, we returned to Hotel Barocco to be close to the airport. Again, warm and welcoming staff. Fabio was again kind and charming. The servers at breakfast all stopped by our table to chat and say good bye, and wish us safe travels. We had a driver from the hotel take us to the airport the next day. He was also very kind, answering our questions and sharing his knowledge of sights we passed along the way. A perfect beginning and end to a perfect Italy experience.

The bed was the most comfortable one we slept on in Italy and my husband thinks it was more comfortable than our bed at home! The bathroom was a little hit or miss. Great shower, fancy basin sink, but no where to put toiletries. Also there was apparently some sort of leak I think., When we check in I noticed the carpet around the door to the bathroom was damp. After our showers the next day the capret was very wet, despite the fact that there was no water on the floor and the shower door had been tightly closed. Not sure what that was about. The location of the hotel is great- very close to Metro and many things to see and do (be sure and hit the Capuchin Crypt right down the street- wild stuff!). One word of advice to the owners- your internet access is grossly overpriced- 5 euro for 30 minutes is outrageous. We wanted to check our flight info but didn't because of the outrageous price.

The hotel is situated perfectly for walking to all the major sites except maybe the Vatican which we decided to take a cab. The front desk has a good free map to guide you to everything. Walking around can be intimidating at first, but once you get acclimated it is easy. The Barberini square, where the hotel is located, has a taxi pickup a few steps away where you can easily catch a cab. The hotel is \"hidden\" on a side street from the square, but once inside you can tell it has been remodeled. Everything looks new and clean. Typical small European room but modern. TV has a few English speaking news channels to keep up on current events. The only complaint is our bathroom didn't have enough lighting at the vanity, but we managed by opening the shutters. The hotel has a laptop you can rent to check in your plane tickets or check email too. The breakfast was wonderful with a variety of simple breakfast foods, juices, and water. Try the red orange juice. Coffee and made to order eggs can be ordered through the staff. The staff took great care in making sure everything was replinished. When we went to the Vatican a young man immediately approached me when I got out of the taxi to sell me a tour. We were hesitant at first, but agreed. It was great. 40 Euros each let us bypass the HUGE line. We had an English speaking guide and each of us received an Ipod type listening device so everyone in the group could hear him. Finally, the hotel arranged a car service to take us to the airport. 50 Euros in a nice Mercedes. A taxi costs 40.

We planned on seeing a lot, but at a very leisurely pace -- not a strict agenda. The Hotel Barocco was the ideal home base for us in Rome. It was our first hotel in Italy so we were pleasantly surprised to arrive to a friendly, welcoming staff who spoke perfect English and was very helpful - providing a map and pointing out the key sights nearby and watching our luggage until we were able to check in, since we arrived so early. The hotel is conveniently located in Piazza Barberini, close to many great sights. 5 mins to the Pantheon, 5 mins to the Trevi fountain, 15 minutes to the Spanish Steps, 15 minutes to Piazza Venezia, give or take...I'm not even sure. My wife and I had originally anticipated taking buses or cabs from our hotel to certain sights that seemed pretty far when looking at a map. Maybe it was because we were so excited to be there and so amazed by everything we were seeing, but we found ourselves walking everywhere. We walked as far as north as Piazza del Popolo along the Via del Corso, as far south as Trajan's market, and as far West as Piazza Navona. We never once stopped to realize how much ground we were covering. The hotel is a short block from Via Veneto and and nice stroll up it takes you to the old city walls and Villa Borghese (10 mins, tops). It all felt like it was right next door. When we walked as far as Piazza del Popolo and realized it was going to be a hike back, we jumped right on the subway and it took us right back to our hotel. We went to mass at Saint Peter's Sunday AM via the subway and it was as simple as can be. The subway stop is steps away from the front door where Via Veneto meets Piazza Barberini. The bus stop is a few steps in the opposite direction - which took us down to the Colosseum, right in the heart of Ancient Rome. So as far as location goes, for us, it was ideal. Although we didnt use it, the train station (Termini) was a few blocks away. The staff couldn't have been nicer. Thankfully, we didnt need to rely on them for any emergency situations since everything went very smoothly, but the few times we had to correspond with them was very pleasant. We stayed in the Junior Sweet which was lovely. 2 rooms seperated by pocket doors. Enter into the first room with a walk in closet, long desk, pullout coach, and large window overlooking the Bernini fountain in the center of the Piazza. The second room has a King bed with another window looking over the piazza, and a large marble bath. The shower, albeit small (i am a large person) was extremely nice with both a handheld shower head above, and optional jets on the side. By far, the best bathroom epxerience I have ever had in Europe. I have never stayed in a 5-star hotel, though. 2 countertops with mirrors made it easy and efficient for both my wife and I to get ready at once. Also worth noting, the room TRULY IS SOUNDPROOF. I cannot vouch for the internal walls, but with both interal and external windows shut, you could not hear ANY of the outside noise. Especially considering its a major Piazza and there is a lot of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, I was Truly amazed how quiet the room was. The ONLY negative thing I can say about the room itself was although I had the air as low as it could go, it never got really cold. I like my room cold regardless of the time of year. Ironically, of our 4 hotels in Italy, this was by far the nicest, and turned out to be the cheapest. Maybe we got lucky? The only thing I can imagine that people MIGHT complain about, which made no difference to me, was the entrance to the hotel is on a narrow sidestreet so when you step out of the door, you dont have much room before you are right in the middle of traffic. It's iiterally no big deal, but I bet some picky people might complain. The included breakfast was one of the most extensive in all of our 4 hotels as well. It was the only one that asked every time we sat down if we wanted eggs.

The room was small but very clean, and the good sized bathroom was spotless, with a good shower and a decent hairdryer. There was limited space for clothes, with only one small wardrobe and no drawer space for clothing, so we ended up living out of our suitcases, but apart from the lack of storage space we had no other issues. The bed was very comfortable and it appeared that the sheets were changed daily. The breakfast was good, with eggs to order and plenty of choice. A good start to a long day of sightseeing. The Hotel is central for sightseeing or shopping, with the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain only a few blocks away. The metro stop is in the square which was handy for the colosseum visit. The main shopping streets of Via Del Corso (and side streets), Via Dei Condotti and Via Nazionale are also an easy walk from the Hotel. All in all an ideal base for a Rome trip.

The hotel in the Piazza Barberini. It does not have a grand entrance so is hard to see from the street. You actually have to go down the side street to go into the hotel\u2019s entrance. Once inside, there was a large arrangement of fresh flowers that made the lobby smell wonderful. The lobby is small and the elevator even smaller. I was a little worried getting on it being it barely holds 3 people with luggage, but we didn\u2019t get stuck. The positive: We had the honeymoon package, so we stayed in a junior suite. It was a very nice room. There were a dozen long stemmed red roses in our room when we arrived, which added a nice romantic feel to the sitting area. There was also fresh fruit set out in our room daily. Our balcony was huge and had a wonderful view of the square. The rooms next to us had a wall around most of their balcony, so we were fortunate to be able to look out over the square. The room was fairly quiet. You could hear some of the street noise outside, but if you closed the outside shutters of the windows, it was not bothersome at all. The hotel staff was very friendly and spoke very good English. Each concierge was able to assist us in recommendations for a place to eat and in directions to get there or anywhere else in the city. Their recommendations were always excellent choices for the types of places we wanted to eat. If you need an iron and ironing board the hotel will bring you one on request, but it does not stay in the room. Anytime we had a request (like needing a converter plug, the iron, etc.) the hotel staff would have it to our room within five minutes. I was very impressed with the service. Unfortunately we only got to eat breakfast one morning our entire stay due to leaving early for tours (and sleeping in), but it was very good and the food was fresh (eggs, thinly sliced bacon, cheeses, coffee cakes, etc). The location of the hotel was excellent. Most of the sites and good places to eat were a 5-10 minute walk. The Coliseum and Vatican would be a too far to walk, but the Spanish Steps, Pantheon, St. Mary\u2019s Basilica, Fontana Trevi, and many others were well within walking distance. The hotel also has an airport transfer for Euro 50, which I would recommend using as it will be a private car with plenty of room (unlike the taxi\u2019s that are small, compact cars). The hotel will arrange for the transfer. The hotel also arranges for taxis if you need one to go anywhere. All you have to do is let the front desk know 2-3 minutes before you\u2019re ready to leave and the taxi will be there that quickly. The negative: The king bed was firm, but in doing reviews I read this seems to be typical in Rome. The bathroom is a little small by American standards, but was still nice. I would recommend taking your own hairdryer though as the one in the bathroom is not very powerful and takes a bit to warm up, so it took a while to dry my hair. The room has an \u201cold\u201d feel to it, but I liked it given that we were in Rome and I did not want to stay at a typical American hotel. The elevator was out of service about three times while we were there, but not for very long. I would also recommend taking your own converter plug. The hotel let us borrow theirs and it worked fine for charging the cameras, but when I tried to run my small portable fan that I brought with me, it blew out the converter and my fan. It was actually funny after the shock of it wore off! All-in-all, I would definitely recommend staying at the Hotel Barocco.

We went out for a walk to the Trevi Fountain and had lunch and we returned the bags were in our room. The concierge was helpful with all of our questions regarding buses, directions, pharmacy (I was sick one day) and other things. He prearranged our ticket reservation to the Borghese Gallery as well.

We walked to the Trevi Fountain, The top of the Spanish Steps, the Bottom of the Spanish Steps, The Pantheon and Piazza Navone with no trouble at all. We even walked all the way to the river and then to Trastavere one day and found that we could have walked to the Vatican if we had wanted to. The hotel was also within walking distance of the Borghese Park, but probably about 35-45 minutes. The only negative thing I could say about the hotel is that the entry had been moved from the main street (Tritone) to a little alleyway which made it a little harder to find and that the bathtub was very small (narrow). A large person would have a problem using the bathtub, but after 14 days of showers, we welcomed the bathtub.

Didn't hear people in rooms on either side of us. The AC worked fine for us, but in the summer months it might not cool the room down enough. Just move the drapes out of the way for the air to circulate. It did get quite cool during the night and I had to throw an extra blanket on the bed(husband likes a freezing room). The front desk staff/ breakfast room staff were fabulous!!!! We thought that the breakfast buffet had plenty to offer. Croissants, sweet rolls, small hard rolls, pastries, tortes, three types of meats, cheeses, bacon, scrambled eggs, fruit salad(always refilling) and yogurt. We had plenty to eat and variety was great. Front desk staff always gave us good info-on how to get to places, restaurant tips etc. Used a car service to get to airport when we were returning home. They arranged car and it was cheaper than car service I had set up to pick us up from airport to bring us to the hotel. Barrocco is close to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps.

THE ROOM: An old building but the room was reasonable spacious, well furnished, comfortable bed, desk, chair, airconditioned, very quiet, facing lane, heard no traffic from busy Piazza Barberini. Bathroom was fitted out in marble, toilet, bidet, shower, all good. Very satisfactory for a 3 night stop. THE HOTEL: Would call it a boutique hotel, around 20 rooms I suppose, well furnished, breakfast room nice, continental and hot breakfast included and unlimited cups of the best cappucino. Breakfast staff and hotel staff very obliging. Hotel is very well situated in Pizaa Barberini. Walk to Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon etc. Plenty of restaurants nearby and corner shops.

(We took the train from the Rome airport to the metro station, hopped on the metro, and Piazza Barberini was the second stop - so easy!) Once we had our \"Rome bearings\" we also realized that we were within walking distance of tons of popular sights. (Spanish steps: 5 minutes; Trevi fountain: approx 5 minutes; Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Campo Di Fiori: 10 - 15 minutes). There was a bar/tabac around the corner, along with a small grocery store, and many places to eat nearby. Very Friendly and Helpful Staff: The staff at Barocco go out of their way to make you feel welcome and like no question or request is a problem. They were also helpful prior to our arrival by answering all of my email questions promptly and were extremely friendly and courteous when we had a bunch of \"how do we find this place in Rome\" questions upon arrival. Convenient: The breakfast that was included with the price of our stay was great and very convenient. Cereal, fruit, meat and several cheeses, eggs, bacon, patries, yogurt, juice, fruit, coffee or cappucino made to order. Beautiful and Spacious Room: We stayed in the Annex building (4 rooms available next door to the main hotel). The Annex rooms were added to Barocco in recent years, so the decor is a little different than the rest of the hotel, which we loved. (the website represents the room descriptions well). The room was more spacious than any room we stayed in during our 2 week trip to Italy and France, was very clean, and the bathroom was huge. The room was also very quiet. While in Rome, our favorite meal was across town in the Trastevere area at a wonderful pizzeria called Dar Poeta.

It's a nice old building with high ceilings - cooling in the very hot summer of Rome. As mention in previous review, entrance to the hotel is on the side street Via della Purificazione, not facing the Barberini Piaza. On arrival, we were greeted by the receptionist who sent a maid to lead us to our room and arrange a porter to deliver our suitcase very promptly. Our room was very clean and nicely decorated with touch of luxury - marble wall skirting, antique looking polished wooden furniture, mirror with golden frame, comfy bed (not to hard/soft), large marble bathroom with a hydro message tub. It has a view to the side street where the hotel entrance is on which I suppose is a bit more quite than those facing the square. Sound proofing is very adequate anyway. My only moan is that the aircon is a bit weak to my like but we left it on when we were out and it does the job to keep the room at a comfortable temperature. By the way, weak aircon seems to be a common issue in all the shops and restuarants. The staffs in the reception are always polite and helpful and certainly treat you like a welcomed guest. We were very impressed with the efficient housekeeping staffs as they meticulously clean and tidy up our room/bed every time we went out (once 3 times in a day during our stay). The good thing is that they keep a low profile and don't bother you when you are in the room, so you don't actually see them but the result of their work! Breakfast is served in a small but nicely decorated room on the first floor. A good continental affair with fruit, yoghurt, pastries, eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, juices. Tea/ coffee and cappuccino is always offered by the waitress and brought to your table. We cannot fault the hotel location. The metro stop Barberini (line A) is half a minute away. We used it very often as it's a too hot to walk to sights in this weather unless its early morning or later in the afternoon. But the distance to various sights would have been easily negotiable in cooler weather. Also the hotel is very well served by buses and the open top tourist buses stops right outside. The convenient location allow us to return to the hotel in the afternoon for a shower before heading out for dinner. Also a stroll to the Trevi fountain in the evening can be easily done. Another good aspect of the hotel is it's fairly small size. The service is personnel and there is no annoying tour groups/ students but independent travellers during our stay - Italian and foreigners alike.

I am glad I read reviews telling me the entrance is poorly marked off a side street that looks like an alley or I would have missed it, turn right where Via Veneto ends, next little alley turn right and 2nd door. We had room 49 and you have to walk up a separate staircase to get to the room so if walking is a problem get a different room. This was our choice as this is a big room with a balcony. You get some road noise but we were staying out late and counting on the noise to get us up for the great breakfast that is a real meal and a high point of this hotel. The internet was expensive, 8 euro for an hour on their laptop, so I went to the internet cafe across from the Hotel Bernini just up the side street on the far side, you can see it from the hotel. They also downloaded the photos of my digital camera to a CD. The cafe just past the internet cafe is a good deal and nice, much cheaper than the Via Veneto restaurants. Went to the top of the Hotel Bernini, walk thru lobby, go into bar on the left and there is an elevator at the back that takes you to the top to check out the view. Everyone said it was real expensive but they had dinner specials for 38 euro and if you liked the special, the view is worth it. Check it out. I didn't think the front desk tried hard enough, the map they gave me was lousy, got lost a lot the first two days. As you walk out to the front, go right and everyday walk the four blocks to the Trevi fountain, then Pantheon, then Piazza Novana, the Piazza di Fiori. The tomb of the unknown soldier gives you the landmark, figure out where Via del Corso intersects with Victor Emmuel. Walk and take a cab back. To go to Spanish steps, go out and take a right and a right at the first street and you run into it. As is said you can walk from here to most everywhere. We walked to the Colessum, Vatican, and when we got tired just took a cab back. If you take this street uphill away from the Spanish steps you will go to the Berbini museum and keep walking to get to the Presidents house and the back way to the forum. I liked the location, the breakfast, very nice hotel. The Piazza Berbini is crowded, I am glad I stayed here but next time I would stay in a quieter area (not Via Veneto) hopefully with a view of a monument. Now that I am thinking of everywhere I walked from this hotel, if you go up the block from the internet cafe you will be able to walk to the train station. Also walked back from the Borghese Gallery thru the park which was my favorite museum. Wife would not get on any subway or bus which you can access from this hotel, but the cab stand is by the Hotel Berbini on this Piazza.

It is warm, friendly, and inviting. My single room was small, but I've stayed in smaller rooms in New York, and I didn't spend much time in there. It was pleasantly decorated. I had asked for a quiet room, after reading reviews of noise in Rome. I got a room in the back, which was completely silent. When I travel by myself, I like to stay in smaller hotels. I find them more friendly and wlecoming. The Barocco was certainly all that. The public rooms were all cheery and inviting. Often, between my day's activities and dinner, I would sit with a book in the salon/bar and read. Other guests were very friendly. I always felt as though I was coming home when I reached the Piazza Barberini. The breakfast room was beautiful and the servers were all very friendly and accommodating. For people who choose their hotels based on the breakfast, it was all one could ask for. The staff members of the hotel were all warm, friendly, and helpful. For example, I had printed off the train schedule from Rome to Sorrento, but the concierge told me that it wasn't right. He checked the correct schedule and almost rook me by the elbow to show me the travel agency in an adjoining alley where I could buy a ticket without going to Termini. To be fair, I speak Italian, which I tried to do most of the time, and I think you are always treated better when you speak the language. The location was good: close enough to the major sights to walk to most of them but far enough away to get away from the chaos. There was a subway stop right near the hotel, although I never learned to use it. If I have one complaint, it was with the bathroom (isn't it always); The shower, toilet, and bidet were raised about three inches. On top of this there was a sliding glass door, which added another inch or so and was completely unnecessary since it was a single room. The opening through the door was narrower than my shoulders, which meant I had to enter sideways. It was much more fun exiting sideways, once the floor was wet from the showers.

And do visit Giardino restaurant round the corner (the receptionist will give you the directions) - they do a superb anti-pasto spread.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat place and great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4994533", "Content": "My Girlfriend and I have just spent 3 nights at the wonderful Hotel Barocco. Upon arriving from the airport our taxi driver pointed us to a little doorway facing the Piazza Barberini that had a buzzer and a small hotel sign above it, after a short, slightly confused conversation between myself and the hotel reception over an intercom on the wall we were told we had been sent to the wrong door as the proper hotel entrance is actually just off the piazza down a side street to the right of this doorway and that some one was coming to find us. I only mention this so that anyone in the future will realise and be able to find the reception desk first time, im sure if our taxi driver hadnt pointed us at this doorway we probably would have been less confused. Once inside we were very impressed with the hotel and its staff, most of the staff speak excellent english and they were always freindly and helpful. They provided us with a street map of the main centre of rome that became invaluable when getting around as we walked to all the sights. Our room (number 29) was large and spacious with a small 2 seater sofa, large double bed, two bathrooms (one large one and one smaller one) and air conditioning. The room has two large windows that look straight out onto the piazza bernini and the view of the fountain was excellent. The maids came twice a day and room was always kept spotlessly clean and tidy. The buffet breakfast was good with a decent range of cerals, meat, cakes, cheese, bacon, scrambled eggs and fruit juices. The Piazza Barberini is a great location as it is surrounded by restaurants and shops and is within easy walking distance of most of the sights, especially the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. Each evening we dined in a differant restaurant on the Via Vittorio Veneto which were all very classy looking places and the food was always good. Hotel reception arranged a car to take us to the airport on our last day and also looked after our suitcases while we went out for the day as we didnt need to be at the airport until the evening. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definatly stay there again should we return to Rome. The only problem we had was with the noise from the busy piazza at night, my girlfriend is a light sleeper and had some trouble sleeping amongst all the beeping of horns and revving of moped engines throughout the night but after a long days walking around this beautiful city she was tired enough to sleep through it.", "Date": "April 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFabulous and Romantic Visit at Barocco\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4965522", "Content": "A group of 12 friends, American couples, spent several nights at Hotel Barocco in Rome on route to Tuscany.

Very clean comfortable hotel. Staff are very friendly and helpful and the service is excellent. Within easy reach of all the sights, we walked back from the Vatican on Sunday.

The room is HUGE with one side engaged with floor length opening doors/windows to the long balcony overlooking the Piazza. Inlaid marble floors, toiletries, fluffy bathrobes & slippers all add to the ambiance of a quality hotel. The whole hotel was spotless with maid service twice a day. Standard rooms looked quite small, but well furnished and elegant. Although the hotel has a lift, there are still several levels to each floor, with numerous steps to navigate. Whilst the hotel does not have a restaurant, the breakfast room is elegant with good quality table cloths and cutlery. Breakfast choice is adequate, and it can be booked for room service without extra charge. Reception staff were very helpful and welcoming, with a vast knowledge of what to do and where to go. There are numerous bars and restuarants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. Accessing the whole of Rome is very easy from the Piazza directly outside via bus/taxi, although we walked most days, getting lost amongst the narrow streets and finding interesting shops and cafes. We thought it would be a fast placed dirty capitol city - but it is so different from any other city we've visted. It is clean, elegant, amazing, relaxing and welcoming. The coloseum is amazing, but make sure you go early to avoid the masses - the same with the Vatican. Have lunch on Piazza Navona and watch the world go by! We will definately be returning to Rome and this hotel.
