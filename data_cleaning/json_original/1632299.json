We have stayed at some of the most expensive places on the boardwalk, but we feel the Sun n' Fun is just as nice as most of the expensive hotels.The rooms are very clean with a refrigerator and microwave as well as a large flat screen TV. The price was reasonable too. We were pleased with the hotel staff as they were pleasant, friendly and helpful. It's just a short walk to the boardwalk with easy access to the bus route. There are also restaurants nearby, minature golf and a laundry mat. We would highly recommend this hotel during your stay in Ocean City Maryland. You can't beat it! We will always make our stay at the Sun n' Fun every time we visit Ocean City.

We found this motel online, and when we booked our room, the manager was very pleasant and helpful. We arrived to find that we were just a 90 second walk from the beginning of the boardwalk and beach. We were close to sub shops, donut shops, right across the street from the Jolly Roger Amusement Park, and there was even a bus stop very nearby. The room was clean, and the air conditioning kept us very comfortable. Whenever we stopped in the office for any reason, whoever was on duty was very eager to help us. The clientele at the motel was like us; upper middle class families. No loud college kids or seedy characters hanging around. If you want to iron your clothes, though, you will need to take your own iron. But in the grand scheme of things, that was not a big deal. We will definitely make the Sun 'n Fun motel our place to stay from now on.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Chester, PA", "Title": "\u201cAlways A Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "Joel B", "ReviewID": "UR139574393", "Content": "Me and my mom have stayed at this Motel every year for the past 5 years.

First of all, the coolest thing about this place is the advertising design of the hotel billboard. It is very advanced with the logo and the neat sun with a smile. It puts me in mind of when my father took me to Hagerstown Suns games when I was a child. I'm sure there are others who travel to Ocean City, Maryland and receive great memories when they look upon the hotel sign. Anyways, we always book here the last week of August that runs into September. Sun 'n Fun always has the best rates out of all the other hotel and motel chains at the middle and end of August, and I always compare, and they always come up with the best price in the area. But, it's just not the price that keeps us coming back, it's the manager that works there that truly makes the stay. In a retail world that does not care about customer service or the consumer, Eric goes above and beyond to satisfy the patron's every need and requested service. He is always friendly and truly cares for the people staying at his resort. Most people in today's world are unapproachable, but Eric is very nice that even the most introvert of people would have no problem in communicating and asking for help from him. We could easily decide to book at another location, but Ocean City, Maryland would just not be the same of an experience without seeing that familiar face. He is accessible throughout the day and night, and most hotel and motel chains do not do this. Sun 'n Fun Motel is at a great location as well, just two blocks from the beginning of the boardwalk, and is also located near Tommy's Subs in which is right in front of motel. My family and friends also stay at this location because of the rates, great location, and the motel manager as well. Thanks Sun 'n Fun for always making our vacation a blast, and we will definitely continue to keep staying there as long as the service is still at top quality and I truly believe that's based on Eric's sincere and true personality and work ethic. That is what truly makes our stay go above and beyond. With a ton of places to be able to book at, customer service will always bump those few and far between above the rest.

Yes - mouse infested! As we walked in my boyfriend noticed droppings on a table by the window and then to horror, when I went into the bathroom I noticed a mouse in the bathtub. I immediately went to the front office for an explanation (and by front office I mean a little box room at the front of the complex) and told them to refund us immediately! His response when he saw the mouse was \"don't kill it\", which I would never do, but I was astounded that he didn't even seem shocked! I dread to think how often this happens... Needless to say he called in the manager who walked into the office bare feet and didn't even introduce himself or apologise. After much persitence and complaining were we're transferred to their partner motel down the street which wasn't much better but moderately more liveable for the two nights that we had booked. My advise would be that no matter how cheap the motel is our how desperate you are to stay in OC... Don't even think of wasting your time and money on this place! It needs to be knocked down ASAP!", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Media, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cutterly disgusting\u201d", "Author": "Kerri M", "ReviewID": "UR135839335", "Content": "This motel was far and away the WORST place I have ever stayed. Upon walking in, we noticed crushed up pretzels, pieces of cereal, and hair all over the floor. Clearly, they didn't even pretend to vacuum. When we opened the drawers, we found old candy wrappers inside. On the box spring cover, there was a huge red stain, literally as if someone spilled a whole juice box and they just never changed it. The sheets had brown stains on them, and there was sand in each of the beds. When we requested new sheets, the sheets were changed. However, we found a TOENAIL in our bed after the sheets were changed. In the bathroom, there was a yellow urine stain around the toilet. The vanity had hair on it, and the tub was black. Whenever I showered or even walked in the bathroom, I wore flip-flops. The towels all had brownish red stains that looked like blood. I truly think they picked the towels up off the floor and refolded them. Frankly, there are many cheap rooms to be found in Ocean City Maryland that are as cheap as this place (and fun and sun really isn't that cheap). They literally don't even pretend to clean. I had trouble sleeping because I was so creeped out by the place, and it didn't help that they was only one dirty pillow for each spot on the bed.
