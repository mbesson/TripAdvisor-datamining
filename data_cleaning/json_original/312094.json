If you are aware and chose wisely.\u201d", "Author": "Mario_MZG", "ReviewID": "UR121411576", "Content": "This a very useful reference hotel... if you really know what you will get. The hotel does not have any bells and whistles... it does not have any \"turkeys\" either. And all reviews must have in consideration the cost/benefit ratio. Location could not be better, right in the heart of Covent Garden, where all the action goes: theatres, pubs, restaurants and all the Soho life nearby. Plenty of underground stations around. Piccadilly Line direct to Heathrow Airport. Price does not get any better in any hotel 5 kilometers around. We paid 140 UK pounds per night on a triple room (more about that later) including breakfast. Staff is friendly, kind and willing to help, where necessary. Room care is addequate, bed grooming, full towel change and WC cleaning everyday. Now, what you should be aware about: Hotel is in a narrow building with 4 floors (we stayed in 3rd), there is no elevator (lift) and the stairs are narrow. Bringing in the suitcases may be a chore (I was offered help but declined), bringing them out is the same, but this is work to be done only once on arrival and once on departure. However, if you have mobility issues, be aware. Rooms have the bare essentials, however clean, cozy and quite new. But rooms are not spacious. When me & my wife reserved, there was only a triple room available but we reserved anyway, because the price & location were right. This triple room (#11 on 3rd floor) was exactly right for us, with a nice double bed plus a single bed where we could spread our things and open our suitcases. If we were on a double (or if we were 3) the suitcases should have to stay open in the floor. The WC was ok, small but addequate, good shower, lavatory and toilet. Be aware that economy hotels in London have usually *very bad* WC's (or they have shower but no toilet, or no WC at all). What else ? A clothes keeper big enough with lots of hangers & 4 drawers, two bedside drawers, small TV, hairdrier & mirror, coffee/tea kettle with cumplimentary coffee, tea & cookies every day. The hotel stays in a very quiet street but cornering with a busy avenue. Londoners are noisy (and frequently unpolite and rude), you may be bothered with noises at night, like buses and lorries passing by, some sirens and even obnoxious people honking at 4am !! Not to mention the \"night birds\" speaking or singing loud as they pass by. Bring in your earplugs. And your eye covers (curtains are thin and don't block daylight). We were lucky, neighbour hosts were quiet (this is always a question of luck). Big central heating, switched on when necessary (temperature was very comfortable). No AC, big fan in ceiling (maybe useful in summer, but London is never hot anyway). Breakfast is the typical English breakfast, not our preference but quite addequate and substancial anyway. All in all, and with the correct pondering of pro's and con's, this is a very interesting choice for an hotel, that we may easily use again next time.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "BRISTOL", "Title": "\u201cStay at your peril\u201d", "Author": "BristolSparky", "ReviewID": "UR121097124", "Content": "Dark dreary rooms.

There was a small ensuite shower room with toilet and washbasin, spotlessly clean as was the room. The beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of room for our clothes etc. Beds were made/room cleaned daily. The location of this hotel is fantastic; 5-10 minutes' walk from all the theatres, from Covent Garden Plaza, from a huge choice of restaurants, cafes and bars ranging from cheap to expensive, and some good real ale pubs. 10 minutes walk to the river too, and only 15 minutes taxi ride from Kings Cross though getting back there was a different story! The staff at the hotel are wonderful: friendly, welcoming and nothing too much trouble. There is always someone on duty to release the door lock at the front door, so you feel secure, and they happily look after your bags on the final day; we felt it was safe to leave them near Reception because there is always someone there and they won't release the door except to guests. The breakfast was a bit basic, like the rooms, but edible, and included in the price, but if you want a lie-in there are several nice cafes almost next door for coffee/croissants etc as breakfast is quite early at 7-9 a.m. There is no lift and the stairs are narrow, but staff happily help with luggage so no worries there. Rooms are extremely good value for this part of central London: we paid \u00c2\u00a3250 for 2 of us for 2 nights. And I've had poorer service in 5 star hotels!

My bed was next to the heater.. and very close to the wall and the wall had dust and yellow stains on it.. also the heater had stains.

It was 11pm in the morning, and the cleaners were vaccuming so noise was not an issue. Maybe she was afraid I would break their fragile stairs. But the luggage was heavy ofcourse there are gonna be some noise. If she was so concern I think she should come help me instead of just sitting there complaining after the luggage had already been taken down. What's the point? I'm already checking out and that is my only piece of luggage, and I am never coming back again. The washroom was so small, you can only stand and turn, don't even have enough room to change your clothes in there... unless you change in the shower area. The washroom door lock was broken, the door was dented, looked like someone punched a hole in it previously. The toilet paper were crap.. no tissue available.. even if you have to wipe your face or mouth, you'd just have to use their toilet paper.

It was also incredibly hot in London, but there was a fan in the room (which when you had the bathroom door opened whacked into it, LOL), which did the job.

It was also spotlessly clean which is obviously very important. However, unfortunately that is where the positives end. Despite phoning a week beforehand to ask if we could get into out room a few hours before the usual check-in and was told they would try their best to accomodate. We were slightly annoyed when we turned up at 12 noon to discover our room not ready but understood. We informed the staff member at the desk that we probably wouldnt be back until late evening but would try to come back to check-in in order to make sure our bags were safe etc. (oh and that same member of staff seemed offened I dare suggest our bags wouldnt be safe in the communal lobby, ridiculous!) So, we found some time to nip back after 2pm which is the stated check-in time only to find the staff member has told the cleaner 'not to bother' preparing our room because we said we wouldn't be back until later. This was made out to be our fault. The room should have been ready for 2pm no matter what in our opinion not left until later so the cleaners could take thier time! We had a busy day and would have appreciated the opportunity to shower. In the staff member's defense, we were offered the dining space downstairs to change and use he bathroom which we took but obviously a room would have been better! On to the room. Yes, it was small but we has prepared ourselves for this so it was fine and as I have mentioned it was very clean. However, we ended up with the only room on the ground floor (Room 1) which we next to reception and under the stairs! We could hear absolutely everyone and everything coming and going on the staircase. It bothered us the first night but after that we were just to exhausted and tired to care so just got on with it. Agan, on the first night, another staff member was constantly yapping on their phone and had a loud rigtone which kept going off. We had to go out to the lobby in out PJs so ask them to stop talking. After trying to make excuses about the hotel phone ringing, their personal mobile rang in their hand with the same annoying ringtone so the conversation was pretty much over and there was no more disturbance. We agree with other reviewers that if you stay, don't bother the the breakfast. Just head out to a little cafe on Monmouth Street or round about and get yourself a decent breakfast. Overall this is an excellent location an if we had a little more money to splash around we would have stayed in the same area but in a different hotel. We probably won't be back here because of our bad experience but I would recommend it if not only for cleanliness and location but dont expect luxury!

Everyone who works here is pleasant and friendly. Everything is clean and everything worked. I read the other reviews and agree the rooms are small with spartan furnishing and noisy, if facing the street. Now the trade off..... If you can easily afford to pay 160euro a night for the hotel across the street then go for it. It is a nicer hotel. But if you hate to toss away that amount of money in a room you'll probably spend 8 hours a day in; then the Seven Dial is the best bet in the area. It is all a balance of cost and location to me. You can get cheaper hotels out around Hyde Park but I have no interest in spending all my time on the tube. I've made that mistake and regretted it - a waste of my time in London. I want to stay in the Theater/Museum area of Covent Gardens. I've stayed at many hotels in this area and I think the Seven Dials is top of the list in that price range. You can easily find nicer hotels but you'll pay at a minimum double the price. Again if money is no issue then go somewhere else. You can't beat the location here. I want a hotel I can stop by to change clothes or pick up something from my room, in between a Museum and Lunch without taking what turns out to be an hour tube ride out to another part of the city. It is less than 5 min to the British Museum, within 10 min to Leister Square, dozens of theaters or the National Gallery. There are great restaurants in the immediate area (Punjabi around the corner is fantastic). Some of the items people have complained about for this hotel are just common facts of this class/price range hotels in London: the steep narrow stairway, the small rooms, minuscule en suite bathroom, the cheesy furnishings, cramped breakfast room- you will find these exact same qualities in most hotels of this 'class'. However, the difference here, we found everything to be very clean, the staff very friendly and everything serviceable - that is not always the case with the other hotels in this class. This is why I would rate the Severn Dials as best bet in the area. There is no elevator - if you cannot CARRY your suitcase (not pull it but actually lift it) then you might find the stairs a problem (however on arrival the owner happy offered to bring my suitcase up to the room). Do bring earplugs if road noise bothers you. I was there in winter, in summer with the windows open it will be noisy. If you are coming in/out of Heathrow with minimal luggage just jump on the tube and get off at Covent Gardens very easy no changes and direct - it takes about 45 mins. If you take the Heathrow express from Paddington you have to change a couple times, which lengthens that 15 min express train to also 45 mins. If you have too much luggage catch a taxi.

We arrived around midday and although we couldn't check in until after 2pm because the room had to be cleaned after the previous guests, we were allowed to leave our case in the secure reception area (the main door has a secure entry system) to allow us to go a wee wander. When we got back to the hotel, I realised the comments about the staircase were true as I struggled to get my huge suitcase up the narrow stairs, however with smaller cases/bags, this should not pose as a problem. We stayed on the 2nd floor, room 6. This room had a double bed and a single bed, a wardrobe with hangers, a desk with mirror and stool, plenty of drawer units, tv (although reception wasn't great but I wasn't there to watch tv so didn't bother too much about this), coffee/tea making facilities, toilet, shower and wash hand basin. Everything you could need really. The room was very clean and I could not fault it at all. My only comment would be that there perhaps were not enough accessible sockets for girls who blow dry and straighten their hair, at the same time as charging their mobiles like me. Also the socket behind the tv unit was slightly loose but worked fine. The staff were extremely friendly and had no problems letting us in the main door every time my mum wanted to go out for a cigarette. Talking of which, I previously read a comment about the street not being safe at night well I have to disagree. We never felt unsafe about anyone passing us on Monmouth street. Also, our room looked onto the street and there really wasn't a lot of street noise through the night for London. The location of this hotel was ideal. I had never been to London before and found my way around just fine mainly because all the main areas surrounded the hotel. Oxford Street was a short walk, several underground stations were also a short walk, many theatres are just around the corner. Both mornings we were served a lovely buffet breakfast. Three kinds of egg, bacon, sausage, tomato, beans, toast, cereal, coffee, tea and orange juice. The eating area was in the basement and was very clean with excellent service.

Nowhere for toilet roll to go apart from on floor, shelf 2 inches X 12 inches on which to place all your toileteries. Its a bit tedious after a while. The stairs is 2 feet wide and goes around in a spiral so its hard to walk down. Its an old house in London so its just the way it is. Its not really the owners/managers fault. However the price for London accommodation is just appauling in general. This place is rubbish value for money as is the whole of London. The breakfast is ok and is buffet style. I preferred this. On second day the beans and egg were cold. Two surly girls (looks like family run place) are in charge of breakfast. Other staff were fine particularly the lady of reception (looks like wife -you get picture?). I'm guessing Dad answers door when you ring doorbell.

They were very helpful and advised the best places to eat and drink and the older man had no problem us buzzing the door to be let in at 3.30am after a rather heavy cocktail drinking session! We were in quite a poor state i can tell you! We also ended up in a gay bar but we only realised when we were in. Apparently the area is well known for the gay bars. We had a great experience. The location is fab! We got quite lost when we walked out of leicester square station but once you know where to go you will have no troule finding your way. Breakfast was 8am to 10am, after a rather heavy drinking session we needed food! We arrived at the last minute at 9.45am and there was still a full english left in the buffet, with toast, tea, coffee. A lovely girl took our orderes of tea, coffee and toast and didnt complain that we had turned up just before closing.

On returning at 2pm for check-in we were told our room wasn't ready which was annoying as we had been up since 5am! Eventually we were allowed to our room which was on the 3rd floor. The stairs is hardly wide enough for one person, never mind one person and a big suitcase and hand luggage and hand bags and NO LIFT. It took us much pushing, straining, stopping, heaving, falling over and giggling to get to the 3rd floor. I would not recommend to anyone who hasn't tried out for the olympics recently. Our room wasn't as dreadful as we expected after seeing the rest of the \"hotel\", The room was small but we made do, in fact it wasn't as small as other London hotels we've been in. The bathroom was TINY though. Plenty of towels and toilet paper and soap (not wrapped). Bedclothes were clean and room seemed generally clean, We had a view onto the street outside which we were happy with initially till we realised that it would and did keep us awake at night. Every sound could be heard from other rooms so if you are partaking in any nightly activities, don't forget your neighbours ;) We had a look at the breakfast room and decided we were not going near it again. Its tiny, old, cramped, ewww! Staff were very friendly, all foreigners but with good english. Location of this \"hotel\" was superb. We were going to a few Shows so it was ideal and we were going to Leicester Square for clubbing which was a ten minute walk. Our television broke on Saturday afternoon and we were afraid we would miss The X-Factor so the manager of the hotel came as fast as he could with a new television so that we wouldnt miss our show.
