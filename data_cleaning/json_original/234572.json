The front desk staff were helpful in providing us directions, making our dinner reservation at La Pepita restaurant and booking our taxi to go to the airport (they speak good English). We booked the U232 room but when we smelled the room that had a hint of cigarette smoke (we requested a non-smoking room) we explained the situation to the front desk staff and they surprisingly upgraded us to the Top Room on the 10th floor...we were in for a treat! The room was clean, spacious and it had a balcony over looking the beautiful city of Barcelona. The furnishings seemed new, comfy bed and pillows. Bathroom was clean and I liked the rain shower. Daily breakfast was good although I did not notice a change in food selection (we stayed for 3 nights). I say that the kitchen staff were helpful because one morning when I was having breakfast, I accidentally cut my finger while slicing bread and it was fairly deep. The male staff quickly walked me inside their kitchen and called his lady colleague who helped me apply pressure on the cut as a lot of blood were coming out (apologies for being graphic). They immediately got the first aid kit and was applying pressure on my cut to stop the bleeding. They applied bandage and made sure I was ok. We did not understand each other as she was speaking in Spanish and I was speaking in English but that did not stop her from treating my wound. I was constantly thanking her (and the staff) because they were good samaritans in my eyes. I wish I got her name :(. Location wise, the hotel is walking distance to a train station but not a lot of restaurants nearby.

We found the hotel through Trip Advisor, and after reading some great reviews and seeing its very reasonable rates, we decided to book it. We got the train from the airport to Barcelona Sants (which was only 20 mins), and then took a quick metro trip to the \"Hospital Clinic\" station. The U232 was only a quick stroll up the road, so it really couldn't have been easier to get to. The street it is on is really lovely. On entering the lobby, we both immediately started grinning! It was fabulous! The decor is very contemporary, with dark brown, black and cream colours, and soft jazzy music playing. The whole hotel is immaculately clean. The reception staff were very pleasant, and while the situation didn't arise in our trip, they did seem very approachable if you needed them. Our room was really lovely, and in keeping with the decor from the lobby. The bed was large very comfortable, and a large desk, above which was an LED tv! Unfortunately, the only English speaking channel was BBC World News, but to be honest, with all of Barcelona to explore, this really didn't matter! The bathroom was a great size - again, all black and brown marble - and the shower pressure was brilliant. The bathroom also had a proper hairdryer (unlike the usual tiny air blower in hotels) which I was delighted with! However, the room did not have its own iron and ironing board, but I presume you could get these from reception when needed. Probably the best part of our room was the balcony though! We completely were not expecting it to have one, but when I took a peek in the door of one or two other rooms as they were being cleaned, it seems that all rooms have balconies? Is this possible...? Anyway, it was a fine size balcony overlooking the street we had arrived on! As the weather was beautiful for our days there, we made good use of relaxing out there when we got the chance. The hotel also has the most beautiful terrace on the roof, complete with sun loungers, and some larger ones almost like beds (!) with soft jazzy music constantly playing in the background - extreme relaxation!! As for getting around Barcelona from this hotel, the metro station allows you access within minutes to anywhere in the city you would like to go. We got a T-10 metro ticket each as soon as we arrived, which allowed us 10 trips on any train or metro, including the train to and from the airport - it really is the best value transport ticket, and is available from all the automatic ticket machines. If at night you want to stay local, there are plenty of bars, restaurants, cafes, and tapas bars on the street the hotel is on which are really good! We found some great places to sit out with a glass of wine which were very reasonable! We didn't get breakfast in the hotel, but instead went to a cafe down the road every morning for croissants and pastries! Overall, I could not fault the U232. From the service, to the room to the location! Everything was top notch, and to be honest, I would have expected to have to pay a lot more for such an experience.

The hotel is away from the main tourist areas; so avoids the associated problems of excess noise and the dreaded pickpockets. The \"Hospital Clinic\" metro stop is only a few minutes walk from the front door, which gives access to the L5 line. This line runs through the centre of Barcelona and makes travel around the various areas of the city exceptionally easy. There are a number of restaurants within a short walk of the hotel - which we found to be significantly cheaper than the central areas, without a noticeable drop in standard. Transport to the hotel: To get to the hotel from the airport, the best bet is to walk to the airport train station. Tickets can be purchased from the machines before the barriers. I would recommend the \"T10\" ticket - which cost us \u20ac9.25 and allowed 10 journeys using; train, bus, tram and metro underground trains.

It is in a quiet area, near the metro station, a few good restaurants and bars are in the area where you can find only spanish people and not tourists. The staff can make you any resrvation for a restaurant or help you accordingly. The first impression when i arrived it was a cosy entrance and friendly staff (well done Manuel) the room was OK for single use (comfortable bed and pillows - clean - mini bar - big flat TV) and it was really quiet even it was near the elevator. The bathroom was clean and it had everything you may needed (the only thing missing in order to make it perfect was a pair of slippers), the shower was big and in marble. The breakfast was excellent, fresh fruits, a lot of choices and traditional mediterranean breakfast. The staff was also very helpful and kind. In the hotel there is free wi-fi connection so you can be online most of the time. if you decided to book a room there, note that you can negociate for the price. I made the reservation on November and when i contacted them by email, they gave me -10% on the internet rate + -10% for early booking.

I chose this hotel because I fell in love with the Top Room photos shown on the website - the beautiful balcony with comfy furniture where I could see us lounging after a hard day of sightseeing! This was a splurge for us but we thought we'd kick off this very special vacation with a treat. The room itself (910) is super - spacious and modern, comfortable beds and lovely linens, a good sized table, tons of closet space, mini-bar and safe, excellent air conditioning and lighting. There was no noise from outside and we had good, sound sleeps. But my heart sank when I saw the balcony - no comfy furniture, no shade - only a small table and 2 hard chairs and 2 uncomfortable lounge chairs that were difficult to get in and out of. I was so disappointed. Months of looking forward to this vacation and this particular hotel - only to find this. And to add insult to injury, from our hot, stark balcony, we could see the balconies below us - with their lovely upholstered wicker furniture, side tables and shade!!! I went to the front desk to inquire about this and was told that only room 910 had twin beds. Great. No offer to move the furniture to our balcony from another suite. They did offer to move us to another room the next day but it had a double bed - I was so tired after travelling all night that I just gave up. But I agree with other posters that the hotel should provide the same furnishings for all their \"Top Rooms\" or indicate on the website that there is a difference. The other minus was the room service. Service was prompt but the so-called \"club sandwich\" was beyond a joke - not even close to a club sandwich and completely inedible. One wonders why a decent sandwich cannot be had when the breakfast buffet (although expensive) was quite tasty. When we called the front desk to complain about the sandwiches, we were told curtly by a woman with somewhat of an attitude that \"it is not possible\" (to get a club sandwich!). There was no argument about removing them from our bill. This item should be removed from the menu entirely. The other staff members were great - in particular one young man whose English was excellent and who checked us in and out, stored our luggage while we waited for our room to be made up, provided maps and directions and called us taxis as required. The other pluses include free Wifi, a nice little bar in the foyer and the business center with 2 computers and a printer. We were able to print out our boarding passes which meant we avoided a huge long line-up at the airport. The breakfast buffet (14 euros) was convenient and varied - several hot dishes - grilled tomatoes, bacon, scrambled eggs, patatas bravas, cold cereals, fresh fruit, juices, yoghurts, pastries, a variety of breads, cold meats and cheeses. Location is good - we walked to Las Ramblas and back one day and on another, jumped on the subway to get to the Sagrada Familia Basilica and then to Barceloneta - very easy to get around.

We chose this hotel because the rates were reasonable and we had arrived by train from Madrid and this hotel is located one easy and short metro ride from the Barcelona Sants Railway Station. As most reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is a little bit outside the heart of the city and it's a bit of a pain to switch trains plus a hike through some really long corridors at the Diagonal Metro Station to get to La Rambla. But we found the benefits of staying at this hotel far outweighed the cons. For us, we thought the biggest benefit (besides the proximity to the Sants train station) was the dining options in the area. Our best meals in Barcelona were all at restaurants within walking distance from this hotel, and prices around here were very reasonable compared to the tourist-driven restaurants in the city centre. We particularly loved Maitea Taberna and their wide variety of delicious tapas. Maitea Taberna is located about 2.5 blocks away from the hotel on Carrer de Casanova. The staff at the restaurant was very friendly and patient as we were trying to figure out the whole process. We loved the food there so much that we went back a second time. Another terrific restaurant was Gusto, located 1.5 blocks away and right across the street from the metro station. I would come back to this hotel just to eat at those establishments again! Other things we loved about the hotel: - Very quiet, spacious and comfortable rooms for reasonable rates. We stayed on the second floor and had a balcony. Albeit the balcony was right smack dab in the middle of a coutyard in the middle of a network of apartments. But it was nice to step outside on a warm night with a drink and look inside the well-lit apartments all around us! - Free wi-fi plus there are two desktops and one printer for public use. Very handy as we didn't bring our laptop with us. - Room was equipped with a safe and fridge, which I think should be essentials in every hotel room. - Besides the restaurants I mentioned above, there were also plenty of places where you can grab breakfast, or a quick bite. - There are a couple of Suma supermarkets and they are both within 2 or 3 blocks from the hotel. Great place to buy snacks and drinks to stock the fridge. - Even though you need to switch metro trains to get to La Rambla, there are some places that are easily accessible from this hotel, such as Sagrada Familia and the Sants Railway Station. - Well staffed.

The hotel itself is fine. Service at reception and roomservice is good, fast and pleasant. The lounge and bar are nice, although constantly in a dim light.

Most interesting was the window between bathroom and bedroom, with blinds, but just a glass pane as divider. I suspect that my room is offered as a 1-person business room with less use as the other rooms: some lights didn't work, glass shower divider was broken, there was some water damage, and the bathroom was clean enough, but seemed unused for some time. I wasn't particularly fond of the shower as it looked better than it functioned: not much water pressure and temperature changes that are uncomfortable.

It took us a minute to figure out how to use any of the lights (you must put your key card in the slot by the door), but this turned out to be fairly common throughout Spain. The bathroom was very nice, with a spacious shower (not necessarily common in Spain), extra cubbies for your toiletries, etc. As others have mentioned, this hotel is seemingly designed with couples in mind. The lighting style and placement are all quite romantic, and the bathroom has a window allowing anyone in the main room to watch whoever's showering. While this window can be closed easily, it's worth noting that I would recommend this hotel slightly less for families or, haha, business acquaintances. We didn't eat at the hotel due to the price and the large number of good breakfast options within 2 blocks. Speaking of which, the hotel's location is wonderful. While not in the old city, it is 2 blocks from a major Metro station and only a 15 minute walk from many other interesting parts of Barcelona. The street on which U232 is situated is clean, fairly quiet, and eminently safe, though Barcelona is a very safe city in general. A 5 year old walking down the road with a million Euros in cash at 3AM would have no problems in this wonderful town.

Additionally, the rooms with 3 beds worked very well for our family of 5. Now I go onto my complaint. Our stay before our visit was uneventful, but our stay after our cruise was very disappointing. Although the staff will make no attempt to check you in early. I realize this may be impossible at times, but our party felt that they did not even try. When from our cruise we were unable to check in, so we went out for the day. When we returned, the staff had given away 2 of our rooms, which we had wanted to be adjoining as we were travelling with our 3 children. As well, we wanted the room with 3 beds, which we had booked well in advance of our visit. We found out the room was occupied by getting to the room to find another lady guest within it. I have to say the staff working at that time tried their best to find us another room, but it took an hour to resolve and included another visit to an occupied room. In the end, we were given 2 rooms beside each other (but not joining) we (5 of the 9 of us) were provided a breakfast, which was nice, but not really compensation for the lost time and inconvenience. The next morning, the staff member working the front desk was very unfriendly and unhelpful (and he frowned at me the entire time). He was put out to provide another room key, which was a function of not having adjoining rooms in the first place and my son locked us out of the room. There was no need for him to bark at me about returning \u201call the keys\u201d when I only ever received 1 for each room. Upon checking out, I then asked this staff member about \u201clost and found\u201d as my son had misplaced his red Boston Red Sox baseball cap on our first stay and I was hoping someone had found it. He replied that he would have to look for it the next day. I conveyed that I was leaving for Canada, but he was still unwilling to be helpful.

We are spending our final nite of a 6-nite stay at U232 in Barcelona. The neighborhood is excellent. The metro stop - Hospital Clinic - 2 blocks away, is ideal, you can get anywhere from here so incredibly easily. We have the \"Top Room\" which is large with a king-size bed and a big terrace on an upper floor. We needed the terrace for smoking because it's a nonsmoking hotel. We don't rely much on hotel staff, but they were always impeccably friendly and helpful, and the housekeeping was very good. We try to always get a breakfast included deal, but because of the limited number of the terrace rooms which we booked 6 months ago, it simply wasn't on offer. We saw on booking.com that they were willing to sweeten the deal with free breakfast for their standard rooms. So we cannot comment at all whether their 14 euro breakfast was one way or another. We just don't do 14 euro breakfasts, and never even saw the breakfast room. But the huge terrace overlooking the city more than made up for loss of breakfast. There is a coffee pot with instant coffee and teas available. So we ended up doing a bruch out on our explorations. We have to highly recommend two Italian restaurants, each two blocks in opposite directions on Calle Urguell. We ate our evening meals at these places five out of six nites after getting back from our day's activities, they were that good and economical. There are a lot of other places to munch merely steps away, and grocers as well, which might not be so obvious in other reviews. Also we had already done all the great gastronomic stuff the previous 10 days in Madrid and Bilbao. You cannot go wrong dining at Gusto Ristorante Trattoria/Pizzeria, two blocks east on Urguell across from the metro elevator. Equally recommended is Buongiorno Trattoria and Pizzeria two blocks in the opposite direction going toward Diagonal.

Although the Hotel is small and slightly out from what is considered the main centre of Barcelona it is actually a pleasant and reasonably quick walk along to the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia. The hotel bar was slick and comfortable as was the breakfast area with a good breakfast selection. There are plenty of Deli and coffee bars nearby as an alternative to having breakfast at the Hotel. I tried to re-book this Hotel for Easter Weekend 2011 but it was full and I guess a popular choice.

I have stayed in Barcelona many times in the past and normally stayed down near the port or the Ramblas however this hotel was slightly out of the 'tourist' centre which I really enjoyed. There are some really nice bars and restaurants near by (my favourite was Maitea Taberna, it is a must if you are staying in this hotel, only 2 minutes walk and great food. Read the reviews on this site). Although I did walk to the Ramblas from the hotel one day I would probably recomend the metro if you want to get about without blisters. There is a stop only one minutes walk from the hotel (called Hospital Clinic) which will give you quick access to the whole city. Travel Tip: I would definitely recommend getting a T-10 ticket for the metro, it saves you a lot of money and makes travel so easy. As the name would suggest you get ten trips on bus or metro and can be used by more than one person (just leave it on the top of the barrier for your friend to use behind you).

Cons: - No iron & iron board. There are laundry facilities available but at high prices. Approx 8 Euros for washing and ironing a single shirt. We ended up buying a travel iron at Carrefour. - No clock in the room. No big deal when you are on holidays but somewhat surprising. - Relatively expensive breakfast. Better value breakfast options are available across and down the road. - The bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a double glass window. Inside the double glass appear to be some blinds which can be electronically adjusted. However this did not work for us.

Decor: The decor is modern, but with a jazz/deco twist. Lots of black (though this worked well). Lighting in the hallways was dim and warm-feeling, which I actually liked because it created a sense of relaxation. Room: Rooms were spacious and clean. We had what their web site calls the U232 Room, with a king bed, and balcony overlooking the courtyard. Bed was comfortable. A bit on the firm side, but actually softer than many European hotels (so, maybe soft for Europe!). Our room overlooked the courtyard with a nice little balcony, which was kind of fun as it was faced actual apartments, so it felt like a glimpse into how people actually live there. It was also QUIET, which we prefer. I don't know how the street-side rooms are but the courtyard ones were very quiet. Photos on their web site are pretty accurate as to what the place looks like inside. Misc: -If you need ice, you need to get it from the bar in the lobby. -Room has small min-bar fridge. -There is a safe in the room. -There is no iron/ironing board available. They do have laundry service you can pay for, but nothing you DIY. -There is no concierge service, for example, to plan excursions, but the front desk was helpful with recommendations and directions. -Also, they give a much better city street map than the tourist office uses. -Front desk staff speaks English well. -Did not do the breakfast buffet - there are several cafes and places within a block or two of the hotel to get food. There is also a small grocery store around the corner. -There is a parking deck right next to the hotel - hotel guests get a discount, so if you rent a car, this would be helpful (we did not use it). Location: Location is in the city, but outside of the main tourist areas, so it's quieter. Just 2 blocks from the Metro 'Hospital Clinic' stop, so it's really easy to get anywhere you need. Wifi: Free wi-fi throughout the hotel. Ours did not work at first, but they sent up a maintenance person right away who fixed it, so definitely tell them ASAP if your in-room internet service is down. There is also a small 'business center' with 2 computers and a printer in the lobby area near the bar. Bathroom: The only down-side (and none of these things would make me not recommend this place, but if it is important to someone else, it is worth noting...) is the bathroom. Overall, it is spacious and clean but there were a few issues. The main issue: there is a window that separates the bathroom from the bedroom. There are blinds you *should* be able to close for privacy. Ours did not work and because the blinds were between glass, you could not manually adjust them. We told the front desk who indicated this was a known problem (and it sounded like it is in many rooms) and they said parts were being ordered to fix them. If you need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, the light will wake the other person. But also, if you are traveling with someone you would feel uncomfortable being naked in front of (a friend, your teenager) then this might be a problem. Be sure to ask if this has been fixed if this is important to you. The bathroom isn't very sound-proof. Not to be indelicate, but if you have to 'go', the person outside the room will hear you. Again, might be awkward depending upon who you are traveling with. Bath products are not great. They only give you shampoo (kind of drying), bath gel (watery) and soap. No conditioner or body lotion, so bring these things if you need. Also, no washcloths or tissues (we asked for tissues - housekeeping left us extra rolls of toilet paper - not sure if that was a translation issue or not, but we did not ask again). Also just odd: you have to step all the way into the shower to turn on the shower faucet, which means you will get wet with cold water when you turn on the shower. The door only slides at the opposite end of the tub. There is also a European-style hand-held nozzle to use. That said, hair dryer was great! I have long hair and most hotel dryers are low wattage and take forever. This was a full-sized, full-strength dryer.

The \"Hospital Clinic\" metro stop is about 100 meters from the hotel, so when we didn't want to walk somewhere, we were able to get around very easily. It wasn't always easy to find good restaurants in the area, however, so we ate elsewhere in the city on a couple of occasions. Room - Our room was very clean and a reasonable size. We certainly didn't feel that it was too small for our five-night stay. There was also ample room to put away our clothes for the duration of our stay. The washroom was nice despite a small amount of water vapor damage that was visible on the ceiling (I don't know why they don't use bathroom fans in Spain, but that would likely take care of the issue).

Getting there Took the rail line from the El Prat BCN Airport, Transferred to the L5 at Placa Sants station (about 40 min commute). If you land in T1, take the free shuttle to T2 (about 10 mins). Hospital Clinic station was easy, two short blocks away - don't even have to cross the street if you leave from the correct exit. We arrived at the hotel around 9:30 pm on a Monday, felt safe. The reception staff was very helpful, check-in was painless and quick. They spoke flawless English, and even helped us book a restaurant in the neighborhood for us very helpful. The room is exactly as the webpage portrays. Fantastic bathroom, large for a Euro-hotel, comfortable king. We had a courtyard room on floor 1, which was great- the main street -Urgell is very loud in the mornings especially on the weekdays as its a main street buzzing with traffic. Its good to avoid the view and opt for the quiet courtyard. Location was fantastic! We took a peek into the hotel breakfast and decided to go local instead. We skipped breakfast at the hotel - and went to my favorite place in all of Barcelona - Dino Pan (a chain bakery) on the very same block as the hotel down the street. GREAT VALUE. We grabbed breakfast here EVERY day. Lots of good restaurants in the area -Vinya Roel ,La Mamasita, Balthazar (2 to 4 blocks away). Good bars in the area for tapas hopping if you wanted as well. The neighborhood is very local and safe - We don't like the crowded tourist areas and we just want to experience the culture of every day life when we travel. The close metro stop will help you get to the main sites of Barcelona with an easy transfer. For all my friends who visit Barcelona, I will recommend the U232. Great hotel.

Firstly, It's location. The hotel is not right in and amongst the action of Barcelona's main centre/old town/tourist locations but it is very close to the 'Hotel Clinic' metro station - basically, across the road. This station is also directly connected to the 'Saints Estacio' station via the blue metro line, this means that you only have to make one change after a train from the airport. The Hospital Clinic station is just a few stops from the Segrada Familia, it also runs diagonal across the city so it connects to many other lines. The Hotel itself is very contemporary, tastefully decorated and lighted, this provides a very tranquil, pleasant atmosphere. The staff are fluent in English, pleasant and helpful, i couldn't ask for more. They made our check in/out process totally easy. When we asked to put our bags in the hold after checking out, they promptly did this for us, straight away, they marked up the bags infront of us and quickly stored them away - unlike in other hotels when they pile them up with the rest and do it later, leaving you nervous! The room was inviting, very nicely decorated and exactly as they looked in the promotional pictures. The room was clean, fresh and air conditioned. The air conditioning worked and was easy to use. The bed and bedding was of high quality and comfortable. The furnishings were of excellent quality, My mother owns the acrylic chair they have in the rooms and they are worth well over \u00a3100! The bathroom was clean, stylish and well equipped with quality fittings and appliances, the hairdryer was modern too! Towels and toiletries were good quality and were replaced daily. The room had free wireless internet access, this was a great little perk, just make sure you ask for the WiFi code when you check in. It was nice to use it to research places to eat/see using my tripadvisor app on my iPhone! The room had a nice balcony overlooking residential buildings, we never used it to sit on but it was nice to stand at for some fresh air in the morning! All in all, an excellent stay and i would make a point of going back and recommending this establishment. I have stayed in 5 star hotels in London less equipped than this place. We took a chance with this hotel and it paid off. The ONLY drawback, and i mean ONLY - the TV. The signal of the English channels was poor and unreliable but hey, you don't go to Barcelona to watch telly do you?!

I booked in advance this hotel for three nights as a birthday treat for my girlfriend. I booked a suite U232 room (901) and has been in touch on many occassions prior to arrival for advice, assistance in terms of my reservation and also to have restaurants booked on my behalf. On each occassion I was well assisted even though Im sure I must have seemed a nuisance, I just wanted it all to be perfect. They seemed to understand and were nothing but polite and helpful. The room was sensational, large room, but not huge, an INCREDIBLE bathroom, one I certainly plan to recreate in my own home, well equipped and with the added bonus of a wonderful private terrace. The terrace and bathroom was really great. The bed was also very comfortable. The only slight nags I could possibly issue are that the furniture outside does get wet as the terrace is not covered. Then again, if it were covered you';d lose some view which would be a pity. Another highlight was breakfast, for a european city hotel this really was first class, yes it is a buffet but the food is well made and very tasty with a wide selection. We also tried one morning the breakfast in bed at no extra cost and this too arrived on time, at the correct temperature and well prepared. Location wise, I cannot fathom the criticism, if one wants to stay on La Rambla with the street hawks and football fans then fine. But for me U232 is ideally situated, the metro system works like a dream, very regular, lots of space, clean and very cheap. Literally takes door to door under 10 minuts to any of the main attractions: La Rambla, Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, Montjuic or the harbour. Finally, the big bonus, the staff, again, in comparison to other city centre hotels thsi was second to none, the staff were friendly, polite, helpful and informed. Managing a guesthouse this is usually my selling point as the main differential from city hotels, however U232 proved that personal service is achievable in these larger venues. This was my concern, if other hotels were to cotton on to this, guesthouses such as mine would no longer have a market. I hope they wont and that U232 stays a unique shining light. I would like to partcularly thank Cristina, who helped me with my initial reservation and also aided my requests, she was also ably aided by two other colleagues who helped answer questions and make reservations for me. I would also like to thank the gentleman who we often saw at reception during our stay, I believe his name to be Miguel (could never quite make out his name badge in the light) young gentleman receptionist who was so helpful, polite and courtious.

They had my reservation (through booking.com) and an available room for me. I booked a single and expected an extremely small but well-appointed room. It turns out the \"L\"-shaped entry/foyer was about as large as I thought the room would be...but then there was an actual room as well, with a small balcony, two beds, ceiling beams, dark marble bathroom....sigh. I was almost tempted to take a nap but decided to run around and get to know the city. U232 is two blocks from the Metro. As many had mentioned here, the hotel is not in the center of it all, but it is close enough and the Metro runs a very admirable schedule, very efficient. I could go on and on about the Metro, but that is for another forum. More about the hotel...the decor is very masculine and warm, with dark woods, striped and leather couches, bold, simple and large images on the walls. Impeccably clean. . Even the shampoo smelled masculine, which was a nice diversion. My saving grace was the hotel\u2019s business center, which was not much to speak of, only with two computers and one printer, a seating area and a conference table. But because I\u2019d made my reservation so late, I was unable to secure an international BlackBerry and decided to leave my compute behind.

A fun visit to Barcelona does not require you live in Las Ramblas (I actually did not really like that area when I walked around there--just too touristy). The metro is very easy, convenient, and cheap (2 day pass was 11.50 euros), runs late on Fri, and all night on Sat. If you are out late at night drinking, the hotel is walking distance from most places in the city. The staff gave me some great recommendations, and a local friend also took me to a great Chilean restaurant (Hugo's). Another day we found by chance, La Taverna del Born. Both were not too touristy (the restaurants lining Las Ramblas tend to be more expensive and touristy, according to my friend, a native Barcelonan). The hotel staff were very friendly, and there is internet (2 computers) and wifi free! you can even print for free--so they don't nickel and dime you. I hate when you pay $100 for a room and they want to charge you $5 for 15 minutes of internet use (it's not so much the money, but the principle).

We did not have the breakfast, although there are at least 6 bakeries within a block of the hotel, so if it's unappealing to you, many things around the area should suit better. The gentleman working reception when we arrived was a bit reticent and uncongenial, and after quite a bit of travel, this was unfortunate. For instance, one of our keys didn't work in the door, and we didn't discover until two days later that it had been coded for a different room. Once we were able to enter, however, we were unable to turn on any lights. If it's common to have to use one's room key to turn on the lights in hotels, I have somehow yet to have encountered it, and it would have been nice had the gentleman at reception told us about this detail. So, if you stay at this hotel: your room key turns on the lights, and it must remain in the light lock for the entire time you expect the lights to be operational. However, the woman at the desk in the evening was friendly and helpful, and even helped us a bit with both Spanish and Catalan pronunciation. The woman tending the bar is certainly at home in the chic design boutique hotel environment, and mixes excellent drinks.

We were so thankful to have found U232, and can say without a doubt that it is where we will stay anytime we return to Barcelona. The prices were great, the hotel very chic, and the staff ridiculously friendly and helpful and spoke great English. To find this place, I used my two trusty travel tools: Kayak to check for the lowest prices and TripAdvisor to compare top rated hotels with real customer reviews. I cross-check using the two tools and narrow down my hotel choices in that way. One of the things we loved the best about this hotel is that it was NOT in the middle of the tourist area near Las Ramblas. Why did we love this? Several reasons: first, the price was better; second, the restaurants near our hotel's prices were better; and third, we got more of an \"authentic\" experience since the food places we visited were filled with locals and not tourists. Being away from Las Ramblas did not make it difficult for us to see some of the tourist attractions, since the hotel is right near a subway stop, and it was just a few subway stops (or a long walk) away from Las Ramblas and many of the famouse Gaudi buildings. We also love the free internet access so that we could check-in with folks back in the US. Some tips: As I mentioned above, Barcelona has a great public transportation system. We were able to save TONS of money on taxis by using the subway. You can honestly get nearly anywhere you need to go in Barcelona by using the subway (including the airport). We got 10 ride passes for around 8 Euro, which could get the two of us around all day between the hotel, restaurants that were not in walking distance, and tourist attractions (each cab ride is 15-30 Euro to give you some comparison).

August is high tourist season in Spain, but it's low business season in the big cities and most of the business hotels offer very low prices, especially on reservations made in advance. That's how we paid a bargain price for such a comfortable and elegant four-star hotel. We chose a \"U232 room\" that turned out to be very spacious and stylishly designed in predominant black and white square shapes, with a king-size bed and a small balcony facing the interior patio of the block. A comfortable bathroom was separated from the rest of the room by an original wide glass screen shaded by blinds, so that from the bathroom one could peek into the bedroom and vice versa by adjusting the slant of the blinds (which of course could also be shut). The U232 Hotel is located at the south-western end of the Eixample, the district that comprises some of Barcelona's most renowned avenues and squares. Being a quiet residential neighbourhood rather than a tourist area, this part of the Eixample district is a very good compromise between quiet and distance from the centre. A hotel in the Ciutat Vella, the very centre of the city, might apparently be more attractive, but it would also be more expensive and, most of all, probably less quiet, considering how busy and noisy the Barri G\u00f2tic and the Ramblas are at any time of day and night. There is a metro station a few steps from the U232 and you reach the Rambla in just four stops, although with a line change. I don't agree with the reviewers who complain about the presumed inconvenience of the location, when it takes only fifteen or twenty minutes at most to reach the Barri G\u00f2tic. Moreover, not all of Barcelona's attractions are inside the old city: Gaud\u00ed's most renowned works, such as the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, the Casa Batll\u00f3 and La Pedrera, are in the Eixample; the Casa Batll\u00f3 and La Pedrera, in particular, are reachable from the U232 Hotel in a twenty-minute walk, if you don't feel like taking the metro for just one stop. Overall, the value for money is excellent, but breakfast is not included in the price of the room. It costs some 14 euros per person, quite much compared to the price of the room, for which we paid no more than 68 euros per night. You'd better have your breakfast outside: try the Bracaf\u00e9 at the corner of Carrer del Comte d'Urgell and Carrer de C\u00f2rsega.

I'd advise to ask in advance to get a room overlooking the comte d'urgell rather than the dark courtyard. Guests ranged from business types to affluent Americans, so peace and quiet is pretty much guaranteed. Location is absolutely fine as its only a 20 min stroll to Las Ramblas - and who'd want to be too close to the equivalent of Leicester Square anyway?!

Bed was very comfy, aircon worked a treat and room was very spacious. View from balcony wasn't great, but as mentioned by someone already, not too bothered; the room itself made up for this.

Since we had breakfast included in our room, the breakfast was alright. In the overall the hotel itself is very nice. There are more TV channels with movies than another hotel where we stayed. The only downside of the hotel is its location that is a little far away from the city center where most tourist activities take place (Plaza Catalunya & La Rambla). There is no direct metro line from the city center to the hotel. There are 2 bus lines which are pretty convenient. However their Sunday schedules are not too frequent. We had to take a taxi, instead, to catch our tour bus which departed from Plaza Catalunya. Luckily there is a line of taxis just a block away from the hotel, in front of a hospital.

The hotel was nicely decorated and the rooms contained all you need, not massive rooms, but big enough and reasonable sized bathroom.

The marble bathroom a delight. And the decor a pleasure to look at. But I had trouble modulating the air conditioning. The blower was right over the bed, so it was either freezing and cold air was hitting my face all night. If I just used the fan and no ac, then it got too warm. Consequently, sleeping was difficult. Also, the 14E breakfast is definitely overcharged. The cereal selection is museli and corn flakes. Limited cut up fresh fruit available. They offer mainly canned peaches, etc. But it was more convenient eating there than trying to find a cafe that wasn't filled with cigarette smoke.

You cant really walk anywhere good (La Ramblas etc) however, there are many cabs available on Urgell and it only costs 5 Euro to cab to La Ramblas.

Cost: about 130 euros per night, for the room, plus about 10 euros for cab fare to town and back, For a nice 4 star hotel like this, I think this is a real bargain. Rooms: Very clean, modern and nice. The rooms are somewhat small but they are space efficient. The beds are new, comfortable and very clean. The showers were also very good. Hot and great water pressure. The windows open to allow in fresh air and curtains could keep out the sun to ensure a dark peaceful night's sleep. I would recommend rooms at the front of the hotel as the view from the back is of some run down apartment buildings. Restaurant: Only serves breakfast but it is quite good. It is a cold buffet with meats, cheeses, sausage, hardboiled eggs, pastries, juice, coffee, cereal, yogurt etc etc. Breakfast costs about 13 euros and is a good deal for what you get. I was very pleased with it. There is no lunch or dinner. They do accommodate room service but it is limited. I did not try room service. Location: Is somewhat poor but not too far away from the centre of town. There are some very good restaurants nearby and ample cabs. We never waited more than 3 minutes for a cab to show up. Hospitality: was very good. I read some reviews criticizing the staff. Whoever wrote this must be a curmudgeon. The staff were consistently friendly and helpful.

Every dollar you spend here is on a great hotel, not a great location. Hence the great value. If this hotel were in the Ramblas it would cost $500 per night.

Location Do not believe some of the other reviews that rave on about how great the location is - it's a disappointment. If you're looking for a meai, you'll need to walk about 20ish minutes to an area with few restaurants. The walk isn't so pleasant when there's nothing along the way to look at, and the streets leading into that area are quiet & dark. Furthermore, we were told by staff that that area was in fact the city centre of Barcelona, it was far from it - we didn't see / experience any excitement or buzz, or bump into many other tourists. We found out the next day that the life of the city was actually several subway stations away from the hotel. So if it's location you're after, then you may want to avoid this place. Staff Bases on the above comments, we were obviously disappointed with the staffs' inability to accurately tell us where the city centre was. Additionally wrong directions to this supposed city centre. Also, the staff (specifically the evening shift ones) weren't as friendly as we had hoped - lacked patience in assisting with basic tourist questions. Each time we approached them, we felt we were bothering & inconveniencing them because we wanted their guidance & advice on attraction sites. When we asked them the name of a castle that sits on a high hilltop we saw on the way back to the hotel, the staff rudely & abruptly told us it was impossible for him to tell us as there were millions of castle in Barcelona. We accept that that question may have been somewhat vague & silly , but there was no need for a response in that tone & manner.

I booked an \"art weekend\" from the hotel's website. It was good value for money, I ended up paying about Euro 100 per night for the double room. This weekend special included one pass for two people to seven of the major museums in the city (Picasso, Miro, MNAC etc.), a welcome cocktail from the bar and breakfast for two nights out of three. The hotel is indeed very nice aesthetically. The reception and bar area were clean and inviting. The rooms were quite spacious for a standard room. It had simple furniture but with a nice touch... everything was in wood, which I always appreciate. Flat screen TV (though didn't have many channels in English or French). Bathroom was also in style, with black marble and a big glass shower. Wifi in the lobby area and two computers that were at disposal. I thought that was a bonus, since I really didn't want to carry my laptop with me for a weekend where all I needed it for was web check-in. Breakfast was served in an area on the first floor, it had quite a wide selection and I loved the little doughnuts they had. You got a choice of hot and cold savory as well as toast, yogurt, pastries, cereal etc. I give it 4 out of 5. Now to the not-so-nice stuff: We arrived on Friday night and found that amenities in the room included: razor and shaving cream, toothbrush, shoe sponge, bath sponge, tissues...everything except shower gel and shampoo...there was nothing to wash yourself with but the tiny bar of hand soap! Just to be clear: they forgot to provide us with both shower gel and shampoo for two nights out of three. We ended up going to a supermarket to buy shower gel. Also the room needed to be heated all night because the bed came with one very thin cover. In February the temperature drops quite a bit a night. I like to save on energy if I can and have a green attitude when travelling too (not just in my own home) so I really do not see why we had to heat up a room all day and night as opposed to just having an old-fashioned duvet! On our first night, after the flight & tired, we didn't notice there was no blanket under the bed cover so we hadn't switched on the air con. Result: I was freezing and had a very bad night's sleep. Not a good way to start the weekend. Because we checked in at midnight, the receptionist gave us two vouchers for our \"special U232 cocktail\". So next evening before going for a meal we sat down to taste this special cocktail. The bar lady said (in Spanish) that this was a glass of cava with creme de cassis, a sort of Kyr royal though not real champagne...wait a minute, I said, why are we not having the \"U232 cocktail\" (which was on the bar menu). She replied that the voucher said \"A\" special U232 welcome cocktail, so it did not mean that or any of the cocktails on the list. Well you can imagine how impressed I was about receiving English lessons from a person that not once even tried to speak English with me, even when I was visibly struggling with my Spanish. ANYHOW beggars can't be choosers I suppose, but really did not appreciate the style of staff at times. Last but not least, on the Sunday night we booked a taxi for 5am the following morning and asked for a wake up call at 4am. Therefore, the staff were informed that, yes, we were leaving extremely early. At the same time we ordered room service (it was just past 9pm). By 10pm my boyfriend was getting hungry and a bit annoyed. He called up to ask what was going on and the receptionist said that it would be another 20 minutes. We had ordered a plate of ham, a salad and a ham and cheese sandwich, so we were quite bewildered. Another 30 minutes go by and I'm thinking that we should have been in bed already. FInally at 10.55 our meal arrived. I was furious and so was my boyfriend. We slept very little and were thoroughly annoyed with the whole thing. Thankfully they had the decency not to charge us with the service, I discovered this when I checked out. At least they implicitly admitted their mistake. However, if you are not in a position to provide room service, then don't have a menu for one. We could have gone to one of the corner cafe places, and had an equivalent meal in 30 minutes. All in all, I do not recommend this hotel to people who don't speak Spanish, who are looking for a true 4 star hotel or who are looking for a hotel that's close to where it all happens.

Would stay there again.\u201d", "Author": "JJ_Wisconsin", "ReviewID": "UR51301127", "Content": "I stayed at the U232 Hotel for two nights while visiting Barcelona for leisure, and enjoyed it very much. We got a good price on Booking.com (great source for international hotels, BTW) where it ended up being a little over one hundred dollars per night, with taxes and everything. My husband and I arrived around 10:00 in the morning and were greeted by two friendly individuals at the front desk. They both spoke English, and they informed us that though check in was not until 2:00, they did have a room available for us and that we could get in early. (It was really nice to be able to refresh & recharge a bit after an overnight flight!) The hotel itself is very nice, very classy. The public areas were clean and well-maintained, and the room was very comfortable. We had a double bed (technically two twins attached with a filler piece), a desk, flat-screen TV on the wall opposite the bed, minibar, and good-sized bathroom with tub and shower. Our room faced the courtyard (not street) side, so we did not have any outside noise to contend with. On the second night of our stay, a large tour group checked in, so that night we heard evidence of other people in the hotel--desk chairs scraping on the floor, shower running, etc. So if you were to get a noisy neighbor, the walls may seem thin; for us, though, there were not any real noise issues. One feature I really liked was the fact that there were numerous lights throughout the room, and that pretty much all the lights could be controlled from multiple points. It was especially nice to be able to control the overhead and reading lights from the bed. Also, you need to have a room key placed in a slot near the door for the lights to work; this is a great energy-saving feature, as it prevents you from leaving the lights on full-time in the room when you\u2019re not there. I have only seen such a system in European hotels, and wish more U.S. hotels would follow suit. If you care to watch TV, they carry a number of channels; CNN and National Geographic were the only channels that were always in English, but other channels did occasionally have movies that were in English (I ended up watching Road to Perdition at 2 a.m. when struck by jet lag the first night, and The Last Castle on the second night.) We were on the sixth floor and were able to access the hotel\u2019s free wireless Internet. There is also a business area with two computers, one of which you can print from. I have to say one of the best things about this hotel is its location. While it is not in the same neighborhood as tourist stuff, it is very near a Metro station, and we found the Metro system to be EXTREMELY convenient, reliable, understandable, and easy to use. Honestly, we have had more difficulty navigating subway systems here in the U.S., where we speak the language! I can\u2019t say enough about Barcelona public transportation. We were able to get to everything we wanted to see via Metro (or, in the case of Parc Guell, Metro plus one bus ride). Other reviewers have stated that it is not difficult to walk to many attractions from the hotel, and I believe them, but we took the Metro everywhere because I\u2019m 6 months pregnant and my feet just couldn\u2019t take any extra walking. You can purchase a 10-ride card (T-10) for 7.70 Euros, and it can be used by multiple people (my husband and I shared one card at a time, with me running it through first, then him right after me). Also, this card is not just for the Metro! The first one we bought got us into the city from the airport on a RENFE train, around the metro, and on a bus. And if you transfer to another line within an hour and fifteen minutes of your first ride, it only counts as one use each. You can buy the passes at automated machines in each station, and they take cash, debit, or credit card (but be aware that if you want to use a credit card, it may ask you for a PIN, which we didn\u2019t know for our credit cards). As far as food goes, we did not try anything the hotel had to offer, but there are restaurants and cafes very near the hotel. There is a gas station nearby, and a little convenience store just down the block which is good for picking up drinks & snacks. The cafe called Dino Pan was a lifesaver for me--pastries each morning, and sandwiches for keeping my energy up during the day. We also bought food at a grocery store on the Ramblas (in the basement of the El Corte Ingles department store) and brought that back to the room. We did not try anything at the hotel bar, but I\u2019m assuming that it would be pricey, like most hotel bars. There is also a little bar just down the street which we walked by many times and it looked fine (not dark or dirty or scary). I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family who might want to visit Barcelona.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGood value in a good location\u201d", "Author": "SelinaE", "ReviewID": "UR51161049", "Content": "We have selected this hotel based on the reviews in Tripadvisor.

U232 is close to the Diagonal which is one of Barcelona's main shopping avenues full of designer lables. It is also close to one of the newest shopping centres in Barcelona, L'Illa which again is full of designer labels. We walked a lot in Barcelona and did not find it too difficult from the U232. We had a Top Room which is on the 10th floor with a great view out over the city. Our room was fantastic. Immaculately clean, sheets and towels changed every day which you don't get in all hotels these days, it even had a kettle with tea and coffee. The bathroom has double basins and a double shower with a very long bath in what I would call a Wet Room. The shower was the best I have every experienced in any hotel. The staff at the U232 were excellent and spoke very good English. Nothing was ever too much trouble. We arrived before check-in time but our room was ready and check-in took a couple of minutes. We decided to eat breakfast in the hotel after trying it on the first morning. It meant that we could have a pretty healthy breakfast with some vegetables and eggs. It is not cheap at 13euro each plus tax but we decided that this would be our little luxury. The quality of the breakfast is excellent and the coffee is very good. They serve the coffee in a jug that keeps it very hot and you also get a jug of warm milk. You can also get an espress if you wish, even decaf. The hotel does not have a restaurant but there are plenty of places to eat in the surrounding streets. I would not hesitate to stay at the U232 again and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a high quality hotel that was very good value.

We were very worried that they would not hold our room since we were arriving at about 1:00 am. We flew Ryan Air into Girona, about 120 Kilometers awat. Upon arrival, the wife and I took a bus for 21 euros each, round trip into Barcelona. The bus trip took a little over an hour. Once at the Barcelona Bus Terminal, we could have taken the metro but decided on a taxi due to the late hour, (8 euros) Upon arrival at the hotel, we had no problem with our late arrival. In fact, we were pleasantly surprised. We walked into a very nice looking hotel, older, but very well maintained. The hotel clerk was very friendly and helpful in giving us directions to a nearby gas station / store to purchase and bring back some drinks and a few snacks for quick bite. We dropped off our bags in our very spacious room on the 8th floor with two complete bathrooms, a mini-suite in my book. Don't know if this was a mistake because we booked a standard room. Making the price for this room a great deal. We went for sightseeing so the hotel location was not important but we were very happy with its location. The Hospital-Clinic metro stop, L5 - Blue, was only 2 blocks away. The metro system in Barcelona was clean and very easy to use. We bought the 4 day pass for about 19 euros and included unlimited buss and tram use. On our first day, we decided on the one day hop on- hop off bus tours and at least saw all the major sights. The hotel staff mentioned a voucher for this tour, and they sold us a voucher which saved us 2 euros per person. The pick up location for this tour was only about 4 blocks away. Again, I have to mention the staff was the greatest. They also recommend great locations to visit and even mentioned a few places to eat. We are very easy to please and we would recommend this facility to any of my friends. Also don't be fooled, December weather in Barcelona is cold. Which leads to our only complaint, if you could call it one; we could not turn off the heat nor turn on the A/C.

It was lovely - just like in the photos. First we were put in a horrible dark room on floor 9 with a brick wall outside the window but were moved into a much nicer room on room 8 where we stayed for 3 nights. It was very quiet as it was overlooking the back of the hotel - not a pretty view mind, as it looked over other people's washing and flats. Overlooking the front probably would have been better as it is on the street but has double-glazing. We didn't spend much time in the room so it didn't matter. The staff were helpful and friendly, particularly Jennifer. There is supposed to be some kind of spa downstairs but it was closed when we were there. When I got back I read a review on TripAdvisor that a couple had been given free breakfast because the spa was closed, so remember to ask if you go there. We were able to leave our cases in reception all afternoon as we were on the late flight out, and had absolutely no trouble getting back to the airport by train - stress-free. The hotel is very near the underground station 'hospital clinic', but we found that it was quicker to walk to the top of La Ramblas and make our way down than get on the train. We got the train back sometimes though as it was all uphill. The underground system is very easy to navigate and they have glass lifts from the pavement - how good is that? We bought 10 tickets each for 7 euros at the airport and didn't use them all. We did not eat at the hotel (I think they did breakfast at 13 euros each) as there are plenty of places to eat close by where you can buy rolls, pizza and all sorts. There's a nice deli across the road on the corner. Try the Chinese along the road back towards the station - fab food but they can't speak English or Spanish so it was completely empty!! The woman owner is like a Chinese Basil Fawlty and we eventually managed place our order in French to one of her staff. The atmosphere in Barcelona was brilliant; I absolutely loved it and must have walked miles and miles but it didn't feel that way as there is so much to look at. We even got to watch the gay pride procession. The tourist bus is brilliant - 3 routes and well worth the money. You can get money-off vouchers for the bus in a pack from the hotel. There's a great market in La Ramblas - La Boqueterie - where you can buy fresh fruit and yummy food. And there's always McDonalds and Burger King. We tried hard to find real Spanish food, but despite trying we mostly got rubbishy tourist food that I'm sure Spanish people would not eat. Watch out for eating and drinking alfresco in La Ramblas - we met my in-laws and a couple of drinks each and 2 plates of tapas cost nearly 120 euros. I nearly fell off my chair!! On our last day we found a wonderful little eating place down by the port - as you face the water by Christopher Columbus it's in the side road on the left. Carry on past the corner place where tourists (like us) sit outside and pay \u00a35+ for 2 cokes. It is run by women who cook lovely stuff and at reasonable prices too. Sorry, can't remember the name but wished we'd found it on the first day. I would go back to Barcelona; it is a fabulous, vibrant city - full of life. I don't think it's somewhere I would choose to take children - it's a grown-up place with amazing architecture, particularly Gaudi. If we were there for longer, I'l like to have visited Dali's museum at Figueres, but this is nearer to Girona airport. I didn't know where to look when we walked back down the beach paddling in the waves towards Barceloneta - lots of naked people spread out sunbathing without a care in the world!!

Other reviews have mentioned the convenience of the Metro Stop 2 blocks away for getting around the city to see it sights, it also works well as a source for getting to the airport. It took about one hour to get from the hotel to the airport ticket counter. The cost was less than 2 Euros each. Their are elevators at both ends of the stops, and the one in between at the train station, that allow you to get to the Metro Platform/Train Platform without having to lug your luggage up and down stairs. The hotel personnel were extremely helpful in explaining the process/connections you need to make in using the combination Metro/Train to get to the airport. Obviously, you can do it in reverse too. Just communicate with the hotel staff before leaving on your trip and I am sure they can give you adequate directions in an email.. Although we starting using the Metro the last 2 days of our stay, initially we just wanted to walk above ground and see the city and all the vitality it has to offer.

With a stop at the Starbucks shortly after entering the Passe de Gracia Boulevard and gawking at the sights, it took us about an hour to get to the top of Las Rambla. You can walk a more diagonal and direct route in about 20-30 minutes through the neighborhood and get to Las Rambla too. Either way you decide to walk, there are many good eateries and cafes to stop at and rest. Initially, We suggest you walk as much as possible to places, for it is the best way to see the city. The neighborhoods around the Hotel offer many interesting areas to explore. After a few days and you're tired of walking, take the Metro to get around!! During our second day we took the Tourist Bus around the city, doing all 3 routes - Red, Blue & Green.- in one day (takes about 5-6 hours). The Hotel Staff will provide information. The stop for the primary routes (Red & Blue- each has their own, different location to board at the intersection described below) is 3 blocks from the Hotel at the tri-corner streets of Urgell (Hotel Street), Avinguda de Josep Tarradellas and Avinguda Diagonal. And, a Starbucks is right there if you have to wait long, which is seldom the case!! Also, there is a nice, rather elegant, and not too expensive restaurant around the corner from Starbucks, called \"Ginos:\" that is open at 7:30 P.M. for evening meals. At the above location you can catch whichever Bus Route has seats available on the open top deck first, then come back to the same stop in about 2 hours and catch the other route. To catch the Green Route along the shoreline, you'll need to get off and on the Blue Bus Route at certain points. The Hotel Staff is very helpful. They consist of young and older people, so whatever your age is I'm sure you'll find someone on the staff who can impart the age appropriate tourist information you seek! As other reviews have stated, the rooms and hotel facilities are a good bargain for the price. You could stay at regular or boutique hotel nearer the old part of the city for about the same, or higher price, and probably have less room/bathroom space, less newness/cleanliness, less sound proofing of the room and more street noise to deal with late at night. Also, the street life around this hotel may be less threatening late at night. Besides, you would never see the part of the city where this hotel is located and the interesting neighborhoods between the hotel and the old city as you walk back and forth!! If you book a hotel near Las Rambla you may never explore the other parts of the city. I've attached several photos to give you a sense of what the hotel looks like. It is very similar to the professional photos the hotel displays on their website.", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "auckland", "Title": "\u201cModern well priced hotel - but location is just OK\u201d", "Author": "specialk23", "ReviewID": "UR43675321", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights.

I\u2019d sum it up as old world class presented in a most pleasing minimalist style. Upon walking into the lobby area, one immediately knows, U232 is a hotel that pays great attention to detail. After a most taxing flight, I can\u2019t tell you how nice it was to sink down into one of the oversized leather couches which adorn the bar, all the while sipping away on one of the hotel\u2019s signature cocktails-what bliss! Of course one cannot mention the entrance to the hotel without paying tribute to the fantastic reception staff. From day one of our trip they went out of their way to attend to our every whim, even checking up bars we were interested in online for us. Knowing we had such helpful staff available helped us enjoy, all the more, our limited time in the city. Another feature not to miss in u232 is thier lounge area on the first floor.Here, amidst the opulant leather couches and old style mahogony furniture, one can lounge out in front of the flat screen tv. We loved to relax here after a long day sight-seeing and it was also a great way to meet and converse with other guests. Clearly after having seen the reception and lounge area we had high expections for the bedroom. Thankfully it surpassed them all! The classic old style minimalist interior we first enjoyed on the ground floor continued on into the bedrooms. Our room featured a very impressive super-king bed, aflat screen tv with English channels, a well-equipped mini-bar and of course complimentary wifi! The ensuite with it\u2019s shower enclosure (bigger than a double shower!) and black marble throughout was perfect for our stay. Also tribute must be made to the cleaning staff who ensured our bedroom remained immaculate during the course of our stay. Having read reviews of the hotel prior to our stay, we were slightly worried about the location of U232. However, these fears proved entirely unfounded. The hotel is situated only a stone\u2019s throw away from the \u201cHospital Clinic\u201d metro stop. Thus in a matter of minutes you can go anywhere simply by jumping on the train. We also walked to Las Ramblas, where many principal attractions are located in a mere 25 minutes. We actually loved being slightly out of the madness which is the center of Las Ramblas. We also found many bars and eateries around the hotel which we really enjoyed and which were more authentically Spanish than thier Las Ramblas counterparts, not to mention considerably cheaper. Try \u201cEl Sol\u201d bar which is located on the same block as the hotel for very cheap tapas, local beer and wine. It is ope until 3 am and is full of locals. Also the \u201cTapas Restaurent\u201d located right at the \u201cHospital Clinic\u201d metro stop (The Comte d\u2019 Urgell entrance) does the nicest Paella we tasted over the course of our trip. As you can tell I would whole-heartedly recommend for anyone to stay in U232. it deserves it\u2019s 4 star rating and more and was a fundamental reason we so enjoyed our time in Barcelona.

We were upgraded to a massive queen size bed, our room had a balcony looking out into a courtyard, and huge french doors. The window through to the bathroom that so many people have mentioned was quite unique!! we decided it was like a one way mirror you see in cop shows in an interrogation room. There is a venetian blind on it so it can be closed completely for privacy, or opened for questioning!!! The hotel is very comfortable, with lovely seating areas. The staff are superb, loads better than the staff all around the city, who we found a bit reluctant and surly. The hotel staff couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast, at 13 euro, is good but pricey. There's a small bakery, Dino Pan, two doors down. You can get gorgeous coffee and croissants there for about 2 euro, or there are other cafes within five mins walk as well. The hotel is in a lovely area, just ten mins walk through the Modernista district (Eixample) with the lovely architecture will take you to some great shopping areas. Or the metro stop Hospital Clinic is two blocks away (incidentally, the only bad food we had all wkend was in a restaurant at this metro stop called TAPASBAR, a glass fronted place - avoid at all costs). This hotel made a great base for our stay. Taxis are cheap, public transport is easy to access, and it's a quiet, relaxing home base.

The room (908) was absolutely fantastic. We loved the huge private balcony on a corner, with 180 degree views over the city.

The lobby is great for meeting people - a well-serviced bar and comfortable seats to wait for a friend. The rooms were excellent - very clean and comfortable - included a safe and robes, and even slippers, and the bathroom was nice and big and clean with plenty of space for a couple trying to get ready at the same time for a day's walking or a night out on the town! It was more luxurious than we expected and worth every penny. I left an item of clothing by accident in the room and didn't notice for a few days after I got home. I emailed the hotel, worried that i had seen the last of my favourite (and not cheap) piece of clothing and they followed up promptly, without drama, and they sent it to me safe and sound without issue, even though I was in a different country by then. They went the extra mile when they didn't have to and it pretty much summed up our experience when we stayed there. We found it easy to get around even though the hotel is not super central - the underground is only a few moments walk from the hotel and we used it every day to get to the sites we were visiting. So in effect, the location was really convenient as we would've had to pay a lot more for this standard of hotel if we wanted to stay in the centre of Barcelona. This was a real treat for tired travellers and well worth the stay. There's a great little tapas place not far from the hotel - gorgeous food but we recommend booking ahead if you want a table guaranteed.

Check out an amazing tapas bar in walking distance called Cerveseria Catalonia for the best tapas in town.

The standard rooms are just big enough to walk through and only one person at a time can enter the bathroom. We booked (and paid!) for a 3-person bedroom but all that actually exists is a two bed room with a soft couch, thus not a proper third bed. We were told the three bed rooms only faced the back of the builiding, which was about a meter away from the adjacent builiding, therefore letting absolutely no light in. Almost made claustrophobics of us; we ended up nicknaming our room the Bunker. There was no discussing for a change of type room without charge, and after about 10 minutes of exchanges, no solution was offered nor any compensation.
