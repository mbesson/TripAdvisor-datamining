I didn't get it either! The staff were wonderful in helping us explore Rome, however, the rooms were far too hot at night despite fans. Air-con is a must in Rome April-October! The location is a bit out but Tuscolana station is nearby (downhill there, uphill back, mind!) which links to Termini in a few minutes (services are quite frequent and mainly punctual) or Trastevere in the other direction (again, a fairly frequent and mainly punctual service) I would stay at the Lodi again if the price were VERY low and it wasn't so hot, but next time when in Rome I shall likely save up to afford somewhere a bit nicer.

But the owners offered us another drink so we sat in the sunny garden again & sipped coffee (again on the house). Lodi is a hard place to leave. On arriving at our 4 star hotel the busy receptionist took quite a few minutes to even acknowledge our presence. And this place costs over twice what we paid for Lodi.

I had no idea about the place before actually going there for the first time. I was going to stay in Rome for 6 months but I had no place to stay in the beginning so I started my journey in this wonderful place. It's not just a hostel. Right now I feel like I have a second home in Rome. As soon as you enter from the door you start to get the feeling that you know the people working there for quite some time. And once you get to know them you feel like you've been friends with them for ages. The thing that especially made me even more fond of this hostel was the consciousness of the staff about the security, cleanliness and comfort of the people staying there. I would definitely recommend this hostel to anyone who wishes to stay in a cosy clean hostel with full of wonderful people.

I was traveling with my three other friends for 16 days and Rome was one of our last stops. Everyone was tired when we got there. We spent a bit long time to find this hostel. Maybe a blinking sign would be helpful? Anyway, we finally got the hostel. It was ordinary from the door...I have to say. But we were specially welcomed by the beautiful staff Sara. She was so nice and talkative. I bet you will like her...oh....even love her. Other staff are all great. I bet there are the warmest hostel staff we met during the 16 days. She warmly tell us where we can find the nice Italian restaurants for 30mins....and also print the maps for us! She is always ready to help you. Of course, you can also find other staff are great. Environment and Rooms This location is perfect compared the all-graffitied city centre, also quite and maybe safe, except a bit far from the centre. But you can still get the centre in 30mins. The hostel itself is great. It has a garden. All of us like it. You can enjoy your breakfast or rest there. The downside is the seats are limited. But still you can stand in the garden, enjoy the sunshine or rains! The rooms are good. We booked a shared private room for four people. We slept well for three nights! Breakfast and food This hostel is supplied with nice breakfast. Two soft breads, one big bottle of juice and a pot of coffee (which you can choose from coco or other coffee drinks). The food is tasty and enough to fill your stomach. You need to prepare the lunch and supper yourself as it didn't supply any supper!

Cristiano took the time to go through a map of Rome, pointing out highlights and explaining the city's transport system. Throughout our stay nothing was too much trouble for any of the hotel's staff. A bottle opener and glasses arrived as if by magic and the delightful breakfast was served with a smile in the pretty garden attached to the hotel. The free internet access was very useful and the staff willingly printed out our vouchers for the Vatican despite it being half two in the morning!

Here are the pluses: It is relatively affordable. The rooms are reasonably clean and comfortable, if small and quite Spartan. But you don't come to Rome to spend time in your room. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel offers nice Italian breakfasts and internet access (not wifi, but actual computers, so you don't need a laptop.) Now for the negatives: The hotel faces a rather noisy street. The rooms don't have air conditioning, so if you don't want to dissolve in a pool of sweat on summer nights, you need to keep your window open. The street appears to be a side street on the map, but it is apparently part of a secret Roman shortcut between neighbhorhoods because it carries frequent traffic, including a lot of loud motorcycles and Vespas, well into the early morning hours. You have about a three-hour respite, and then the garbage truck arrives, followed by morning rush hour traffic. According to management, all double rooms face the street, so if you are traveling with a partner during the warmer months and are not used to loud street noise at night, this would not be the best place to get much sleep. Also, the hotel is a bit out of the way. It is a good 15-20 minute walk to the nearest Metro station, though there are a couple of convenient bus lines closer by. But almost none of the main sites are walkable. The silver lining to this is that you will experience a real Roman neighborhood that is not overrun by tourists.

We are a mixture of ages, from 10 to 68, on a very limited budget, and the Hotel Lodi fit the bill of being cheap but near the centre of Rome. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to San Giovani station which takes you only 3 stops to the central Termini station. We even walked one day to the Colleseum, with 2 senior citizens and we made it in about 30 minutes. The Hotel staff are what really make this hotel a winner. They are warm, freindly, helpful and thoughtful. for example, realising we would not have had a chance to organise a cake for my birthday, they brought one for me...and candles, to take to the restaurant. And it was a handmade delicious cake from a bakers, not from the supermarket. The hotel is part hostel, and I think this gives it a relaxed feeling. They had no issues with us making our own hot drinks in the kitchen, or using the lovely internet room to eat a chinese take away. The rooms are not 4 star but they are not bad. We did not have a private toilet as we thought, just a bidet, but that has its advantages when you are in a couple..lol. The beds are really really comfy, and they are spotlessly clean. My only gripe would be the noise of traffic if you have a double room at the front, but with some earplugs, or in our case tissue in the ears, we slept through it in the end. The back rooms, the quadruple and the triple, had no noise issues. This hotel is cheap, clean, friendly and in a great location. There is a handy spar a few minutes walk away from which we bought several lovely pack lunches, takeaway pizzas, handly little bakers, ice cream shops and restaurants nearby. Because these are not in the centre of Rome, they are more reasonably priced. I highly recommend the Hotel Lodi. It has a lovely garden where you can sit and have tea, and as I said before, the staff are wonderful! As for Rome, or Roma as I like to call it now...well it is better than I ever imagined.

I originally chose this hotel because of the good reviews it received on Trip Advisor, and because it was less expensive than other hotels I considered. I realized it was a little further away from the center of Rome than most other hotels, but I did not think I would mind that (and I didn\u2019t), and also the cost savings seemed to justify it. I must confess that our first impression of the hotel/hostel was not favorable, but as time passed, we grew to appreciate and enjoy Hotel Lodi, its staff, and the neighborhood. First, the week we stayed in Rome, it was unusually hot. We arrived at Termini at midmorning, took the metro to the San Giovanni station, exited the station, and then attempted to walk to the hotel by using the directions from the website which said to follow Via La Spezia from the station to the hotel. The only problem is that construction on Via La Spezia at the station hides the street from view. After walking around lost for several minutes, we finally found our way to Hotel Lodi, but it took us 45 minutes to make what should be a 10 to 15 minute trip. Also, the neighborhood is what I would describe as \u201cworking class\u201d with graffiti painted everywhere (And I mean everywhere. We came to find out that this is very common all over Rome and to us, a real shame.) When we finally arrived at the hotel, hot and tired from our trip, and not overly impressed with the neighborhood, we discovered that the hotel was not air conditioned. In May, this would not normally be a concern, but again, it was unusually hot that week. Not a good start. We put our bags in our three-bed, four-person room with private bath and immediately headed out to see the city, this time catching the bus at the stop on La Spezia back to the metro station at San Giovanni. When we returned to the hotel later that evening, we had difficulty sleeping because we were not used to the street noise, which while not horrible, even the sound of one motorcycle every 10 minutes was enough to keep us awake (remember, no air conditioning, so the windows had to be left open). But, the sun rose in the morning, and a new day began. We had breakfast in the picturesque little garden, and were served by a charming young lady. Breakfast consisted of juice, coffee, and a basket of croissants and white bread, with butter and jam. We began to get to know our two gracious hosts, Toni and Fabrizio. They could not have been nicer or more helpful during our stay. They really made an effort to ensure their guests were taken care of. Toni recommended a restaurant, La Viletta, right around the corner from the hotel for dinner. La Viletta turned out to be one of our favorite restaurants during our two week vacation in Italy (we ate there twice). In fact, we agreed that it was probably our most authentic Italian dining experience. Back to the hotel\u2026our room was clean, and two computers with free internet service were available to the guests as was a refrigerator in the kitchen. We also grew to like the neighborhood. One morning we strolled from the hotel to a clothing street market (our best shopping experience in Italy) that Toni recommended. The market was located across from the metro station at San Giovanni. Along the way, we visited a neighborhood food market located on a side street from La Spezzia. Very Italian. Also, I think one of the good things about staying away from the center of Rome is that you get to experience how normal Romans live, and you also are not subject to all of the thieves and pick-pocketers that frequent the busy tourist areas of the city. So, all in all we had a very good experience at Hotel Lodi. The only reason that might cause us to not return, at least in the summer time, is the lack of air conditioning. But, if that is not important to you, I would think you would thoroughly enjoy Hotel Lodi and its wonderful staff.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poland", "Title": "\u201csleep zen wake up a touirst - great place to chill after day of sightseeing\u201d", "Author": "pjupju", "ReviewID": "UR30944751", "Content": "1) it is not and in a center and it is a great PLUS!

The breakfast is excellent and served in the beautiful garden. Bread baked that day, a selection of jams and spreads plus, juice, mega fresh croissants and delicous latte coffee (or cappucino), just right to set you up for the day. The hotel is not in the city center but it is easily accessed by the train network. The nearest station is about ten minutes walk away. When we stayed last week, it was a bit difficult to find due to the ongoing building works near the station, so I would recommend that you take a map, however once you have done the journey once, it is very easy to get your whereabouts. 3 day train/bus tickets are available from nearby Tobacconists or the station at a bargain \u20ac11. The hotel is situated in a very nice area and it is safe. We found a very cool bar where you can have a drink on the terrace and a truly Italian bite to eat. It is called Goodfellows but is only signed in Italian (Quei Bravi Ragazzi), It is next to a chinese restaurant and opposite a park just around the corner from the Lodi. It is full of locals and the staff are great (even though we spoke pathetic Italian!!). Beppe and the owner Davide made us feel very welcome.

Having the staff as a resource at the Hotel Lodi was invaluable to me as a woman travelling alone in an unfamiliar city. I immediately relaxed when I walked in the door and was greeted with an offer of grapefruit juice from the backyard tree. My room (a shared dorm) was clean, comfortable and fresh, and there was a large (clean!!) bathroom. I also appreciated the closet-like lockers available for free use (hard to find such spacious storage in any hostel). Another plus was the free internet provided for guest use in the relaxing lobby, attached to a garden, which was the perfect place to mix and mingle with other guests. Not only were the facilities excellent, the staff was also an amazing, friendly resource for me. I was welcomed with smiles and kind words, something that I had felt lacking in other parts of Rome. They take care to ensure that all guests are safe, happy, and comfortable, and are also extremely conversational and friendly. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Rome, and this was only because I chose the perfect place to stay. Thank you those at Hotel Lodi for your kindness, I will never forget you! Sophie T.

A big thanks to Ali for making me feel very welcome when I arrived. Before I arrived at the hotel, Ali sent me a detailed email explaining how to get from the train station to the hotel even marking out which stop I should get off at. Upon my arrival, Ali gave me a good explanation about the city of Rome and also told me which buses, metro, etc., I should take. Even in the morning, he was still very kind. I also appreciated Ali making me a \u201cLOVELY\u201d cup of tea on the Friday night and for suggesting that I leave my luggage in the reception area on the Saturday when I was leaving. As it was raining for most of the day, I was truly grateful. Ali has a very kind personality; nothing seems to be too much trouble for him. My room was very cosy and was fine for me although the traffic noise did disturb my sleep a little but all in all for the price I paid, it was super value for money. It is a bit outside of Rome but it's only about 10-15 minutes on the bus which stops at the Colesseum and also by the Via del Corso (the main shopping thoroghfare of Rome) - near the Trevi Fountain. The free use of the internet was lovely and I enjoyed meeting the young people in the meeting room and hearing about their travels around Europe. Breakfast was included; if a bit of cereal could be added to it, that would be great for me otherwise it was really nice. I would also like to thank Fabrizio for fixing my TV and for also leaving me some beautiful flowers in my room. As I explained to Ali, I did think of taking the flowers with me on the flight to remind me of the hotel but I was worried that they might get spoilt so I thought that it might be nice to leave them for the next resident to enjoy. After Ali paying me such a wonderful compliment about my age and personality, I will just have to return to the hotel. I walked around Rome with a big smile on my face all day. Ali, you are a real credit to your country and to your own family. I hope your studies go well. Fabrizio and Ali deserve the hotel/hostel to succeed because they are making such an effort to make things go well for all of your clientele. If you stay at Hotel Lodi, you have to appreciate that there will also be backpackers staying there also so please be aware of that fact. It didn't bother me because I enjoyed chatting to them. Also, thanks very much to Mariella for the breakfast and for cleaning my room so well.

We stayed in the hostel at the Hotel Lodi and found that the kitchen there had everything we needed. The whole place is quite homey (again we emphasize the staff's role in making it so), but seeing as the only lounging area is in the outside garden we don't recommend staying there all day long.

The rooms are typical of an old Roman house, but clean and quiet at night. Internet access is provided in the room and in the hotel lobby. On your arrival Mr. Fabrizio would speak no stop for 30 min on travel tips in Rome. If you find it hard to remember all the tips, just hop onto Bus 81 which brings you to Colosseo, Piazza Venezia and Piazza Navona and Vatican city. It is far more convenient than taking the underground train. But of course, Mr. Fabrizio would later tell you that he has mentioned all the tips.
