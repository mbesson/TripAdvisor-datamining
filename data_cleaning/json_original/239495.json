To be fair the room was clean and the bed comfortable - and although the mildew smell from the bathroom permeated the room there was no visible sign of it. As noted in the photos, the common areas are appealing enough, however the furnishings of the individual rooms are somewhat worn and tired. The biggest problem was one I had not even anticipated. To air and cool the room we opened our window; however since there were no window-screens, we were swarmed with mosquitoes. When I explained the problem and requested the use of the advertised air conditioner so we could sleep, I was told it was \u201cnot possible\u201d and so we sweltered, aggravating the many, many hot, red welts across our arms and legs.

I asked the next day and again was told it would be fixed the next day. Yesterday, I had them show me the router and cables. No wireless router, even though they said they did have one. The cabling to the computer is exposed and runs along a power line. This causes the router to fail. I showed them how to power down and power up the router. It fixed the problem for now. The computer is running an old version of the browser. The keyboard is Italian. No way to type the \"at\" sign in an email address. Very friendly people though. They just do not want to give you an answer that you might disagree with. The hotel is up an alley. The alley seems to be a pissing ground for the locals.

The breakfast was simple but quite adequate - croissants, cheese, ham, cereals, fruits, yogurts, as well as a cappuccino made for each person who wanted one.

The small TV had a satellite feed, including one English station, CNN. The bathroom radiator was also the towel rack (thus the \"heated towel rack\" that some people refer to), and the bathroom was completely modern, with usual facilities, incl. a shower with plentiful hot water. I do wish that the very firm bed was slightly softer, but that's a small point. I enjoyed the fridge (altho' I didn't buy anything from the mini-bar), the safe, and the lovely, large windows that let in such great light but which could be completely covered and darkened for a quick afternoon nap.

Just walk south along the river for about 15 mins. You have to walk along the side of the river to get pretty much anywhere so during the day it's nice to use the steps down to the lower embankment and get away from the traffic.

Breakfast was adquate. rolls, croissants preserves, boiled eggs done at 7.00 so cold by 9.30! cold meat, cake so good choice. Get the younger guy to make your cappuccino, his is the best.
