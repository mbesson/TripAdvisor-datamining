{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Functional Business Hotel / Good Location It is not very difficult to find a business hotel in Tokyo, but it is also very easy to stay in an over-priced, noisy, cramped and scruffy one. The Park Hotel is none of the above. It is not 4-star, the rooms are functional, tidy and small, but the price and location make this hotel an acceptable place to stay. My favourite aspect of the hotel is the location, a 10 minute walk to Shinjuku Station South Exit and just a few minutes down from Takashimaya Department store. It also benefits from being in a quieter part of Shinjuku, away from the bar/nightlife district, but still within a gentle 10-15 minute walk to that entertainment hub. I passed eating at the hotel's restaurants as next door is a coffee shop offering a fine breakfast combo and in the evening it is much better to wander off into Shinjuku and find one of 1000s of different places to eat/drink. The hotel is nothing out of the ordinary, but in many ways that is exactly what people who wish to stay in an inexpensive, clean and quiet business hotel will be looking for. In this regard, the Park Hotel is just fine.", "Date": "Nov 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR547236664", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "blue13"}, {"Content": "Not bad Booked this hotel through asiarooms.com and got a great deal. The hotel was difficult to locate as many locals have no idea where it is. But it is a known hotel as it shows up on a few maps. Make sure you take the appropriate exit (east exit) from the Shinjuku station. You'll know you're close when you go past the Takyashmaya (sp?) department store.Staff was very friendly but spoke little english. My room was ok albeit small. One major negative was that my washroom smelt a bit like urine. Not disguestingly so, but enough to annoy me.I didn't have the free breakfast because I either left too early or too late for it. Overall, not bad value for being near the heart of the city. If you're willing to pay for more, you'll get nicer though. I spent about C$ 90 a nite there.", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR769486264", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "omnipotent"}, {"Content": "A great little find This place is a great little find (mind you, it is also the only hotel I have ever stayed in, in Tokyo)Just 150 Meters from where the action happens in Shinjuku, it is set down the road a little, in a quieter area  close to both the train station and main bus station.A great breakfast (Western for 600, Japanese for 850 JPY), clean, small but cosy. I wouldnt hesiatate to recommend it if you are looking for a single room around the 8,500 JPY mark.To find your way, take the New South Exit from Shinjuku Train station, head for the large Takayashima building then keep heading that direction for another 50 or so meters. It is between Takayashima and the big Clock Tower building (you'll know it when you see it).", "Date": "Apr 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR368440489", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MichaelW_2000"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d649204-r21861136-Shinjuku_Park_Hotel-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "649204", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
