We had an excellent stay. We had a 2-bedroom lockoff oceanview that faced the public park and ocean. Having the 2-bedroom lockoff was fantastic because we had the full kitchen with plenty of space to entertain everyone in the 1-bedroom because of the full deck. The studio side was great for the parents to have their own retreat. This was my first time to this particular Westin property and thought it was great. I've been to the Westin Maui several times and really enjoy that property too. The mid-week cleaning didn't occur on the day we were told but a \"reminder\" phone call was enough to prompt them for the next day. It wasn't a big deal but definately out of the norm for a Westin property.

First two were four star +. The third was our last stay. It took 8 tries to get room card keys that worked; then it went down hill from there. Flight was late getting in and by the time we finally got keys to our room, we were ready to crash. Got up and went to breakfast. When we returned to our room, we noticed a strange chemical smell - something like turpentine or laquer thinner. Front desk sent Security to check it out; yes, Security -- not Housekeeping, not Maintenance. We were told to go about our day and it would be fixed by the time we got back. Inconvenient; we had planned on spending the day, reading, relaxing, and swimming; i.e., we had not planned on leaving the resort. Returned to the same smell. Front desk explained that, although some persons from housekeeping and maintenance noticed the smell, there was no agreement regarding what it might be. So, they decided to try to \"ionize\" the room and hope it would take care of the problem. Front desk eventually found an alternate room for us. The room seemed to be OK although there was a slight musty smell even though the windows and lanai doors were open. Next day; same problem. We awoke with headaches and the smell of turpentine. Returned to front desk. Front desk claims there is no notes in our records indicating a prior problem. They offer to send Housekeeping to check out the situation. We wait for Housekeeping (for 2 hours). Housekeeping arrives; they offer to \"spray\" and/or put the \"ionizer\" in the room -- but, ionizer requires that we leave the room for 8-10 hours. Fortunately, we have an outting planned so the 8-10 hours fits our schedule. We return to a room with all of the windows and lanai doors open (not exactly a \"secure\" environment for our belongings); but at least there is no noticeable odor. Next morning, same headaches, same odor. Front desk tells me there is no record of any problem or complaint in our file. We insist that Housekeeping and Maintenance be sent to our room. Maintenance shows up in 45 minutes; housekeeping takes 2 hours again. We go into the room with both representatives; one says \"chemical smell ... not paint based ... but definitely chemical\", the other says \"not chemical ... more like something is rotting ... fruit or something that was sweet\". They send us to the front desk to see if there is a different room. On our way, we pass an area where painters are spray painting some doors or other larger items. When I get to the front desk, I'm told that there is nothing in our records about any problems and that the resort is completely full. I ask for a manager. She asks me what the problem is; I replay our experience thus far over 3 days -- and I mention the painters working on another building. She asks me where my room is at and where the painters are. Then she goes and gets a map and shows me that my room is not near where I say the painters are so therefore whatever I smell is not a result of the painters work on the resort. I reply that I don't really care what the cause is, that I just want a room that does not have a chemical smell and that does not give me a headache from breathing whatever is in the room. She tells me that I am \"mistaken\" and that there is nothing wrong with the room I am in. She then asks what I would like her to do. I ask her to go to my room and smell it for herself -- and to talk to the 4 housekeeping staff, 3 maintenance personnel, 2 security personnel, and 1 conceirge representative who had gathered in the room -- all but 1 of whom detected a strange odor but could not agree on what it might be. The \"Front Desk Manager\" gave me a disgusted look, then got up and walked away without saying a word and without taking any action to try to resolve the issue.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sherwood Park, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "cuddles521", "ReviewID": "UR125906211", "Content": "My husband and I spent two weeks at the villas in January. This is a beautiful ocean front property with nicely furnished rooms. Even though we stayed in a efficient suite we had a kitchen, large bathroom with jacczzi tub and separate shower, king size bed, safe and washer/dryer in room. Beds are most comfortable and their bedding is heavenly. Guest service is fabulous. They are friendly, courteous, professional and very accommodating. We were assigned a room without a liani and they went out of their way to get us a room with one. When we go to Hawaii we want to spend our time outside as much as possible and morning coffee and evening wind down is just perfect on a liani. There are suites that do not have them and that is a shame. Bouquet goes out to Stephanie who found us a room with a beach and ocean view. The next week we had to move and this was a bit difficult to accommodate us because they were painting part of the resort.. They did find us a suite with a liani that had a mountain view. This was closer to the highway and prone to more road noise. Did not mine the road noise as much as the noise that the shuttle buses made. All in all noise is noise and we enjoyed sitting on the liani and enjoyed the Hawaii terrain and air. Shuttle bus service is great and one really does not need to rent a car if you are staying around the resort. The shuttle goes to three Starwood properties, Whalers Village, Safeway and right into Lahania town. This is just wonderful. Enjoyed the swimming pools, beach and the boardwalk that connects all the Kaanapali properties. The boardwalk is great for a run or leisurly walk . We even walked the opposite way to the supermarket \"Times\" for the extra exercise and to pick up a bottle of wine and some groceries. Whale watching was great and we even had a monk seal beached one day. Enviromental people sealed the area off and watched it until the tide took it back into the ocean. One can rent kayaks and paddle boards at the beach and on fridays they sit up a big tent and the locals come and displace their crafts. Resort is beauitfully maintained inside and throughout the grounds. Everyone goes out of their way to be friendly. Spent time at this resort before and will definitely come here again.

First off, the \"room\" was huge! Sure our view was of the parking lot but who cares when you have a full kitchen, washer/dryer and a spacious bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi? It was very clean and everything looked brand-new even though we were supposedly in one of the older buildings, number 4. Our toddler loved playing in the jacuzzi every night and we loved having a fridge at our disposal. It was great to have so much space to ourselves, which made it very easy to relax. The location was also wonderful, very close to Lahaina for shopping and Napili (and of course Kaanapali) for swimming. The resort offers a shuttle to Lahaina but you will probably have a car and can get there quicker by driving. We've never had a problem finding street parking in Lahaina so found it easier to drive ourselves instead of having to wait for a shuttle. What I really liked was being right across the street from the Sugar Cane Train depot. Now the train itself is overpriced but if you have a kid who loves trains, the attraction is priceless. It was very easy to walk over and hop on the train for a ride to Lahaina and back. There is also a little farmers market at the depot that sells fruits and shave ice, also overpriced, but may be worth checking out for some. The grounds were spacious and my husband did say he didn't like all the walking but I enjoyed how much there was to see. The main pool and slide were a real treat although our son was too young to ride on it. No matter, the pirate ship pool with nearby playground was perfect for him. I really liked how there were several shallow baby pools besides that that he could safely play in too. The beach was also great for kids, with wonderfully textured sand to play in and calm waters in which to frolic. I saw there were stacks of chairs and umbrellas on the beach but didn't see any attendants nearby for set up. Are you supposed to go all the way back to the pool area to ask for that service? That does remind me that service was a bit lacking here. Most of the staff could use a refresher course in Aloha 101. While the room attendants and valet were courteous, the pool attendants were almost flippant and the front desk staff very impersonal and unhelpful. The concierge were hit or miss and while they do give you a nice welcome gift (for us, a reusable shopping tote, very helpful as Maui County has a plastic bag ban), they will also ask you to attend a timeshare presentation. However, a simple \"No, thank you\" will get them off your back; I was afraid they'd be more pushy. I'd read some reviews from couples who were disappointed by the lack of romantic atmosphere and turned off from all the \"screaming\" kids. While I encountered lots of kids while there, they all seemed very well behaved and I found the area quiet as a whole. Our room seemed especially quiet; I didn't even realize we had neighbors till we were all checking out on the last day. So maybe all the children around is not ideal for a romantic getaway but this was certainly the place for a family vacation.

Sadly, I would have rather paid $800 more and stayed at the Marriott for a room with no view. Here is why... Kids pirate pool is nice. But it's tucked away from the from the main pool and it's not a short walk either as the property is huge. No view from here. Just a pirate pool in between some buildings. At the Marriott, the pirate pool was next to the beach and the other pools, it was connected. No special trip to go to the pirate pool. Ashame, because of this we only used it once here at the Westin. The mariott was close to whalers village. A 10 minute romantic beautiful stroll down the beach walk. The Westin is not walking distance. You got to drive and pay parking. The beach at the westin is top notch but the resort is not right on the beach. There is a small green buffer area separating the hotel from the beach. The marriott was right smack on the beach. The pool at the Westin is smallish compared to Marriotts mega pool. There is a BBQ area overlooking the ocean but it's quite far from the rooms. The Marriott had a BBQ at every picnic table rather than several bbq station.

My family has been coming to Maui since the early eighties. We originally stayed at The Kaanapali Alii until the first Westin Resort Villas opened. We have a 2 bedroom in both north and south villas. Although this timeshare is not as intimate as the Alii, we enjoy every amenity the KORV has to offer. This year we stayed 4 weeks. Jan. 6th to Feb. 3rd. We stayed in studios 2417 (2 weeks) 5605 & 3612. Front desk staff are professional and full of aloha spirit. Each time we walked thru the lobbies the staff were always smiling and pleasant. People who complain about THIS staff must have walked in with a chip on their shoulders to start with. They are awesome. We needed to move several times, which yes, is annoying. However, we understand because you are able to call exactly one year in advance of your reservation. That means if you are spending several weeks, you have to call the 1st week, then put in a request to automatically be reserved for the following week. You are able to put in a request for a certain building, or a certain floor, but you are not guaranteed that you'll get it. The best group of guys are the bell staff. Every one of them are friendly, fast and efficient. When we first got to the Westin, we were loaded up with cases of wine and groceries. These guys had our luggage and everything loaded onto a cart and beat us to our room! Give them a BIG, well deserved gratuity. Sometimes they will pass on a special percentage off a restaurant. As in our case, we got free hula pies at Kimo's. The studios are spacious. We used the little kitchenette alot and it is stocked with most of the things you need. We love using the BBQ grills. We never had to wait for a grill, and they were cleaned every day. We met alot of fun people. One guy had caught an ahi one morning, and brought a big platter of it down and shared with us. The beds are true to the Westin \"heavenly\" promise. I prefer no down pillows or comforter. Just ask and they will give you down substitutes. Although we had a rental car for the month, we made use of the shuttle service at least 2 or 3 times a week. The shuttle takes you to the Westin resort (south of the villas) the Sheraton, and 3 stops in Lahaina. They run from I believe 10 am to after 10 pm. Be sure to tip the driver. They appreciate it. Here is a breakdown of this years stay: (Suite numbers break down to blg#, floor#, room#) Room 2417: (Blg 2, 4th floor, room 17.) South Complex. Ocean view. Good location, right next to the foyer/elevator. It overlooks the main pool area. Note the sun shines most of the day on your room. The pool can get noisy, but never bothered us. Blg 2 has full refrigerators, a plus. Room 5605: North Complex Awesome corner suite! Ocean front. Had a window over the tub area and beautiful views. LOVED this room! Con: A maze to get from lobby to room. Long way from the BBQ grills. The view made it an easy trade. Room 3612: South Complex Room was clean. Faced the jacuzzi as well as the Ocean Bar and Grill. Noisy. Very early morning heard carts rumbling and dishes tinkling. Blg 3 has small dorm sized refrigerators. Blg 3 facing south is nice. It looks over the park. Internet was fast. Room service speedy. A phone call gets your trash emptied, towels replenished, reservations made. The cleaning staff for the rooms, hallways, the groundskeepers, pool shack guys.. everyone who needs to make the wheel turn, were so nice and we always made sure to say aloha to them. They work hard. Acknowledge them. It may make their day. Observations: Smokers. They can smoke on the balconies. Lounge chair hogs: They are at every resort. Pool Servers: Sorry to say, most were spotty and slow. Prices: We think the prices are fair for a resort. Food: Average. Ticked I wanted a kid burger and they said no. Of note: Whale watch on a raft with Pacific Whale Foundation at sunrise. Duke's, Seahouse, for Happy Hour. Betty's for Lobster: $13.95 (Wednesdays) also lobster benedict. (oh) Also, you can watch Feast of Lele for free, as Betty's is directly behind the show! Pacific O for lunch. Beachfront. Mixed Plate Lahaina. Beachfront. Cheap. Great food. Westin Resort @ Tropica for Sunday brunch. Oceanfront. Lulu's Surf Club by Safeway. Good breakfast, pool tables. Fun evenings. There are no plastic bags allowed on Maui. Bring your recycled bags. Take the trail from Ritz Carlton to D.C. Fleming beach. Beautiful. Roy's is moving to the Kaanapali Golf Course on Kaanapali Parkway. Finally final note: Thank you to Sulin Aipa for your making things right this year. You are a godsend.

The valet employee quickly checked for us and informed us that we were staying at the North Villas, so we went there. We were greeted by Tosh with a big smile and he quickly went to work loading up all of our groceries we had purchased as well as our luggage while we checked in. We were in our room barely 5 minutes when Moo knocked on our door to deliver our luggage and groceries. Moo was extremely helpful, putting away groceries, filling us in with information about the property, giving us tips about things to do, just a very kind man. We booked an island view studio so I was kind of expecting to look over the parking lot but to my surprise we were placed in building 5, fifth floor overlooking the kids (pirate ship) pool.

The outdoor BBQ's are a great addition to vacation cooking, we used the BBQ's 3-4 times during our 7 day stay and it was perfect. The property is very well taken care of, extremely clean, well manicured lawns, just a beautiful setting.

We signed up for an outrigger canoe trip through the concierge and it was awesome! Guides were extremely friendly, we left right from our beach so no need to drive to our excursion. We saw many many whales on our canoe trip, got close to a few, but not too close! The whales were extremely active during our entire trip, in fact, the day before we left we were treated to a very up close encounter when two smaller whales made their way extremely close to shore. They casually swam by us in very shallow water approximately 20-30 feet off the beach, very unusual and it was a bit concerning for many people as they thought they may beach themselves, but they didn't, they just swam by very slowly and gave everyone some great picture and video shots!

Later that week we went out whale watching and got much closer. We did not have an ocean view from our room more of an \"island side\" view but the inside of the suite was well appointed, quiet and we made many of our meals there. Being in Kaanapali made it tough to get to the East side of the island and back in a day but we did it and although our time was limited the sights and side trips on the \"Road to Hana\" were spectacular. The Westin is well situated to take in all the activities on the island's West side. Next time we go back it will be to the Westin for sure but maybe an extra day to stay on the East side to do more hiking.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMassive resort\u201d", "Author": "Norcalrjg", "ReviewID": "UR124328196", "Content": "Stayed in a one bedroom ocean view suite in late January.

We've stayed in these villas before, but our unit during an earlier stay didn't have much of a view- this one was terrific. The unit itself was what we expected: clean, well-furnished, and convenient with the appliances. A friend stayed in the studio side of the villa and was very pleased with the room and facilities. We did not have much noise from others, except once being able to hear people talking in the bathroom of the villa next to us. Service was very good. Since we were out golfing every day, we didn't make much use of the restaurants. We did go to the sports bar a couple times- the hamburgers were pretty good. No fries, though, which are always a nice/guilty treat after golfing! We used the valet parking- great service. We want to give very special recognition to Toshi. He managed to handle 3 large golf travel bags and 5 suitcases with ease- from getting them from our rooms to loading them in the mid-size SUV.

We decided to get lounge chairs at Costco for the beach (which was worth it) and snorkels (which was not worth it -- you can rent snorkels for $35 for the week at the Westin; the adult snorkels were $42 at Costco). The Westin property is split into a North property (newer and all rooms have an outdoor lanai) and the South property (older and basic rooms don't have outdoor space), which each have seperate reception and parking areas. I would call the day before you arrive to determine if your room is in the North or South property, as we parked and dragged our stuff to the South reception, only to be told we were due at the North reception. Not a big deal, but would have been nice to know. The room itself was large and the property was well maintained, though be advised that because its a timeshare property, the rooms don't get cleaned everyday. There are a number of different pools and lots of kids, though the large group of lounge chairs closest to the beach by the restaurant/bar seemed to be the quietest with the best sun. My one complaint would be the lounge chairs themselves, which were very uncomfortable. We ate at the restaurant on the property, which had large portions and was generally good, but I'd also recommend walking up the beach boardwalk (its lit all the way) about 8 minutes to the Duke's restaurant, which had great seafood and a nice bar.

That has been added since our visit in April 2011. Seems a few basketball hoops have been mounted along the side of several of the pools. Also nice to have options while enjoying the pools.

Our room had no view but we weren't too upset, we weren't in Hawaii to sit inside. The room was facing the main driveway into the resort and toward the highway but the windows provide complete silence. There was ZERO hallway noise as there is a main door to two separate suites blocking any noise you might get. The room was well-appointed with everything a small family could need for a week at the beach. I cannot tell you enough how handy the washer & dryer are when you are swimming and playing all day with kids! Tip the housekeeping staff to ensure well-stocked sundries. The only issue we had was the set-up with the washroom. It is divided between the bedroom with slated french doors and when one uses the washroom in the night, there is only one main light for the room which wakes everyone up. The toilet is in a separate room but it all runs on the same light for the entire washroom. We stocked the kitchen and used it to its' fullest potential. From the Westin & Sheraton there is a free shuttle that will take you to Lahaina (the driver will tell drop you off right at a supermarket) and you can shop reasonably to stock your kitchen. There is also a small fruit market directly across the highway from the resort - we bought a pineapple at day! The small shop in the South tower is well stocked but totally overpriced. This is where you can get your lattes in the morning (small line-up...expensive). We never rented a car while here - the shuttle took us everywhere we needed/wanted to go and it is free (tip the drivers). The pools are great, the pool bar at the South Tower is friendly and the happy hour decent enough but the food is only mediocre however the breakfast buffet is worth it. Eat late and it lasts you most of the day! Use the public BBQ if you can - great dinner al fresco. Bring your own snorkle gear! Trust me on this one. We brought ours and the best snorkeling in Maui is directly off the resort's main beach. Black Rock has nothing on the snorkeling here but to rent is ridiculously expensive! You get towel \"cards\" at the front desk and you exchange your towels daily - if you lose a towel its' $15. We tried to book a trip with a concierge (they are everywhere!) but when I thought I was asking questions, he thought he was booking and a family catamaran trip came to over $540 and I was presented a bill. When I explained the misunderstanding he got snotty and gave me real attitude. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Check the public notice boards for all the free things - Lei making - Ukelele lessons - Snuba lessons. Well worth it and a great experience. The Pulehu restaurant is nice, great ambiance, good food but totally overpriced for a place with paper napkins. Make a reservation. If you are a runner - get up early and run the boardwalk South through all the other hotels and you can make your way to Whaler's Village and back. It is a windy, indirect path but keep the water to your right and you will be fine.

The check in process was seamless. all through my stay I found the personnel in the lobby area friendly and eager to help, whether it was to simply answer a question, provide directions, or to discuss activities for the week. The rooms are well planned, clean and have all that one needs to vacation: a huge kitchen in the 1 bedroom, with a slightly smaller one in the studio; a washer and dryer in both; a lovely balcony facing the pool and courtyard with a limited view of the ocean from where I was located; very comfortable beds; fabulous shower and tub in a huge bathroom. There is once a week maid service to freshen the room and provide clean linens. The grounds are magnificent with beautiful flowers and trees, a well-manicured lawn area, playground space for young children and the beach and ocean just a few feet from the hotel. There are restaurants on the grounds to satisfy ones needs: the Ocean Pool Bar and Grill is located poolside between the two South towers and is easy for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Pailolo Bar and Grill is located in the North Towers area near a pool; The Pulehu Italian Grill and Cafe sports an outstanding Italian menu and seems to be busy everynight. I came in one night after having eaten in Lahaina and wanted some of their sorbet. There was a long line waiting, but when I told the hostess what I wanted and that I was alone, she accommodated me within minutes. (I was dressed nicely, not in shorts and a T-Shirt like many who were waiting. I have to believe that had something to do with the quick service, as this is a restaurant where one should not come in from the beach or trekking all day and expect to eat.) It was the best sorbet I have had! In addition, there is the General Store and the market where one can buy limited food items as well as sundries and souvenirs. There are programs for everyone at the Westin! Many programs are designed specifically for children, while others appeal to adults only and then for all ages. There was ample room for all programs to be held with out infringing on the space of others. Free shuttle service is provided to the other Starwood properties on the island, to Whaler's Village and to Lahaina, the Cannery and Hilo Hatties. Being an owner, I chatted with the sales staff about the property and the options available. There is no high pressure and they are there to serve.

Everything is expensive in Maui, so just know that on the front end and expect it.

They do have 2 separate check-in areas, with a lot of redundant services, but everything flows together seamlessly.

There were 3 of us. We had an ocean view but could also see a fenced off piece of undeveloped land btwn the Westin and Honua Kai and could hear some road noise when on the lanai. We were fine with this, but just letting you know in case you book into the far side of bldg 8. Also, you need to park in a parking garage in bldg 6 and walk past the pools and a BBQ area to get to bldg 8. The property is very nice. Great amenities in the condos and at the resort. FYI, the condo has a cooktop but no oven and the lanai was quite small. I think the most important consideration in whether to pick this property is location. We found it to be extremely windy. We've stayed at other properties along Kaanapali Beach and really think the further north you get, the windier it is. We stayed at the resort beach and pools a couple of days but it was very windy and drizzly. We decided to go down to Wailea area beaches and had great weather the days down there. So, if you like to venture out most days and see the great Maui sights and beaches then the Westin is a great property.

They also feature a kids' pirate pool and playground as well as a slide and a wading pool. The hotel is located directly on the beach just north of Black Rock and the popular shopping area, Whaler's Village.

The beach in front of the hotel offers some of the best snorkeling I have experienced. As a guest, you are able to rent beach chairs and umbrellas. I actually preferred this beach to the more populated one by the resorts near Whaler's Village which can get very crowded. The rooms: The rooms are 1 bedroom condos equipped with a full kitchen and washer/dryer (life savers when you have a kid.) There is a relaxing balcony to enjoy as well. If you require it, the hotel offers a crib, high chair and even a diaper genie! Although this my not be important to many, the bathroom has 2 entries which is great when you don't want to disturb the kids. The staff: The staff are only so so. Nothing bad to report but they are simply not very prompt or helpful. We kept receiving calls daily about a technician wanting to enter our room to install a new router (why now? Why not wait until we check out?). We would give them a time and they would never show. But without a doubt they would call when the baby was napping asking to install yet again. Housekeeping was fine but we had to forgo it one day since they did not show up during the 4 hours we were out and when we returned the baby needed her nap.

We were here for a week at the end of October/beginning of November. We stayed at the Marriott Maui Ocean Club last year, so we had that experience to compare it to. The Westin Resort Villas are located on the other (north) side of Black Rock, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit more secluded. The Westin hotel is actually located on the Kaanapali strip adjacent to the other hotels. Overall, I was impressed with the villas property and location. We were upgraded to an ocean front room, so the view overlooked the pool and was very close to the ocean. We got great views of the sunrise and sunset every day. The pool is nice, but it gets crowded; this was really my only complaint. We thought we would avoid this because we went during the off season, but one of the pool attendants told us the property stays busy year round. I remember looking around at night and every room was occupied (It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really too much of a problem though because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend all day every day at the resort). People do get up at 6am and reserve pool chairs for the whole day, which is annoying. We never had this issue at Marriott. Also you cannot move the pool chairs onto the green grass adjacent to the pool bar; which you could do at the Marriott (Marriott actually positions their pool recliners on the grass). I liked being on the grass because you could actually have some space from the people next to you and you can avoid the hot cement. However one of the pool attendants asked me to move my chair back to the concrete, so just be aware that seating selection is not that great. The beach, however is awesome. The water feels amazing and there is a ton of amazing snorkeling right off the shore. The beach is also a nice and close walk and not a trek which is perfect. Parking is not actually that bad; it is close to the buildings and we could always find a spot. The rooms are also really nice and spacious; the walls are thick so we did not hear our neighbors at all. We could however hear people down at the pool in the early morning. I also liked that the property is just the right size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is not too big as to be overwhelming, but not too small either.

As soon as we got there we were disappointed to learn the villas were NOT located next to The Westin Resort which has the best location in Ka'anapali. Anyway, that is our fault for not doing enough research. THE GOOD: * Room - we stayed at the smallest room (the studio) and it was very roomy, clean and modern. Also, it has a kitchen which comes very handy if you want to save money by at least eating breakfast in your room. The rooms are also very quiet since there is an extra door separating them from the hallway. I just wished the studios had a balcony, but they don't. * Service - except for the bartender and one of the servers, the service was very good everywhere. Employees where helpful and friendly. THE NOT TOO GOOD: * Ocean: although the hotel is ocean front, the beach has rocks and unless you take a walk further down, you will find rocks which don't allow you to stand up so you have no choice but to just float/swim. I found this to be very disappointing. Also, if you expect a Caribbean ocean you will be disappointed. Maui isn't the Caribbean. * Location: yes, it is in Kaanapali, and although you can walk to Whaler's Village, it takes about 20-25 minutes to get there. I wish the Westin Villas was located where the Westin and Sheraton are. * Lounge Chairs - I don't know if I am being unreasonable here, but I was surprised to find out guests had to pay $12.50 in order to use a lounge chair for the day plus $7.50 for an umbrella. Maybe it's because I've been to the Caribbean too much where lounge chairs and umbrellas are always available for free. Also, please keep in mind this hotel is perfect for family with children. However, if you are planning an adult only trip you might want to go to a different hotel unless you don't mind seeing children everywhere you go!

Second, the hotel location on the beach was perfect for those who want to get away from the busy areas. We rented snorkels nearby and was able to walk outside and dive in.

It was extremely comfortable, resort was immaculately maintained and beach was superb, the size was perfect (not too big that its overwhelming, not too small that you don't have all the perks of a resort), the service was great, and actually, we didn't find that there were too many loud/noisy children running around. I've been to some resorts that are even more 'family-oriented' where the pool was overcrowded with kids and their parents, and kids were running around poolside knocking over drinks etc... the Westin was NOT like this. It was calm, tranquil, and just a fantastic place to be. Being two couples in our mid-thirties, we actually wanted to escape from our hectic city life, wasn't really looking for nightlife (we get enough of that at home!) and the Westin Ocean Villas was just the place for the R & R we were looking for. We were upgraded to a 1-bedroom suite on arrival; the suite was just perfect. With a full kitchen and ensuite laundry, we could stay here another week or two! Having a kitchen and BBQ facilities nearby was awesome; we stocked up at the Costco (just beside Kapului airport) and had breakfasts at home, and about 3 dinners at home. This was both economical and made for some fun nights, sitting on the patio, sipping drinks. The snorkelling right off the Westin Villas beach is just suberb! But also highly recommended, is to take the Westin shuttle over to Black Rock and snorkel there! We saw sea turtles there, and more fish than I can dream up. Being a foodie, food was also really important to my vacations... top spots in Maui (Kaanapali) were SENSEI sushi and Merrimans (both just about 10-15 min from the Westin Villas.

The beach outside this hotel is actually pretty good and has some great snorkeling. When staying at hotels I am a clean freak and I really thought our room could use a deep clean. Also, housekeeping didn't clean our room one day which was a true bummer. I love coming back to a nice clean room after being out all day, so when I came back and it was still dirty it totally ruined my chi.

If you stay at a lot of Westins you will notice the difference. They are quite focused on the owners and their interests versus the guests we felt. I think the main way this shows is that the restaurants aren't all that busy and the wait staff there, although well-intentioned are fairly unskilled. Our feeling was that the owners don't eat out there much so the restaurants get second priority. We got asked 5 times in 7 minutes if everything was OK with our meal at one point. At another place we found out they only serve food until 6 after waiting for a server for almost 10 minutes. Plus the drinks are really small and overpriced. Also, my wife is a Platinum Starwood member and the upgrade we were entitled too upon check-in was pretty minimal. Partial beach view from the back of the resort. Check-out at 10 a.m is a bit harsh also we thought. I know this sounds whiney but if your expectations are high this place just falls a bit short, in part because the Westins generally are so good.

This leads to some confusion as there is a Westin Hotel in Kaanapali and some guests assume they will be able to amble down the beachfront walkway to their resort. It will be a LONG walk.

Studios include a queen be and sofa bed in the room and the one bedroom has a separate bedroom with a king bed. Each unit has a kitchen area though the studio features a small rangetop and microwave. All units have washers and dryers which can be a godsend to families with small children. Televisions are in every living room and separate bedroom. A significant difference between the two resorts is that the Noth property has studios with small lanais; the south resort studios have a patio door and a railing to allow fresh air but no chairs. All one bedroom units have lanais. the grounds are luxuriantly tropical with palms and other foliage that whisk in the wind. As the resort is on the west side of Maui, guests have a beautiful view of the islands of Lanai and Molokai across the strait. There are several large pools and a kiddies' pirate ship play area. A full range of resort activities is published weekly and the resort offers free shuttle buses to Kaanapali and Lahaina- a boon as parking can be difficult in these tourist meccas.

Sun never reached the pool, and 10 adults in the pool would have been over crowded. The other pools were huge. However, the maximum depth in all of the pools was 4 feet. And none of the pools were heated. I know this keeps down the cost of chemicals, but, what is the point of having a pool for guests yet making them miserable to use? So, the pools were not really usable by anyone other than very warm blooded children. When sitting around the pool, the servers didn't want to seem to stop to take a drink order. When one did finally bring a drink, he didn't return for 45 minutes.I gave up. The gym was very small, and didn't have a variety of equipment. We had booked an early morning snorkeling trip, and when we arrived at the valet desk to pick up our car, there was only a security guard on duty, who was loading a guest's van. When my husband went searching for someone at the front desk, he finally found someone in a back room, who came out and told us there was no one on duty at 6:30 a.m., and we would have to wait for the security guard. Although she knew we were waiting, she took her time loading the car and chatted with the driver before starting to search the valet stand for our car keys. When she found them, she had us get in her golf cart as she drove us through the parking garage looking for our car. She seemed as though she had no clue how to find our car. We finally found the car and sped away, hoping we could make our 30 minute drive to take our snorkeling trip. Luckily, the boat had not left the dock, although we were about 10 minutes late. When we expressed out dismay at this ordeal to the front desk, they grouchily told us that the valet desk wasn't manned 24 hours. However, this was not noted in any of our information, nor was there a sign posted. Luckily, we had actually left our room a little earlier than necessary, since we were not exactly sure of the marina location. We have stayed in Maui before at other hotels that had rooms not quite this nice, but had much better amenities. Otherwise, I would have given an above average rating.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Babylon, New York", "Title": "\u201cAmazing\u201d", "Author": "Dave03060", "ReviewID": "UR120800984", "Content": "We were fortunate enough to accompany friends of ours who owned a timeshare at the villas.

Therefore, each are furnished and finished the same - very good quality. Good soundproofing as well. We had a 1 bedroom, which was great - we could close the door and my freind could watch TV in bed while I was in the living room. Very good sized lanai as well. Our unit had a full kitchen so we had the fridge with an icemaker, full oven as well. I believe the studio room only has a mini fridge and a microwave (which I understand is also a convection oven). There is an in room safe and the closet is a good size although a little awkward to access because it is behind one of the bathroom doors. Good number of pools available - the adult pool at the far north end of the resort is very quiet, but very shady & while we were there the tradewinds were a little high so this pool was so breezy it was impossible to stay there. The pirate pool was working but the area close by was being worked on (blue board walls were up so don't know what they were doing). It is likely the reason why the north pool which others have said is so quiet turned out to be the busiest and the noisiest of all. The cost to rent a lounger and an umbrella for the day for 2 people is $45. Too steep it seems for almost everyone because I think we saw one maybe two set up while we were there. Pool loungers are plentiful but not those with a palapa so good luck getting shade. People were putting their towels out well before 8 am and contrary to what they say we never saw a staff member removing these. Here is the pay attention part: We did not book direct with the Westin, we got a good rate through another booking agency. Be very sure of what you have booked and have an email or the booking confirmation to back it up --- we were told free parking - they tried to charge us. The booking agency had our room as ocean view & Westin said 'no' island view. This meant her making some calls, going to a back room and we were left to wait and wait and wait. She brought out the map & showed us 2 room options and then 10 mins later confirmed one of those was not actually an option because it was a handicapped room and they needed it. I pointed to the map & said so there are no rooms in this area (the north area) and she said no, not that had an oceon view. We asked to see the other room & more than once we had mentioned our wish for no parking lot (which was also on our booking confirmation). Sure enough we looked at that room and it was over a parking lot with trees in front so no view at all. Back to the front desk and this time we insisted on a manager, who was with another client, and as it turned out in another building, so more waiting. The manager actually listened and showed us on the map the original room we had, although it was called island view, in fact it overlooked the koi pond, the pool, and was on the side where you could see some oceon !! So if the first girl had listened to us re: no parking lot and when I pointed to the map if she had showed us the original room we had on the map we would have taken it, no question. This whole process TOOK OVER 2 HOURS, we ended up on the south side with a full oceon view overlooking the park that is adjacent to the Westin (the parking lot was off to the left but that was ok). So again, be specific on your intent. We did hear a few owners during our stay who had issues with their room placement as well. In addition, painting the exterior was taking place so noise during the scaffolding procedure, then the spraying, this made some of the palapas even busier as no one wanted to be need where that was taking place. If you go without maid service, which for us was daily, you get a voucher for breakfast so we did that for 2 days so each of us could have 1 free breakfast buffet - it was really good.

I complained about it to the front desk and they sent housekeeping up. Housekeeping came and they said engineering has to fix it. There it goes 5 hours down the drain. Called and spoke to the manager who offered me to switch to an oceanview room the next day.

Friends had asked us to join them for a week in their two bedroom suite. We were happy to do so. We had previously stayed with other friend in Kaanapali's Marriott time share property. We felt this Westin facility, while lacking some of the pool amenities, was a better hotel. The finishes in the kitchen, the set up of the bathroom, the location of the balconies, the quality of the beds, were all superior. The one major flow this facility had, in our estimation, was the location. This hotel is north of Black Rock where the Sheraton is perched. That meant it was not an easy hike to the restaurants at Whalers Cove. So while members of our group routinely hiked down the beach to Whalers Cover, it was not likely we would amble over there for dinner knowing we would have to repeat the hike back. That also meant the amenities of other hotels were not in close proximity. If you wanted to go to another hotel's restaurant, not likely. If you wanted to attend another hotel's luau, not happening. While maybe there is some benefit to being a little secluded from the rest of the Kaanapali hotels, we could see no huge benefit in it. We were on the third floor of the six story North Tower. Fortunately for us that meant we could park on the same level as, and relatively close to, our room. That said, nearly all the spaces on our level were designated to \"compacts\" and we had a Hyundai Santa Fe and a Dodge Caravan. Sometimes there were no parking spaces because over-sized Chevy Tahoes and Dodge Challengers were hogging two spots. The one huge compliment I will give this facility was its cleanliness. As our week progressed and we hiked in and out of the room it occurred to me that it would be some job to clean up after us. We had six adults squeezed into two beds and two bathrooms. We surfed, golfed, zip-lined and snorkeled. We ate in the rooms about half the time. Kudos to house cleaning for making the suite look nearly unlived in when we first checked in. I have also stayed in a private condo in Wailea which I can use for comparison. The Wailea condo had a large lanai. But private condo's are not as polished as this Westin suite. Private condos also do not have access to room service, to coffee in the convenience store, a sports bar next to the beach or fresh towels at the pool. The Westin took care of its guests even if it did wrangle our friends into another presentation trying to upgrade their time share package. At the end of the week I had to admit this was a good experience. In part because our room location overlooking the pool and, by extension, the ocean, was perfect. But also because the seldom seen but very efficient Westin staff was on hand to keep order where there was chaos.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful spot, big rooms, mediocre service\u201d", "Author": "srothnu", "ReviewID": "UR120635498", "Content": "This was our first trip to Maui and we were so pleased with the lovely beach and the size of the one bedroom suites to accomodate our family.

The Italian restaurant in the newer North villas was quite good (especially by time share resort standards). The room was well-furnished and clean. We didn't have the bug issues that others have reported (but heard of others who had bad issues while we were there). What we didn't like: the wireless service is very spotty and definitely comes and goes throughout the day (despite the fact that they did an upgrade to supposedly better quality during our stay). Our view was okay--it was considered \"ocean view\" (bldg 7) but was very distant. As owners who reserved far in advance, I was hoping for more. Service from the bar while at the pool is also really poor--it wasn't crowded but I still waited forever for a server to come by. The worst part of our trip was our owner update. The person who did our update clearly had a set spiel and, although we are very experienced travellers in general as well as seasoned owners, we felt like it was very \"101\" type of information. Plus, they try to make you feel badly about what you currently own so that you'll upgrade to more (\"gosh, this new rollover feature is really going to hurt owners like you.\" Hmmm, really? I don't think so since we are never able to use all of our points.). Also, the ONE thing we really want is the ability to view availability and book rooms online for the owner part of the program just like you can with hotels, and our salesperson told us they have no intention of ever adding that feature nor do they plan to ever add more resorts. Great! Gosh, how can we sign up to buy more now that we know Starwood will never do the two things we want? Plus, on the very last day of our trip, we just asked for a tour of the model in the other building so we could see the difference and know where to book next time. Yet, they stuck us with another sales person who proceeded to grill us the whole way on the tour about how many StarOptions we had, how long we'd been owners, etc. It's very hard for them to get out of sales mode.

This resort is in sharp contrast to our previous accomodations, which was a small timeshare walking distance to two fantastic beaches near Kapalua. The Beach at the Westin Villas is quite long and relatively narrow at the same time. The real attraction is the number of pools, the size of the suite, and the overall service and ammenities available to you. In a nutshell, you have lots of space within your room, relatively good amount of space in the public areas, and little reason to leave the resort. Our kids enjoyed the pools, and found the beach itself quite boring. The water was very calm, which would be great for small kids and snorkeling. We started our vacation at the Fairmont, and I would say this is similiar to the size and ammenities there. The pools at the Westin were better, but at the same time, there were alot more people (even though the Fairmont was quite crowded as well). What took us by surprise was the absolute number of people at the resort. After spending days in sleepy Hana at a private villa, and then at a small timeshare, the size of the Westin and the absolute energy was a little bit overwhelming at time. There is no doubt kids will have fun here. If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing place to soak up Maui, you would either need to go to your suite, or find another place to stay. Don't get me wrong. The beds were wonderful, the amount of space in the room was great, the view from our room was nice, and everywhere was clean. We did enjoy it.

The hotel workers were very nice, but it took a day to get moved to another set of apartments, where the ocean could only be viewed by standing on one corner of the balcony. The next day we were moved to another set of suites with the beautiful ocean view we originally requested and could fully enjoy the resort. Our apartments included full kitchens in each one, which were very nice since we had a baby and a toddler to care for. We stocked up on food and necessities at the local Wal Mart near the airport when we first got to Maui. Please be aware that the use of plastic bags is restricted on Maui, and you must buy reusable bags to transport the things you buy. The children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool with a large pirate ship taking up most of the central area of the pool was unique with its fountains of spray and slides for the children. The boardwalk along the ocean was wonderful to stroll on in the morning or evening. We rented snorkeling equipment, but the heavy surf on the beach prevented the less adventurous including the grandmother and grandchildren from snorkeling. The adult children enjoyed snorkeling far from the beach in the ocean and seeing the fish and turtles. The beach was a lovely place to sit and listen to the surf and enjoy the sun. There were several restaurants at the resort, where the food was good, and the workers very pleasant. The resort does have a shuttle, but limits use of baby strollers on them. They have their own baby strollers for use on the shuttle, and do not want other strollers brought on board, although they allow large golf bags, pool toys and surf boards, so do not go expecting to use your own baby stroller. We had to rent a taxi or use our own rental vehicles. The people driving the shuttle were very pleasant, but apparently there has been some controversy over the use of baby strollers, so they would not relent on the use of our own simple baby stroller. We drove the road to Hanna and enjoyed the views along the way of the beautiful ocean and rock formations along the shore. We enjoyed the Polynesian Luau at the Westin Hotel just down the road, although we had to rent a taxi to get the baby stroller there, so the baby could lie down to take his bottle during the luau. The food was good, and the show with its dancers and musicians very entertaining. There are several swimming pools at the resort, and these were very pleasant for the grandmother and children to use. It is especially quiet of a morning to use the pools, and the temperature is not so hot. There are very modern barbeque grills around the pools for use on a first come first serve basis. We ate out for all our meals, but saw families enjoying the BBQ areas with their nice tables and seats. It's a lovely resort, with great workers, but you have to be patient and able to communicate what is expected.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Mateo, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Maui Resort\u201d", "Author": "MKtravelers19", "ReviewID": "UR119672232", "Content": "This was our third stay at the Westin Villas.

We were extremely pleased that we decided to stay at the Westin Villas, over the other hotels in the area. Luxurious villas > regular hotel rooms any day. From our check-in to our departure, we were treated kindly by every single associate and manager that we ran into. Ami at the front desk was a pleasure to talk too, and was extremely helpful when finalizing our room details upon check-in. We asked for a quieter room, not overlooking the kiddie pool and since a room was available, he was more than happy to accommodate us. Hats off to management for training and hiring such sincere and genuine associates. We stayed in a 1 bedroom villa, and our room was immaculate upon checking in. For those who aren't quite sure, yes there is a full kitchen (electric stove & oven, full size refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, etc), and a washer and dryer in the room. As well, the kitchen is fully stocked with all the utensils, pots and pans to make a home cooked meal. It was great to make/have breakfast at our own leisure. We had dinner at the poolside restaurant one of the evenings and we had a great experience with our server Eric. He was extremely attentive and pleasant, he did a wonderful job of making us feel welcomed and gave us great recommendations. The food at the restaurant was exceptional, everything tasted great. The dim lights and flickering candles on the tables set up a nice relaxing dining experience. On to the helpful facts: *Parking is $8 a night, and that is the only resort fee that I remember paying. It was a little tricky finding a spot late in the evening. It appeared that most people returned to the hotel in the early evening. *Internet is free. *There is a shuttle that runs between the Sheraton Maui (Black Rock) and the Westin Maui every 15 minutes. As well, there is a shuttle that runs to Lahaina town. *There is a Safeway Grocery Store as well as a Longs Drugs about 5 minutes south of the hotel in Lahaina town. *The sunsets were amazing to watch every night. *There were BBQ grills out by the pool for anyone to use, I believe it was a 1 hour time limit on the grills but we never utilized them. *There were beach lounge chairs available for all hotel guests to use. *There was actually pretty good snorkeling in the beaches along the resort, we saw some decent sized fish and great looking coral out there. This hotel seriously made an amazing impact on our vacation. I haven't been able to shut up about this gorgeous property to any of my friends, and have been recommending it to everyone I have talked too. Hope this helps.

The Bell Desk was also \"right on it\" getting my gear and food up to the room after I checked in. The one bedroom has a large kitchen(with almost every appliance one would need on vacation), and bathroom with an adequte living room/dining room connecting to the lanai for enterainment.

The grounds are well maintained adorned with Island flora and connect to the beach area which is great for snorkling or just swimming. The Westin Ocean Resort also has about a dozen grills for outside dining or just to cook and bring back to your room. This is particularly nice around sunset. This property also has an exercise room, sauna, and a \"killer\" steam room. One of the great things about this property is it's location. It's away from the crowded hotel row of Kaanapali Beach but close enough for a leisurely stroll to Whalers Village.

We had requested them far in advance and were told they had them so when we found out they were a blend we weren't sure what we were going to do. My husband has a severe allergy to polyester. Brian notified Jason and we also told Caroline our concierge. Together they worked with Marc Grotelueschen the manager to figure out what to do. Caroline was so sweet she even offered to get her own sheets from her house to let us use. Mark contacted Steve H. the director of housekeeping and he went to Costco and bought us sheets. Hannah Aiwohi at the front desk also was involved in helping our situation. All these wonderful people worked together to make sure we had a great stay. The bed was comfortable and the room was very spacious, complete with every thing you could need. The resort is beautiful and all the staff here are so helpful.

We stayed in the studio suites in the South Towers in Bldg 3. I really love this place almost to the point where I almost bought a timeshare here and still thinking of buying it. I think this place is a good place to stay if you have families or if you really want to get away from your busy life and truly want to relax. The grounds are big and lots of green lawn. Has adult and kid pools. It's right on the beach so you just have to walk there, rinse off and go to your room. I didn't really care for any lounge chairs and stuff, so we were content playing in the sand and swimming in the ocean and in the pools. So the stuff I loved about this place... - Washer/Dryer - I loved it! I didn't have to wash our swim suites every day by hand - Quiet - At least for us in bldg 3, I felt like it was really quiet (except housekeeping staff, see below) - Kitchenette (at least for the studio) - I loved having a bigger sized fridge than the little ones you get at other hotels. We were able to store our milk and juice in the fridge. We're your basic cereal type of people, so this worked out great for us. - Size of the room - at least for south towers, I felt like the room space was decent. Stuff where they can improve... - Recycling bin - It would be nice if each room had one. We went through a lot of water bottles and coke cans. We just made our own with a brown paper bag, but it would have been nice if they had one in each suite. - Housekeeping - this is the reason this hotel couldn't get a 5 rating from me. Our room was clean for the most part when we checked in, but there were lot of places where you can totally tell it was not dusted!!!! You can see it on top of the microwave, on the shelves in the bathroom, and night stands. - Housekeeping Staff - This only goes for bldg 3 and at least where I stayed. The housekeeping staff were so freakin LOUD!!! They would talk to each other in the hallways and when they were cleaning the room next to us so loud I was afraid my children were going to wake up from their naps! - New carpet on the first floor of bldg 3 - they really need to replace or have a good cleaning, it's kind of dirty and not very appealing. I couldn't help noticing the dirty carpet every time I had to walk through the bldg. Also I did check out the suites in North Towers. I think maybe it might be nice to stay here because at least it has separate showers. The South Towers (at least for us) only had the jacuzzi tub with the shower head and that was a little inconvenient. Except for some of the stuff they need improvements the need, it really is a great hotel if you really want to relax and have fun. I saw people using the grills which looked nice too. All the staff I encountered were super nice. I will most likely to stay at this place again especially after staying at the Westin Maui Resort & Spa and couple miles down for the next 5 nights we stayed in Maui. We wanted to try both resorts, so we split up our time evenly between the two, but I really wished I stayed at this one. Westin Maui Resort and Spa was nice too, but their beach (well there wasn't much of one because it had eroded so much) and I felt like there is way too much commotion going on the first floor of the lobby area with bunch of vendors. I think I would stay at the Villas and just take the shuttle the next time because I did like the Westin Maui Resort & Spa being close to the Whaler's village and their restaurant Tropica was pretty good and right on the ocean front.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chula Vista, California", "Title": "\u201cBad room location\u201d", "Author": "EdR1956", "ReviewID": "UR118975146", "Content": "This was the first visit to our timeshare at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas North (9/23 to 9/30) since our purchase.

I figured it out after watching people exchange towels with their towel cards. I wish I knew when the house keeping people were supposed to come. They just make the beds and do very light cleaning. The room was nice but the kitchen appliances were not that great. The coffee maker was moldy smelling and the only coffee available was Starbucks, which is strange since there is great local Hawaiian coffee! Their idea of green living was strange- not encouraging the changing of sheets- to be green. It seemed like it was more for the Westin to save money because there were plenty of non-green things happening at this resort! The rental station people were nice except for some who treated me like a rich tourist constantly pushing Maui Jim sunglasses on me. They also push the tea tree aloe lotion too. I did not like how they kept saying I could charge it to my room. It doesn't make it less expensive! I finally bought the tea tree aloe lotion because I needed it. Also the lounge chair and umbrella rental is 45$ per day and necessary with kids on a beach but expensive if you need it every day! The snorkel gear that we rented was not that great either and that was about $30 a week as was a boogie board. My daughter kept getting water in her snorkel. We eventually rented from Boss Frog and they were more attentive about the fitting of the snorkel. My kids who are 7 and 10 loved it here though and loved the water slide and pools. The nice part is that it doesn't feel pretentious but its expensive for what it is. The food which is mediocre is overpriced; The only deals are during Happy Hour where some of the appetizers are half priced. My room faced in and I couldn't deal with the second hand smoke wafting from other people's balconies. Once I turned off the air conditioner I was never able to turn it back on again. My one phone in the bedroom had a bright blinking red light that I couldn't turn off. It was possibly broken and I just unplugged it and used the phone in the kitchen. I couldn't be bothered to call housekeeping to keep fixing these minor problems. I would say their beds were comfortable but this is not luxury. It is like suburban living on a beach front property with heavily chlorinated pools filled with kids. The views are amazing but I couldn't stop feeling sad about the way it used to look 15 years ago, when there were less hotels and the coral reefs were healthier and there were more fish.

I am a Worldmark owner, and trade in through Interval International. Last year, we got into a 3 Bedroom Ocean View at the Marriott Ko Olina Resort on Oahu, so was hoping similar or better expectations with the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas. We flew out a few days early and stayed 2 days on the Kehei side at our home timeshare, Wyndam Worldmark Resort, which we were able to get a 3 bedroom for a family of 7, which was 4 adults and 3 kids. This resort is clean and average, and met our needs. We came in a few hours early on Saturday, 9/17, to check into the Westin Resort, and when you arrive, we came to the South Lobby first, and the bellman at the front will tell you which section you would be staying, whether North or South Section, and we found out the South Tower is where we would be staying. We checked in at the front lobby and the front desk receptionist started out being nice, and then gave us our room and briefly explained that because we used Interval International to exchange into the property, we would only get to stay in the South Tower areas, and the North Towers were reserved for owners only. So she gave us our room, which was in Building 4, then tells us we were in room 4011/2012, saying it was a good room with a view. I asked her if it was on the 1st floor, then she says no...you sit up a bit. She said this was the only room available for a 2 bedroom connecting unit, so figured would check it out. Well...we walked over to the room and was nice, then went to the balcony....which overlooked the circle driveway entrance to the South Tower, and was basically floor level. She said there was a view...but if you turned, the only view you saw was the South Tower bulding entrance, then just trees. We went back to the lobby and met another Front Desk Receptionist, who took her time in finding us a different room. She says she was moving other people around to accomodate us, and she got us on the 2nd floor of Buliding 4, rooms 4207/4209. We went up, and it was somewhat better, where we got up to the 2nd floor and got a direct view of Kahekili Beach Park in front, then if you sat in the living room on the couch and look around the trees, you would get \"some\" ocean view. We figured we would keep this room for the week since we wouldn't be in the room that much. Resort was nice and we did enjoy the facilities of the pool (Pictures of the Pirate Ship Pool in the middle of the resort is misleading...our 4 year old thought he was too big for it. The pictures on the site make it look alot bigger than it really is). When using the water slide at resort, we had some issues as some of the other reviewers complained about, which was inconsistency with the rules of the Pool Boys. The 1st time we went, we saw families catching their younger kids at the bottom of the slide, so we did it as well with our 4 year old son (who could swim ok, but just needs a little help). The next day we tried it, I did the same, the Pool Boy then says, no one is allowed to stay at within the roped in areas to catch their kids and then he says if I stood outside the ropes near the drop off point, and my kid swims to me, that would be ok...so I did this a few times, which got old, so we left. We stayed in the pool area, and another mother and daugher with a little girl about the same age, but could not swim, went down the pool and the mother was there for about 20 minutes in the roped area catching her kid. My son then wanted to go back down the slide, but just told him didn't want to deal with the Pool Nazi, so left to the pool near the North Tower. By the way, the 3rd pool, which is through two buildings from where we were in bldg 4..its a hike, but it's the best pool of all three at the resort. However, they call the pool a Lazy River....it is no such thing....just a pool with a few turns here and there, with no current. The other issues that came up, which is mentioned by other reviewer is ANT PROBLEMS. Day 3 into our trip, we noticed Ants coming up by the living room tv, and behind the dining tables, as well as the kitchen walls. We complained the maintenance man was going to spray our room after we ate dinner, but the canned spray he brought smelled, so he said he would come back when we were out. The next day, as we were leaving for the pool, I guess Westin brought in the Professionals, Orkin Exterminators to spray our room. Well, when they were done....they sprayed so much that you can see the pesticide dripping from the walls and counters, so I had to wipe it down so my son would not touch it. The funny thing is that nite....we STILL HAD ANT problems. The maintenance person that was going to initially spray the room came in the day after while we were out and sprayed again...and you know what....STILL NO HELP! At this point, we just dealt with it...making sure after we ate to WIPE EVERYTHING DOWN!!!! And this didn't help....so if you see any small dots on the walls in your room or kitchen....these are DEAD ANTS that the maids don't wipe down.....so you will have ant problems no matter what. The positive was parking was easy, which we parked in the lot by the Beach Park. Also, drinks at the hotels bars had good deals.....so that is another plus! On the last day, we understood check out to be by 10am, which was not a problem. We were just finishing up some things and got a knock on our door at 9:30am....it was Maid Service, asking if they can start cleaning the rooms already. We told him we were getting ready to leave...so he waited around a few minutes, then he got the hint it would take longer, so says he would come back after we leave. So overall, be careful, if you are paying for the resort...it is NOT worth the money, look elsewhere, maybe the Honua Kai Resort which is next door. We are somewhat lucky that we just traded in and only cost the exchange fees. So in comparing this to the Marriott Ko Olina resort, this was a huge step below in regards to quality. We will not be returning to exchange into this resort again.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Family Vacation at WKORV North\u201d", "Author": "Vacationlvrs", "ReviewID": "UR118588916", "Content": "This is our third visit to this resort and we were lucky enough to get upgraded to an ocean front two-bedroom villa (which is the one-bedroom with an attached studio villa).

I decided to stay here. From our experience, here's my comments (especially in relation to some other reviews that I checked and considered before booking here), We arrived late at night on Thursday, so when we checked in, we were the only people in line and were greeted courteously and efficiently. I am a platinum spg member, so I was offered a studio suite with a partial ocean view (which was what I had booked) or to be upgraded to a full one bedroom suite, but with no ocean view. I realize that all spg upgrades are dependent upon availability at check-in, so I am always pleased and appreciative when we are offered an upgrade. In some instances I am willing to pay extra or prefer to have a \"view\" room - other times not. In this case, since we were staying for 3 nights, I preferred to have some extra room rather than a \"view\". When the receptionist described the room - top floor, corner room, I was delighted, as I am a light sleeper and this sounded wonderful. I noticed at the time that the \"Timeshare desks\" near the check-in counter were closed. First impression of our room was \"fantastic\". You can check out the more-detailed reviews of the rooms from other members. Briefly, ours was very spacious, clean, well laid out, great bathroom, large veranda, etc. We unpacked, relaxed a bit and then went to bed (extremely comfortable mattress and pillows). It was then that we found out about what would be our only major complaint with our entire stay. Our room was on the highway side of the closest building to the highway. The sound proofing was not that great, as we heard a lot of traffic noise from the adjacent highway. I initially thought that there might even be an open room window to allow so much noise to come in - but there wasn't. Also, apparently one of the things-to-do while in Maui is to rent a motorcycle and drive around on the island. So there is more noise from cycles than one would usually expect. I felt like we were in Los Angels next to a freeway. I pulled out the earplugs and eventually got to sleep. The next morning, I asked my wife if she wanted to see about changing rooms, but she said we were already unpacked, so let's just stay. The other bad thing about having that heavy traffic through much of the day, was that in the evening when we wanted to just sit out on the nice veranda and enjoy the atmosphere, the noise of the traffic made us just go back inside. I know that the resort has no control over this traffic, but if you have a choice, other areas of the hotel may be more secluded from the traffic noise. Here's my responses to some other reviews (1) We had no problems with noise from other guests - but we were not in a high traffic area for other guests nor near the spa or pool (2) All the staff members were friendly and courteous to any request (3) We were not pressured into a timeshare presentation (4) I do not know about pool charges, pool activities or ease in getting gazebos, grills, etc. We walked through the pool area a number of times, especially on the way to take walks along the beach. The pool did often appeared to be quite busy.(5) We had no problems with anything in the room (6) I did notice that when I walked through the reception area a little after 4:00 PM on Sunday, the check-in line was quite long and all the \"timeshare desks\" were busy. I assume that many people may book their stay for an entire week (Sunday to Sunday?) and check-in time is not until 4:00. So, if possible I would recommend that when you arrive in Maui, if at all possible, you find something else to do first and then check in at the resort later in the day - unless you don't mind (or don't have a choice) waiting in long lines tor check in. Of course, maybe that was just due to a big group or tour or some event where lots of people were checking in all at once? (7) We drove by the other Starwood properties, just to check them out, but we did not go inside nor try to use their facilities. All-in-all, other than the highway traffic noise, this Starwood property was great for us.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cAmong the best\u201d", "Author": "CtJbl", "ReviewID": "UR118334705", "Content": "We could not have been more pleased with our week-long stay at this resort.

Yes, the entrance has your typical Westin appearance, but once you get to the pool area(s), it feels like a really bad water park -- overwrought with large groups of partying parents (think wife-beater tanks, white sunglasses and backward baseball hats) with running, screaming, unattended children. We were taken to our room, which overlooked one of the pools, and I almost started crying (and NOT tears of joy) when we stepped out on the balcony and it literally smelled like old fried food and smelly diapers. Our daughter (yes! we have small children) said, \"you can still hear the kids with the door shut.\" Not the way we wanted to spend 9 nights in Maui. It was too late to find other accommodations that night, so we elected to stay and see if things got better. Nope. Around 6:15 p.m., we headed downstairs to one of the only places open for dinner.

We didnt eat at the Italian place but did get snacks and drinks from the pool bar. $6 drinks of the day and $4 mai tais at happy hour, not bad for a resort on Maui...although we DID find $2 mai tais at Famous Daves (he he) Get some food and BBQ on one of the grills, very nice set up and then wander out to watch the sunset. Maybe it was the time of year we came (Sept 3-12) and everyone else was back home getting kids ready for school but it wasnt super busy, we scored shaded lounges 3 out of 7 days, and moved to shaded ones later in the day a few times... My only complaints (and they are more like minor annoyances): - The hot tub by the water slide was unbarably HOT, so we couldnt even sit in it (the other one wasnt this way), -The elevators seem to be in strange places, the halls were a bit \"mazelike\" and we never quite figured out a quick way to get to our car even though it was parked directly below our room... I am rating the spa as \"Average\" due to the high price for what I personally experienced... all I got was a standard \"heavenly manicure\" and it was about 20 minutes for a polish removal, tiny hand massage and re-polish. My technican was a sweet heart and I enjoyed talking with her but $68 after all was said and done was a tad high for what I had done. The spa was very clean, and modern though. And I will say we NEVER EVER were approached about a timeshare- I also think this is another attribute to staying in the North Section, the timeshare office seems to be in the \"main\" building.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carson City, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful low key resort\u201d", "Author": "Familyfunn2", "ReviewID": "UR118075758", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in a studio unit with a small kitchen.

The resort is gorgeous with an amazing open air lobby that looks out to the ocean. We stayed in a studio king that overlooked the pool & grounds (and a sliver of the ocean). The room was very spacious, modernly decorated and the amenities were very nice. We had complimentary laundry detergent and dishwasher detergent, which was perfect to wash our swimsuits and glasses that we used. The full sized fridge was very useful and my husband loved having an ice machine in the room. Even though it was just the two of us, these extra amenities are nice to have when traveling with a family. The resort is centrally located, near the fun little town of Lahaina. The resort offers a free shuttle to and from the town which is very nice considering parking is a a minimum and very costly. Overall a great location and close to other attractions and things to do. Now onto the reason why you come to Hawaii... the ocean! The resort is right on one of the best beaches in the world, Kaanapali Beach. We were able to go to a few other resorts while we were here for different activities, and what we noticed and favored about the Westin Villas is that there are no stairs to have to climb to get to the ocean, no sand dunes to jump over, the ocean is literally steps away from the resort. You can also rent kayaks, snorkel gear, stand up paddles, inner tubes, anything you want and the prices are pretty reasonable (i think it was like $30 to rent snorkel gear the whole week). If you don't want to go in the ocean, there are tons of pools (and one designated only for adults - although it's not in the sunniest of places). There are also tons of lounge chairs close to the pools, and we never worried about having to save chairs or having chairs available at any time of day. When I come back to Maui I would stay at this hotel again - worth every penny! I also want to mention that we are not timeshare owners or ever have any intention of purchasing one. We LOVED how we were not hassled to buy one, consider it or even look at the details. I got the feeling that if you wanted to seek that part out you could, but they will leave you alone if you don't.

It is beautiful but we got the street side parking lot/highway view in Bldg 4. The view of the mountain from our high 6th floor was great but it was very noisy with the constant traffic so we did not use the lanai at all. Apparently, if you do not own a timeshare there, this is the view that you get and the staff are very upfront about that. Owning a Starwood timeshare anywhere should give a better advantage for views (although did not help us). It was fine because we were not in the room very much. Some of our family had difficulty sleeping at night due to the noise though. As \"green\" as most of the Westin's are, we found it odd that there were several bathroom lights all on one switch so you had to turn all of the lights on at the same time regardless which part of the bathroom you use.. It seemed very wasteful of the expensive electricity on Maui. The 2 bedroom room was clean, updated and very spacious (at least 1200 sf). The entry was nice as it completely separated the two units for privacy and the doors could be left open to adjoin the rooms. Starwood timeshares are great but I was a little disappointed in a concierge for the first time ever. We are not hard to get along with by any means and when I simply asked where to see the sea turtles, a woman basically responded, \"there are no guarantees that you will ever see one so go to the aquarium...\" and was very arrogant and it was very obvious that she did not want to help us. This was our first encounter with a snotty concierge person with Starwood. Later another concierge told us about the various beaches where we might spot some turtles and was quite pleasant and helpful. There is a concierge in each building lobby which was very nice for questions or booking activities so you don't have to walk to the main building and stand in line. The food and drinks were good but pricey except for the pool restaurant. The beach is dog friendly (which we liked) but very busy so we went to Lanai by ferry for a quiet beach.

Great location - perfect for snorkeling or walking along the beach. The shuttle to Whaler's Village and Lahaina is also very convenient. Our room was a studio in building six in the north villas, overlooking the koi pond, the pool, and the ocean in the distance. We loved this room location, and enjoyed sitting out on the lanai and watching the koi fish and the neat-looking bird that lives by the pond. The room was also very quiet and made for a restful night's sleep. We stayed here last year in the same type of room (North Villa studio), and had no problems at all. This year, however, our room had several maintenance issues - it became sort of a game to see what would go wrong next! Immediately upon checking in, we noticed that the safe was not working, which we reported to the front desk the next morning as we were headed out, and they told us we would need to be in the room for them to fix it. We called when we went back for lunch, and the people who tried to fix it were very apologetic and friendly, but they were unfortunately unable to fix it after two hours(!) of attempting to do so. At that point, we just wanted to get on with our first day in Maui, so we decided to just forget about it, though the lack of storage for our valuables made us a bit uncomfortable. Other maintenance issues were a broken coffee maker that spewed coffee all over the floor on our first morning, a very worn iron that leaked water and had a deteriorating coating that flaked off on the clothes, a cordless phone handset that didn't work, and a rather temperamental icemaker. Lastly, the dresser was off balance somehow and tilted so that if you put any sort of weight (such as two pairs of shorts) in two of the drawers, they wouldn't stay closed. Someone had apparently attempted to fix this at some point by wedging some napkins under one of the legs, but this \"fix\" did not work, and we were unable to use those drawers. We did not report any of these other maintenance issues to the front desk during our stay, since they didn't bother us too much and we knew by then that we would have to be in the room for any of them to be fixed. We did tell them upon check-out so that they would have a chance to fix things for the next guests, and they were again very apologetic.

We had read one review noting that their room was sold as having an ocean view, but in fact can only see the water from the balcony. When we checked in, the rooms we were given faced an interior courtyard. When we noted the discrepancy, the receptionist said - with a straight face - that these were in fact ocean view rooms because one end of the courtyard was open towards the water. We were skeptical, but willing to give Westin the benefit of the doubt and at least see the room. Unfortunately (for us), we found that a tree blocked the end of the courtyard towards the ocean. No view of the ocean was possible from the room nor from the balcony - even when (literally) leaning over the side, standing on our tip toes on the balcony, etc. The receptionist and (later) two managers confirmed to us that this was not a mistake. Our assigned room, and many other rooms with no ocean views, are classified as ocean view rooms and sold as such. The rooms that actually have ocean views are called \"ocean front\" rooms and are solely reserved for time share owners. The receptionist tried to \"help\" us by sending us to another ocean view room (which did at least have a distant view of the ocean). However, while examining that room, another family arrived who was surprised to find us in the room that they had specifically reserved a few months in an advance.. The receptionist then sent us to another ocean view room from which one can only see trees and car parks, and again, not a sliver of the ocean to be seen. After that, we were told by a manager that we were welcome to move to another hotel if we wanted to see the ocean from our room, since the Westin Vila Resort had no rooms for non-owner guests from which the ocean could be seen. We called a few hotels (Sheraton, Hyatt, Ritz, Four Seasons) but all were fully booked if we wanted two adjoining rooms with ocean view. We then understood why the manager could not care less about us - we didn't have a lot of choices. We finally found rooms in another hotel that would become available after a couple of days and told the manager that we would be happy to move. It was at that point that the manager said they would try their best and then found us a room with a view of the ocean (which apparently was an \"ocean front\" room). Bear in mind that even the \"ocean front\" rooms partially face other blocks of rooms due to the angular way in which the Westin Villas have been constructed. We have stayed in other resorts which had fully ocean facing rooms, but the Westin Villa's structure trades this benefit for maximizing the number of rooms which (theoretically) allow a glimpse of the ocean from at least some angle of the room or balcony. The manager promised to charge us (lower) \"island view\" rates for the first two nights that we were stuck with no ocean view. We asked to review the bill a couple of days early to make sure he had done what he agreed. Not only was the credit not given to us, but Westin had added so many debits and credits that the bill was incomprehensible. Of course, the total came up to be higher than what it should have been. The billing was the last straw. I had a fit because we lost so much time walking around the compound looking at different rooms, liaising with the staff about the rooms, looking for another hotel to move, and then trying to sort out the billing. In the end, Westin took off the room charge for the first 2 nights. Service - quality of service varies greatly from person to person. We have never seen such great variation at a hotel. I believe this comes down to poor management and poor staff training, and as a result quality of service comes down to your luck and the individual. The first manager snubbed us (his attitude was more or less \"too bad, so sad\" until we found another hotel which could accommodate us after the first 3 nights) whereas the second manager tried to help. Customer reps on their in house \"service express\" line can be very friendly or very rude. As an example, housekeeping forgot to clean our room one day. I called to ask for someone to come in 2 hours but was told to call back when I was ready. I said I will be ready in 2 hours. The customer rep repeated that I should call back then and hung up the phone on me. Housekeeping staff always seem unhappy. Cleanliness - poor. The housekeeping forgot to clean our rooms twice. When they did come, they only did the most noticeable parts, such as the bedding and the towels. They didn't always vacuum and never cleaned the countertops in the kitchen (unless they deliberately kept the mess on the floor and the countertop). Pots I pulled out of the dishwasher were not clean, when they did not just leave the used pots on the stove. They have even forgotten (giving them the benefit of the doubt) to clean the sink so it was filled with debris. Places such as the back of the make-up mirror were covered with dust. I normally would not have noticed that had our baby son not tried to play with every thing. Rooms - Of the ones we've seen, some are tired (two of the rooms we saw had sofas with threadbare cushions) and lack maintenance whereas others are new and reasonably nice. Ground - well manicured and pretty. It also has a nice pond with beautiful fish. Restaurants - only three, not many choices on their menus either. Food in all three is fine. Not spectacular but not bad either. Pools - a bit small for such a large compound. Beaches - good snorkeling, nice sandy beach with reasonably calm water.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Napa, California", "Title": "\u201cBest Maui Vacation to date\u201d", "Author": "Latbrat16", "ReviewID": "UR117922223", "Content": "Just returned from spending 12 days in Paradise.

We enjoyed the pool side service for drinks and would like to give a special recognition to Kelsey. She was always very friendly and came around often throughout the day to ask if she could get us anything. My friends and I were in a two bedroom lockoff and I thought the rooms were very nice and pretty spacious but we didn't actually spend much time there. The only complaint we had is that there is only one light for the entire bathroom and when one person gets up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, they either have to do so in the dark so that they don't disturb the other person or turn on all the lights. I should note that I did have one issue with the Customer Service provided by the Front Desk staff at the end of my vacation that left a sour taste in my mouth. The night before checking out, I requested a copy of my bill just to review all of my charges for the week and found a charge that I did not believe was mine so I requested a copy of the receipt. After waiting for some time the associate at the front desk received it and said that it was billed to me in error and would be removed from my bill. However, when I get to my room, I receive a call from the front desk asking if one of the guests in my party is named XXX and says that the charge is for them. When I ask my guest if they made such a charge and they say no, I tell the associae that I will come down to review the receipt immediately. She says that is not necessary and she will leave a copy at the front desk for me to review the next morning when I am leaving. Well the next morning when I am leaving the receipt is nowhere to be found and another copy needs to be requested so once again I'm forced to wait for a copy of the receipt. (the chrages are still on my final bill) In the meantime, my shuttle has now arrived to take me to the airport and when I'm asking the associate if there is some way to speed up the process she says I can go get the receipt myself at the North Front Desk (I was staying in the South area). So I have my airport shuttle transport me to the North Area and there appears to be only one person on duty there, who is helping another guest and I can no longer wait. I immediately call to speak with the Manager and end up leaving a voice message. An hour and a half passes without a return phone call, so I call again. I finally reach the Manager and the charges are determined not to be mine, so they are finally removed from my bill.

Mark calmed us down brought in housecleaning and provided Dinner at Pulehu, a restraunt at the resort. The staff their spoiled us, especially my four year old daughter. Food is amazing by the way.

We loved the room, and the customer service from the bell desk and the front desk was great. The grounds were very impressive. We had a 1-bdrm in Bldg 3 with a pool and ocean view to the side...all very lovely to wake up to after such a long flight from Calgary. We found the bed very comfortable and the amount of room for us and our boys (ages 4 and 6) to be perfect. The kitchen was stocked with the utensils, pots, etc. that we needed. We were on the 2nd floor and part of our view looked onto the back of the Pool Cafe, but the noise from the restaurant was the only issue (wait staff dropping plates, etc.). Above ground parking was ample and easy to access. My only one issue with the hotel was with inconsistency with the rules about the water slide. The water-sports center that oversees the slide was inconsistent with what was allowed and not allowed. On the first day, my boys wore life jackets down the slide - just to be safe - and they had a blast; only to be told the next day - after 10 turns down the slide with their life jackets on - that they were not allowed to go down the slide with the jackets on, and the attendant overseeing the slide made them sit to the side (why not send them back down?) while I waited anxiously at the bottom because some time had passed since they had gone up. Then we were also told that we were not allowed to 'catch' our kids at the bottom of the slide - another inconsistency because throughout our 10 days there, we noticed some parents were allowed to catch their kids and some were literally scolded for doing so. Imagine having to explain that the rules are not always the same to a 4 and 6 year old! Also, kids who were going down the slide doing turns, etc. were not 'reprimanded'. There are actually rules on the board about doing things like that down the slide. Clearly, a blind eye was turned to many things. When I approached the water-sports center, they told me that there were liability issues. OK. I totally get that. However, if that's the case...make the rules consistent and visible and post it along with the other rules on the board. I was also disappointed that when I tried to reach the manager on duty, my call was never returned. I was able to speak to Cameron, the manager of the water-sports centre, who started to re-explain the liability issue, but we got cut off, and he never returned my call again. We paid a pretty penny for this resort and I would expect that calls would be returned and concerns would be followed up until closure. One other thing was that the cleaning staff missed doing our room one day. Other than that, only our sheets and towels were done the other days. Sticky sunscreened floors were a bit gross to walk on after 10 days! (cleaning should be provided every day for renters). Having said that, we did not let these inconsistencies ruin our trip, we enjoyed the ocean and beautiful beach that was only 2 minutes from our building and my kids had fun at the Keiki pool (pirate ship) even though it was a bit young for them. The location on Kaanapali Beach is fantastic! We also made use of the Late Departure Lounge which provided safe storage for our daypacks and the front desk was more than happy to provide me with a safety deposit box for our passports, etc. that we didn't want to leave in the lockers. It was easy to enjoy a full day on the beach and in the pool and be able to clean up before getting on the plane. I would not recommend eating there due to the outrageous cost for what you get.

The kitchenette was a really nice touch- with a cook top, microwave, toaster, and small fridge/freezer, plus the bbq tools (and access to a bunch of bbqs around the property), you can make as many meals in the unit as you like, and you can easily warm up leftovers. There is plenty of parking in the basement, with lots of elevators. There are also free shuttles that go to Lahaina and the other Westin (to the south) to get you around. The pools are pretty good- there are some water slides and a pirate ship play area for the kids, and there is an adults only pool (although it is small and seems like an afterthought). The beach is only a few steps away, and actually has a very nice reef for snorkeling. Just head to the northern most portion of the property and swim out from there. The reef stretches for several hundred feet in both directions, and is very close to shore. There were eels, a turtle, and fish of all kinds.

Other nice touches: -Rooms are well insulated from noise (other than hearing the loud \"clack\" of your neighbor's door) -HBO included, as well as a DVD player (there is a Redbox down the street at Walgreens) -Free wireless internet -Washer and dryer in unit Minor nits to pick: -Each unit has a shared entryway which means that you have to use your key twice to get in your unit (once on the shared door, and then again on your own door). The shared entryway also means that you clearly hear the shared door and your neighbor's door close. We were awoken by our neighbor's door a couple of times. The plus to the entryway setup is that you are well insulated from any noise in the hallway. Of course, if you want to tweak your neighbor just wait for them to leave and then use the security bar on the shared door- they won't be able to get back in! -You can't just head down to the pool and ask for a towel- you have to get towel cards from the front desk. They keep track of how many cards are issued to each guest, and each card can be exchanged for a towel. A little surprising that the resort is so concerned about losing towels when the rooms are at this price point. -Not enough outlets around the room to plug in phones and laptops. -No iPod dock on the Bose system.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cWestin - just average\u201d", "Author": "marenostrum", "ReviewID": "UR116676121", "Content": "I want to do justice to this very big investment on Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach. The Westin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153product\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is slightly different than the Westin Hotel system since this property is geared more towards timeshares than a hotel. During the 10 days that we stayed, the property was at 100% capacity and we experienced these service strains. The vast majority of guests were families with children. So, a tranquil spot may be a slight challenge to find. The beach does offer some repose to the packed hotel. I am sure that the experience would be very different in low/off season. The good news- - We had a one bedroom corner unit with a Mountain view. It was very spacious and comfortable. The internet/wifi is free and room service although it can take upwards of 1 hour, was very good. This permitted us to avoid the crowds. - Given that it is condo living, the local Safeway and the market across the street made for great food variety. - The fish and chips were surprisingly good and the Margherita pizza warmed in the oven after delivery was tasty. - The Concierge in each of the buildings is a nice feature. The mediocre news- - For such a large population and seven buildings, I was surprised with the limited restaurants on site. Yet, you can take a shuttle to the (Hotel) Westin and Sheraton for dinner. - This portion of Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali beach is narrow and you have limited access to beach chairs & umbrellas (for which you pay). - You are regularly approach for time share solicitations. - Housekeeping services were erratic notwithstanding we were considered Hotel guests and should have had it every day. The bad news- - The beach services are woefully overpriced with $75 stand-up paddle lessons for 30 minutes or bogie board rental for $18 per day. - The beach chairs an umbrella is around $40 and get this...only until 4:30pm! They collect all items very early. - It is very hard to find pool chairs if you arrive later in the day (say after a morning excursion) With the pluses and minuses, we spent much time away from the property so that its shortcomings were not felt so much. Apart from the golf outings, we had an all day hiking expedition (Kayak & waterfall hike) www.hikemaui.com ; a sailing snorkeling trip to Molokini; an all day Lanai boat trip with abundant snorkeling and swimming www.mauioceanriders.com; a trip to Haleakala; naturally two days of two hour surf lessons from www.goofyfootsufschool.com with groups of max 5 people and many others around you; and the obligatory and well performed luau with excellent food in Lahaina www.oldlahainaluau.com . These activities are guaranteed to make your kids sleep at night! As for restaurants, we tried all three on property which were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153okay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6tasty items were the pizza from the Italian Restaurant and the fish & chips. And it stops there. Other dining options that we experienced were as locals say ONO (good): Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish House, a little far since you are going back to the airport, but worth the drive; Merriman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at Kapalua, only 10 minutes away, dined twice, expensive great views and totally worth it; Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian Restaurant in Lahaina, 10 minutes away with complimentary valet parking so that you can walk around after dinner; Pacific O & its sister restaurant I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122O both located at 505 Front Street are very good. Pacific O offers great al fresco dining with a wonderful view. In summary, I think that when we go back to Maui, we will be exploring other lodging options, perhaps in Wailea or if in Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali another hotel. Background- as part of our three week golf vacation, we stayed on three islands, three hotels and played 7 different courses totaling 12 rounds. On the Big Island, we stayed at Mauna Kea Beach hotel and played Hapuna, Makalei and Mauna Kea. On Maui, we stayed at the Westin Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Ocean Villas and played Kapalua, Makena, Wailea Emerald & Gold. On Oahu, we stayed at the Royal Hawaiian but did not play golf.

We stopped by the reservation desk on way to dinner and reminded them that housekeeping never came to look at the problem. I stated that if the problem could not be fixed we would like another room once we finished with dinner (ate at grill next to pool, surprisingly good food). The front desk was nice in handling the problem and were able to move us rooms, which was appreciated. Downside, we were \"downgraded\" to smaller room but ant free, so no complaints. When we went to get our luggage to move rooms a note had been placed on the door by housekeeping that the ants had been cleaned and \"poisoned\" to kill off the ants. Surprise, the ants were still coming in from the outside and had spread to the table in the living room. Luckily we got out of there quick! Room keys did not originally work in the new room, so after walking back and forth a couple more times we finally made it in around 10p. Smaller studio room was nice however, the kitchen could use some better utensils/cookware and shutters from bed looking straight into bathroom was a bit strange.

It was our first time to Hawaii. The Westin Villas were really great. We stayed in Building 3, which was right on the pool and had a view of the ocean. The North Villas looked awesome and are newer. However, both properties were top notch. The rooms were spacious and typical Westin vacation villas. The concierge when we checked in was awesome. Usually, the first thing they try to do is set you up for a tour, but she was very helpful before even talking to us about a tour. If you want to make the trip somewhat affordable, take advantge of the kitchens. The Safeway down the street is expensive, everything you read is true. However, we have a Safeway card, and saved about $75.00 for the week with the card. Their produce isnt very good and is expensive, and I recommend that you try the farmers market acroos the highway near the Sugar train for local fruits. There are also farmers markets on different days in various locations that are well worth it. I highly recommend you find those instead of buying produce at the grocery stores. The grills at the Villas are huge, really nice and are cleaned every day. There are tables to eat dinner outside and watch the sunset that is just gorgeous. We grilled almost every night. I highly recommend that you make reservations for the Old Lahaina luau before you get to Maui. That is the one a lot of people and books recommend. We could not get in because I didnt make reservations in advance. We went to the Westin Maui Luau and it was really well done, and the food is very good. They had fire knife dancers that were great. The only thing they dont have is the pig ceremony where they take the pig out of the ground after cooking it all day. I do recommend you get the premium seating because you get right in, dont have to wait in line and get to sit in the first three rows. The show looked pretty small from the back. it was nice after a night of Mai Tais to take the shuttle home to the Villas instead of driving. We went on a catamaran snorkeling trip on the Hula Girl, and it was great. Some people in the villas complained about the ones they were on (with different companies), but I thought ours was excellent. If you want to do local snorkeling, around Black Rock near the Sheraton is really good, we saw sea turtles, and took the Westin shuttle down. We did the road to Hana and stayed over one night in Hana because I was worried about driving back. It is very tiring. The roads are hard to navigate. However, you can definitely do it one day if you leave early enough. I wish we had done it in one day instead of two. My kids were climbing the walls the next day. If you are bringing kids, defintely do the stops at the waterfalls or on the black sand beach, anywhere where you can swin or hike a little. They do start to get sitr crazy looking at plants and oceans for 6 hours. There really is nothing in Hana for kids but a great beach. Dont expect to find anything there once you get there. I do HIGHLY recommend Coconut Glen's ice cream right before Hana. The ice cream is awesome and the experience is too. We bought the \"Maui Revealed\" book and followed it on the road to Hana. It was excellent in showing us where to go. I also bought the road to hana audio tour but it wasnt good at all. By the way, the Maui Revealed book was worth every penny. It was spot on with every activity we did in Maui and was a great resource for restaurants with good food at decent prices too. The only downside to the resort is the pool chair situation. If you arent out there early, you might as well forget it. I know I was there at peak season, but I would like to see more chairs for guests. It was really frustrating, and we ended up renting chairs for the beach at $12 per chair per day, plus $20 for the umbrella just to have somewhere to sit.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Bend, Washington", "Title": "\u201cLuxury, good service and a heavenly bed\"\u201d", "Author": "washingtontraveler78", "ReviewID": "UR116325429", "Content": "We had a lovely stay at the Westin Kaanapalli Ocean Resort Villas North.

I'm a Platinum member with Starwood and I have stayed at a number of Starwood properties. This is by far the worst one I have ever stayed at. I emailed the hotel four times prior to arrival and for whatever reason they were unable to tell me whether I could anticipate an upgrade being a Platinum member. Little did I know this is because this is practically a glorified apartment complex completely filled with time share owners. Here is what has transpired so far: -Check in and ask for an upgrade due to being a Platinum member. I call literally 1 hour prior to check in and they cannot tell me if I'm going to be upgraded. Therefore I pack up the family (after having stayed at the Sheraton on Maui which was absolutely fantastic by the way. I highly recommend this property over the Villas). I check in and they do give me an upgrade from the studio to the 1-bedroom villa. Excellent, or at least so I think. My upgrade is on the 2nd floor, facing the pool directly over the walkway to the pool. Normally a pool view isn't bad, however when there is literally a 24/7 frat party going on at the pool being directly over the walkway to the pool insn't my idea of an upgrade. As soon as I opened up the patio door I could literally hear about 100 people shouting and screaming during an avid game of pool volleyball. Oh by the way, the jacuzzi is open 24 hours (use your imagination here). -Kids: Keep in mind that I brought my two kids and I have to say that aside from a Justin Bieber concert I've never seen more kids in one concentrated area then I have here at the Westin villas. When we first arrived I kid you not that there were literally 50-60 kids in the pool at once, all screaming and dunking each other. Not exactly what I signed up for. -Patio Grills: Good luck gettiing one of these. You literally have to fight the guy in the 24 Jimmie Johnson wife beater and cut-off jean shorts to get one. Keep in mind he's the same guy who just got back from Costco and purchased about 20 lbs of 2-day old chicken, 5 gallons of potato salad and a pony keg of Old Milwaukee. Good luck with that! -Cleaning: Ah yes, you would think that if a resort charged $500-$600/night that it would include cleaning. Not at the Westin Villas. We stayed 5 nights and the room was cleaned once. If you want it cleaned daily you need to pony up an additional $25/night. What a deal! -Getting a Lounge Chair at the Pool: Good lluck!! Be prepared to get up around 6:00 am and beat the stampede of time share owners down to the pool to get anything withing a 100 ft radius of the pool. The great thing is that everyone will reserve 4-6 chairs by putting towels down and then leave to go back to the room for 2 hours. Plan on spending your time at the beach. -The Beach: You mean all 10 feet of sand that runs from the resort to the water. Don't forget the 45% angle the beach is on so if you love lying out in the sun diagonally then by all means this is your place. -The Room: Toilet doesn't flush; Shower broke and we had to call maintenance; ceiling fan runs at about 3 mph; did I mention that you have to pay to get it cleaned? Oh yeah. -Pool: On Day 3 we decided to try our chances at the pool around 4:00 pm. As we stroll up from the beach we notice a number of people leaving the pool area and heading up to their rooms. I look at my wife and think \"could this be the moment? could we actually get a lounge chair?\" As we get closer to the pool one of the 'security guards' informs us that one of the 8 million little kids decided to drop a Baby Ruth in the pool. That's right folks, a brown log, a muddy missle. In my 38 years of existence I've never had to vacate a pool because some little kid dropped a log in the pool. After asking around this appears to happen quite frequently. They literally close the pool on the spot. We head back to the room and I call the front desk to ask if perhaps they could give us a free movie for the inconvenience. Their response was to send us to the South Pool, which is about a 1/2 mile away. I'm sure it won't be crowded after the 5,000 people at the North pool mosey on over there. -Pool Service: Good luck getting someone to wait on you. We had one server literally walk past us 15 times and not once ask us if we wanted something to drink or eat. He was more concerned with the 15 college kids ordering drinks. Unless you're in a group of 10 or more you may as well do yourself a favor and walk up to the bar yourself. -Use of other Starwood properties: Not so fast!! Being a Westin Villa guest they do not allow you access to the other Westin property or the Starwood (which is awesome by the way!!!). You're stuck fighting the 12.4 billion people staying at the resort for pool chairs and space in the pool-that is if you can dodge the feces some little shaver decides to spit out. -Accommodating: Don't be fooled by the token replies you see by the Westin staff on TripAdvisor. They sent me one as well. They make it appear as if they're so accommodating. I requested to transfer my stay (after 3 hours of being there) back to the Sheraton) and everyone approved it (Sheraton, SPG Platinum) and they said no. Keep in mind they were at 98% occupancy so they literally had about 5-6 rooms available. Thus the sweet upgrade over the walkway to the pool. The Sheraton somehow is rated two categories below the Westin Villas (have no idea how this happened) and yet they still flat out denied my request. Their response was to pay 50% off the rack rate and not give me any of my money back. Yeah, they're real accommodating. Seriously, you'll see a ton of responses from the Westin staff. It's all a big marketing ploy. They don't accommodate anyone! Trust me on this one. I busted my tail to become a Platinum member and have spent thousands of dollars over the last 12 months and they couldn't even transfer my reservation to what they claim is an inferior property. If you're even contemplating staying here please reconsider. If you love being around 2.3 million kids (and that's real close to the actual amount) and you enjoy little ones dropping Caddyshack like Baby Ruth's in the pool then by all means pony up the $500/night and knock yourself out. If you don't want an atmosphere that reminds you of a glorified apartment complex then you'd be better off staying at the Days Inn.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kailua-Kona, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "badger808", "ReviewID": "UR115939683", "Content": "We have stayed at other Starwood properties very similar to this.

We have always looked forward to our stay at the Westin, as we did on the occasion of our present visit. Unfortunately, our current trip has been met with repeated disappointment and unpleasantries. One of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privileges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of ownership is the ability to secure a room of your choice (by location floor, etc.) in advance. As an owner, one can place a request a year in advance. As usual, a year to the day before our stay we requested several room options in an area we know to be more quiet (albeit with noise from the road very near the Resort), and to offer us a good view of the ocean and island of Lanai. The system the Resort uses assigns the room not when you make you request, but only a few weeks before your arrival date. Further, if one of the rooms you had requested is not available you will not know that until your arrival. Instead of a top floor room with a nice view of Lanai we were presented with a second floor room overlooking the parking lot of the park next to the Resort. We purposefully chose the park side of the Resort as we have found this be a quieter side of the facility. Being on the park side was a request of ours; however, every other request was ignored (high floor, close to the ocean and suggested room numbers). The Resort claimed to not be able to move us to a different room anywhere near our selection made one year prior, claiming that moving someone else would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfair.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We were initially offered a room facing the interior of the Resort, an option we did not prefer due to prior experience with noise coming from the guests using the 24-hour hot tub. We agreed to stay in this room until other options were presented to us. Later that day we were advised we could change to a room overlooking the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool of the adjoining hotel, a room more than half-way back of the Resort with a limited view of the ocean, or a second floor room closer to the ocean. The hot tub is open all night. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quiet time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is supposedly at 10 p.m. when the pool closes, but as in the past, the noise from guests in the hot tub is not regulated, and the hot tub festivities went well past 10 p.m. As the noise permeated our room we chose to not stay in that room and instead chose the second floor room nearer the ocean. This room is not near the hot tub but near some outdoor grills. A group at the grill area decided to party after their barbeque towards midnight. Again the Resort failed to regulate its noise standards. We called and the response we received was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes we have had several calls about the noise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd About an hour after we first called, the party was stopped by security. It should not have taken an hour to accomplish this, given the 10 p.m. curfew. As our room is above a service path there were Resort staff frequenting this path through the night. At about 11 p.m. the staff would disassemble potions of the grills, put these metal pieces into plastic carts and push these down the path that is about 20 feet from our lanai. This made quite the racket. Very early in the morning Resort attendees would straighten chairs, rake the grounds, and push more carts about the facility. As there are more guests than chairs the shaded spots are at a premium. If you are not down by the pool by 7 a.m. forget about getting a shaded spot by the pool. Guests are reserving pool chairs for hours at a time in the morning without been seen. We anticipated this so several weeks we tried to reserve a gazebo. The Resort at which we are staying has only four large gazebos, so we knew reserving one of these would be difficult. When we called to reserve a one we were told to place the request via e-mail via an out-sourced corporation, not affiliated with Westin. Apparently this company handles pool reservations for several other resorts in the area. We did that and never heard back. We called and e-mailed again but again, no response. By the time of our arrival none of the large gazebos were available. We have also found the guests of the Resort to ignore or flaunt the Resort rules. In addition to ignoring quiet time and reserving chairs for endless periods of time, smoking on the Resort premises and in/around the Resort rooms is another example. While the villas are smoke-free, there is no rule against smoking on the lanais or at the pool. We have awoken to the smell of cigarette smoke in our room and the smell of cigarette smoke while standing on our lanai in the evening. Finally, although expressing our extreme displeasure regarding our room assignment there is been absolutely no follow-up with the Resort as to our present accommodations. Considering the above we will not likely ever stay at this facility on our return visit to Maui. Apparently our ownership interest and ongoing payment of yearly dues, fees and taxes do not matter.

This is a spectacular resort . We have been to Maui on several occasions. On this trip, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want or feel the need to explore the island. We were looking to spend a week relaxing and doing little more than lounging around the pool and beach. I was a little concerned beforehand by the number of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family friendly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd comments I read about the resort. My kids are grown and I have reached a point in life where I want a more adult environment. That being said, I did not find the large number of families staying there took away from my enjoyment of the resort. Probably, because the overall environment of the resort is so relaxing that one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tolerance level is increased. You just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be bothered by petty annoyances here. We exchanged with I.I. for a studio which was more than adequate for just the two of us. The efficiency kitchen was equipped with a stove (no oven) dishwasher and a mini-fridge. There was an adequate supply of dishes and utensils. The bathroom was spacious with a large Jacuzzi tub and separate steam shower. The room was equipped with a washer and dryer. We were fortunate to have a full balcony. Most studio units do not have this feature. Thank you Suzy Porter at the front desk for this perk! There are very few ocean front units at the resort. Most units do have a partial ocean view. The degree of that view varies from building to building. On a side note, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen several comments where people have complained about their views. If you paid for an ocean view, you have every right to complain and to get what you paid for. If you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for an ocean view, quit your whining. You have no right to show up at the resort and demand something you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for. We made use of many of the resort amenities. The pools are spacious and relaxing. There are plenty of deck chairs with a decent amount of umbrellas and side tables. This is one of the few resorts I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to where they make some attempt to enforce the no saving of deck chair rules. In the morning, staff tags those chairs that appear to be being saved. If the chair is still unused an hour later, they open it up. I know this rule is tough to enforce but at least they make an effort. The beach at the resort is spectacular. There is a great snorkeling reef right off the WKV shoreline. We made good use of the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBQ grills. The grills sit right on the shoreline and make for a great sunset dining spot. There are several tables there as well and the spot can get crowed at dinner time. We used the free resort shuttle to do dinner at Whalers Village on a couple of nights and took a short walk north to Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on another night. The breakfast buffet poolside is a good spot to start your day. We did a 1 hour couples massage at the spa. The spa was adequate but nothing special. The resort brings in different vendors throughout the week that sell local products and arts. They are only there once a week so if you see something you want, buy it then. Groceries and fresh fish markets are nearby but do require a car for convenience. I found the staff to be exceptional. Every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful. They seemed genuinely concerned about my needs and enjoyment. Every resort says customer service is their top priority, WKV actually backs it up. There were some minor flaws I noticed but frankly, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re so trivial I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even bring them up.

Very nice staff, they unload your stuff and valet parking is free for the first night. We did the check-in at 3:15 and could go to our room right away. Some other people seemed to have to wait for theirs. The lobby is absolutely beautiful, very contemporary but kind of exotic in a good non-tacky way. We got room 8504 which was oceanfront (totally unexpected!) We were very impressed with the room; that ocean view was breathtaking and when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting it, I guess it feels even better. We had the studio, which was pretty spacious compared to other studios we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had in the past. When you come in, there is like a little foyer that has a door leading to the 1-bedroom unit next door when those lock-offs are turned into 2-bedroom suites. That little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foyer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was practical throughout our stay to leave all our beach stuff and leave the sand right there. You also have a washer dryer in that corner: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a regular size washer, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough for 2. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have one detergent package when you arrive and they give you another one when they do your room refresh. Once you pass that little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foyer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, you have a little kitchenette across the bathroom. The fridge is a decent size fridge with a freezer; plenty of space for all your juices, soft drinks etc, and a good size veggie compartment. You also have 2 electric burners, it takes time to boil water but they are fine. The dishwasher is pretty small, if you eat all your meals in the suite, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably need to use the dishwasher everyday. I believe we got 4 dishwasher detergent units throughout the stay. And I had brought along a couple capsules from home. There is no regular oven, but a micro-wave-convection oven. Other than that you have the regular appliances: toaster, coffee maker, can opener, blender. The bathroom is great, even though there was one thing I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like: the lack of storage. There were no drawers in the bathroom to store all kinds of toiletries. The Jacuzzi that separates the sleeping area from the bathroom is quite large, same for the shower, we loved both. The bed was extremely comfortable, there is a reason for their name: heavenly beds! We slept like babies! The two side tables had two deep drawers: great storage.. The entertainment unit has good storage as well. We loved the Bose cd player, that was a nice touch as we could plug our ipod into it. The living area is good, the sofa is quite comfy, with those 2 ottomans, it was pleasant to sit back and relax in front of the tv. The dining table is small, but enough for 2 to dine. The lanai was our favorite part with 2 chairs and a small coffee table: we had most of our breakfasts out there. The resort. The resort was absolutely beautiful and we really loved the size of it. We were there off-season so it might seem a little over-crowded during peak season, especially with kids running around. Over the week, we probably stayed a couple of mornings by the pool and it was very pleasant. There are some cabanas you can rent for $90/day, they come with 4 long chairs. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t order any cocktails as it was a little early, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on those. The grounds are very well kept, we loved hanging out by the koi fish pond but we also used that great boardwalk along the beach. They seem to offer various activities but we were out and about most days so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take advantage of them. The beach right in front of the resort is narrow but was fine when we were there. Not sure if it would during peak season. You can rent a chair on the beach for $15 and an umbrella for $25 (I think but not 100% sure). We just bought a cheap umbrella from Times for $15 which we used the whole week at all beaches we went to. The snorkeling in front of the resort is great, we even saw turtles so we were quite excited. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way nicer if you go down to Black rock, which is a 10-15 minute walk from the resort. You can rent the gear at the resort but we rented ours at Snorkel Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which is a 5 minute drive away and a little cheaper, especially if you rent your gear by the week. There are several BBQ you can use but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use them. Every evening it seemed like they were all in use so I guess they worked fine but you might want to get there early to make sure you have a spot. Food I cannot comment on the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants as we never had a meal there: we liked going out to Lahaina or Whaler Village in the evenings. We went once to their little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but it is very pricey so most of the time we just drove down to Times (5 minutes away) where we found that prices are similar to what we have back home (Vancouver, BC). Transportation You get free valet parking the first day which is nice when you have all the luggage and the check-in to take care of. After the first day, parking is free if you park your car yourself. We also used the shuttle many times to go to the Whaler Village and Lahaina, it runs frequently and it was never full (off-season perk I guess).

The grounds on the property were excellent, the transportation options to and from the hotel were a nice touch, the kids club is really the only thing that needs some attention. It is okay but a bit small and I think some bigger games and things to do for 7-10 year old children is a must. My kids wanted to participate in the kids club from prior experience at other SPG properties and that is the feedback we got from them. They know....they are there. The food and drinks were very good and were not overly priced but $5.95 for a soda is offensive and something does need to be corrected there.

Some staff mentioned they were at 100% capacity...never a good sign on what purports to be a high-end resort. It had something of the feel of a nice Marriott, not as clean as in the past, not as efficient and much too hectic to be pleasant. The mad dash for a decent set of chaises has reached absurd proportions. (For God's sake, get some form of portable umbrellas and cushions!!!) Even poolside service was slow, erratic and spotty. As an owner we'd like to see some recognition in our treatment of the ever-increasing maintenance fees we pay to support the operation. We were surrounded by what appeared to be conventioneers and unnecessarily aggressive Asians. One night we ate at the South grill. It happened to be their \"crab feast\", with tables struggling to crack open crab legs for some small semblance of meat. None of us like crack, so we opted for the limited menu options. HORRIBLE! perhaps the worst meal in Hawaii. Clearly each dish was a microwaved retread of something cooked and refrigerated earlier in the day. We dined several evenings at Pulehu. Excellent both times. Impeccable service and excellent meals. The real shining exception, I'm sorry to say. It seemed to me--and, if pressed I'm not sure I could tell you why--that there were people there, using the facilities, who were not Resort guests. Just little bits and pieces of comments we were picking up. Then it occurred to me that the public beach was adjacent and anyone could simply walk on and grab chairs and access to some nice pools. For the first time, I found this stay tiring. The entire feel was frenetic and jumpy, dramatically overcrowded. Everything felt rushed and challenged. Even the \"chair patrol\" seemed an unnecessary intrusion, albeit one I believe has become quite necessary; far too many guests throw down a towel and disappear for hours while others wander hopelessly looking for a quiet place to relax, read and soak up some rays. Wireless internet is, today, a necessity. It works reasonably well in the rooms but is quite spotty outside. Some booster devices would be welcome. Frankly, I think management needs to get a bit more creative in finding solutions to some of the issues. You can't charge like a Westin and convey an ambiance like a Holiday Inn. In the future it's likely we'll either identify quieter times to visit or we'll head elsewhere.

Thanks especially to the pool guys at the slide pool who supplied air for my ridiculously large lounge float!

The ($6) drinks of the day were fun to try, and we did our best to try a lot of them! Mango Madness and Ocean Tropical Rita were standouts. Happy hour at both poolside bars is 4-6 p.m., and the mai-tais were great. Good lemonade for the soft-drink set. Also loved the kettle chips with Maui sweet onion dip at Pailolo. Yum! The beach in front of the villas is fantastic. There IS a big and quick drop-off, so watch out for your kids, but the immediate access to a beautiful coral reef is unbeatable.

Only negatives were in the bathroom (some mold around shower door) and bird poop in balcony. Pools A All pools were clean and well kept, plenty of towels, cold drinking water for guests, small slide for kids on South side. Both Kiddie pools were excellent, especially the Pirate Ship in the North Tower. No negatives really. Lobby,Sorounding Areas and Beach A Very clean, well decorated, no issues AT ALL. Beach is just a few minutes away and it was VERY clean, however, BE CAREFUL with little ones, it goes from shallow to deep QUICK and there is a reef so be careful when entering the water. Staff A Courteous, helpful, no issues either. They are a plus for sure. Jacob at fron desk was A++ Check in/out A- We checked in late so it wasn't crowded but the check out was a bit slower due to an onslaught of arriving guests, still acceptable and not really an issue if you do the express check out which we could not do since we were \"transferring\" to the Westin down the street, the attendant still called the hotel and arranged an early check in. Restaurants A We had lunch at pool side, food was good and service was very good. We had dinner at the Italian restaurant and it was very good, great food and good service. No complaints. Parking B Only issue with parking is the small spaces, we had a full size car and it was not easy parking if other full size cars or mini-vans were in the tri-spots...not a major issue but one may need to look around for the right spot which can mean a long walk back to the room. Not an issue if you get a compact or smaller which of course, may not work for large families. Elevators A Worked the whole time we were there, were clean and fast.

I was told that they were booked solid, and they had nothing better, but maybe if I checked back in a day or two. I complained that I had made my reservation 6 months prior and had requested the best possible ocean view. I felt he then implieded that because I had made my reservation through a company other than the hotel and made it outside the window(?, don't know what he ment by that) that my room was the best they could offer me. He did check for about 20 minutes to find something, but he said I probably wouldn't be any happier with what he had avialable. He said he would keep checking, and they did move us into a better room about 4 hours later. It was a handicapped room and the studio did not have a shower which I found very strange. A deep tub with a hand-held shower head was all it had. Since we also had a 1 bedroom next door, also handicapped, but with a shower it worked out fine. We did enjoy staying at North Kaanapali, verses Kaanapali. THe hotel had a much bigger pool and more grassy area to play. Only had one day at noon that we couldn't find an empty lounge chair, but some opened up fairly quickly. I wish they would remove towels from chairs after one hour all day long. They only tag from 7-11. So you could get a chair at 11 and hog it all day long, as many families did. The FULL kitchen in the one bedrooms is AWESOME! Full size fridge, stove and oven, and everything you need. Saved us a lot of money with our family of 7. We had cereal, breakfast meat, sandwich fixings, snacks, soda's, and alcohol in the room. Bought it at Safeway down the road. All the kids (age 10-23) enjoyed the pool. The slide wasn't a big hit, too slow. Hyatt has a great slide! The restaurants weren't the greatest. Walked to Duke's next door two days in a row. Get the one bedroom over the studio. The studio balconies, from what I saw, couldn't fit a chair on them. Request the 6th floor or North towers. Building 4 is awful. Too many trees to allow a view. We were in building 3, 3rd floor overlooking the pool. Housekeeping was another roller coaster. For some reason the studio was cleaned early, but our one bedroom was cleaned later in the afternoon, and skipped twice. They didn't always clean the stovetop or dining room table. Had to request shampoo and conditioner. Almost ran out of toilet paper, down to one roll before they restocked. Never got a clean glass in the bathroom.

We got 2 adjoining rooms so the kids could stay in another room. The pluses were the really comfortable bed (never slept so well!) and the really quiet atmosphere despite the resort being really busy. Housekeeping also came late, but I tipped them $10 every day and encourage you to do the same. You get what you give! Service improved after the first day. The rooms are quiet: You hear the occasional kid screaming in the hall but never a slamming door. The showers are instant hot and nice and big. The kitchenette was really convenient for cooking, there is a full size fridge and freezer and small microwave and oven. Even had a blender for my smoothies, yeah!. They provide dishes and utensils and cooking pots. But No salt and pepper or foil etc. Gotta buy your own. There is a small store in the lobby for this, with resort prices of course. Also, you can donate your leftover unopened food to the local food bank at the end of your stay... which is very green and selfless. The Really big down side is the sucky Wifi internet connection. Mind you when you go on vacation you should leave the connectivity at home... yeah I know ;))... but it was really frustrating to get dial up internet connection speed on their crappy WiFi network. Everyone at the pool griped about this, too. A couple next to us asked us if we had the same problem and others around us chimed in. It did make for some lively human connectivity to have to gripe about the internet though so I guess that is the gift... but again.... the Westin WiFi is somewhere between sux and blows! The on site restaurants are okay food wise but are over priced of course... its a resort they have to make money. Kobe burger... gotta be kidding.. it is not worth $20! On a side note: Lots of places to eat in Maui but I live in the Bay area and we have better food I must say than Maui.... IMHO... except for their tropical fruits, which you cannot get anywhere that taste this good.. this of course is No reflection on the hotel. Be prepared that the place if full of kids and 30-40 something families predominantly. Be prepared at least in June/ July if you don't want to be among little kids all over the place whining and taking dumps and who knows what else in the pool... (yes this did happen during our stay), might want to think twice. If you have kids or teens this is the place to stay though. They have tons of activities for little kids. It is very safe too.

Great food, music, scenery, prices. Best food value around is CJ's Comfort Zone in the strip mall right by the resort. There's tasty homemade food, mainland prices, walk-up counter service, expansive menu. Also use the resort shuttle to get to the other Starwood Hotels and beaches, it's so easy and stress free!

Not to mention the full-size refrigerator for holding a good supply of liquid refreshment. We like to stop off at the Costco near the Maui airport and load up on groceries and snacks -- saves a bundle of money and is so convenient. Whether you stay at the north or south property, you can use the pools and facilities at both. It's gorgeously landscaped and feels relaxed. Probably my husband's favorite feature is the beach which is steps from your condo and is excellent for swimming and snorkeling most of the year. Another great feature are the complimentary shuttle busses which will take you to the other Starwood hotels (Sheraton Black Rock or Westin Maui, and Whaler's Shopping Village. That gives you alot more choices for shopping and places to go for meals without having to drive your rental car around.

It truly is a tropical paradise. The check in process was quick and we were amazed when we got to our suite. It was a large suite with full kitchen, massive bathroom (with two sinks, separate toilet room, hot tub and separate large glass shower), large balcony, king bedroom (I love the Westin Heavenly bed and toiletries), and large living room area with couch and dining room table. We had a view of one of the pools and the ocean. We loved that we had a kitchen so that we could cook a couple of the nights and had breakfast food, drinks, and snacks. There are several restaurants on the property that we tried. We also liked the little convenience store on the property. They have lots of fresh foods, toiletries, gifts, and groceries. It is better to go to the grocery store for a big grocery shopping though. We enjoyed the pasta buffet at the Italian restaurant. It was a LOT of food! We also ate at the bar and grills in the pool area (there are two). The food was good pub fare, nothing spectacular but decent. We loved the pool area. There are lots of families here since it is an all suite hotel but that didn't bother us. A lot of the kids enjoy the pirate ship area which is enclosed and away from the other pool areas. The property is massive and we enjoyed walking around it. There is a free shuttle that you can take to the other Starwood properties and to local shopping areas and downtown Lahaina. The beach in front was one negative since there is a lot of coral so you can't just walk in the water. You have to walk a ways to get to an area without the coral. We did do some snorkeling in front of the hotel. It's good for beginners but there isn't much to see. I recommend driving out to Napili Bay for breakfast and the relaxing and gorgeous beach there. The Westin has lots of activities going on if you wish to participate. We were pretty much beach and pool bums but did enjoy the craft fair that they had one day during the week. We were able to park in the covered parking garage near our room at no charge which was convenient. The only other complaint we had was that the maid was waiting by our door for us to checkout. We weren't even late, she came 15 minutes before checkout and just stood there waiting for us. We thought it was rude and unprofessional of the Westin to let this happen. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at the Westin. Our suite was perfect and it truly is an upscale tropical paradise.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201c2nd Time...we'll be back again.\u201d", "Author": "LC_Darling", "ReviewID": "UR110852399", "Content": "I must say it was hard to compete with our last trip to WKORV.

Over the past few years, we had previously stayed in the Westin Resort and Sheraton down the road and this was our first stay in the Villas. Overall, I like this hotel more than the other starwood properties on the island. The grounds are very nice and the rooms are clean. It is nice having a kitchen(ette) to prepare snacks and other lunches. The hotel also runs a shuttle service between the other starwood properties and downtown Lahaina which is a nice perk. (I am always shocked at how few people tip the drivers!) The pool has many loungers around the property and some umbrellas if you want to escape from the sun. Unfortunately, the loungers are not that comfortable as they have a metal bar across the back which makes for uncomfortable lounging. The pool side drink service is very understaffed and you are much better off hoofing it to the bar vs waiting the 30-60 minutes for the drink boy to show up. I was not impressed with the front-desk. We arrived at Noon during the day of check in. We did not expect our room to be ready upon arrival, but we were hopeful to get a room before 4PM. After checking with the front-desk a few times, the room was still not ready at 4PM. Finally, the front desk called to check on room status instead of relying on the computer status. Sure enough, it was ready but the status was not updated. I wonder how long it had been ready? On the plus side, we were given a \"late\" checkout of Noon. The standard checkout is 10AM which is way too early. As the hotel is a \"resort\", they do not honor most SPG \"gold\" status perks so you will not get a room upgrade or 4PM checkout. I prefer the Wailea side of the island. If I were to return to this side of the island, I would consider staying here again.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cSleep well, great for family with children\u201d", "Author": "linbay", "ReviewID": "UR110767351", "Content": "This hotel is great for family traveling with young children. Here is a breakdown of different categories: Location: It's in Ka\"anapali, although the official address says Lahaina. When you drive in from the airport, you don't need a map, just follow signs to Lahaina. Once you are in Lahaina, you have to continue going NORTH. There are two Westin resorts, there names are extremely simlar. Just remember this one has \"Villas\" and the other one don't. You'll need to make a LEFT ON KAI ALA Dr. However, the same street has 2 names, and 2 signs. The other sign is PUUKOLII. Make a LEFT HERE. The location is about 50 minutes from the airport without traffic. Self parking is $ 7, Valet is $ 9 per day. Your first day of valet upon check in is complimentary. If you wish to self park, you can retrieve your car on day 2, there are indoor/outdoor parkings. The hotel does not have anything plazas or anything exciting nearby. The Whalers Village and the other Westin/Sheraton are 30 minute walk away. The hotel does provide a 15 minute interval shuttle that will take you there free of charge. Check in: They have two lobbies, South (the first one as you pull up), and North (the second one). Depending on which building your room is located in, you'll have to check into the corresponding lobby. The two lobbies are walking distance from each other. Difference between North and South: We stayed in the north building # 7 and found this to be more favorable because it's newer, the halls are decorated with art, and it appears that North buildings mostly face the ocean with minimal rooms that face the parking lot. The room: We stayed in the 1 bedroom premium villa full kitchen and laundry. Although it's a full kitchen, they only supply the following: Dish detergent, sponge, coffee, limited creamer, coffee maker, blender, toaster, pots/pans, dishes, utensils. You will need to buy your own oil, seasoning and any other basics you need to fully utilize the kitchen. We had to invest in ketchup, oil, salad dressing, salt and so forth. Being an experienced international traveler, I'm pleased with the room. The bathroom is large, and has two doors, one into the master and the other into the living area. The bathroom also has a jacuzzi tub which we absolutely loved. We were placed on the first floor, which at first we were displeased with. However - we now realize we prefer the first floor, this is why: All rooms have balconies. And if you are on the first floor, instead of a balcony, you have a larger patio that leads to the hotel public grounds. The patio is not completely exposed, it's surrounded by lush plants, but there is an access path to give allow you the opportunity to get to the pool/beach directly from the patio. Someone would have to stay behind to lock the sliding door from the inside. Another reason we like the first floor is that I'm very impressed by the fact that you WILL NOT HEAR ANY NOISE FROM PEOPLE LIVING ABOVE YOU. I have stayed at expensive resorts all over the world including 5 star hotels, historic hotels, and I must say, when it comes to hearing your neighbor above you, price has nothing to do with noise. At the Westin Villas, we have NEVER heard people walking down the hall giggling or talking loudly, or high heels, or people above us, EVER. Our sleep quality is exceptional because we don't hear dumpster trucks, sirens, loud motorcycles or fixed up cars, or beeping trucks backing up. The hotel is absolutely QUIET! The room also offers laundry, so if you want to use it, you'll need to purchase your own detergent/sheets from a store. We found this to be very useful since we stayed 7 nights. The pools: Each south/north buildings have their own multiple pools. I'm disappointed with the appeal of the pools. For the price we are paying on the hotel, we expected the pool areas to be more upscale. However - they do have multiple pools/jacuzzis that appeal to different preferences: children pool, adult only pool, pirate pool and so forth. It's very children friendly. We've stayed at places where they do not allow flotation devices. This place has an \"anything goes\" mentality. So if you prefer to let your children monkey around in the pool and use flotation devices, this is PERFECT. The pools does have hours, but then again, anything goes here. I find the staffs don't enforce the hours, so I think it's PERFECT if you want to take a midnight dip. Although the pool water is not cold, it's not warm either. You can also rent flotation devices from the hotel directly, it's right next to the pools. Beach access: The hotel has direct beach access. There is also a path that parallels the ocean that runs north/south. Since the resort is on the north end of Ka'anapali, if you want to go for a long walk, you can go further if you head SOUTH. As you walk on the path, you will actually walk through the grounds of multiple resorts. There are signs that will guide you how to continue on the beach path. You can actually access the other Westin & Sheraton Black Rock by foot, as well as the Whaler's Village if you go SOUTH (that means beach is on your right). Other hotel guests: Most likely in the retirement age, or families with young children (like us). This is definitely NOT A ROMANTIC HOTEL. So if you are considering this for romance, you need to look elsewhere. Overall value: We paid about $ 800 per night for a studio/kitchen + 1 bedroom villa with kitchen. So if we break it down, it's about $ 400 per room, not including taxes & parking. As an experienced traveler, I feel that we are paying more due to the fact that the rooms come fully equiped with kitchen/laundry. At the end of the day, I think $ 400 is steep. We do save a little by being able to dine in once a day in our room, but we also invested in things like oil, butter, seasonings that we'll just leave behind for the hotel to throw away. The hotel grounds is nice, but nothing about it wowed us. We most likely will NOT RETURN to this hotel, although we did enjoyed it. Although the hotel is pretty new, you can see visible wear & tear.

We traded our two bedroom condo for a two bedroom condo (4619/4620) at the Westin Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Ocean Resort Villas. While checking in we were disappointed because we were given a condo in the 4th building (South property of the Westin). If you were looking at the building map this was one farthest from the ocean; however they honored my request and gave us a high floor which was on the 6th floor. We lucked out and checked in at 3 PM as they already had our studio unit ready so we went up to that side of the condo. At this time housekeeping was just finishing up the large one bedroom side. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe our eyes as these 2 units together were huge (actually sleeps 8 people) for just the two of us. It was like having 2 separate condos with a joint entranceway and then individual doors to each unit. Had we known how big our condo was we would have invited another couple. The view from the large one bedroom lanai was amazing. We had a corner unit and had a direct view across the pool area and straight to the ocean. From the other side of the lanai we could see the mountains and rainbows. Needless to say at this point we were extremely satisfied with our trade. The staff also left a bottle of champagne and a note congratulating us with our 5 year anniversary. What a nice touch! The condo was beautiful. A large kitchen with full stove. Large refrigerator, microwave and front loading washer/dryer. Both the living room/bedroom had large flat screen balconies. Oh and need I mention that Heavenly Bed (I wanted to take it home with us). I used the large Jacuzzi tub most nights. Everyone was right the snorkeling directly in front of the resort is amazing. We compared notes with another couple and all of us said the snorkeling here was better than Hanauma Bay on Oahu. We were blown away by all the tropical fish and beautiful reefs. The grounds were immaculate, pools were really nice and the koi ponds were cool. We ate at both the Ocean Bar & Grill and Pailolo Bar & Grill (both were really good). They both have a Happy Hour every day from 4-6 PM. The boardwalk in front of the resort meanders all the way to the Sheraton Black Rock and up to North Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach. A short walk from the resort (10 minutes) and you can eat at Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right along the beach and a great place to watch sunsets. We rented a jeep for the week from Thrifty through Discount Hawaii Car Rental. This was our second time using them (last time was in 2008) and everything was great. I highly recommend them. Having a vehicle on Maui made it even better as we could explore on our own. Parking at the Westin is free as long as you are an owner or exchanger. In fact we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anything negative about the entire trip. It was a great experience from check-in to check-out.

Unbelieveable, we couldn't wait to get out of there. We stayed at this highly overpriced resort that offered NO AMENITIES and finally moved to the Hyatt where were in the truly lap of luxery in comparison at $169.00 per night!!!! Very disappointed, never acknowledged again even after relaying our experience to the Vacation Ownership Representative. The resort is \"pretty\", the food is marginal and of course expensive. My Sprite at the pool bar was $4.95, my husbands Mai Tai was $4.00...does that make sense???!!!?? Eggs benedict one morning was fine, the next time all eggs were hard cooked...for eggs benedict???

My husband and I were not on a tight budget but had to watch our pennies, so we decided to book through a timeshare owner at a lower cost than what the hotel was charging, which was great because the rest of the hotel \"extras\" were expensive. The minute you walk on to this property you are surrounded with relaxation. The property is very well manicured and decorated to the hilts. I can't say enough about the front desk and the valet, what wonderful people. We only sat at the bar twice but the staff seemed nice too. The room goes beyond your expectations and is nicely arranged so you are not stepping over yourself to move around. The pools are clean and the beaches are perfect, the snorkeling on the hotel beach front is amazing. The only suggestion is to buy your food at the grocery store and cook your own meals. The day we arrived we were pretty tired and didn't feel like going to costco, so we headed straight to the hotel.....bad decision. We sat at the bar, ordered a 20 oz Blue Moon and Bud light; had a pleasant chat asked for the bill and were shocked! $18.00 for 2 beers. We were anticipating a hike in the prices but not 3 times the normal price. The next morning we headed BACK to Costco and picked up a 24 pack of corona for $25.00 and called it a day. The hotel food looks good but we didn't eat there except once, which was breakfast. They have a beautiful buffet for the low cost of $25.00 a plate or a full menu....By the time it was said and done, breakfast for 2 was $52.00 + tip. The hotel has grills that guests can use and they are cleaned daily by the staff and there is always one available, we never had to wait.

I was extremely upset. Mylin at the front desk remained calm and professional and kept trying to switch us. After at least 45 minutes she went to talk to management and came back with good news, we were now on the 5th floor. The room was great and I am glad I stood my ground because there is no ocean view on the 1st floor or other lower floors from what I could see. Housekeeping was very layed back, everyone was complaining that they didn't clean rooms until late in the afternoon so we decided to go green for 4 days because the day we did have cleaning it was after 4 oclock and I had to ask for it to get done. Of course on our check out day they rang our bell at 9 and asked when we were leaving so they could clean the room. With a 10 am check out I can't believe they did that! Upon checking out we were told that we owed for our room. We had paid in advance for the room but they insisted they had no payment. I had to call our travel agent who had the receipt that it indeed was paid for. This took about two hours before they gave me a receipt with a zero balance. Not a \"we are sorry, or have a drink on us\" (we were staying at the pool until it was time to go to the airport) nothing!

The beach in front of the resort isn't the best for swimming, but a short walk down is a great area free of coral. The beach drops quickly, so you can stand in chest high water just a few feet out. We were never asked to participate in a timeshare pitch, although we expected it. After all, this is a timeshare resort. The valet crew was efficient, courteous, and extremely friendly. The cost to valet was only $2 more per night than self-park, a deep discount in Hawaii. Our one-bedroom room was upgraded from our original reservation of a studio. The room was spacious with comfortable seating and the bed was great. The large bathroom opened up to the bedroom. And it was nice to have the washer/dryer combo since we had spent a week on Oahu; we washed all our clothes before going back to the mainland.

We are Starwood owners (though not at this resort) and had one of our best trips ever. I love the location, amenities, staff, pools, snorkeling, beach, bars and restaurants. The staff is great and there are plenty of places to chill by the pool or beach. There is nothing not to like unless you have a disappointing view. We stayed in the older South building (bigger rooms I was told) in building 2 on the 5th floor nearer the ocean than the main building. From our balcony we overlooked the kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool, gardens between the North and South building and had a great open view of Molokai. Watched wales all week long and even had some 150 yards off the beach from time to time. Pictures included. The drinks and food are pricy, but not any more than other parts of the island. Paillo Beach bar has $4 Mai Tais during happy hour every day and the food is good. They have a shuttle to take you just about anywhere. Down to the Sheraton/black rock for the cliff dive ceremony (get to the Cliff Dive Bar early for a good view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highly recommended), the Westin Hotel/Whalers Village and other places.

Thankfully there was no damage or even signs of the wave at the Westin. I give the management a HUGE thumbs up on the communication and evacuation plans. Luckily we did not have to move being on the 5th floor. There were PA announcements and phone voice mails about every 45 minute to an hour informing the entire resort of what was happening.

Our condos were in building 7. Overall, I would give this resort a very high rating. Here are some pros and a few cons about our stay: pros: 1) Condos were very clean. Bathrooms and kitchens were spotless when we checked in. 2) Nice picture on the hd TVs 3) Staff was very friendly. We were always greeted when walking around the place. Those working at the poolside rental/towel building were always very helpful and friendly. Waiters and bartenders at the poolside bars/restaurants were, for the most part, very attentive and friendly. 4) Concierge was friendly and was not at all pushy about the timeshare presentation. We deferred on the 90 minute presentation. But, the $75 resort credit was tempting. 5) Check in and check out was painless and quick. We had read about long lines at the front desk. I never saw more than one or two people waiting at the desk (this is the north villas lobby). We checked in at about 7:00 pm on Saturday and checked out at 9:30 am on Saturday. 6) If you don't mind not having your condo cleaned every day, I would recommend deferring on the housekeeping service. We got one breakfast coupon for each day we did not get housekeeping service. Well worth it. The breakfast buffet is fantastic (a little pricey if you are paying). 7) Pools were clean and not too crowded. Deck chairs were usually available. We spent most of our time at the beach though. 8) The snorkeling in front of the westin is fantastic. Lots of coral to explore. Saw many fish and turtles. We thought this area was one of the best on the island. 9) Beach was clean and not too crowded. The trees (that blocked our view) were a great place to seek some shade. The water was calm and easy to enter, for the most part. We had a few days of high trade winds, which hampered snorkeling on some of the beaches. 10) Food at the Paillo Grill was great. Again, a little pricy, but, in line with other restaurants on the island. Try the hot dog with onion straws. Delicious! (see picture) 11) The grounds around the resort are meticulously maintained. 12) No need to bring your own beach towels. The Westin had a great system. At check-in they issue a set of towel cards to you. You exchange the cards for towels at the beach house. Bring your dirty towel back at any time for a clean one. At check-out time, return the cards to the front desk. You are charged $15 for each card not returned. A fair system. 13) Shuttle buses are available to get you to Whalers Village and Lahaina. Buses run often and are very convenient. Leave the rental car in the lot! 14) Great water pressure in the showers 15) Kitchen was well equipped and included a dishwasher cons: 1) Carpet had some stains that could have been cleaned a little better 2) Our condo was an 'ocean view'. We had read this from other reviews to be aware of. Yes, we could see the ocean, but, it was not much of a view. We were on the 3rd floor. A higher floor would be better. Building 7 sits behind building 8 and sits at a slight angle with gives all the condos on the north side a view of the ocean. Because of building 8 and a row of trees at the beach, you can only see some water and part of Molokai island. Building 8 has some great views, but, we were told that building is for 'owner only'. If you can get a condo in building 8, take it. The view should be great, especially if you are on an upper floor. 3) Parking seemed to be all 'compact' spots which makes for tight parking. Lots of suvs and vans in the compact spots. A common phrase in our group was, 'oh well, it is a rental'. Parking gets really tight if you return to the resort after 9:00 pm. Squeezing back into a spot became a daily challenge. 4) You can rent a chair ($10) and umbrella ($20) on the beach. Too much. Sit in the sand.

A couple years ago we met Mr. Valenzuela - a wonderful man and a dedicated employee. Since then he has taken care of our luggage, our needs, and our life in Maui. He proved himself to be exceptionally knowledgeable of every single aspect concerning Maui and the Ocean Resort Villas. Besides Miguel being a friend and Ohana to us as well, on February 19 our flight home was cancelled. That night we were homeless. Miguel offered us to stay at his home. What kind of employee would do that; an outstanding one! Mr. Valenzuela consistently distinguished himself above others that we had encountered since inception of the Ocean Resort Villas. He exhibited professionalism and an outstanding follow through which always catches my eye. He has a thorough and winning way with customers, always going the extra mile to secure our satisfaction. Mr. Valenzuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enthusiasm was most sincere, and his vast experience at the Westin Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Ocean Resort Villas was refreshing. We thought that Miguel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initiative and motivation deserve special recognition. In addition, his integrity and dependability was outstanding. Miguel is an asset to your company. His attention to detail, professionalism and compassion for us is second to none. I hope you can recognize him in some way that would benefit him. Thank you for employing such a fine individual.

We stayed here in 2008, 2009, and just recently for 8 days. The pirate ship pool was a great hit with our 11 month old, our niece (9 months old) and nephew (3 years old). Our only recommendation would be open the towel area at the pirate ship earlier (like 8:30 or 9am rather than 10am) as young children are up at an earlier time and it is a hassle to try to go to the main pool for towels rather than just being able to get them at the pirate ship. Kehaula M. (spelling?) at the front desk is AMAZING! She was such a pleasure to chat with over the phone prior to our arrival to ensure we had everything we needed (highchair, diaper genie, crib, etc.). We were fortunate enough to be able to meet her in person during our stay and she yet again provided us with helpful information, ensured our accommodations were up to par, etc. Thank you so much Kehaula M. (spelling ?). Keep up the amazing job and service you provide. Look forward to seeing you in 2013. You set a high standard for all to follow in your footsteps for customer service. Thank you! The pool bar service at the North side was great! Good Happy Hour. Anytime we called service express and needed something they were quick to respond which was greatly appreciated. The property is still as beautiful as it was brand new. Awesome shuttle service (huge plus with a child). Free internet! We did however encounter one problem....we were there during the Tsunami and because we were on the first floor we had to be evacuated. This was not the problem, however the process in which we were handled during the evacuation for our family was a huge disappointment and struggle. A positive during this time was the sirens/announcements that would go off in the rooms and the property was great. The voicemails they would leave were great as well. However...the NEGATIVES were as follows: We were offered several different alternatives as to where to move, one of which was 'hospitality villas' at the North property. Keep in mind we were a party of 6 adults and 1 child. We went to the first room offered and a family was actually checked into that room. We went back to the lobby and informed the front desk and we were given another key for another hospitality room. We drag all 6 and a baby plus needed bags to the 2nd room and yet again...checked in room. Are you kidding me? Back to the lobby again... At this time when I stated we have already been to two so called hospitality rooms with people checked in and this was not acceptable, the woman at the front desk (unsure of her name) stated in a rude tone \"Well be thankful we are not underwater\" and slammed the next key on the desk. A manager did walk over and reassured us that the 3rd room was an actual hospitality room and apologized for the first two inconveniences. Another alternative offered was we could remain in the lobby as it was on the 2nd floor. However, they changed their minds on this as the lobby was 'too open of a space'. Okay no problem we can go to a room. After going to another THREE 'hospitality rooms' with all of us in tow as previously mentioned, each room had already had 12+ adults and even more with children. We actually had two of the rooms tell us we are already too full to fit anymore people. After 1 1/2 hours of going from room to room all over the property with all in tow, we planted ourselves in the lobby again with a few other families that had gone through a similar experience thus far. Thirty minutes prior to the scheduled arrival of the potential tsunami, a manager approached all of us to say we had to go to a room. All families present informed him yet again, there was no room for any us, even with splitting up the families. Shuttles had stopped, rooms were full. Oddly enough, after much discussion, he said we have a room on the 5th floor we must go now. Security had to help us as the elevators had already been turned off. They were not thrilled and put up a fuss in having to help us carry our stuff and our child (asleep finally in the stroller) up the stairs. We walk into what appeared to be a 'show room', in which 2 employees were on one couch watching the news. Again are you kidding me...2 employees in an entire open 2 bedroom villa. We were extremely thankful to be in a room with all of our family and enjoyed the company of the other family placed with us. But really, you had this open room the entire time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Come to find out also, as I mentioned they were leaving important voicemails on the phones, well the phones in this room did not work...big problem. My suggestions for this entire evacuation experience is: 1st: make sure the phones in ALL rooms are working (showroom or not) because you never know when you have to use ALL rooms, 2nd: have a better system rather than just giving out 5 keys to each 'hospitality room', i.e. you have 6 in your party here is your key to 7505, next you have 4 in your party here is your key to 7505...7505 is full, move onto the next. Once you have filled rooms with 10-12 people, then start back again at the first room. Also, maybe put out an announcement to all guests, \"anyone willing to open their rooms to other guests please notify the front\". Therefore a party of 2 possibly staying in a studio, etc. can open their room for another few people. We understand the stress and hassle of an evacuation and the terror of it all, but things could have been handled better and we expected much better. We are extremely thankful that there was no damage and we could continue on our vacation and all was well for all as it was not in Japan unfortunately.

Timeshare owners 2. Starwood Gold and Platinum Members (which I have been a long time SPG member) 3. First guests that checked in due to the Westins policy of not assigning rooms from reservations but assigning rooms in real time without conditions of the reservation taken. This reminds me of the famous Seinfeld where he is standing at the Rental Ticket Counter with his reservation and after finding-out that no cars were available he shouts, \"anyone can TAKE a reservation but you have to learn to HOLD the reservation.\" This was certainly a Seinfeldian moment at the Westin Villas! The Situation Like the credit card commercial some experiences have a price and some experiences are priceless. Our first night stay at the Westin Villas had a significant price and almost ruined our families trip. Traveling with an 8 and 5 year old can be a challenge, however, being greeted by Moana at the Westin Villas at 11pm after a long cross country trip with my Orbitz reservation started a nightmarish, although, somewhat predictable outcome. Moana first stated that they were 99.9 percent occupied and that my beautiful room was ready. - Note: As a million mile traveler I knew that checking in late is always a risk but hearing that the Hotel had full occupancy during check-in is always a cautionary condition during check-in. Upon taking the room it seemed old stocked with different color appliances, cheap furniture and although only a few years young the villas were well...cheap and aging quickly int he South Tower. Room 3203 was even more interesting as my kids threw open the curtains in anticipation of our beautiful Ocean View only to see a parking lot full of cars and a commercial air conditioning unit directly beneath our lanai. Better yet a large green electrical transformer hummed beautifully throughout the night competing with the air conditioner for attention. I think you get the picture and as a father I really felt that I let down my kids and family with my decision to Reserve an Ocean View Sunsational Deluxe Room through Orbitz at the Westin Kaanapali Resort VIllas. If you have a weeks vacation in which you saved a small fortune to enjoy a week with you family in Maui I can only describe this experience as deceptive and not a pleasant experience. Note: Glen Casil was respectful when we discussed my complaint and the Westin through Orbitz has decided to refund a third of my money. I appreciate the attempts to work with me but the experience as described was my personal experience and it should be a matter of record to ensure that potential clients are not treated with such indignity. I have a higher standard for the Starwood Group and for Orbitz to fully resolve such issues without gratuitous attempts to convince me that if I really look hard enough some 450 yards around the parking lot and past the wall leaning over the railing I can see the Ocean.

The buffet was great for my husband, but I always chose the continental which suited me best; the fruit was fresh and yummie.

Suite: Because we have a young one, we spent a fair amount of time in our room. Our son was very happy in his special crib (we bought bumper pads as he is rather active in his sleep) and we slept like royalty in our king. The room was clean and ideal for a family. Be sure to make use of the BBQ on the pool deck, we'll use it more often next time! Beach: PERFECT, need I say more? We rented a Stand Up Paddle Board and took turns on the water while the other played with the babe. The sand was ideal for a new lil' beachcomber. We also took little day trips, but kept returning to the hotel for \"our\" beach and pool. Thank you to those of you who made our trip memorable, because of you we will be back.

I booked a studio and as a gold got a nice one bedroom. Check in was easy, just a tip - find out if you are in the north or south areas as they have two separate but very close driveways. I was put in the south side which is the slightly older side in a nice one bedroom, corner unit with a long balcony with two lounge chairs and two seats and small tables. The view was of the entrance driveway but the landscaping did an amazing job of making the view nice. There was lots of space, a dishwasher as well as a washer and dryer. Bathroom was handicapped accessible so was large. There were tons of towels and amenities. My only negative is the current trend to have the bathtub open into the bedroom. This is the third property I've experienced it with and I don't get how the romance of the tub overshadows all the other stuff you do in the bathroom and why you want the sights and sounds to escape. There were two large screen TV's, DVD player as well as a great selection of TV stations. I didn't eat at the restaurants but found the on site store very expensive, even compared to that of the resort closest. They have free shuttles to nearby shopping running late in to the evening which is great. You can also walk to Ka'anapali town where there is a good market, small italian restaurant and coffee place. Services I did use were very well done, the staff uniformly pleasant and respectful. My only gripe is that there are a LOT of units which took away almost all the resort feel. It felt like an apartment complex on the beach, which BTW is pretty but rather narrow. I will echo the rest, if you walk a few minutes down the beach to eat at Dukes, the resort it's a part of is really nice with much fewer units and a much nicer feel.

I could of paid for their garden view and saved a bundle. Next time, we will go back to the Fairmont Kea Lani. There, our Costco Reservation stated Full Ocean View.

And if you are a time share owner, it might be a great choice. Were were regular hotel guests and I was extremely disappointed.. We paid for an ocean view room and we got a view of the back of a building, with the view of a parking lot directly south west and a faint glimpse of the ocean. it was a joke. when i requested a room change, i was told that the hotel was 98% occupied and that it is always 98% occupied and that the true ocean view rooms (forget ocean front-they dont even pretend to make those available) were reserved for time share owners and that i was basically a \"second class guest\". on my second day, i was offered a room change, which was a slightly better view of the parking lot and no blocking building, but still no real ocean view. in order to move, i was required to check out at 10am and to then check back in at 4pm and the hassle factor relative to the zero improvement in my view was not worth it. so my first tip is DON\"T PAY FOR AN OCEAN VIEW ROOM, AS THERE ARE NOT ANY FOR A TYPICAL GUEST. And then to add insult to injury, our second floor room was invaded by ants. on our second day, we noticed a trail of ants (maybe 50-75) crawling along the wall and around the kitchen grout lines. we called the engineer, who came promtly, apologized and wiped down the ants with some bug kille (which of course, smelled for 2 days)r. Two days later, the ants were back. and even more this time, as they were on the ceiling crawling between ventilation grates, all over the kitchen . another engineer came and again wiped down the ants with bug killer. More smell and 2 days later, they are back again. at this point, we are ready to leave, so we just told the front desk when we were leaving that they needed to bug bomb the room with a strong insect killer. so when you check in ASK TO CONFIRM THAT THE ROOM DOES NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF ANT INVASIONS. the pool towel policy was a little annoying as well. other than a bait and switch on the room and the ants, and 2 obnoxious hotel staff members and the towel policy, the property was lovely and the staff was friendly and accomodating.

We were so excited for a few days of rest and sun. Maui delivered all of that, but the folks at the Westin did their best to thwart our plans. First, we arrived and thought everything to be perfect - lovely lobby, friendly check in staff, nice, comfortable room, etc. However, that evening, after returning from a stroll and a bite to eat on the property, we found a letter that had been slipped under our door, informing us that we would need to have all of our things packed and ready to move the following morning (Thanksgiving day) by 10 am, and that our new room would be ready by 4 pm. The tone of the letter was curt and rude, and so started the decline of our tropical vacation. Over the next 24 hours, through much yelling, we were granted an extra day in our room so that we did not have to move on Thanksgiving day. We spoke with several managers, including an unpleasant woman named Corolla, who were condescending and simpering, and who acted like we were somehow trying to scam the Westin because we did not want to move into a downgraded room. In the end, we moved into a worse room on a lower floor without a view (and it was a handicap accessible room, so less lovely overall). We made the best of our situation, and in spite of the Westin's poor attitude towards us, enjoyed Hawaii. On our last night, we wandered down to the next resort over for dinner and found that it was much more beautiful, and about the same price as the Westin (we did feel some regret, but what could we do?). On another note, the Westin \"nickel and dimes\" you for everything - 10 dollars/day for cheap beach chairs (the kind with bands of plastic) and 20/day for an umbrella, no water service (you have to buy everything), and drinks/food on the resort are not great and super expensive. For couples without children - do not come here. It is set up around being a family resort, and is in no way chic or sophisticated in any of its offerings.

The hotel is nice but it feels more like condominums than a resort hotel. The room was a one bedroom and was huge but not magical. Again, the room was large but they gave us a lobby view so I cant speak to any ocean or garden view. I suspect thats because instead of paying 550 a night for three nights, I got three for the price of two. I had signed up to listen to their ownership presentation but wasnt impressed enough to take a hour and a half out of my weekend to listen. We went to the pool instead. They have a pirate ship pool for the kids and a good waterslide. That was fun. The fish in the pond entertained my daughter. The food was good and not overpriced. The service was friendly. My husband didnt like the drink and they remade it to his satisfaction. The concierge set us up with a luau, a bit cheezy but worth it for our 5 year old and our 8 year old niece. The feast of lele was the luau and there was an abundance of food and drinks so the $100 a person was worth it. The show was great too, very fast and entertaining for the kids, but we have been to luaus so many times that we truly did it for our kids. The highlight was they sold wooden honus and carved the kids name on them. I asked for a late checkout and they only gave me 1230. It should have been 4 as an spg member paying over $500 a night. For that rate, I expect EVERY answer to be yes as they are definitely positioning themselves to be 5 star and appeal to that market so the answer should be yes again. I tried to stay another night but they wouldnt keep me in the same room so I moved. Granted I wanted to use points but I went to the Westin Spa with points and they gave me a 1300 square foot room for a mere $200 more. Also, at that price it was a bit disconcerting to see some of the crowd, seemingly local, that showed up at the pools with the inappropriate language etc. I dont mean to sound like a snob but for that price there should be a difference in the clientele. Overall it is very nice place just too industrial, needs more hawaiin feeling, and more 5 star level service. It felt like they were truly about money.

I don't understand how anyone could possibly complain about this hotel. Some people are just never satisfied. We booked through costco (extremly good value) and were upgraded at checkin to a beautiful ocean view studio room in the South tower building 2. The room had everything you would need except a large balcony which I thought would be a problem, but we would just open the slider and sit in the chairs and have our coffee in the morning and wine at night, so we were very happy! It was our 25 wedding anniversary and the front desk sent up champagne, red wine, and some nice chocolates, which was very nice. There is alot of families with kids, but it was never noisy or bothersome, it just made us miss our 4 kids at home. We are going to bring the kids next time. We did the time share presentation and Jennifer did a great job explaining the starwood system and we are going to come back within 2 years and do it again because it is just not a good time to purchase for us right now. We received a whale watching cruise for doing this that was excellent it was called the Teralani and I would highly reccomend it. We had 3 whales swimming around and under our boat for about and hour. If you go to the Italian Grill order a lemon drop, it was the best one I have ever had and the oriental chicken salad at the ocean bar and grill was very yummy. The location was perfect because it provided a nice walk to whalers village and back which we did everyday, and if your down there for happy hour the Hula Grill has great Mai Tais and appetizers. My husband and I both had 80 minute massages and they were fabulous. We went to little beach which was quite entertaining, on Sundays they have a bongo and fire dancing locals show.

However, it is a beautiful resort with great amenities in an excellent location. We rented it from someone on redweek and were very pleased with the price we got. The three problems were with (1) housekeeping (2) the italian restaurant on site and (3) the spa. A few hours after we arrived I noticed that my 8 month old daughters legs were all dirty. She had been crawling around on the carpet. I checked the carpet and noticed it was wet. I called down to the front desk to inquire and they informed me that housekeeping probably had cleaned it. While that would normally be great, I was worried about it because it was still wet and my daughter had been crawling on it. Housekeeping informed us it had been steam cleaned. They asked us not to allow our daughter to crawl on it until they could dry it. When I inquired further (because she had been on it) they told me the substances used were \"not that toxic\". Considering housekeeping put the crib and highchair in our suite, I was not pleased that they didn't want my daughter on the floor and didn't bother to say anything. We decided to try the italian buffet at the on site restaurant. I would not recommend it. I have been to other italian buffets and they are much better. The pasta was not very pleasant after sitting in dishes for a while. In my experience, a restaurant of that quality would do pasta stations rather than leaving the pasta to sit in dishes. However, the real kicker was that even though the waitress told us on our arrival that my 8 month old daughter was free when I fed her 2 pieces of fruit and some noodles from the pasta buffet they charged $15 for her meal. I did not think that was very classy. The final issue was the spa. My husband decided to treat me with a GC to the spa. Unfortunately, I never got to go because it took them 3 days to get it to us after repeatedly making him wait in the room for the GC to arrive and then leaving me a message about it - ruining the surprise. The upside was that the spa took responsibility for their failures and gave us a nice little basket to apologize.

I wrote ahead to make arrangements with the restaraunts' chef and food service manager--they even procured gluten-free pasta, bread and brownie mix so the kids could enjoy evenings out.

Our 1-bedroom Villa was so perfect for our family of four. We stopped at Wal-Mart on the way in so we could fully use the full kitchen. They had everything we would have wanted (blender, coffee-maker, non-stick pan, spatula, just to name a few). The bathroom is HUGE and is laid out perfect for a family. The bed is so comfy and lanai was very large. I honestly cannot think of one thing to complain about in the room. We had a bit of difficulty connecting to the wifi but the staff was great trying to remedy it. The pool areas at the resort are really the star. We never even made it to the North pool because our boys (2 and 4) were so addicted to the SOuth pool and the toddler pool with Pirate ship. The beach was perfect for us. The sand is wide and holds crowds very well (if there are any). There is plenty of room to play in the water (limited surf) without getting into the coral. I was originally worried about our kids being able to play in the water without getting in the coral. This was not a problem in the least. However, having the coral within swim reach was perfect to teach our boys how to snorkel for the first time. How often can you swim for 30 seconds and be in a school of fish? We LOVED the beach and pool. We didn't eat at the resort restaurants, but did get drinks daily which were fantastic. Their Happy Hour is great (4-6) and they have cheap Mai Tai's daily during this time (which were terrific). The staff was courteous and helpful, and we would have never known it serves as a timeshare as well. There is ZERO pressure, invitation, or presence. You would have to seek info about timeshares to get any. We walked down to Duke's restaurant 3 times. We love that place and it was such a beautiful and short walk down the lit beach path to get there. We did use the BBQ Grills to cook on and they were great. I would highly recommend doing that once at least. It was very relaxing and a nice reprieve from spending money. To put the entire stay into perspective: We spent 3 nights at the Hyatt Maui after our week stay. The Hyatt is one of the best and highest rated resorts on the island (and should be, it is beautiful). As much as we liked the Hyatt, we completely missed the Westin Villas. All in all, we could not have enjoyed it more. Our boys cried when we left, and we will definitely try to come back again.

I was misled if not deceived when I booked a \"Deluxe Ocean View Sunsational Villa\" over Christmas at this resort and ended up with a room with a view facing a highway and a construction site. My disappointment led to complete frustration when I addressed the problem with a manager at the property who said that my issue should be taken up with Orbitz, only later to find out from Orbitz that she had the power to resolve. She also said I should have mentioned something earlier in my stay (which I did when I registered and was told there were no other options as they were at 100% capacity.) Thus, I found her response disingenuous at best, outright deceptive at worse. I later filed a complaint with Orbitz and was told that the property had no record of my complaint (I have since sent them e-mails proving otherwise.) I'm really shocked Westin would attach its name to this \"resort\" which is little more than an overcrowded condo with really poor customer service. (You'll find that hotel \"guests\" are second-class citizens to the condo owners at this property, who in turn, resent the guests who stay there for a fraction of their maintenance fees.) If this property had any integrity, they would accurately and fully describe the rooms and views. Simple as that. Yes, my room also had a view of the ocean, but why not disclose all information so travelers could make informed decision?! I would never have booked a room facing a highway. Unfortunately, the Westin KORV has an elaborate room categorizing system (which differs from the one published at Orbitz) so they can put you wherever you wish and come up with any explanation to justify it. I won't even go into how Westin claimed that they had no record of my reservation, which I had made over three months prior. Thus, I had to call and e-mail back and forth between Westin and Orbitz during my vacation. Let me also say that the place place was overrun at Christmas. Men's public bathrooms were swampy and both showers in the locker room were out of service. Trash from the condo units lined the hallways day and night. Pools were cloudy, even the \"adult pools\" which were overrun by kids. I've been to Hawaii over a dozen times and was NEVER once made to feel misled, deceived or outright lied to. Westin KORV is a disgrace to one of the best tourist destinations. The rooms are definitely nice, but there are far better run hotels and even better values to be found elsewhere.

People seem to love it or hate it. Luckily I had the most fabulous time on my solo retreat to Maui. I stayed in a 1 bedroom premium villa with an oceanview. First of all, if you are looking for full service resorts, then you are probably best to look at the traditional hotels on Kaanapali. The Westin Ocean Villas is a timeshare resort with all the comforts of the Westin room amenities without traditional hotel services such as room service and daily housekeeping. That said, I loved it. I loved not having a housekeeper waking me at 8am to clean my room and having a full kitchen to cook and not eat out all the time (restaurants, by the way, are pretty pricey in Maui). The pools were great and I never had issues getting a lounge chair. But I was also there during the shoulder season. Lots of kids but it seemed to be ok. In terms of location, yes the villas are further north from the traditional Kaanapali hotel area. But I see this as an upside. The hotels right on Kaanapali are older, run down, and badly need of some TLC. Not to mention CROWDED. The villas are quieter but accessible to the main drag - the resorts offers a complimentary shuttle that takes you to their sister properties. The beach in front of the resort is great with good snorkeling but you can easily hop on the shuttle and go to the Sheraton to snorkel at Black Rock. The villa itself is enormous by most apartment standards. The bathroom was larger than most apartments where I live so I found it spacious. For two people it would be perfect however for an entire family, it might be cramped. The kitchen comes fully stocked with pots, pans, dishes, etc however there were a few things I wished they had (containers to store leftovers would be nice!). It also comes with a washer/dryer which comes in handy after multiple visits to the beach. Unlike some other reviewers, my place was pretty clean and I'm pretty picky about cleanliness. Most of the staff was friendly and always said 'aloha' - even the guy changing the light bulbs in the lobby! The girls at the Concierge were great (thanks Andrea!) and made me feel at home. After reading the other reviews, I think there is a difference from what you get as a timeshare owner and non-owner (ie. booking through Expedia). Timeshare owners get priority in room location and get the best ones when available. I rented someone's timeshare and thus got a great room.

First the positives...room was nice (even great for a family), pools were great, certain amenities were great like free wireless, kitchenette, free parking, washer/dryer. Now the downside...starting from our reservation. We were told a couple of things when we made our reservation that turned out to not be true. For example, we were told we would also have access to the Westin Resort and Spa and the Sheraton (as affiliated resorts). Not only did we not have access to the other resorts but (to make matters worse) the staff told us that the reservations people would \"never\" tell us that...like I was lying and like they would somehow know what another employee told me. Kicking us out made us feel bad enough but to call me a liar was terrible customer service and a terrible experience for my family. Second, the Westin told us that all benefits from being a Starwood preferred Gold member carried over to the Villas (e.g., upgrade to a better view room if available). The front desk clerk then told us that is not true because they are a timeshare. I didn't expect an upgrade as it's not always available but to be told different things is very frustrating. Then there's the terrible experiences with the concierge. Every time we wanted concierge service, we got the hard sell on the timeshare. Even worse, we made a reservation for a Luau with the concierge. The Laua was great but the frustrating part is he pressured us into taking the reservation immediately while we sat there telling us there were only three slots left. Turned out that wasn't true and there were plenty of openings. The concierge also charged us more than making a direct reservation. That's fine except no need to lie and say it's selling out when in fact it's not. Makes you wonder what kind of kickback they got. Again I don't care about the kickback...I just don't want it influencing how they sell us on different services. I definitely left with the impression that the staff (at the Villas being timeshares) are not trained to the same level as typical Starwood properties. Finally the price. I've stayed at alot of nice hotels (albeit the following without kitchenette's)...it's easy to find cheaper OCEANVIEW rooms at much nicer hotels (e.g., Ritz Carlton, St. Regis, Four Seasons etc.) than nonoceanview rooms at these Villas. In my mind, the Villas are WAY overcharging for that kitchenette. Don't need to say much more on that one. Personally, I'd recommend one of the other Starwood properties on Maui or Kaui.

Second issue on both weekends the basketball area and some of the lounges were overrun with a group of locals (15-20) for the entire day. None of us could use the pool-basketball area and when we inquired if there was a time limit (such as 1 hour) the pool staff said not really and did nothing suggest that others have some pool court time. As there are plenty of high quality resorts on Maui that welcome guests and try to accommodate the room requests we most probably will not stay at Westin again especially if the front desk and management continues to get worse and not consider their guests.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marshall, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Trip\u201d", "Author": "jeff224", "ReviewID": "UR88343840", "Content": "Thanks Westin for making our stay a Delightful one !

We had a studio through Interval trade and the kitchen had 2 burners, a refrigerator, dishwasher, sink, and sufficient counter space, plus everything you could need for cooking and serving. The bathroom was beautiful and large, large shower and a tub. And the bed ~ absolutely heavenly, as in Heavenly Bed. We slept great every night! The grounds of the Westin are beautiful and maintained. We really enjoyed the beautiful beach, great for swimming, wading, snorkeling, right in front of the resort. We spent much of our time on the beach. We really appreciated the Westin Shuttle between the resorts, LaHaina, to Whalers Village, and you could also stop at Safeway which is a nice way to get around. It was nice not to fight traffic for a week. We also became new time share owners at this resort and Jenn & Susan were awesome. The Westin is fortunate to have them on their sales team! The resort does not push their sales on you at all, in fact, we had to inquire about it for our own curiousity. Also, the food was delicious at the on site restaurants. WE especially loved our dinner at the Italian restaurant and the chef made me gluten free pasta! Yummy. Some other things we really appreciated was the free internet access as well as free parking.

Combine this with kids running around, servers getting orders from pool area and it gets a little old after a while.

The resort is large and there's a lot going on, but after a day of snorkeling and hanging out at the beach you just want to chill with a drink and not have so many distractions and noise.

The Westin Villas are not necessarily the cheapest but it's great value if you are looking for a nice room with kitchen and all the amenities like pools and a gym. Maui is not cheap so one way to save money is to cook instead of eating out. This is especially true for long vacations (at least 1 week). Otherwise a hotel may be perfect for a weekend getaway. Speaking of cooking, the Westin Villas offers several gas BBQ grills and picnic tables. There is now a 1-hour time limit if someone else is waiting. As with all hotels, alcohol may be consumed in the privacy of your own room but not in the public areas, so we simply be disgreet (reuse water or gatorade bottles or poor into regular glasses in advance). The Westin Villas provides almost all of the kitchenware that you will need, including the BBQ grill tools and salt/pepper shakers (but no salt and pepper). Grocery stores there are not cheap but there is a Costco right outside of the airport, so it's good to stock up once you have arrived. I bring a few food items in our sut case if small enough so that I don't have to buy it on the island, such as little packets of salt & pepper, ketchup and mustard. The kitchens come with a fridge, electric stove top, convection microwave oven AND dishwasher. Another bonus is the in-room washer and dryer which prove to be convenient when staying for 1+ weeks. Westin Villas provide a small bottle of liquid dish soap, 3 dishwasher pellets and 1 small box of laundry detergent (I suggest bringing 2 cups and a few cling free sheets from home). If you do NOT like to cook or want to treat yourself, there are a restaurants on-site and you can also use the restaurants at the other Starwood hotels which you can charge to your room. The best part of the Westin Villas is the reef right in front of the property. You must rent a car when staying in Maui because Ka'anapali and Lahaina are 40-45 minutes away from the airport without traffic, plus all the sightseeing requires a car. You can get a shuttle for $45 each way but the car is not that much more. My point is that you can walk into the ocean and start snorkeling easily right off the shore in shallow water (AKA save money by not going on an excursion). As timeshare owners of the Westin Villas, our maid service comes once mid-week during a 1 week stay. However, the studios and 1-bedrooms are available for rent on travel websites, while the 2-bedrooms are not. If you have 4 people, the 1-bedroom is good for privacy since the sofa bed is in the living room. The maid service is daily when renting. You can always put out the trash bag outside of your door and call housekeeping to pick it up. You can also call for extra towels. Additional maid service is available for a fee. The bathrooms are huge where the toilet is always separate in its own room. There is both a huge shower stall and a huge jacuzzi tub inside the bathroom. There is always 2 different entrances into bathroom, so it's nice that your guests can go into the bathroom directly from the livingroom/kitchen area without having to go through your bedroom. Like I mentioned earlier, Westin Villas are not cheap but you can watch for great sales on websites such as Orbitz.com. The best deals are when 4 people are sharing a room. Sometimes it might be cheaper to book the reservation for 2 people and then have the other 2 book their own flights, if you know what I mean. The other reason why the Westin Villas is better than the hotels is there is no $25 \"resort fee\" which other properties charge. The resort fee usually includes parking and internet access. The internet access is free here with wireless in public areas and wired ethernet in the rooms. Another great benefit to staying here is the free shuttle to the other Starwood properties (the sister hotels are Westin Hotel and Sheraton Black Rock Hotel) as well as to downtown Lahaina. So that both my husband and I can enjoy ourselves (no drinking & driving), we take the shuttle down to Lahaina for dinner and drinks, then take a $25 taxi back to the Villas since the shuttles do stop running around 10pm. Black Rock is another awesome spot for snorkeling which is a 15 minute walk along the boardwalk south from the Westin Villas or you can take the complimentary shuttle. However, the reef in front of the Westin Villas is much less crowded and much closer. The business center is also included. You can use a desktop with a printer for 30-minute increment. Printing is free. Better yet, you can email a document to the concierge or upload it to their designated website for free, then they will print it for you and have it ready for pick up at the front desk. This is convenient when you can check into your flight on your own laptop or cell phone in your room then go pick up your boarding passes upon check out. Geez, what else? We had our wedding in Maui last month, so that was the purpose of our visit. Some of our friends and family stayed at the Westin Villas which was really convenient. I wish everyone else had stayed there too but all the hotels are within 15 minutes driving when staying in the west side (West Maui), which is popular since Ka'napali offers the best beach in Maui. Again, this place is not the cheapest but it's good value for the money if you can afford it.

Marriott Maui Ocean Club\u201d", "Author": "cmhrun", "ReviewID": "UR85313570", "Content": "We have stayed at the Marriott Maui Ocean Club several times and absolutely loved it. We found a reasonably good deal for the Westin and decided to give it a shot, as it had very good reviews. Our stay started on a very negative note, but improved as the week went on. We paid extra for an Ocean View 2-bedroom villa. After standing in a long check-in line, were were finally given our room. I was dismayed to find we were situated directly in front of a parking lot, with a somewhat obstructed view of the ocean behind it. One of the bigger negatives of this hotel is that it sits back further from the ocean than the Marriott Maui Ocean Club (MOC), and some of the ocean views are not great. At the MOC, it is situated very close to the ocean, and we have always had a FANTASTIC ocean view. There has never been an issue. I called the front desk to hopefully remedy the situation. After being put on hold for ten minutes, I called back again. This time I spoke with a woman at the front desk, who spoke to me about the issue, then put me on hold. She never returned back to the phone. By this time I was pretty upset, and went to the front desk, toting my young children with me, who were by now crabby and hungry. The front desk said they were almost at capacity and had no other ocean view rooms for me. I told them that was unacceptable, and asked the manager to call me. An hour and a half went by, and no call. It was now 5:30 pm. My husband called the manager and she said we could stay across the hall with a pool-view room. We reluctantly took the room, as no ocean view alternative was given to us. It turned out to be all right, but didn't come close to the ocean view rooms at the Marriott that I would have received. The room itself was spacious and clean. I did not care for the floor plan of the two bedroom,which is not good for families with young children. It basically is two separate hotel rooms connected by a front entryway. It was hard for me to monitor the children with the floor plan, and I did not feel very comfortable at night, as I was afraid I would not hear them if there was a problem. The MOC has a more standard floor plan that has the room connected at the family room. The hotel grounds were very pretty. They were nicely landscaped. I thought MOC's were prettier though. The pool is a big deal for us, with three small children. The 1 1/2 foot baby pool was nice, as was the pirate ship. However, I didn't like that the pirate ship pool was completely separate and about a 3-4 minute walk from the main pool. The Marriott's pirate ship is directly connected to the main pool, and much easier to keep the family together. We all agreed the MOC's pool was much more interesting and prettier than the Westin's pool, with all the waterfalls and the swim through cave it has. The beach at the Westin is wider than the one at MOC, with better snorkeling. However, I still preferred the beach at MOC. It seems more private and intimate, and is a closer walk to the pool. Both the Westin and the MOC have a nice walking path along the ocean, and actually connect to each other (which I didn't know about previously and was wondering if that was new...) Both the Westin and the MOC were very quiet. I did not hear much from neighbors. The biggest negative about the rooms at the Westin was that there was no trash chute anywhere. I had to call someone every time my garbage filled up, which was usually once a day. The staff would then pick up my garbage at the door, but then of course, I had to pay a tip, which I thought was annoying. When I had to throw out a dirty diaper, I had to walk all the way outside to find a garbage to put it in. Why the heck don't they have a garbage chute on each floor? It was very irritating. The staff for both hotels were overall nice and polite. The service was good, except for the issue with our room view. The only other negative about the Westin is all the wind, which I had read about before, but experienced first-hand. I'm not sure exactly why it is windier at the Westin than at the MOC, but it is very noticeable. By the end of the week, we were calling it the \"Westin Wind Tunnel.\" At times, the wind cooled us off, but most of the time, the wind was just an annoyance. One day, we drove over to the MOC from the Westin. When we got to the MOC and walked by the pool, it was much less windier and much nicer to sunbathe. The Westin lacked a decent place on premise to buy \"cheaper\" food. It only had a sit-down restaurant close to the pool which was expensive and didn't have much casual fare, like sandwiches, and ice cream bars. The MOC does have the Market Pantry, which has a good assortment of things to buy, and is right next to the pool. It has an awesome view of the ocean. However, even items such as PJ sandwiches and Pizza are still somewhat pricey. As far as being the best hotel for kids, I prefer the MOC. First, as discussed before, the pool is better with the pirate ship connected to the main pool. Second, Westin has no playground for children, while Marriott has a great playground right next to one of the pools. The Westin also does not have a game room, while the MOC has one which my children really enjoyed. Finally, as a work-out enthusiast, I always try out the gyms a few times during my stay. Both the Westin and the MOC have good work-out areas with cardio equipment, free weights, and machines. MOC has the edge again, as their work out area has a beautiful view of the pool and the ocean, where the Westin's is in a basement, with no view. To sum it up, the Westin was a nice play to stay, but it just can't hold a candle to the Marriott Maui Ocean Club. We'll be staying there next time. It's a better fit for our family.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful sums it up nicely\u201d", "Author": "SusieG1391", "ReviewID": "UR85302640", "Content": "We're staying here now and today is our last day - got an offer in the mail for (island view studio villa) 6days/5nights for $749 including car rental and either 7000 Starwood points or $100 to spend at resort.

The pirates ship for kids is very cute. They have a water slide also. DIDN'T LOVE *TV was cumbersome to figure out and lacked channels (not that we watched much, but still) *Movie rental machines in both lobbies had technical problems (same as above, but nice to be available) *We weren't informed the credit card authorization to check in was $2500; we learned later when checking our bank accounts. All was OK but they should have told us upfront. *Noise from nearby main road, mostly daytime *WiFi did not work in our room. They tried to fix it but it never fully worked. The \"business center\" is basically one computer on a desk on the perimeter of the open lobby, so people walk by. *Hotel layout was hard to navigate; it took myself and many other guests a few days to learn how to get around. *Food/bev is VERY expensive. Hotel gift shop/market is very overpriced. Example - box of instant oatmeal packets is $9.99 (Safeway is normally $3.99). Breakfast buffet at Oceans is $25 (excellent, but pricey). Pool service - Pina coladas are about $9.50. Diet Pepsi is $5. You'll also pay to rent the beach chairs and cushioned pool chairs. Standard pool chairs are complimentary. And don't lose your towel cards or they charge $15. *Housekeeping was inconsistent a couple of days we were there (almost like they left in the middle of cleaning) *We were asked a few times if we wanted to attend a timeshare meeting Tips - when we were there, they offered a \"go green\" program. You'll receive 1 free breakfast buffet voucher per day in exchange for no housekeeping service that day. Ask the front desk about it. Also, they had a hot dog vendor there during the lunch hours on the weekend, selling hot dog, chips and soda for $7.

Upon our arrival, the staff immediately made us feel welcome. Our luggage was promptly delivered to our villa, and our one bedroom accommodations, with partial ocean view, were clean and comfortable - just what we needed after a long flight from the midwest. Love those heavenly beds! The property is beautifully landscaped, with many nice touches such as native Hawaiian flora and banana trees. My wife especially liked the koi fish pond behind the lobby - she would always stop to admire the fish whenever we walked by. Kaanapali Beach was a short walk from our villa. A boardwalk runs along the beachfront adjoining a park and other properties. We found this to be a delightful place for a morning or evening stroll. The beach itself is great for swimming or walking on the shore, and the view, especially when the sun sets between Lanai and Molokai, is simply breathtaking. We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful throughout our stay. We appreciated the concierge personnel, who assisted us in planning activities - mapping out the route to Hana (good advice - leave early), and getting reservations for a luau (Feast at Lele - fabulous!) Only caveat - things are very expensive here, even by Hawaiian standards. From renting beach chairs and umbrellas to eating in the restaurants, it's not cheap. We shopped at the Safeway a few miles down the road and cooked all of our meals. There are large barbecue grills by the pools, which we utilized on several occasions. Overall, we found the Westin to be a wonderful place to stay. Seeing the magnificent sunsets every evening seemed to make us forget about anything else.

This hotel however should not have been branded as a Westin since it lacks many of the Westin brand standards.

Cons: - Rooms lack bathrobes - No room service available - Bathrooms lack privacy from rest of bedroom room - Restaurant at North tower closed on Tuesday and Wednesday - No restaurant at South tower - Pool-side restaurant/cafes close early, are expensive for quality, and the food is not very good even if it were cheap. - Lots of noisy equipment (a/c compressors, pool pumps, etc) right outside many rooms - No pay-per-view in rooms I WOULD come back to this property, it's a great place to enjoy a very deluxe suite, but lacks a lot of options for pampering (restaurants, room service, turn-downs, etc). This is a great setup to bring friends and family. Tips: - 20% off Spa coupons available from restaurant and bar servers. - Stop at Costco, Whalers General Stores or ABC stores on your way in for food to cook yourself at the property, not many food choices without driving away from property. - Double check which tower you are staying at in advance. You might find yourself waiting in a long line at the front desk only to find out you are at the wrong tower. - Great entertainment nightly at the Royal Lahaina, just south of the property, 5 minute walk. - Great food at Dukes Beach House, just north of the property, 10 minute walk.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hedgesville, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAnother week in paradise\u201d", "Author": "mjs47", "ReviewID": "UR83675581", "Content": "As owners at the VIllas, this is our 8th visit in 8 years.

I have stayed in many hotels and this is the first I review I felt compelled to write. First off, I read reviews about this hotel before selecting either the Westin south of this one or the Sheraton but when I found out these were more condo style rooms with a laundry facility, kitchenette, and full sized fridge, as well as jacuzzi, I was pretty much sold. Given that my trip would be 10 days, eating out would be tiresome and washing bathing suits and clothes every other day at a laundromat was out of the question. There are also many BBQs that are available for guest use and we had no problem finding a vacant one during dinner time. Here's a quick recap of my overall experience: CHECK IN Checking in was quick. However, the front desk staff wasn't overly excited and quite expressionless but I suppose that is better than being awful and rude to guests. I did notice that during mornings, line ups would form but they weren't as bad as the lineups I saw when I walked down the Westin that is south of this hotel *yikes*. I had the impression parking was free but was later notified that it was 7 dollars a night, or 9 for valet. ROOMS We stayed in a Dlx Studio Suite in the North tower. At the beginning of this trip, the hotel is confusing as heck to navigate through. Elevator signs that lead you to more hallways, the numbering system of the rooms (listen to the front desk instructions carefully), etc. Hold on to those maps of the front desk agents hand you when you check in because they come in handy if you haven't been here. Once you got the hang of the buildings, it wasn't too painful. The hotel room was equipped with all your kitchen necessities such as pots and pans, cutlery, glasses, plates, etc which was fantastic. Kitchenette also had a dishwasher which made cleaning easy. I have read reviews about the odd window in the wall that goes through the bathroom into the bedroom area but it doesn't bother me as it made the room feel more open yet still retain privacy. The decor is simple and everything in the room was quite up to date in terms of style, so no complaints there at all. The bed was heavenly. Enough said. The large flat TV was great for watching a movie. The room comes with a DVD player as well as a Ipod Dock/Radio. The hotel is also equipped with FREE wi-fi which is AMAZING since many of us now cannot live without being connected. Not to mention, the connection speed was faster than expected and getting online was 100x easier than most hotels I have stayed at. RESORT The resort has a great kids pool for toddlers to age 5 with a large pirate ship to crawl all over. Its nicely tucked in a spot for families. There is two other great pools that are located elsewhere on the resort so you can take your pick on which you like most but they are equally nice. I went during down season when all the children are back at school so the pool area was rarely busy and chaises were easy to find. Staff have told me that it can get a little wild during Christmas and summer so beware if you are looking for that perfect romantic, quiet getaway during peak times. The overall appearance of the resort is quite spectacular compared to its neighbours. Really, it is. The lawns are trimmed to perfection, the lobby is beautiful, the hallways can probably use a good buff from all the snorkel gear being dragged around but overall, its well kept. SERVICE I love towel service. Especially since we are almost on the beach and there are plenty of pools, fresh towels were a great luxury. It was noted that housekeeping would arrive anytime before 5pm which seemed late but as it was clearly noted in the hotel directory and elsewhere, so we just accepted the fact. I believe you may request a time for a housekeeper to come in but I'm unsure if there are any additional charges or if this is frowned upon. Each clean was very thorough. Now, here probably comes the worst part of the trip which isn't that bad but suppose is worth mentioning. As I do not hold a deed to this hotel (this resort is part timeshare), I felt that the level of service at concierge was not as genuinely open to visitors of the resort. Not only this, but I asked for several directions on multiple occasions for certain activities held on the resort and was given wrong directions each time to where the activities were held and at times, they were even unsure when and where these places were. Keep in mind, these activities are held at the resort itself. This was incredibly frustrating to have to walk back and forth to different concierge desks located throughout the hotel to get proper directions. LOCATION Located on Kaanapli Beach, it is definitely one of the most luxe beaches you can find on the island in my opinion. There is a great Beach Walk on the resort that is open to the public and if you are willing to go the distance (I would recommend you drive though since the heat can get to you but I have seen people walk it), you can check out Whaler's Village for some shopping and eating, and other hotels to find out that you are definitely at one of the best. Stopping by at the Westin south, the night time vibe was more lively but during the daytime, the pool area is swamped. North of this hotel, you can drive to Kapula Beach for a snorkel or Honokeana if you are more interested in seeing sea turtles as there is an abundance located at this beach. Black Rock which is located at the Sheraton hotel is also fantastic for snorkeling. These beaches are close in proximity to each other and are only about a 5 minute drive away. There are also many others along the coast but these are ones worth mentioning. The town of Lahaina is about 7 minutes away and easy to get to. After visiting most of the area of Maui, the location of this hotel/resort is prime for snorkeling and dining. You also get a great view of the sunset on the beach. There is not much on the east side. FOOD There really isn't that much selection in terms of food at this hotel. I wouldn't highly recommended eating too much here as its really nothing to write home about. If you are a foodie, check out restaurants in the town of Lahaina or venture elsewhere along the beach walk. The drinks poolside can add up to cost an arm and a leg and bringing your own liquor is prohibited but happy hour runs from 4-6 so feel guilt free to fill up then. ACTIVITIES This hotel/resort offers many family friendly activities throughout the week such as hula lessons, ukelele lesson, water fit, etc (some are complimentary only). Its a nice break from going out to the beach all day but as mentioned, get the right directions of where they are held or you may lose your chance to participate. If you're into golfing, this location is prime for some spectacular greens I have ever seen in my life. The lawns were so green that it made the colour of fresh celery look pathetic. This place is pretty quiet at night compared to its neighbouring hotels which held luaus or live entertainment which was disappointing but we found that we were pretty burnt out by the end of the night anyway. If you want entertainment, it is not hard to find down the beach walk in the evening. To sum up, I really loved my stay here and would recommend it to anyone hands down if they are here during low season. Apparently it can be pretty crazy busy here with families, but you can really say that about any hotel. For the cost of what you get, and the amenities that are available in your room as well as service, I would highly suggest you select this hotel compared to its competitors. It is definitely family friendly, has an excellent beach, and is in the perfect location to everything you want and need from Maui. TIP* Do yourself a favour and rent a car when you visit this island. Public transportation is dreadful here as I only saw about 3 buses on my entire trip and taxis are rarely seen. With this in mind, don't forget your GPS, you will need it.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cAnother breath of fresh air in Maui\u201d", "Author": "Opengtune", "ReviewID": "UR79551571", "Content": "My wife and I stayed in the Westin Villas this year for the first time.

We were poolside but the noise was never an issue. The staff provided a shuttle each day to town or to the other adjacent resorts. The shuttle was timely and saved the hassle of trying to park our rental car. The room was clean, new and although we had a studio size room it provided more than ample space for our needs. After all you are in Maui so go outside as much as possible. We hope to return to the resort again. we also hope to bring family to take advantage of the many swimming pools and beautiful sunsets.

However, when we arrived the check-in person told us she had no record of that request! and that we would have to change rooms! Ok so an error was made. My husband then went to the front desk to check-out of our current room at 0900 the next morning and was told that out new room as ready. Great expect that this person asked us why we didn't just go there yesterday. It was free!!! We were very disappointed with that. Also since it was our wedding anniversary my in-laws had called ahead and left a note for us indicating that they had purchased a gift certificate for us for dinner at one the restaurants near by. No one ever told us about it! Finally my father in law called us and asked us if we got it and then we went looking for it. It was sitting in the back office! Good use that would have been. The resort is very beautiful and the pools and beach are great. Some of the best snorkelling around is right outside the resort. There are great BBQ's to use on the grounds as well. However, we went to use them one night and they were not working. So we called \"o\" as indicated on the sign near the BBQ's and asked to have someone come look. We had to call back 3 times and finally after 45 minutes my husband went and found a maintenance person to do it. He said it was already done and cleared in the system. No one had coem and checked with us at teh BBQ's that they were working. The maintenance person just had to turn the gas on and they were working in 2 min!!!

We had a very nice stay. The best thing about this location was the wonderful beach right outside your door! The water was clear, clean and calm. Now i understand people go to Maui to surf - obviously this isn't the place for that. But if you want to just swim around and relax, it was perfect. The snorkeling was also very good here. It was nice to be able to snorkel right there and not have to go anywhere. The sand was very soft and clean. We never bothered renting chairs (with three kids, we don't really sit down much). We just sat on towels. I noticed that not many people used the chairs and I do have to say, for a resort, they were the sorriest looking beach chairs I have seen at a high end resort! They were reminiscent of the 1970s metal lounge chairs. They were rusted and everything! I can't believe you had to pay to use them. The pools were nice but we pretty much steered clear. Figured we were there for the beaches. Though my kids love pools, we tried to keep them out as much as possible. Almost every trip we take, someone comes down with swimmer's ear or an ear infection from the hotel pools! The pools at the Villas North was very quiet and relaxing though. Very nice layout with waterfalls. We did venture over to the other side (I guess it is South?) for the water slide a few times. It was much more crowded and crazy over there. Couldn't even get a chair (didn't have this problem at the pools in the North Villas). The kids seemed to enjoy the slide (ages 11, 9 and 7) though they have been on some of the biggest water slides around (think Atlantis), so I\"m not sure what they found so appealing about this slide - maybe just because there were lots of kids around. That being said, the pool was closed a couple of times for \"accidents\". I saw way too many babies in diapers and swim diapers around. They really need to keep babies out of these pools. It is disgusting. Service was pretty good. Didn't really come in to much contact with personnel as we were on the beach all day or sightseeing, so really spent minimal time inside. We ate lunch a couple of times at the pool restaurant (can't think of the name). The service was good but as usual with resort food, it was pricey and marginal. Not much of a selection for a vegetarian (though I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised about how vegetarian/vegan friendly Maui was! Even the remotest roadside stands on the Road to Hana touted vegetarian food. It was much more progressive as far as vegetarianism than any other area I have traveled to in the US and Mexico and beats NJ by a mile!). We did have a few minor issues with house keeping. They come in once during the week to refresh towels/linens, etc. They did not replace the soap. We called down twice to get more and when they finally came, they brought shampoo and conditioner and no soap! ???? We also had a very unpleasant experience with a worker in the towel hut at the pool on the South side. The day the pool was closed down for the \"accident\", we were getting towels. I noticed the pool was all roped off with a police line (no kidding!). I asked what happened and some smart a$$ in the pool hut said \"She pooped in the pool\" and pointed at my 9 year old daughter! ?? What the heck? Obviously he thought he was being funny but it was disgraceful behavior. We were absolutely shocked. My daughter was devastated and mortified. What a complete loser! I have never encountered something like this and from an adult (I would expect this from my 7 year old but not a resort worker!). The location was good. Very close to Lahaina which is where we ate most nights. I highly recommend Mala for dinner! Great service and wonderful food. Hula in Whaler's Village was good. I also hear there are quite a few restaurants in Kapalua in the hotels but we didn't get a chance to go that way. I recommend trying the beach at Napili Beach (about a 10 minute drive). It was beautiful. Also very calm and clear and they had some awesome tidal pools in the lava rocks that the kids loved investigating in!

About 2 years ago we went in October and had a pretty different experience. We booked an Ocean View Deluxe One Bedroom and were very happy with our room. This time, probably because it was summer break, we played room roulette upon check in, which consumed the tiny afternoon window we had to enjoy the pool or beach after check in (4 p.m.). The first room had a real issue for us as well as some beat up looking furniture, the second was a handicap room--nothing wrong with it but we wanted a different bathroom set up--the third had an ocean AND a parking lot view. The fourth was fine but downwind from the restaurant which made it smell like cheeseburgers. We finally settled into the 4th room. (As an aside, we had a similar problem when staying at the Westin Villas in Palm Springs, CA. There they actually tried to check us into an already occupied room!) It was in building 3 with a view of the main pool and restaurant scene and a nice bit of ocean. We came to appreciate the view as my husband liked to jump up and see how crowded the pool was getting each morning. We were in the south towers which are older but also supposedly have bigger rooms. We never got to check out the north towers so I can't really comment. This is what a bell hop told us. I read here that they probably save their better rooms (ie closer to the ocean so better ocean view) for owners and I guess that only makes sense. Once we were settled, we really enjoyed everything this property had to offer. I guess except the restaurants. We got a few things from the general store but chose to eat more in the room (we picked up groceries on the way in) or at other restaurants. One of the reasons we choose this type of property is that we have small children and appreciate the having a fully stocked kitchen and washer and dryer at our disposal. We were able to pack light and save a little money. The general store has some basic food supplies, and some nice treats. Try the shrimp skewers. We broiled them in the oven and they were very tasty. The beach and pools at the Westin Villas are wonderful. We tried to visit both each day. My sons loved the pirate ship pool as well as the big pool. My older son loved the big water slide. The pools seemed more popular than the beach so we got to enjoy a very calm, peaceful beach scene. There were always plenty of chaises available at the pool but the morning seems to be the prime time and we did notice people reserving chairs with towels. The staff does come by and tag these chairs with a time left unattended tag so that you can have someone's stuff booted if they haven't shown up after an hour. The concierge service was a bit spotty. The first time we used them, the restaurant they reserved for us had no record of the reservation. The second time we used them, we got what we wanted but when we went downstairs to get our tickets printed, the concierge helping us seemed really scattered and rude. During this time of year, I would say that this is a better choice for families than for young couples or young singles. Maybe it's just my perspective but the group of drunken 20 somethings teetering down the hall seemed a tad out of place. Overall, we really do like the Westin Villas and would recommend it.

We decided to explore the property and come back at 4:00. When we showed back up to check in at 4:00 the desk staff said the room was still not ready. A little annoyed we decided to wait in the lobby. After a few minutes one of the desk staff came over to explain the room inspection failed for a couple broken items that needed to be repaired. We appreciated the explaination and after another 10 min. our room was ready. When we got our room we found a very nice two room suite with a king bed, full kitchen, washer/dryer, large balcony, and a very large bathroom. We had requested two roll-away beds as the kids don't like sleeper sofas. The roll-aways, it turns out, are very comfortable, but at this Westin you'll pay $5/night/roll-away. This Westin is very large with separate North and South properties with separate mini-stores, restaurants, and pools, and a childrens pool too. Even though they were separate you still could use the services of either property. Since we were in the North building we used the North pool which did not seem to be crowded. The beach seemed nice but not very wide and we thought it was better suited for snorkeling rather than swimming (though there did not seem to be issues with people who just wanted to swim). We did snorkel right off the beach and saw lots of fish and the green sea turtles. The water was also very calm which made for good snorkeling. They also had a couple nice vendors in the hotel lobby during the weekend. One was a jewelry vendor who sold some very nice bracelets and necklaces at reasonable prices. The biggest inconvenience was the hotel design - basically a \"U\" shape. For example, since the property was so large the parking was on the other side of the complex of the North side. The hotel design made such that you have to walk from the outer parts to the bottom of the \"U\" and they out again to get to the parking, which also had very small spaces. The elevators also seemed only to be in the bottom of the \"U\" so if you are on the top you have to walk to the bottom to take the elevators down, the back to the top to go to the pool or the beach.

We had carefully done our research and planning, and had been looking forward to our long-awaited trip. Unfortunately, our overall experience at this resort was so surprisingly uneven that we would not hesitate to say that we would absolutely not return again, nor recommend this resort to others. Aspects of the resort met our expectations - location, pools, beach and beach access, rooms themselves, grounds. However, our experience was marred by the following issues, mostly dealing with service. First, we had placed a request for rooms in building 7. Upon arrival, we were told that our request had not been seen, and, not only that, the rooms that we were assigned to were in the worst possible location - in the older buildings, on the second floor, overlooking the resort entrance and parking lot. We were told that this was peak season and the resort was to full capacity and that there were no other rooms available. For the next 3 days, we kept checking back to see if there were cancellations, but had no luck. We didn't expect an ocean view room, as that's not what we had paid for, but in terms of non-ocean view rooms, we seemed to have received the worst possible end of the stick. Moreover, the staff that we dealt with, with possibly one exception, were generally unapologetic and condescending, and unsympathetic to our situation. Second, housekeeping service was uneven, at best. Most days, the housekeeping staff neglected to replace something. Several times, we had to call to ask for additional coffee, shampoo, etc. At least twice, one of our beds were not fully made. Third, upon our departure, our bill reflected telephone charges showing 25+ calls to the same local number, each made within a fraction of a second of each other. Each call was billed $1. We pointed out to the front desk that this was technically impossible , but they maintained that their system is incapable of making a mistake in its logging of calls, and even suggested that perhaps one of our children was playing with the phone! In the end, they agreed to erase half of the charges, but we were still left with a $14 bill for a local call lasting less than a minute. While we are on the topic of phone charges, it would have been nice if the $1 charge for local calls were disclosed somewhere more visible, like on the telephone itself, rather than buried inside in the resort handbook. A fourth issue, though less of a concern than the prior three, is that it is nearly impossible to get any poolside bar or food service. There are virtually no servers available. In the many hours that we spent at the pools, we saw only one server the entire time. Collectively, these disappointing experiences made our trip less ideal than it should have been.

When you arrive the concierge gives you a box of chocolates and a $75 resort credit for free. If you agree to go to a timeshare presentation they give you an extra $100 resort credit and a coupon for 50% off a future stay at any non-Hawaii Starwood hotel. It's easy to say no, but we agreed out of curiosity. The presentation was one-on-one with a very professional salesman and took less than 90 minutes. He was definitely a good salesman and it was easy to be tempted but it was also easy to say no. When you decline a second person comes in and offers you another preview stay for $2600 (not such a good deal). There was nothing shady at all about going on a preview package. I would highly recommend it if you have the option. We stayed in building 2, which was far back from the beach but still had a nice view. The only \"bad\" building is 4, which really does overlook the parking lot. We stayed on the original (south) side of the resort, but there is a newer (north) side as well. They have two separate lobbies but function as one large resort. The only downside (and it's a big one) is that the studio villas on the south side do not have a true lanai, just a little step out balcony. Otherwise, the studio we stayed in was very nice and plenty big for the two of us and our son's crib. I found the pools to be more tranquil and less busy on the north side. We were excited to try the pirate ship pool, which is between the north and south sides. There is a sign saying that you must be under a certain height to play there but it was not enforced. There were too many rowdy big kids there for my son to be comfortable, but it was better at certain times of the day. The beach is nice and clean, but fairly steep. Not great for a little one but not awful either. There were plenty of people there in the afternoons but not nearly as crowded as Kaanapali Beach proper. After seeing how congested the Whaler's Village area was I was very glad we stayed up the beach a little bit. The breakfast buffet was fine, although they Hyatt has a much more impressive buffet for only a few dollars more. Lunch and dinner at the Ocean Pool Bar & Grill were both fine but not memorable. We got takeout from the Italian restaurant a couple of times that was good, but would have been great if we had dined in. About a 10 minute walk north up the boardwalk is Duke's. We sat outside, where we had a limited bar menu but a lovely view and live music. A good place to try something different without having to go too far. We would also recommend Cool Cat Cafe (really wonderful burgers on Front Street in Lahaina Town) and Penne Pasta (thin crust pizza and pasta on Dickenson in Lahaina Town). CJ's Deli (in a strip mall just south on 30) was okay for breakfast. We had a nice dinner at Cane & Taro (in Whaler's Village) and they were very accommodating with the kiddo (stored the stroller for us, got us in and out very quickly). Our son cut his finger on a trash can at the airport, so our first stop was the emergency room at Maui Memorial Medical Center. They were wonderful. We were in and out in about 2 hours and they took great care of us. We went to Minit Medical in Lahaina for a suture check a couple of days later and I was not happy with their bedside manner or medical advice, at least for a pediatric patient. Other activities we enjoyed included the Maui Ocean Center, Iao Valley (stop at Maui Bake Shop on the way for a cookie), and the Surfing Goat Dairy (yummy and fun for kids, but don't believe them when they say the frozen cheese will last the flight home in checked baggage!). We also found several playgrounds, as our son has a serious need to climb. There's a rec center nearby on Shaw & HWY 30 in Lahaina with a park attached. Kahana Beach Park in Kihei has a nice big playground. And the 4th Marine Division Memorial Park in Haiku has an awesome play structure. There were tons of locals there when we went on Sunday afternoon. One more thing... The valets were great. You can self park in the same lot the valets use but they only charged us $2 a day for valet. We occasionally had to wait at busy times, but they were always very friendly and helpful. I have read in other reviews that this hotel is missing the aloha spirit, but I disagree. I think it's maybe a Westin thing, that their hotels have a more understated style. Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful, and seemed truly concerned that we enjoy our stay. I'm sure we will return someday, either on our own or in 5-10 years when our son is a more appropriate age for such an adventure.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lahaina, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful place to relax\u201d", "Author": "teaniw", "ReviewID": "UR75693712", "Content": "We are a family here on Maui and decided to spend the weekend at the hotel for our daughters birthday.

We decided to come back around that time, and they told us our room still was not ready; meanwhile, there was another party checking in and they got a room right away. When we complained, the front desk girl (Moana) told us that she could get us another room which was even better than the room we were supposed to get, and we could check in right away. We took the room without thinking any more of it. Upon arriving in the room, we realized that it was a handicapped room, which meant there there was no tub in the washroom, and lower bars in the closets. We called back down to request a standard room. They then switched us to another room on the same floor; as soon as we walked in, we were greeted with a strong smell of detergent/smoke, we felt nauseous. We called down to complain again, and then they switched us to a 3rd room. There was a blood stain in the washroom (which we asked housekeeping twice to clean but they never did); however, at this point, it was now past dinnertime, we were so tired, we settled into the 3rd room. When we took a shower, we realized the rubber grip on the door was missing, and as a result, water leaked all over the unit. What a horrible experience. Housekeeping had to come in to clean. The worst part was, the hotel didn't even seem to care and when we complained, all that was offered was to waive our parking fees. In addition, all other hotels we stayed at during our honeymoon, was more than happy to upgrade us, and offer us a bottle of champagne. The Westin offered absolutely nothing. It seems that they did not care it was our honeymoon, and left us with a very sour taste of the hotel. It is really a shame as being a Starwood Preferred Guest, we have always thought very highly of the Westin brand. This hotel ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THE STANDARDS OF A WESTIN HOTEL.

We tried to participate in the kids activities and their child care facilities but it seemed so crowded in a small room.

One of the employees even told us its just us for now and we have 20 kids way too many for two workers which scared me to leave my two children. I took the advice from the concierge and took my kids to the maui ocean center kids program. They had a blast doing ocean activities and arts and crafts we signed them up for 2 days. It was a journey but well worth it to see my kids happy. the resort offered nothing that we felt would meet or exceed our expectation as far as family fun or activities. If there is anything I would suggest it would be to recreate a more family friendly environment even by the pool it was a little uncomfortable too many kids climbing on each other and when we asked the pool attendant to do something before someone gets hurt he said I have to wait for a manager from the other side it took too long. We hope in the future these issues be addressed when I tried to contact the Manager (Mana) not sure if I spelled it correctly she never returned our call and we even asked for her at the kids care room and they sorry she's off try again on Monday.

Everyone from housekeeping to bell hop to check-in staff are super nice. Normally I'm used to grumpy housekeeping that are always mad when we tell them to come back. BUT NOT HERE!! At the Westin Villas they are super nice and even told us to \"Take our time!!\" Whenever we called housekeeping they would come by within 10 minutes. One time my daughter spilled water on the bedsheets and we had to get it changed and no one came in 30 minutes. I called housekeeping again and they were super apologetic and had someone knocking on our door in 2 minutes! I also like the fact that NO ONE left their trash outside their door. I always stay at 4 to 5 star hotels (yes I like to be pampered while on vacation) and it's always annoyed me that people leave their room trash outside their rooms. It simply looks tacky. BUT NO ONE did that here at the Westin Villas because housekeeping is just a phone call away. Every staff member made us feel right at home. Even when I took my daughter's floatie to the pool and was blowing it up myself ... the pool staff there stopped me and offered me to use their air pump for free! OMG! What awesome service! I'm used to pool staff that's indifferent and could care less BUT NOT HERE! Every staff member is so happy and helpful and that's EVERY SINGLE DAY during our 8 day/7 night stay. I think there's a bit of pride to be working at the Westin Villas. I also liked their self-parking option because it makes getting stuff in and out so much easier. We could have easily have asked Tosh, our assigned personal room manager to help us with getting things in and out of our car. But our hotel room was right next to the self-parking area that it was faster for us to just walk to our hotel room. When we first arrived, not only did Tosh help us get everything out of our car but he also gave us tips and tricks to do while he was getting our lugguage to our room. He also gave us advice on where to park our car for easy loading and unloading. Plus he mentioned that if we needed help with anything from ideas to good dining, to good hang-out spots, how to work the air conditioning unit, ANYTHING he was there to help us. Why can't all hotels have this? And most importantly all service is with a smile here, EVERYDAY! By the way, their beach is fabulous too!! I saw lots of fish! And the swimming pools were also terrific for both adults and toddlers! My 20 month old fell in love with their pirate ship pool! We stayed for one week at the end of July 2010 and we will definitely be coming back to this awesome resort. ---------- We decided to swing by the other Westin ... the Resort and Spa one and I can't say the same thing about them. We wanted to park there thinking the 2 Westins were interchangeable. But the bell hop/valet guy reluctantly came over to our car and told us we can't park there. I then asked him how the beach was and he told me that they had NO BEACH access. WTF? The Westin Resort & Spa is right on the beach and they had no beach access? That was a BLATANT LIE!

When we booked the room we requested a room in the North Tower...we were told that they would make a note and do their best. We received two confirmation phone calls in the month before we arrived and both times were told that they noticed we had requested the North tower and they would do their best. Okay, so we check in and our room is in the South tower...I understand that sometimes things just don't work out so we did not make a fuss (at all!) about it but I did mention that I was dissappointed...what irked me though was that there was no acknowlegement of our disappointment...what would have made all the difference to me is if they had just said \"we are so sorry this didn't work out\". I will say that the person helping us did seem to look at some options (I'm guessing that is what she was doing but she never did tell us) but then just said \"nope, there isn't anything in the North tower, and since you booked on a package deal this is all we have\". And so it began, I guess because we were on a package deal we were not treated the same? Caroline our concierge was very nice to us (although disappointed that we wouldn't do the timeshare presentation, but really? We had not had a warm reception at all so far) and she was able to get us all our hotel information, she also mentioned to us that since we were celebrating our anniversary they were going to send something to our room...we never recieved anything. We asked to opt out of the housecleaning in order to take advantage of the breakfast vouchers and they said \"great!\"...two days later our room was cleaned, I called and was told they would still give us the vouchers so I picked it up, went to the breakfast only to be told that only one of us would have the complimentary buffet because we only had one voucher. I offered to go speak to the front desk about getting the other voucher but was told they'd figure it out...which I guess they did but it put a sour taste in my mouth. The room itself was very clean and the bed was nice. We looked out at the parking lot and turnaround and we were on the first floor so we had a lot of traffic/people noise but when the slider was closed it was quiet enough. The shuttle is very nice...and the drivers were excellent. We also enjoyed the beach which had great snorkeling. I really don't have much else to add. I think this is my first somewhat negative review that I've ever written so I'd like to finish by saying....I believe this hotel/condo has the potential to be a fabulous place (and many people already believe it is) it wouldn't take much to make people like myself happy...just a little aloha spirit which I have read on many previous reports seems to be shared with some people...maybe just not the people who are there on a package deal...although as I mentioned earlier, Caroline and the drivers of the shuttle were awesome.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maple Valley, WA", "Title": "\u201cBest Resort Ever!\u201d", "Author": "Shawna95", "ReviewID": "UR69348878", "Content": "Just got back last night from a wonderful week at WKORV. We booked an island view 1 bedroom through Expedia. From what I have read they said be prepared for a unit in the south tower overlooking the parking lot. When I booked I made a special request for ground floor overlooking the pool. Maybe this helped, as we ended up with a unit in the North Tower overlooking the Pirate Pool (not the pool I had in mind - but it was still great and we heard no noise from the kids) with a partial ocean view. I could not have been happier with the location. Bldg 6 is in the middle and convenient for both sides. This place is absolutely beautiful. I will never stay anywhere else in Maui again. The rooms were nice and the beds great (of course). I loved the location of the resort as it is an easy walk to Whalers Village. Which we did frequentely. Also, the snorkling out front was wonderful. My 14 yo son hooked up with other kids the first day and we hardly ever saw him again. I give this a 5 star on every level. My only complaint about this resort, although it was minor - When I stay at a condo type resort I feel it is expected that you will be making some (if not all) your own food, drinks etc. We felt very uncomfortable bringing our own food/drinks to the pool. We felt it was expected you purchase thiers when you are at the pool. We usually poured our beers into a plastic cup and brought them. Nothing was ever said to us. One day the pool the man next to us very discretely poured a can of beer into a cup, in his ice chest out of sight. The pool waiter said he was not to be bringing his own to the pool. They guy said I was only trying to save a few bucks. The waiter replied \"I have mouths to feed also\". I can uderstand this at some of the other resorts, but I thought that was the point when you stayed in a condo. From there on, we just kept a few of the cups they serve beers in and then just went to the room and refilled them with our own. That is the only negative thing I can say.

I'm migrating my reviews from another website.) Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Ocean Resort Villas is the newest lodging along Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach. Built in 2003, this resort is very modern and built with impeccable materials. Many people do not know about this hotel/timeshare as it doesn't receive much publicity. I came across it on Starwood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employee website and knew it was the Starwood property on Maui. Only one stoplight past Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Parkway, the Villas are billed as a timeshare resort. However, rooms are available and you can expect everything and more that Westins are known for. Others have reviewed the larger 1 bedroom rooms here. We stayed in a Deluxe Oceanview Studio Villa on the top floor with a view of the beautiful public park (see a wedding a day from the comfort of your couch) and Black Rock less than a mile down the beach. Our 500-sq. ft. studio was the perfect base of operations for sight seeing on Maui. The list of amenities in the room is as long as your arm. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to hit the highlights. All counters throughout the room were granite. The furniture and fixtures were tasteful and modern. All other hotel sink and counters should be patterned after this one. There is plenty of room to stow toiletries. The whirlpool bath is not to be missed. Shutters above the bath separate the bathroom and the living area. The room seems much larger than if a solid wall had been installed. The shower here is huge, about 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122x6\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with a bench to boot. The room containing the toilet was even larger. A stacked washer and dryer occupy a closet immediately after entering the room. My one complaint here is that you only receive one tiny Tide detergent box and two small fabric softeners. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the hotel could get them for less than 50 cents so when a room is going for $450 per night, I think they could kick down soap and fabric softener on request. The Heavenly Bed was superb. What more can you say about it? After staying at the Westin, little touches in our room were noticed. The HVAC system was light years ahead of the archaic unit in the Westin Resort room we had stayed at. The system at this hotel is even wired to the door so the air conditioner automatically shuts off if you open the sliding door (or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it closed ALL the way, to my chagrin). The biggest difference between the two room types here is that the studio lacks a proper lanai. Studios have a sliding door and about 12\" of space. I used it to dry some flip flops one day. Another great feature here is the ample parking (not even a resort charge to justify it!). What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better, parking is available under the entire structure. This is great as we avoided a car baking in the morning sun every day except our last. I could go on and on about this place.

We spent two weeks at this wonderful resort for our 30th wedding anniversary and did not have one bad experience to speak of. We own at the Grand Lodge in Breckenridge CO., which is a gold level condo and newly built in 2008. We do know what luxury is, and the Westin Villas north is very nice. This was a trade through II & we were told we got lucky by this location. We were in a 1 br. villa looking into the beautiful, huge pool area the first week, and then requested a ocean front unit for the second week. They had a studio available & we took it. Although smaller than the 1 br. unit it was great. We enjoyed the gorgeous kitchen in both units and cooked many meals which saved tons of $$$. This resort is very well maintained inside and out. The grounds were incredible, flowers, trees, sand, & beach. It is a short walk from the pool to the beach ( maybe 40 yards) and Ka'anapali Beach had as good snorkeling as the two charter trips we took. The North complex (buildings 5,6,7,&8) are the newer of the Westins Villas and a bit nicer than the South area. Although older the South complex is also very nice and we visited there and ate at their pools side restaurant one day. The front desk and concierge were very nice and helpful. I worked with them a few months before we arrived for some special arrangements for my wonderful wife of 30 years. They did all I ask for, and were excited to meet us when we arrived. The general store was a bit pricy buy hey, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a high level resort so what can you expect. They did have a good selection of things. The shuttle is good and you can ride it all the way into Lahaina for all kinds of shopping, food , restaurants, and bars. Safeway is only a short ride or drive (5 mins.) and there is a Mall right there also. I took over 650 pics of the trip so I am not going to post them because they pictures can not truly express the way it is there. My advice is go for two weeks if possible, it took us one week to do the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Maui. We then took the second week to relax at the resort. We rented a car for the first week and used the shuttle the second week. If you only have a week, do your sightseeing and trips the first part of the week then relax for a few days. Maui has their own pace that they operate at. Get ready to SLOW down and you will enjoy it as much as we did. If you want to go \u00e2\u20ac\u201c go \u00e2\u20ac\u201c go, and be entertained go to Vegas , if you want a beautiful, tropical, and laid-back time, go the Westin Villas North in Maui.

The rooms are big and comfortable, but I did hear those \"banging pipes\" from time to time, esp in the bathroom. Now for the not-so-good: Included in our stay was a daily housekeeping visit to make up the room...this happened every other day and only because my wife and I continued to call and remind them that the room needed to be cleaned. Their response was \"well your prvacy sign was on the outside of your door.\" Yes, true, it was up while our kids were napping, for 2 hours a day...plenty of other time to come back without me having to call over and over (and get attitude when calling!)

One day we took a trip down to Wailea, and as luck would have it, there was a fire, and the road connecting \"North\" and \"South\" was closed (some said it would be closed until the following morning). So we were stuck in the Southern section with 2 kids and minimal clothes/diapers etc...Granted, Wailea is gorgeous and not a bad place to be \"stuck.\" We called the hotel and spoke with the concierge, and they could not have been less helpful. They stated \"yeah I live in the Wailea area so I don't know how I'll get home either.\" Then silence on the phone...no recommendations, no offers to give us updates when they received news about the road opening...nothing. My wife finally asked if they could call us when they received any information, and the concierge stated, \"Yes, I already have a list going.\" Really, why didn't you mention this BEFORE I asked you? We were supposedly placed on this list, but never received a phone call or any update. We stayed at the Grand Wailea for the night, and they were extremely understanding/accomodating, offering a discount to all the people who were \"stranded.\" In fact, we hung out at the pool at the Grand Wailea with 8 other families from the Westin, and all expressed their disappointment with the Westin's lack of helpl with the situation. I am in complete agreement with the reviewer that mentioned how they walked by the concierge several times and they never looked up. Poolisde service: very sparse but there if you really seek it out (i.e., walk to the restaurant and specifically ask for it). Service at the restaurant: Just ask the couple who told their waiter \"Oh, you're our waiter..we didn't know because we didn't see you once during our breakfast.\" That's what we overheard while we waited to be seated, although we had 2 waiters who were outstanding during our stay...the rest were just not interested in customer service at all. I have actually never written a review regarding a vacation before, but I felt obliged to do so this time because so many others felt as we did. Like the family that bought a vacation share last year and asked it they could stay in the same room that they had last year...the response, \"Good luck, we're at 95% occupancy.\" They persisted and eventually found someone who actually cares about customer service and made it happen.

Overall the grounds are immaculate. Room was nice. Only comment would be that it needs a good \"once over\" cleaning i.e. curtains need laundering, walls could use a wash. Otherwise very clean - housekeeping kept the showers, kitchen, carpets, etc. spotless. Also, don't bother eating at the restaurants onsite. We'd recommend walking down to Duke's or heading into Lahina to Maui Tacos (light lunch fare), Betty's Cafe (breakfast - good value) or bbqing onsite/cooking insuite.

Our friends are timeshare owners and they let us use their week. (Lucky us!!) We arrived at the Westin Villas around 1:30 p.m., so our room was not ready. Fortunately, the bellhop was able to store our refrigerated food and bags. We stayed in a one-bedroom villa in the North Tower on the fifth floor (Room 6554). Our room was gorgeous. We had a wonderful view of the koi pond, pool, and ocean. The North Tower seemed a little more mellow and had fewer kids than the South Tower. Our villa was very spacious with a full kitchen, jacuzzi tub, and washer/dryer. (They provided laundry soap/dryer sheet for two loads.) I would HIGHLY recommend upgrading to an ocean view room. There were a few locations where the villa balcony faces an empty lot or the parking lot. I would have been very disappointed. Also, there is complimentary wi-fi in your villa and around the entire resort. The kitchen is very well stocked. It had all of the essential utensils including silverware, steak knives, tongs, a spatula, plates, bowls, glasses, pots, pans, a pitcher, blender, toaster, etc. It also came with dish soap, dish towels, dishwasher soap, and a sponge. Thanks to a previous review, we remembered to bring our spices in plastic bags to cook with. We went to the Costco next to the airport on our way to the hotel and loaded up on items for all of our meals. (FYI, the prices are probably much higher in Maui compared to back home.) We really enjoyed BBQ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ing in the evenings. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great way to save money, ensure a good meal, and meet people. (Bring some chips, salsa, and a margarita and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re set for the perfect BBQ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ing experience.) We never had an issue trying to get a BBQ, but the front desk said the hotel was only about 70% full and we ate around 5:30 pm which I think is earlier than most. I would also recommend bringing/buying foil for BBQ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ing veggies and sandwich bags if you want to bring lunch on a day trip. Also, if you forget anything there is a store in the front lobby. Since we were technically timeshare owners we had the option of valeting our car for $9.00/day or self-parking for free. The Westin provided complimentary valet parking the first night. We decided to self-park the rest of our stay. We never had a issue finding a close parking spot, although, the spots were extremely tight. ( I am sure we all left with a few extra dints.) The grounds and pool areas are beautiful. They do an amazing job maintaining the grounds. We never had an issue finding a chair by the pool, but it was pretty windy during our stay which I think detoured people for laying by the pool. Chairs under the umbrellas are prime property, so those can be difficult to obtain. We also enjoyed taking advantage of the drink service. There were normally one to two people walking around asking if we would like a drink from the bar. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drink of the day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was $6.00 and if you waited until Happy Hour (4pm) the other drinks are $7.00. All of our drinks were very tasty. One of the great perks of the Westin is the shuttle service. There are two shuttles (the concierge will explain) that run to the Sheraton, Westin, and three stops in Lahaina. Parking can be a challenge in both Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali and Lahaina, so we always opted to take the shuttle. The drivers were extremely friendly and prompt. The Westin Villas are located in a great area. There is a Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located to the north at the Honua Kai Resort. (Go to Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for dinner and to watch the sunset. Amazing.) Also, we walked along the beach walk from the Westin Villas, past Black Rock, down to Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty walk and definitely worth doing. On a previous review someone mentioned to go up to the 8th floor of the Sheraton to get a view of Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach. We did and it was spectacular. The resort offers daily activities to participate in from yoga to Aloha Hold \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEm to making your own mug. Unfortunately, it was VERY windy the night we were supposed to make smores and have movie night under the stars. We did participate in the guided tour around the resort where the guide educated us about the plants and foliage. It was very informative, but a little long (3 hours.) Our only complaint with regards to the Westin Villas is the quality of the towels and toilet paper. For such a nice hotel that seems to pay attention to every detail, we thought the towels and toilet paper were very rough. From check-in to check-out each employee we encountered was extremely friendly. This made our stay even more pleasurable.

We had read other TripAdvisor reviews and talked to friends who had stayed here before selecting it for our vacation. We were certainly not disappointed with it at all! Check-in was quick and easy, and our room was ready when we arrived, with the crib and highchair we requested already there. The room was very comfortable, with a nice kitchen. We really enjoyed the beautiful grounds, and the pools were exceptional. Our package included daily breakfast, and we loved that we had the option to use either the Ocean restaurant at the villas or the Sheraton or Westin Maui restaurants. We tried all three and ended up using the Sheraton most of the time. The Sheraton had a great buffet (well, they all did, really), but we enjoyed the morning walk to and from the Sheraton. We purchased food at Costco and Safeway to have in our condo, which was a huge plus. We used the on-site grills a few times, and they worked well. We did eat at their Ocean restaurant for dinner one evening, and it was very good. We also made a lot of use of the washer and dryer in our unit. It was great not having to pack as many clothes, and with a baby we needed to do more laundry than average. My wife and I remarked to each other that as a timeshare resort, the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas (KORV) is much more suited to families with children (probably ages 10 and under) than for people without children. In fact, we noticed a few couples that looked like honeymooners, and we both wondered if they were getting the \"honeymoon\" atmosphere people expect on Maui. Our baby LOVED being at KORV. He enjoyed the \"pirate ship\" pool, and we enjoyed talking with some of the other parents. We took advantage of the permanent thatched-roof \"umbrellas\" installed around the pool areas to provide some shade for our baby while we got a little sun. From reading reviews it sounds as though the housekeeping service varies depending on your particular arrangement or travel package. In our case, we were expecting a \"mid-week tidy\" and one \"full cleaning\", but instead our unit was fully cleaned (including a towel refresh) every day. The staff onsite was wonderful. We used the valet parking which was convenient and only $9 per day. As expected at any place in Hawaii, the food and drinks offered by the pool servers were expensive, so we brought our own food and beverages to the pool. KORV are a unique blend of hotel and timeshare condo - we have never stayed at a timeshare that offered so many hotel amenities (pool service, valet parking, daily housekeeping, concierge) which was a pleasant surprise. We also want to point out that we were not bothered at all to attend a timeshare presentation. That's a first! The location is really nice, and there is a nice beachwalk path to other parts of Kaanapali. Our only minor complaint is that we had an \"ocean view\" room in the south complex on the side facing the pirate ship pool. To see the ocean, we had to stand on one end of our balcony and look over the railing. In our experience, this would be a \"partial ocean view\" at nearly every other place, and it probably was more of an ocean view before the north complex was built. Bottom line - we found it to be a perfect place for our family, especially with our baby. We were not surprised with any unexpected fees or expenses (we have traveled to Hawaii many times, so we know to expect things to cost more than they do at home). The staff was wonderful, and for a timeshare resort the extra \"hotel-style\" services were a pleasant treat. It was a relaxing and beautiful place for us to spend our vacation.

We explored the Black Rock on day 1 and it didn't compare to the Westin. We also saw more fish and coral here than at Honolua bay and down in the Kihue area. We didn't get to go south past Wailea, but compared to elsewhere this was the best. We LOVED having the grills and the kitchen as well as the washer/dryer.

We rented chairs for the beach. For one day, a covered beach chair is $20 & an uncovered one is $10. If you plan to use the beach every day, it would pay to buy chairs at Safeway.

However, we wern't staying on a timeshare and after returning from a long day we had to wait 30 minutes for clean towels in order to shower before bed, that was a drag.

We live in NJ and our flight was out of JFK (TIP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Smart Park was great for parking!) on Saturday and we stayed at the LA Westin that night and took an early flight out of LAX the next morning arriving at OGG by 11am on Sunday. We rented a car (Dodge Journey, very nice) and were at the resort by 1pm. Our room was ready when we arrived, we had gotten the one bedroom premium villa, having stayed at other Westin Vacation properties we knew exactly what we were getting, separate bedroom, large bathroom, full size kitchen, washer/dryer, (TIP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bring \u00c2\u00bd the clothes you think you need and do some laundry) dining area and large balcony. Upon arrival we were told that we were upgraded to an Ocean View room, however the Ocean View was a bit of a stretch, had to stay on one side of the balcony to get the view, straight across you were looking into the North building. We tried for another room but the resort was booked for spring break and made the best of the view, after all it was located on the fourth floor not 1st facing the pirate pool. The first thing we noticed while we were there was the wind. Very windy with gusts to 60mph and light rain showers on and off the entire week. The wind whipped the sand on the beach into your face and the rain was whipped around also. You can not do anything about the weather but it detracted from our experience of Maui. The wife and daughter went to the spa for pedicures and the employees there told her that this type of wind was very unusual for Hawaii. When the sun did come out and the wind died down a bit (Thursday) our Maui adventure truly began. The resort was full of families with smaller children (spring break) which really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us much. As parents of four older children we knew exactly what some of the other parents were going through, good and bad. Not sure about other weeks but if you are looking for a romantic getaway for two, I would think twice about going here or check posts that are not during spring break time. We stocked up at the Safeway down the street in Lahaina, grilling foods, produce, water, cereal, beer & wine etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. (TIP - print out the Safeway club application from the website before you go, fill it out, at check out hand them the application you get a club card on the spot and the discounts, saved over a $100.00 on our weeks order) The grounds are beautiful and centered perfectly along the Maui coast with spectacular sunsets and great location among other resorts. It was very crowded here and challenging to get a pool chair (Spring Break) - started at 7am and still only got second tier seating, which was fine. When the chairs are all taken, go the beach, put your towel down and enjoy the Ocean and beach (a little on the small side) if you want you can take the shuttle to the other Westin down the road by Whalers Village and use the beach there, more sand and resort like. The pools themselves we were a little disappointing, no swim up bar and small. (TIP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Go to the Welcome to your Vacation activity and find out about what Spa, Yoga and Bar specials that they will be running that week) If you enjoy jogging/walking, the Beach walk is perfect, jogging early in the morning watching rainbows over the Pacific \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Wonderful. There are two gyms on the property with treadmills, elliptical, etc... The equipment was sufficient but get there early if you want an early morning workout, place was packed by 6am. There are plenty of grills, but they were always packed and if you wanted to use them, you had to wait your turn and bring the food back to your room; all the outdoor tables were taken most of the time we were there. Still everyone was polite and courteous, stories, recipes and beers were swapped while waiting. Here is a brief description of what we did outside of the resort booked through the concierge service which was exceptional: Excursions \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Cruiser Phil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunrise Volcano Bike Ride \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A must \u00e2\u20ac\u201c family had a great Experience, thank you Thomas and Jonathan \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Teralani Sunset Whale Watch Cruise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Pay the little bit extra, worth every penny, clean sturdy catamaran, food and drink \u00e2\u20ac\u201c crew was FANTASTIC \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Westin Luau \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Good for your first Luau \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had fun, we were able to upgrade and was not disappointed with the show or food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Open Bar Our own Adventures: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Hana Highway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This is something to check off that I did it in life \u00e2\u20ac\u201c doubt I would want to again.

Our room was a time share trade for our unit in Florida with Starwood Resorts. This room was nothing compared to our Florida resort in many ways. Here is the good part: Location of the resort is ideal. Right on a nice beach, nicely maintained public areas. Family friendly in the sense that there were kids all over the place. Here are the bad parts: Our room was a studio directly above the lobby. We had a view of the grounds and if you stood on top of a ladder in your room maybe you would catch a bit of the ocean. The balcony was tiny with 2 chairs and a small table. Barely enough room to sit on for one never mind two. The room had a kitchenette where you can cook breakfast but no real space to even put the coffee maker on a flat surface and the toaster to make bread at the same time. The dishes were in cabinets too high to reach and again you needed a ladder to reach most glassware, etc. The knives were relatively dull that could cut bread at the best. The design of the room was such that it had a small table for 2 to sit on near the balcony. If you made use of the pull out couch then there is no room at all for anyone to move around. The closet in the room is barely big enough to put one bag into it. The bathrooms is interesting since all doors are glass and when you wake up the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, unless you do not want to wake anyone up you are all seeing the light come through. The shower area had a door that opened directly towards the wall and the door therefore getting in and out of the shower was a challenge. I guess the designer who created the space did not think of functionality of the space when they created this room design. The walls are thin and you can hear the people above you and next door. Since we were the last unit before the elevators you could hear the elevators open and close all night, plus there was a constant sound of water running from some piping in the staff elevator area piping. When the door to the balcony is open at night you hear the waterfall in front of the lobby and that sounds like a faucet running and not the pleasant sounds of a waterfall to help ease you to sleep. Outside on the entry area is the delivery docks and you can hear the trucks coming and going delivering supplies to the complex. In the morning you can hear the kids screaming early as they go about the complex with their parents who woke up early and making sure the rest of us cannot sleep. The food is mediocre at best. At the bar by the pool the service is slow. The main restaurant is open only Thursday-Sunday night. So you are basically stuck with bar food the rest of the time. The small grocery in the building is overpriced beyond belief. A hard boiled egg is 99 cents and a small box of cereal is $1.99 per box when outside is a dozed of the same boxes for $6.00. Sandwiches are $9.00 while outside the same can be had for $5.00. Other then emergencies, do not waste your money here. Staffing is only friendly here if you start speaking to them otherwise they ignore you completely. Other places on the islands have staff saying hello to you just as they pass you. Overall the only reason I would return is the location of the complex, and I would certainly demand a better unit for my exchange. By the way they do take guests here who pay by the night, but I would tell you to go to the Sheraton down the road which has better service and same if not better units all ocean view unlike here where most units do not have a view of anything but the other building across the lawns.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort\u201d", "Author": "LisaCates", "ReviewID": "UR59663815", "Content": "A great place to relax and for families. we spent most of our time here. the pools and ocean beach are great.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheyenne, OK", "Title": "\u201ccomfortable at the beach\u201d", "Author": "gfwcchick", "ReviewID": "UR59590125", "Content": "Stayed for a week as a guest of an owner March 13-20.

We didn't want to mess this up. We wanted a large, at least semi-luxurious resort with big pool and beach presence. We were slightly worried that a \"condo\" style hotel might mean less services. It did not at all. This is a full-service resort. You just have kitchens, which ends up saving you boatloads on meals. This place more than satisfied our needs and went beyond what we thought it would be like based on the web/reviews. ROOM We booked a studio Island view as that was cheapest and seemed adequate. We were upgraded free of charge to 1BR Island view which absolutely could be called \"Partial Ocean View.\" This room was gigantic, with full kitchen. GROUNDS: From website, pool grounds and beach all seemed like what we wanted. But the website does not do it justice at all. It is more vibrant and lush, and yes it's active with kids, but overall that just added to the fun for us. This place has the same \"get there early to get a chair\" problem that most resorts have, but we had no problems each day finding 4 chairs for the family. The \"Pirate Ship\" pool area is more fun than it looks on the site. Also - when they mentioned on-premises grills, I had no idea they meant STATE OF THE ART GAS GRILLS!!! Incredible. HIt the Safeway on Highway 30 first thing. Trust me. CONCIERGE: Corrin was excellent. They have suggestions for everything. FOOD: Lots of in-room cooking, also Ocean Grill which was very good, especially for breakfast. Also grilled out couple times. Dinners out - Hula Grill and Kimo's in Lahaina were both excellent. BEACH: First of all, it's beautiful. There are trees a little further north, the water is gorgeous, whales are breaching in plain view, people were snorkeling. But it's a little intimidating. It's rocky and reefy. You can still swim here, just wear aqua socks and beware of drop-off and current. Also, if you want to go to where it's sandier, walk down the beach south about 300 yds or so. You'll see it's slightly calmer and much sandier. There are many other options in this area, a short drive down Highway 30 and in Lahaina.

The beach is right in front of the resort. The Ka'anapali Beach Walk runs between the beach and the resort. Very nice to run on in the morning. Beach is narrow and not really suitable for swimming into since the coral is only a couple of feet off-shore. Though the beach is long and beautiful. Sunrise isn't that big of a deal since the sunrise is hidden by the mountain behind you. Service isn't all that great as compared to a 5-star resort like the Four Seasons, but I expected that.

We primarily ate breakfast and lunch at teh resort when we were there - the only time we ate supper at the villa was after catching our own Mahi Mahi when we went deep sea fishing and cooked it on the BBQ that is available at the resort. The building, our room and the resort area was clean. As timeshare owners however, you do not get daily maid service - so we were washing our own towels (oh yea - they have washers and dryers which are great) and the shower seemed constantly filled with sand by our two kids even though we did use the showers outside. They come around once during the week to refresh the bedding and towels and to do a general tidy. We did not see many staff other than the concierge who is in every building ready to help.

The beach is great but be carful if the waves are big because there is rock not very far out and you can get pushed around. We spent a lot of our time away from the resort but we had some very nice days relaxing by the pool. The great thing about having the kitchen is you can make up lunch or snacks and bring them down to the pool help save a lot of money. Also there are bars and a person walking around to get food and drinks if you want to do that also. This is a timeshare resort but we were never asked once about it, we did not use the resort people to book any trips so that could be the main reason.

I can't say enough good things about this wonderful place. We had booked through Maui Hawaiian Vacations, where we found a great deal at 70% off the usual price. We were in building 6 in a 1 bedroom villa, and while we were supposed to have an island view unit, we were very pleasantly surprised to find that we had a decent ocean view as well as looking over the koi ponds. The unit was great, well equipped, comfortable and spacious. Having the large lanai was a real bonus, it got a lot of use. The staff were invariably friendly, courteous and helpful. Any requests were dealt with immediately, for example there was a problem with the freezer and someone came out within 10 minutes and fixed it. Housekeeping was excellent, and the entire complex was spotlessly clean and well-maintained. We spent a lot of time on the beach, and loved the fact that you can find as sunny or shady a spot as you'd like. We also loved the board walk and spent at least an hour each day walking either the boardwalk or the beach, an activity shared by many. I went snorkeling a number of times, very enjoyable, and when I had some difficulties with my prescription mask someone at the water activity centre spent time with me till it was just right. We ate at Puhelo 3 times, and while it was not inexpensive, we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experiences there. We also had the buffet breakfast a few times, which was also very nice. We also used the grills extensively, and enjoyed having the freedom to look after our own meals and snacks much of the time. One of our biggest thrills was seeing so many whales, we lost count after the first few days. On our previous 10 trips to Maui we had stayed in Kihei, and had never seen as many whales as we did in Ka'anapali, nor as close by. One of the things we really enjoyed were the many families that stayed there. It was lovely to see all the little children enjoy the koi pond, and the fun they were having in the pools and on the beach.

I loved all the landscaping and waterfalls. The koi ponds were a nice touch. We stayed in Building 2, in the same suite for the entire two weeks. The room was fantastic! We had a studio which was lots of space for the two of us. The kitchen was outfitted with the basics, so be sure to bring along coffee filters and any spices, baggies etc. that you might want or need. Or hang around by the pools/grills on the weekends when people try to unload leftover items prior to leaving. Our room didn't have a lanai, but a sliding door we could open. It was a partial ocean view overlooking the keiki pirate ship pool, which was great as that pool closed earlier than the others. However, we were directly above the service entrance, which was quite noisy during the second week with powerwashing and recycling starting by 8 am most mornings. If it had been bad during the first week, we likely would've asked to change suites, but on the 2nd week we weren't in the room much at all and moving seemed like more of a hassle than it was worth. We used the grills in the south areas a few nights. We were always able to get a grill and table without waiting and the grills were well maintained. The pools were very nice, especially the hot tub in the north pool, which has a great view of the ocean. Westin's literature says that lounges by the pool cannot be reserved with towels and that towels would be removed if left out for longer than an hour, which is an outright lie. At the same time, we never had a problem getting two lounges side-by-side, but the prime spots were often taken. You can also rent lounges with canopies or poolside tents. Lounges can also be rented for $10 each per day (or $25 for one with a canopy) on the beach which I found to be a bit of a joke, so we used our towels instead. There are sandy \"entrance lanes\" in the ocean through the rocks and coral near the end of Building 3. The surf was pretty rough on some days, especially in the afternoons so it was tough to see the bottom. Reef shoes are essential if you want to swim in the ocean no matter what the waves are like. The snorkeling in front of the Westin was decent, once you figured out how to get in/out safely. Westin also hosts a weekly craft fair next to the boardwalk on Fridays where you could get all kinds of great handmade gifts for less than at most shops in Whaler's Village or Lahaina. The conceirge services were very helpful - we made dinner reservations at Hula Grill through them, and they also suggested a number of restaurants one night when it was raining and we didn't want to barbecue. They even called ahead to see if there was room for us. We found the staff very friendly and polite. The bar service was very friendly, though the drinks more expensive in comparison to other restaurants nearby. The shuttle to the other resorts and Lahaina was fantastic. It made it easy to hop over to the Sheraton to snorkel at Black Rock. We were able to leave the car parked for a couple days, which was a nice change from having to hunt for parking in Lahaina and on those occasions when we both wanted to have drinks with dinner. The Westin also has a departure lounge with showers, shampoo/conditioner, towels hair dryers, lockers and another room with a tv and couches. The Valets also locked up your luggage while you could soak up that last bit of sun before leaving. This was really a handy service for those of us with late-night departures.

I found what I thought to be a good price for eight nights in a 1 bed island view suite with Maui Hawaii Vacations, paid up front but money went to Westin so their 72 hour prior to check in cancellation policy was in affect so I felt more confident in case something happened to stop us from going. I asked very nicely on check in if there was a nicer view and we received a corner room that had a view of the ocean and pool. To be honest we didn't use the lanai so much but loved the corner room with all the windows along the side of the living room. Everything was spotless, I liked the layout and my daughter said it was the most comfortable pull out she had ever slept on. I laid on it and you couldn't feel a single spring, between that and the big screen tv she watched in bed she loved it. We used several different concierges (thankyou Holland) to book a luau and ziplining. MY daughter and I also participated in some resort activities which were fun, every memeber of staff we encountered were friendly and effiecient. We weren't too impressed with the food at the Italian restaurant on site, the service was outstanding but grossly overpriced even for Hawaii. We ate out nearly every day for lunch or dinner and that was the least favourite meal. I want to warn anyone who wishes to snorkel or swim in front of the resort, that there is nothing but coral that starts very close to the shore. There are small signs at the end of each walk way to the beach but we entered just past the end of the South building into the sandy area of water. We found the coral while snorkeling in front of the resort and didn not get close enough to the sandy part when getting out. It can be quite wavy at the shore line and my husband was caught in a wave and thrown against coral at the shore. He ended up with 25 stitches on his shin, nasty but could have been worse. If you require medical attention while there go to the Hyatt to Doctors On Call they are amazing. Anyway we learned our lesson, my advice is to enter and depart the water south of the resort where it is all sand. Saw lots of fish though and a huge turtle so worth trying out. We left Maui and went to the Big Island where we stayed in a condo right on the water, amazing view but we missed the Westin.

We never felt pressure to take her on one excursion after another because all she wanted to do was play in the pirate ship pool. We rented a one bedroom villa from a timeshare owner (less expensive this way vs going to the resort directly) using redweek.com. We had heard very good things about this property so decided to try it out. Here are our tips and comments about this property and your Maui vacation; We have two children (4 year old and 1 year old). Our 4 year old loved the pirate ship pool. It made our vacation much easier because we could watch her play in the pool without always going in. However, it was fun going down the slide with her too. I recommend swim shoes for your toddler in this pool because our daughter got small cuts on the bottom of her feet. Our one bedroom was in the South building #2 overlooking the pirate ship pool with a good angled view of the Ocean. We could see whales from our room. I would recommend trying to get a villa that gets sun on the deck at some point in the day (our didn't but that was ok too). I would be reluctant to rent a Studio in the South building because most of them had laughable sized balcony's. Standing room only - absolutely no chance of putting a chair on them. Our deck was very large with comfortable deck furniture. The room was very nice with high end finishings throughout, very comfortable bed, huge bathroom and fabulous jacuzi tub. Everything looked very clean but I bought some clorox, filled my tub and ran the jets, just in case. The resort gives you a little starter set of coffee/tea, dish soap, laundry soap, dryer sheets, dishwasher soap, soaps, paper towel, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. You could probably request more of these supplies but we brought or bought them. You must get coffee filters, salt and pepper. I also asked for robes which they had no problem supplying. My son needed a crib and it was a full sized crib, very safe. I brought some crib sheets from home but this wasn't necessary at all. The resort also supplied a high chair for our room. I also brought some beach towels and wouldn't bother to do that again either. We had 8 towel cards and never needed more than 4 towels at a time. I always try not to pack too much but of course I did again. This can be an issue with a car rental as we just barely squeezed our luggage in the vehicle. Remember when you are packing that you have laundry facilities and 80 percent of your day you'll be in your bathing suit. So don't pack all those just in case extra clothes. We didn't want to spend a lot on food so we made the majority of our meals. The resort has bbq's set up around the property which we used several times for dinner. It was a great way to make a meal and socialize too. I did not hear anything great about the food at the resort so we only went to the Ocean Grill, for lunch one day. I thought is was very mediocre and we could make better food ourselves. We ate out at Sensei and if you like Sushi, you have to go there. Another great spot was Gazebo for their macadamian nut and pinapple pancakes. We went to the Old Lahaina Lua which I thought was primarily a waste of money. They give you fresh lai's when you walk in and you pretty much serve yourself all night. It is not great with a baby either, since it goes until 8:15pm. Both of our kids were sleeping by the end. If you must go to one of these, book early and get a good seat. The food was good, not great. There is also a higher end Lua that we heard about that maybe we should have gone to instead. If you want to drink your face off from 6 to 8pm then this may be the place for you. We received recommendations to go to Costco to load up on the first day. Costco is a stressful place to shop. I prefer going to Safeway. I don't need a massive sized ketchup bottle for an 11 night vacation. Car rental, we were reluctant but it was worth it. We rented a car for $320 for 11 days. It costs about $100 via taxi to get to the resort from the airport, so most of our rental costs were justified by the $200 savings on taxi's to get from and to the airport. We rented a midsized car from budget when we arrived in Maui. You may wish to arrange that in advance to save a little time. This being said, the shuttle offered by the resort is a worthwhile experience (takes you to whalers village and other close resorts, not the airport). We used it a couple of times to go to the Westin Hotel for a whale watching trip through Gemini (4-6pm), and to go to Blackrock for snorkeling. My favourite part of the trip was snorkeling at blackrock. I am very hesitant when it comes to the ocean, but I was so happy I went snorkeling. Almost the first thing I saw was a big Sea Turtle. Enjoy your trip and definitely try out this place.

Tiny thin beach is all coral and not good for swimming or body boarding. Good for snorkeling but I've seen better snorkeling AND the beach is at a nearly 45 degree angle so NOT good for walking.. There is a big giant opaque window between the bedroom and bathroom. Now since it's a FIVE HOUR difference when we arrive so naturally we might be on different sleep schedules. I would like more than a window between myself and the bathroom if my significant other gets up first (which he does!) and is in there shaving or showering/using bathroom etc. Such a joke. Gym is tiny and towels were overflowing.... I needed to call the room from there and is there is a phone but it's for emergencies only. I CANNOT EVEN CALL THE ROOM from the phone there to ask a question before walking what seems like a mile from the room (oh and even longer from room to the car!!!) and I could find no phones anywhere where I could call and ring the room if I didn't have my cell phone handy. We'd call front desk numerous times and they'd say we're busy we'll call you back. They almost never did. We'd have mail waiting for us but many times they'd not call to tell us even though it was important. Or they'd give us one piece and not the rest and it just sat in a drawer with everyone else's mail not sorted like at a NICE resort. Even once we moved to a quieter room there was noise next door with some kind of construction they had to do. As I write this there is more being done elsewhere in the building and our phone rang and there was no one there. The construction is getting louder and louder and I will quit writing now but would suggest that you never stay here, never EVER BUY HERE. and go elsewhere on the island or better yet...

The resort is great for families. We stayed in a \"deluxe ocean view studio villa\" which was very similar to other traditional Westin hotels, but had a kichenette (no oven, however) and a washer/dryer. Our only reservation is that we think we got a somewhat less desirable unit. Our studio looked over the kiddie pirate ship pool, so there was a lot of noise during the day. No big deal - we have kids too. Our \"ocean view\" was just the slightest view of the water that you could only see if you poke your head outside on the terrace. The \"terrace\" was literally one foot deep, so you can't, for example, put a chair or table outside and drink coffee or read as the kids sleep in. Other studios in other buildings have better views and have real terraces, but none were available to us during our stay. The lobby, multiple pools, beach, and tennis courts were great. The whole place was very clean. Unlike others, we found the concierge helpful, but we used the main desk in the lobby, not the little satellite concierge stations. Parking was easy and $7/day. I think valet was the same price but we did not use it. Wired and wireless internet access was free. Use of the tennis courts and racquets was also free. The location is good with acceptable snorkeling off of the resort's beach, but better, calmer waters with better coral and fish are just 10 min down the road at mile marker 14. We did not eat at the hotel's restaurants, as we always try to find less touristy, more local places to eat when we travel. We did not get bombarded with timeshare pitches - a welcome surprise.

Everything is very new, you have your granite countertops which is standard now at most brand new/renovated hotels, and the neutral decor, flat screen tv, dark cabinetry, etc. Very nice, sleek decor. But it just lacked that Hawaiian flavor. It could have been the same interior decor at a hotel in NYC. Call me picky, but I've stayed at numerous hotels and resorts in Hawaii, and I just didn't get that wonderful Hawaiian cultural magic that you get at other resorts. No live Hawaiian performers, hula dancers on the premises, I didn't see any lei making (maybe it was there, just didn't see it). To me that's all part of the Hawaiian experience. These kinds of criticisms may sound hokey to some, but it really does add to the ambiance, believe it or not. But, on the other hand, I see why they do not add this type of thing at this place, it just would not fit. This place is very laid back. Although the pools can get very crowded. I really did not like their beach/pool towel policy...they were having guests not return towels so they more or less rationed them and you had to give them some collateral in order to get a towel. Thought that was VERY tacky. Again, been to MANY resorts in Hawaii, and never ran into this type of ridiculous policy. It creates unnecessary stress for the guest. This part of Kaanapali beach is very nice and uncrowded, the location is not bad. You can take a free shuttle to the Westin's sister resort which is right near the outdoor Whaler's village mall. That was nice for shopping and dining. I was just not over-impressed with this property. I give it 3.5 stars. It was kind of a very nice, new, but generic family resort on Maui.

We are owners of the Westin Kaanapali Villas North and usually have very possitive things to say about Westin properties, but this weeks experience left us dumbfounded by the lack of attention to detail and the sub-par hospitality and service. The property is beautiful and our room was great. Our complaints centers around the poolside service, kids activities, concierge service and overall general management of the property. For those that do not know, the two locations (South and North Villas) make up one large resort that share activities. The north location has a very good Italian steak house restaurant (open Thurs-Sun) and a pool side grill (hot dogs, sandwiches, hamburgers, drinks etc..) The South side only has the one pool side bar/grill (open till 10pm) The Bad: I should state that my wife used to manage a restaurant and we are generally very accomodating to restaurant staff and delays. This was not the case at either the south or north location as the resort was maybe 60% full and hardly anyone was at the pool side bar/grill. The wait staff had an \"indifferent\" attititude towards customers and seemed to not care less about the patrons or their hungry/thirsty children. We seemed to be intruding on their chit chat time. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night and had a great meal and service, unfortunately it is only open 4 nights/week. We ate at the pool side bar/grill at both the north or south location probably 6 times. Beware-the service at either pool location is terrible. If you like to wait for 10 minutes before even being noticed that you have sat down, then you'll love this place. We had to ask the \"waiter\" 3 times for water and then we just gave up and got our own at the bar. We waited 30+ minutes for our food and drinks and when we brought to the waiter attention that we needed Ketchup for the fries, mayonaise for the burger etc... we had to wait again... and it never did come. Plenty of \"sorry for the wait\" were thrown about, but day after day it was the same thing. Their attitude was \"apologies for the service, and hope they leave\". When you pay $15 for a burger and $4.50 for a coke, that attitude does not fly. Also note, that the pool side grill on the north side closes at 5pm for food (open to 8pm for drinks) forcing everyone at both resorts to go to one poolside restaurant during the evenings midweek. Why in the world the Westin only has one pool side grill restaurant open Mon-Thursday after 5pm is beyond me. It forces customer to have to walk up north to Dukes, or 10 minutes to the whalers village mall. They seem to be running such a skeleton crew, that they really don't care. Now onto the Concierge staff. You'll notice as your tour the properties, that they have booths scattered throughout the property with busy looking attendants tap, tap, tapping away on their computers (doing what, I have no idea). We had various questions about activities both on property and off property that we asked various attentants on different days and always got the same answer \" I don't know, let me check google\". One such day I asked a simple questions about the cost and departure times of the \"lahaina train\" that is located directly accross the road from the Westin. You would think that a concierge who works for the Westin, would either be trained or have some basic knowledge of the activities directly accross the street from thier hotel and surely a popular activity for children (at a family resort), but no. Once again, she had to search google for the times and prices of the train. Unbelievable! One evening I took my 5 year old to the \"Smores\" cookout which is run by the Westin Kids club staff. Once again, they either have no concept of how to run these activities, or they just don't care. It's a great activity, but can get very messy when todlers and small children are roastin marshmallows. Do you think they had the foresight or experience to maybe have napkins or wetnaps handy? Nooooooo. When I asked if they had any napkins (after noticing 10 kids with melted marshmallow in their hair and on their faces) the Westin employee looked at me and said \"No, I can go wet some toilet paper.\" I had to laugh at the stupidity of this person. So I got up, walked to the bar, asked politely for a wet towel, and returned to the campfire and cleaned up my kid. The Westin employee just looked at me and said \"Oh, I'll have to remember that trick\". Sounds like I am slamming the Westin, and I guess I am, but for the prices you pay for these villas and the prices you pay for food and the activities, I would expect some level of professionalism and expertise. They have lots of people standing around looking busy, but in reality doing a lot of nothing. They should take the over staffed concierge employees and add them to the restaurant staff. Having to wait 30-40 minutes for service at a half empty pool side restaurant is just a sign of bad management and leadership. If I want poor service, I'll rent a room at the Ramada. The Good: The rooms are fantastic. The pools are glorious. The kids \"pirate\" pool is a great place for todlers up to pre-teens. The location is wonderful and peaceful. The shuttle service to Lahaina and the Whalers Village is very timely and quick. Make sure to do a \"Gemini\" whale watch cruse (4-6pm). Best money spent on the trip and saw tons of humpback wales, Sailfish at the surface, dolphins, False Killer whales etc... the staff is hillarious, and full of interesting stories. The food was great too.

The main reasons for this choice were - age of property, location, and kitchen. The property was immaculate. I believe it was built in 2003, but it felt brand new. We booked the studio, which accomodated 4 of us - 2 in the king bed, and the kids in the open up couch. We paid for island view, but had a view of the pool and the ocean. It was nice, especially w/ the balcony off the bedroom. The kitchenette, while small, was more than sufficient. We had a full size fridge, stove and microwave, plenty of plates, glasses, pots, pans, etc., for anything we wanted to cook. I would recommend that anyone staying here bring paper plates, napkins, plastic cups, etc., The outside cooking areas/grills by the pool were terrific. We did not visit the on site restaurant or stores, as it wasn't necessary since we did our grocery shoppping at the Lahaina Market prior to our arrival. Great for groceries if you want a good selection of wines, beers, cheeses, etc. Small store, but lots of gourmet choices. This property is a mile or so down the road from the big Ka'anapali hotels, which we liked; it was much quieter and I didn't feel like I was in an amusement park. The 3 pools were very clean. Our room looked out upon the small pool geared for young children and it was very quiet. The others were split - 1 for families/kids and 1 w/ mostly adults. The family pool was a little crowded. The beach was also quiet - I think because the location was just a little north of the big hotel chains down the street. It was very clean. The Heavenly Bed was very comfortable. The resort offers free shuttle service to/from their other properties, the Westin and Sheraton, although we did not take advantage of it as we had our own car. Parking was only $7 a day at the resort, which we thought was a bargain. When we went to Whalers Village, we parked w/ no problem and as long as we made a $ 15 purchase there, which is not hard to do, the parking was validated for 3 hours. We snorkled off of Blackrock at the Sheraton, my husband and son rented a surfboard and boogie boards from the Maui Surf Shop, located right as you access the beach on the edge of Whalers Village. They were fantastic; not only did they provide equipment, they had lots of good information for us. The concierge was very helpful and booked us for a Luau at the Hyatt as well as a Sunset Cruise w/ Whale Watching. The luau was too big for my taste and everyone was herded in like cattle; however, the food was excellent and my children enjoyed it. The cruise was booked thru Teralani and they did a wonderful job; we booked the traditional cruise w/ appetizers. I would recommend the appetizer versus the full dinner cruise they also offer, if you go during whale season - we found that we were too busy watching whales to want to go downstairs for food (or drinks for that matter, which were also included). My only complaint about the concierge was that she didn't warn us about the temperature at the Haleakala Crater - we should have known, and I\"m sure I read about it - but we still weren't prepared and we froze our butts off. However, it was worth it - the sunrise was breathtaking. If you plan to go there, pack jeans, sweater/sweatshirt, jackets, gloves and hat. And bring a thermos of coffee! Overall, we were very pleased w/ the property - my only complaint is that they seemed a little stingy w/ the towels. We liked it so much we almost went to one of their timeshare info sessions. Speaking of timeshare, there was no pressure or any solicitation to speak of other than the mention of their offering while we were there, which we appreciated.

I've been to Maui several times before, so I wasn't after the full-on resort experience and appreciated Westin KORV's low-key convenience instead. Just be mindful that it is NOT a luxury resort, despite the insistence of other reviewers and the Westin timeshare salespeople. For sure, the Westin KORV has lovely accommodations, convenient parking garage (in the north buildling, at least), a good fitness center (however small) with great equipment, a good-yet-expensive spa, and outdoor grills. Plus, it's nicely situated right on the beach. However, its grounds are impeccable but not luxurious. (It is visibly flanked by a municipal park and an empty construction site.) It doesn't have a golf course. In fact, there are only two \"first come-first served\" tennis courts on the whole property of 500+ units. (Yes, there were lines. And no, not one of the concierges could point me in the direction of the other off-site courts to which guests have at their disposal, at least according to the the website and in-room guide.) There are no nearby retail shops. For me, the true upset is that there is no decent restaurant on the property. The only \"fine dining\" option is Puleho, an \"Italian\" restaurant that is unremarkable at best. (Its Christmas dinner \"special\" entrees were inedible.) We dined off-site all but for that one bad meal. There's also an average pool grill and a sports bar (with a limited menu and even more limited service) for days at the pool. I stayed over Christmas and New Year's holiday, when the property was around 93% occupancy (I asked) and I must say the pool areas were packed. The proximity between lounge chairs made it easy for me to overhear several conversations between disgruntled and territorial timeshare owners at the property who seem resentful of the great deal that their exorbitant maintenance fees provide hotel guests. I found the staff mediocre. I spoke to several of them to help put a day of golf together and each gave me conflicting or partial info. Another member of concierge services advised that I skip driving to Haleakala Park to see the sunrise, which turned out to be my favorite experience of my eight vacations in Hawaii. Also, beware: I had a room near the lobby (Building 6) and heard the lobby muzak echo loudly starting at 7AM. It's not a problem the front desk cares to address. I tried several times. And a tip: Bring aqua socks or booties. The coral reef in the shore just in front of the hotel is fantastic, but dangerous and many people cut themselves on the rocks. In sum, expect a great condo, but not a resort.

The hotel's restaurants (and those in nearby hotels) are generally expensive. You can save money on your trip by cooking some meals yourself on the BBQ or in your kitchen. There are also reasonably-priced non-hotel restaurants nearby. The pools and hot tubs are very nice, but crawling with kids. There is a water slide and pirate pool for kiddies too.

We almost didn't go on this trip....but we were so glad we made it! We stayed at the South property for our honeymoon (which influenced us to buy a Westin timeshare) and wanted to try the North this time around. We own a Studio Villa and were upgraded to Oceanfront when we arrived. We stayed in room 5416 which had a small balcony overlooking both the pool and the ocean...with the sliding glass doors closed you couldn't hear a peep - if you left them open at night you could hear the wind and the ocean. I was really limited in what I could do due to the difficulties I was having with my pregnancy so having such a great room and view was a blessing. We ate at both restaurants at this resort (Pailolo was the sports bar - some things tasty, but waaay overpriced. Pulehu was nice Italian but the service was hit and miss.) We also bought sandwiches from the on-site store which was not bad. We both got massages at the spa - and I got a mani/pedi. Extremely expensive, and a total splurge, but worth it at the time. We also used the watersports hut to rent snorkeling equipment for the day. They have changed the way the give you towels from the last time we were at the Westin - now they give you towel cards upon check in which you turn in for towels. If you want new ones, you must turn the used towels in, or if you want your cards back you can do that too and get fresh towels the next day with your cards. There was never an issue with getting lounge chairs by the pool...which was a little on the chilly side, but refreshing if it actually got warm (which it didn't often during our trip ...boo!). There are many different nooks and crannies to the pool, plus there is an entirely different kids pool on the property as well so it was really never crowded. The snorkeling off the beach was pretty good, but it was very windy the day we went plus I couldn't stay in for long so we only did that the one day. One thing we would say is that the concierges that they have there would do everyone a favor if they learned a bit more about the things to do on the island other than their \"go-tos\" ...we asked several about a few things we wanted to do that a simple internet search could turn up and no one had any idea of what we were talking about. Also they might want to get more than one computer for their business center. Parking is free for owners, not sure for those who are not. Other than that - we decided we actually prefer the North to the South ...it feels a little more secluded and calm, it has better restaurants and the spa.

The items were: Coffee filters (regular not cone), gallon zip lock bags (for marinade, wet suits, storing leftovers, etc), small roll tin foil (to cover food and keep warm on the way back to the villa from the grill, salt and pepper shakers (picnic set), spices (small amounts twisted in saran wrap), fabric softener sheets, sample boxes of tide (or you could buy the powder and pre-measure out in ziplocks), and 4-5 dishwasher tabs. The only complaints about the villas, and they weren't a huge deal were the pool was only 3-4 ft deep which is great for children but not adults. And also the parking spaces outside were all for compact cars. We would park our compact out there and come out and be flanked by 2 SUV's and have dings on both sides of our car. There were some regular spaces inside the garage, but not a lot. The shuttle service was great for when you didn't want to drive to the Ka'anapali boardwalk or Lahaina. We felt no pressure to buy a timeshare; we were asked once by the concierge and when we said no were never asked again.

The property has a couple of restaurants; live entertainment each afternoon by the one near the beach. Ka'anapali beach is breathtaking; fine, golden sand, aqua waters with small waves. Tiki torches light the property in the evening, giving it a a romantic and mystical feel. We found the staff helpful and followed up promptly on our requests.

As it has been written on TA before they are saved for the owners. Even though the resort was only about 60% occupied we got a crappy location. At first they tried to put us in a handicapped room. The housekeeping was off and on. We were supposed to have it every day as we were renting directly from the Westin. One day it was great and the next was horrible. A few times, besides taking out the garbage (that was ready to go by the front door) you never would have known housekeeping came by. Bathroom and kitchen not touched. Only other thing they touched was the undeserved $5.00 tip that was sitting on the counter. The pools and grounds were beautiful and the beach was very decent. Even got to see some whales from the shore. What we found was unlike the feeling of Maui in general, there is no warm fuzzy feeling from any of the staff members here. It seemed everyone from the valets to housekeeping, servers, concierge and front desk staff hated their jobs. No smiles or alohas. So unlike the Sheraton we had been to. Asked one concierge for some tips for the Road to Hana. He basically threw a map at us after circling part of the highway. When pressed for where to stop he told us \"wherever you see other cars stop\". Gee, thanks. They are there to sell timeshares so don't waste their time. Too bad because they are just sitting there all day doing absolutely nothing. With that kind of service who would want to buy into that place? They have one computer in the lobby. When we needed to print out a sheet for a car rental before leaving we were forced to wait over an hour as we were third in line for the computer. And no, the front desk staff nor the concierge who are sitting there doing nothing will not print it out for you. We ate once at the buffet breakfast. Offerings were very unimpressive. We sat with a pile of dirty plates waiting to be taken away. They never were. Coffee never refilled. After being seated we never saw the server again until presented with the bill. The general store is grossly overpriced for what they sell. The $3.50 rotting avocados, as well as pricey rotting limes and rusty lettuce. Stale sandwiches. The most expensive bag of Lays chips you will ever buy. ABC store items at 300 percent mark up at least. To boot, there is a tip jar for the cashier! Classy. If you want half day child care it will cost you $60 per kid. Any other kid activities have a fee where other hotels offer them for free, for example lei making.

It was a parking lot and highway view at the very back of the resort. I told her that villa was not acceptable, the next villa that was offered was on the ground level overlooking the koi pond and next to the restaurant. I asked if there was a possibility to upgrade and she offered an oceanfront for an additional $150 Per night plus tax. We accepted....however the villa was in an oceanfront building our room had a view of an empty lot, construction site and a glimpse of the ocean. These rooms are called Villas but are really only a hotel room at best. They are very clean, have nice amentities but are tiny. The grounds are clean but the atmosphere at the Westin seems almost sterile. Where did all the beautiful flowers go?? The pools have all been painted a dark blue-green gray to make you feel like you are in the ocean ? Parking was a nightmare, we chose valet parking for $8.00 per day plus $5.00 for tax. The breakfast buffet at $20.00 per person was very minimal and the restaurants had no view. Were we really in Maui ? I placed a call to Interval World and shared our experience. Customer service offered to move us to the Marriot. I turned this offer down since we had already paid the extra $150 per night which is non-refundable. Interval did refund me my trade fee and return my week back to me. Interval World is a Class Act. Upon Check out the Front desk asked how my stay was and I explained our experience. I was shocked when she replied \"Our Best Rooms Are for Our Owners. How would you feel if at your home resort you had a Non-Owner next to you.\" Unbelievable ! The experience is making us a little gunshy about trading our units again. I read a review today on the Sands of Kahana from another Interal World member who was told the same thing.

The location is very central and accessible to a lot of attractions nearby. We liked that the resort that was family friendly. Our only complaint is that the rooms are close together and you have to go through 1 door, and then another door.

Were these people misled that their might be loads of kids here? No way. If you do not have children or enjoy lots of kids around then do not stay here because you are a grinch and your expectations are unrealistic and unattainable. On the other hand, if you do have kids and/or enjoy kids you will LOVE this property. We actually moved to this resort from another resort for this specific reason. Kids and families are treated well here. They have a kids activity center, kids pools, and they accomadate kids well at the restaurants on-site with special menus and such. Hey, just because we have kids doesn't mean we don't deserve to stay at 5 star accomadations right?! Enough said about that... Food: Amazing. Staff is also very accomadating and prices are reasonable Rooms: Beautiful and huge. I agree that the foldout couches are uncomfortable, but have you ever slept on one that IS comfortable? I didn't think so. Rooms are clean and outfitted with everything you will need for your stay. Store on site...fabulous feature. Movie rentals on site too. The grounds and pools are just sensational, they take very good care of this property. Service so far for us has been second to none. We pulled up 2 hours before check-in and the valet quickly unloaded our car, put our groceries on ice and said they would handle everything...they did. They were fabulous. Since we were so early we couldn't check into our room yet as it was still being cleaned but they set us up in the day room so our toddler could have a nap and we could freshen up or whatever..we soon got a call on our cell telling us our room was ready early and they were most accomadating.

We had a wonderful time staying at the Westin Kaanapali villas. We stayed on the north side overlooking the pool and gardens. Besides our view being great, I found the rooms to be very spacious and clean. We were 3 couples staying in a 1 bedroom unit with the attached studio lock-off unit. The kitchens are well equipped with everything you'd need to stay in for breakfast or grill outside by the pool for lunch. I read some reviews from this website on this resort and found them very helpful. Here is what I'd recomend to save a few bucks, since Maui is a bit on the expensive side. Definitely go to \"safeway\" to pick up your groceries and alcohol. We saved a bundle by going directly to customer service and signing up for the club card. We ended up saving almost $70! And our total came out to about $50 bucks per person...this covered 3 breakfasts, 4 lunches, 1 dinner, and countless snacks and drinks. Also go to ABC stores. If you want to use a beach chair by the westin, they will charge you $10/day to use them. we bought a few beach chairs ($20) and mats ($2) and used them daily. Saved ourselves a bundle there as well...especially since we spent most of our time at the gorgeous pools where the chairs are free. Take advantage at check in too when they ask how many beach towel cards each person wants. We all used 2 per person. The grills are abundant and clean. It was nice to have them so close to the pool so we didn't have to change to go eat. Would recommend the following restaurants: Aloha Mixed Plate (fun, with good drinks and local food) Inexpensive too. Mama's Fish House...food was outstanding!! This is a must see place...the mahi mahi is out of this world. And the shrimp wontons appetizer is great too. Also had the banana dessert with macadamia nuts...YUM! Quite pricey, but when you're saving everywhere else you don't mind going there. Hula's...go just before sunset...the views are incredible! And the food was great too! Baja fish tacos, calamari, and ice cream sandwich dessert were just a few of the fantastic things we had. And for Sushi lovers...Sansei is the place. About 10 mins up the road from the westin. The concierge, LeeAnn, set us up there...said there is no better on the island...very fresh! And you must try the shrimp dynamite!! They have a few nights when they offer a 25% discount if you arrive before 6pm. And definitely make reservations....this place was packed with a line out the door down to the road. Seems everyone knows of it. Loved the 'Old Lahaina Luau'. Was a blast!! Been rated the best luau for all of hawaii! Also biked down Haleakula! So worth it to get up early to see the sun rise from up there. May have been my favorite thing of the week. Check out the Maui Ocean Center (aquarium) if you have time. Only takes a couple of hours to go through. We went when it first opened at 9 (since we are east coasters our bodies woke up quite early each morning) Overall, as you can see, we had a fantastic time on Maui...I'm sure you won't be disappointed!!", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio TX", "Title": "\u201cLOVED IT IM MOVING THERE!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Melisa0214", "ReviewID": "UR41631705", "Content": "I was upgraded to an oceanfront.

Also, the snorkeling is pretty good on this beach because you do not have as many people in the water as you do with Black Rock. The grounds of the resort are very beautiful with waterfalls in front of both the North and South buildings and also by the pool with the slide. There is also a koi pond outside each of lobby areas at ground level. The grounds have lovely gardens with beautiful flowering shrubs, exotic plants, and trees and are very well maintained. We had a one bedroom unit which was quite large with more than enough room for the three of us. We really liked the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. My daughter really enjoyed having her own TV and room at night in the main living room. It was also great having a washer and dryer because we were able to wash our clothes before continuing our vacation in Oahu for 11 days. Our unit was on the ground level so we had a larger lanai then the units above us. We also had a view of the ocean when we looked to the right and a view of mountains when we looked to the left. The maid service was wonderful. Not only did they do a great job cleaning your unit but they also filled up and emptied your dishwasher, and replenished both bathroom and kitchen supplies each day and removed the trash. The resort provides paper towels, coffee, and tea, and sugar, detergent for both the dishwasher and the washing machine. We booked our trip using Orbitz.com. We paid $1,500.00 for our accommodations and full size car for the week. We originally booked a studio unit but we were upgraded to a one bedroom unit. Prior to our trip I had sent an e-mail requesting an upgrade and informed the resort that we were celebrating our daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 16th birthday. When we got to the resort, we were pleasantly surprised with the upgrade as the reservationist wished my daughter a happy birthday. When I sent the email I sent them my Starwood rewards number. So I would suggest becoming a member of this program prior to making a reservation. One of the other best things about staying at the Westin is the gourmet store next store at the Honua Kai Resort called Aina Gourmet Market. We ate there for lunch every day except for two when we were on excursions and also went there at night for dessert and the best cappuccino I have ever had. The gourmet sandwiches and wraps are outstanding and they also give you a gourmet side salad which was also outstanding. This was something we looked forward to every day. And the best part is the prices are so reasonable and the portions are so large that you could split the sandwich and side. Therefore, two people can have an outstanding gourmet lunch everyday with dessert for about $10 to $15 dollars. One thing you should be aware of is this is a time share resort and you are not going to get the same type of service as a full service resort since many people do cook their own meals and make their own drinks in the units. There is pool service and restaurants at this resort; however, they are not used as much as a full service resort. For example, we usually always have breakfast out when we are at a full service resort. At the Westin, it was just easier for us to have breakfast in our unit. Also, the Westin has gas grills that many families use to cook their lunch and dinners. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use them but the resort cleans them meticulously everyday. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Westin and would definitely go back.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cI wish I could live there!\u201d", "Author": "lilmac2929", "ReviewID": "UR40218872", "Content": "After reading some reviews, we were a tad nervous.

As non-owners, we were also given the option of daily maid service or free breakfast buffets. I think the maid service for owners is only every three days. We did find ants in our unit one day. When we called, they immediately came up to resolve the problem and were very apologetic and accommodating. Bottom line, it is an island - bugs happen. Tip - Refrigerate your food! The location was great - nearby Lahaina and Whaler's Village. Loved the Hula Grill!

They also had grills right at the pools that are cleaned every morning promptly at 7:00am. I watched every morning since I used them every night. I must say all of the residents were very cooperative and I never had to wait for a grill. I was impressed. As you have seen in previous reviews this hotel is definately a time share location. They will leave you a message on the phone welcoming you and stating that they have a gift for you waiting at the front desk. This is their way of getting you in. Just don't do it. We stayed there for 5 days never having to listen to their pitch. As far as the room cleaning, here is the deal. If you are a \"guest\" of a time share owner you would only get maid service every 3 days. However, if you make the reservation directly through the Westin reservation desk you get daily maid service. The only problem is that the room may not be cleaned as early as you would like. 2 out of the 5 days we stayed at the Westin we left for our daily adventures at around 8 to 9am to return at around 4 to 5pm and the room was still not made up. However, once we called the down to complain they arrived pretty quickly. We actually used the kitchen facilities which were functional.

We are and have been Starwood Platinum members for years, and have stayed at many Westin and St. Regis properties. We have always received excellent rooms and service. Not this time! This resort was an enormous disappointment, and I'd like to warn you about a few things if you're thinking of staying there. First, it's a TIMESHARE property, not a Westin hotel. If you're not an \"owner,\" this means several things -- first, you will get the lowest priority in terms of room size, type and location, whatever your Starwood status might be. If a lot of \"owners\" are staying at the resort at the same time (which was the case with us), you are highly likely to get the worst room at the resort. Second, although most of the rooms at the resort are \"deeded\" as ocean-view and booked/priced accordingly, 90% of the rooms face each other and are really ocean-glimpse, if you lean far enough out of the window -- look carefully at the resort lay-out map. Also, a significant number of rooms have no real balcony -- this is an unconscionable design for Hawaii, but unfortunately true at this resort, and likely to be suffered by the non-\"owner\" guests. Finally, housekeeping is a disaster at this resort -- again, remember that it's a TIMESHARE property, not a hotel, so the rooms do not get cleaned every day (ours was cleaned once during the 5-day stay), and you may be expected to wash your own towels in your room's washer/dryer. This was never disclosed to us when we made our reservation and came as somewhat of a shock.

We were very impressed with the room, even without an ocean view of any sort. We could watch the Sugarcane Train go by below us and hear the charming whistle blow, while sitting on our nice large lanai. Just a quick trip downstairs and the water was all around us - no complaints! The room was large enough for all of us to lounge without feeling as if we were tripping over one another. The washer/dryer was small but convenient to have! The kitchen was perfect - we typically ate breakfast and many lunches there, even a dinner or two. I'm sure that saved us a lot in expenses. It really was the perfect combination between fancy resort and condo convenience. We ate a few times at the Ocean Pool Grill, and the food was good. We explored most of the pools in both the North and South complexes, and all had great features. I was sure our teenage boys would love the water slide, but it wasn't wild enough for their tastes; however, our five year old loved it. She also loved the pirate pool, so pool time was always a treat. All the kids enjoyed the beach. We spent one morning trying to walk all the way to black rock, but kept getting sidetracked as the waves just were too enticing for the kids and they had to stop and play. The shuttle to the Westin and Sheraton was super-convenient, and certainly saved us having to find and pay for parking in the Whaler's Village. We did a parasailing excursion (UFO) and simply took the shuttle down to the lower Ka'anapali Beach and then back again. So easy! I would definitely agree with other reviewers that this resort is very family oriented. Travelers should be aware that children are everywhere, and though the resort is beautiful enough for honeymooners, the atmosphere is going to be more boisterous than serene. This is exactly what our family was looking for, so we loved it. I recommend purchasing boogie boards at the Safeway in Lahaina - at less than $20 you can get a brand new one for just about what you'd rent them for the week. We'd even drag them onto the shuttle and go down to the lower Ka'anapali beach, our boys in search for some bigger waves. We had a nice lunch at LuLu's in Lahaina, a restaurant I'd never heard of in the Maui guide books. Also, we had a fabulous dinner at Roy's in Kahana (so close to the resort!). We have been to Roy's in Wailea in the past, and have been extremely impressed with the food each time! It's expensive, but the combinations of flavors are awesome! Regarding service: I didn't have a particularly excellent experience with the staff, nor did I have a bad experience with them. I guess for the most part, I didn't interact with many of them. The front desk was busy, making it a wait to get postage for postcards or request info due to lengthy checkins, etc. Still, that didn't ruin my trip. I just didn't think anyone in particular stood out as having offered amazing service. A luau tip - if you're looking to see hula dancers and are not that interested in sampling luau food, the Westin KOR has a hula show right there on the grounds! Also, the Lahaina Cannery has shows (just look for the times posted as you drive by) as well. All for free! We couldn't bear to spend the money on a luau when 3 out 5 of us wouldn't be that interested in the food. Overall, this was one of our favorite trips to Maui. Most of the time, we return feeling we spent way beyond our budget (easy to do in Maui) because every meal was eaten out at a restaurant.

First off, I just want to say that I didn't pay the $400 - $500/night that's posted on Expedia nor do I own this timeshare. I was referred to it by someone who did own one and got a magnificent deal on this resort so my Value rating is based off this. First the room. When we arrived, we were impressed w/ the front desk lobby area as it was grand and overlooked the beach and swimming pool area. Check-in was prompt and didn't have any problems getting into our room. We had a rental car and there was ample free parking in the resort. We got a studio room on the South building which is the older building. I read some of the reviews here and people are complaining that it was less maintained, not as nice as the North (which is newer) but I had no problems with it. It was clean and if I wasn't told that it was the older building, I would have thought that this was the new side. Like all rooms, it had a kitchenette, large jacuzzi tub, king sized bed, sofa bed, tv, dvd player, etc. When we looked out the window, we were surprised to have gotten a wonderful view of the ocean as we would have thought for sure that we would have gotten a view of a parking lot or something. We were very impressed. (note: the south side building was not built by the Westin so that is why some rooms have views of the parking lot) In the resort, there were two large pools (one on the north and one for the south), a water slide, and adult pool and a toddler pool that has a pirate ship in it which my son loved. The pools were all very nice and it's true about limited seating for lounge chairs though we never really had a huge problem. There was so much turnover that eventually you get a seat. By the pool there was a bbq area which we used one day. It's very clean and convenient to use. The beach also sits right in front of the resort and after being to a couple of other beaches in the area (Kapalua and Black Rock), this is my favorite. The water is calm and has a great reef which is great for snorkelling. In fact, we saw turtles out there on our first day. There are also a couple of poolside grills and we tried them both and it was good. Prices were comparable to outside the resort but that doesn't mean much as Maui is quite expensive. We tried their Italian restaurant which was good but quite over-priced. If I were to do it again, I would eat outside the resort. As for other amenities in the resort, there is free internet in our room so we used that daily w/ our laptop. If you don't have a laptop, you could use the business center for free and use their computer. There's a little vending machine to rent dvds if you want to watch movies in your room. Shuttles are also available every 15 - 20 mins to take you to Lahaina, Whaler's Village, the other Westin Hotel and the Sheraton so if you don't have a car, that's very convenient. Some tips, rent your snorkelling and boogie board gear from outside the resort. There are numerous other places to rent and it'll be a lot cheaper. There's a Safeway nearby that you can purchase drinks and food to cook in the bbq area or in your room. If you forget something, there's a general store in the resort to buy some small items like oil, butter, ice cream, magazines, etc.", "Date": "August 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Tx", "Title": "\u201cThe best Kaanapali resort for the view and service.\u201d", "Author": "kauaiboundAustin_Tx", "ReviewID": "UR36619764", "Content": "My husband and I traded our timeshare in Kauai for one week at the Westin Kaanapali villas and stayed in a one bedroom premium villa.

Our family, made up of my husband, me, the two kids (6 & 8) plus my 74 y.o. mother, arrived Saturday evening about 5:30 PM. The only real glitch the whole trip was we were supposed to have an ocean view room and they originally tried to put us in a island view room. My husband talked to someone and when I got back from the bathroom we had partial ocean view room and they gave us a $100 credit to use for dinner while we waited on that room to be cleaned. I thought the room was great since it looked out over the very pretty pool area, plus you could see the ocean. Everything, including the room looked as good as it did on the internet pictures. I would recommend arriving much earlier in the day than we did if you can. I thought it was the perfect blend of a condo combined with full service hotel. We had a 2 bedroom lock off which was perfect, since the four in the immediate family stayed in the 1 bedroom side, and my mother had a nice studio to herself where she could feel comfortable walking around in her PJ's or doing whatever she wanted to do in her own space. The studio does not have a balcony but you can open the sliding glass doors. The 1 bedroom side had a balcony. We had a full-sized kitchen & fridge on our side and my mother had a 2 burner cook top and dorm-sized fridge. Both sides had dishwasher and stackable washer and dryers. We ate one or two meals in the room almost everyday. It was great because kids like to lounge around in their PJs while they eat breakfast. They also have very nice grills outside that are available if you want to use them. The staff cleans them every night so they are just ready to use when you are. The snorkeling was wonderful right on our section of the beach and it was gentle enough for the kids to snorkel and boogie board. Equipment was very expensive to rent from the resort so I highly recommend going down the street to the Maui dive shop where you get some really good equipment, that fits well, for less than half of what you pay at the resort. They were out of boogie boards when we got there so they just took one right off of their sales floor to rent to us. They also are very knowledgeable about where the best snorkeling and dive sites are on the island. They have a game room which was basically a bunch of computers and TVs hooked up with Wii, PS2, XBox, etc which my son loved. I let him go in there a little while but not too much. I also really liked walking along a walking path that I believe stretches 2 or 3 miles, mostly right along the ocean. This is the first vacation ever that I was not ready to go home yet. Partly because there was still more I wanted to do and to a large extent, because it was so relaxing in the comfortable villas that I didn't feel cramped like I sometimes feel when we are in regular hotel rooms.

This is basically a time share so I think there are many other choices on the island that would be more fun and have more of an island feel.", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cWestin Villas - the Only Negative of Our Trip\u201d", "Author": "lostinmadrid28", "ReviewID": "UR36195019", "Content": "I am hesitant to write this review, as I know there are so many on Trip Advisor who own at the WKORV and love it, but I do feel it's important for me to share my experience as a non-owner and some of the concerns I had about the resort. My fiance and I are in our late 20's and this was our first trip to Maui. We spent 7 nights in Building 6 of the North Villas. We booked here because of the positive reviews we read on TA. A close friend of mine and her husband were considering buying here, so we thought we'd check it out for them and report back. Let me start with the positives. The room set-up is very convenient; my fiance and I were able to save a good amount of money by eating breakfast in our room every morning. Buying a bottle of Malibu and some pineapple juice was a nice alternative to the $9.75 drinks at the pool bar as well! We also enjoyed having a washer and dryer to clean our beach towels at night. The snorkeling, as promised, was fantastic off the beach in front of the hotel. It was especially nice during early morning hours when the waves were calmer and the beach was less crowded. Tons of beautiful fish and coral! Unfortunately, that's all I can say for the positives. Here are some of the things we encountered that negatively affected our feeling of \"aloha\" on this trip. 1. The room we were assigned to was on the bottom floor, right next to the koi pond. I didn't mind this at first, as I saw that all other first floor rooms had an abundance of foliage in front of them to maintain some level of privacy. Our room, however, had a walkway directly in front of it and no plants whatsoever. Resort owners/guests were constantly streaming past our room, which meant that we could not leave the curtains open at any time. I typically like to sleep with my balcony door open to get fresh air and I like to wake up with the sun, so this was a negative for me. I did not like that, as we sat on our lanai, people were standing directly in front of us, watching the koi and looking into our room. We were also put in a handicapped room, which meant that we did not have an actual shower and the floors were constantly soaked after showering in the morning or in the evening before going out. We were told upon check-in that the resort was filled to capacity. We watched multiple upset owners complain to the front desk about their rooms (thinking they had oceanfront/view and being given island view), so I did not ask to be moved. 2. Cleanliness of the resort - MANY areas of the resort were very dirty and unkept. On our first full day, we walked past the pool and saw a large pool of vomit floating along the edge. It was very obviously vomit, but no one seemed to notice and guests were unknowingly swimming around in it. WHO vomits in a swimming pool and does nothing about it? Also, due to the strong tradewinds, we saw many plastic cups strewn about the pool area and lawn. Many resort personnel were walking around throughout the day, but I never saw them pick up any of the trash blowing around. We had garbage next to our lanai as well that was never picked up. 3. Cleanliness of the room- This is where I nearly lost my mind. One afternoon we sat down on our lanai to eat lunch. As I was eating my sandwich, my fiance pointed out that there was a large lipstick print on my cup. Sure enough, bright pink lipstick that did NOT belong to me. Even after housekeeping came through, the cup appeared to have been cleaned, but upon closer inspection STILL had lipstick all over it. Another afternoon, I was drying off after a shower and noticed a large brown stain on the towel I was using. It was obvious that the stain was permanent and could not be wiped off - it was VERY off-putting. Why would this towel continue to be used?? I have no idea what caused the stain but I was disgusted that it touched my body. Housekeeping did not always \"clean\" as we would have expected - large clumps of hair were sometimes left in the middle of the bathroom floor. Some other off-putting aspects of the WKORV: young children in the jacuzzi tubs despite the signage stating that they must be accompanied by adults, ridiculously small parking spaces, a strong sewage smell in the parking lot/near the entrance to the North Villas, AC that wouldn't go below 77 degrees (an issue when you have to keep your patio door closed and curtains closed at all times). Lastly, we found the staff to be very unfriendly. We experienced loads of aloha all over the island, but never at the WKORV. Perhaps it's because we look younger than we are or it was obvious to the staff that we weren't owners, but I don't feel either of these things gives the resort staff good reason to ignore us. No \"hello,\" not even a smile from many resort staff. When we ordered drinks at the pool bar, many other guests were served before us. Servers were short and did not seem interested in providing good service. In the end, we absolutely loved Maui as much as our friends, family and members of TA said we would and I was so sad to leave. This place has potential, but I had much higher expectations based on the glowing reviews the resort has received. I can't imagine I would be too pleased if I had actually paid to own here. My friend and her husband will be taking their money elsewhere as well. I am not overly difficult to please, but I do expect a certain standard at a 4 star hotel, especially a Starwood Property.", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201cWestin Villas was Wonderful\u201d", "Author": "Zamigaos", "ReviewID": "UR35765081", "Content": "We stayed at the Villas for six nights in mid-July and had a one bedroom, ocean view unit in the South Tower.

Sure enough, once we were in our room, everything arrived and was stocked in the fridge rather than getting hot in the car. A VERY nice service! (The rest of the week, we parked our car ourselves and had no problem finding good parking right by our building.) The unit we were assigned was on the first floor and a corner unit. Typically, we like to be higher up and asked to be moved, but nothing was available that day. And, we were told the corner unit was usually an upgrade. Well...it was HUGE. It was larger than our first apartment we lived in! And, we did not have hardly any issues with hearing people above us and NONE aside of us. We had a one-bedroom with a king, plus a living room with a queen sofa bed. Two large TV's, full kitchen with washer/dryer, a very large bathroom with twin sinks/large shower & jetted tub...plus, dining area for six and a huge porch. We were very pleased with the room, once we got settled into it. There is a concierge in each building and we found them to be especially helpful...Katie was great in building 4. The property is beautiful and our family loved the pools. We did not play the \"towel game\" and typically got to the pool around 9-10am. We had no problems finding two to three seats together in shade or sun. The pool with slide was busy, but did not feel crowded. Many folks brought their own cooler with drinks and snacks, but there is also the beach bar/restaurant for purchasing these. Or, the market is handy and was not too expensive. (Everything is in Hawaii.) We also used the Safeway in Whaler's Village to pick up food and beverages. We cooked a couple of meals in our unit, but didn't try the BBQ's. They did look very clean and nice as we passed them. We had coupons for free breakfast buffet each day. It was pretty standard stuff, but it was nice to have. I don't know that we would have paid the $20 per person to eat there each morning. We could have used them at Westin Hotel or Sheraton, but we never made it to either of the other places. I also know they have a free shuttle, but we preferred to have a car and go on our own. Parking was never an issue anywhere we went, but we were careful not to leave anything of value in the car. MANY people told us this over and over! Our family really liked the \"feel\" of the Villas...more like a resort than a hotel. It gave us lots of freedom for our last week in Maui.

You will find plenty of details in other reviews so I will go over some things I would have like to known before I got there. 1. The rooms comes with no condiments, so you will need to buy them. You get soap, shampoo, detergent for the washer/dryer and dishwasher, but that is about it. 2. The frying pan in the room was the cheapest thing they could find and it warped when we heated it up and burned EVERYTHING. Be prepaired to buy your own if you want to cook or just pack one from home (cheaper). 3. You can snorkle and swim in front of the hotel, but the area called Black Rock in front of the Sheraton was AWSOME. Every other beach we tried was lousy in comparison and you get to use the showers, bathrooms, and pool of that hotel if you want since it's also owned by Starwood! The free parking only has about 15 slots, so most of the time we just paid at the hotel garage. ($2.00 for every 20/min or $20 max.) You can also use the free shuttle, but we had to much gear and small kids to do that. 4. Get all your gear (rental) in Lahaina the first day at Snorkle Bob's and save with the weekly rate. You can rent a boogie board here for a week for the price of a hotel rental for one day! DO get the top of the line snorkle gear (not the cheap $9/week stuff) and the boogie board. The Boogie boards are sooooo much fun at Black Rock. You will see Sea Turtles at Black rock! We even had them run into us when they came in close to eat the seaweed! 5. Some of the Maui books I read said to get your Groceries at Costco near the airport to save money. That turned out to be a mistake, because my sister-in-law went by herself to shop for 9 people and spent $500! We didn't need 5lbs of cheese or 2 gallons of maple syrup... The Safeway in Lahaina was resonable and we still had to make 3 trips there over the 7 days anyway. That said, here are some more of my feeling about the hotel. Good: There is no timeshare pressure. (This is a timeshare restort, so they do offer you goodies to sit in on one, but you can ignore the offers if you want and they will leave you alone.) The pools and waterslide were great. We loved walking on the boardwalk along the front of the beach (This goes all the way to Black Rock I think) The new towel card policy makes you track your pool towels, but they are good about forgiving mistakes (like returning more wet towels than you take to replace) Take the free valet the first day. (Don't forget to tip when you pull it out the next day to avoid charges) The late checkout lounge was great on our last day since we didn't fly out until 8pm. The lounge has showers, free lockers, vending machines, couches, and a big TV. The rest of our gear was just locked in the rental car. Bad: Towel policy is a pain, but I understand why they have it. \"Private parties\" made it hard to get a grill to cook dinner on some nights. Prices to rent gear by the pool is so high that no one does it. Stupid. They need to spend more than $3 on the cookware.

As East Coasters, we splurged and traded for one week in a villa and then another week at other islands and Starwood Hotels using points - Sheraton in Kauai and then the elegant and newly renovated Royal Hawaiian in Waikiki (yes, it is a very long flight - so go for 2 weeks from the East and both of these places are excellant) I'll limit my comments to say that there is no comparison from Westin Kan'apali Villas to Harborside/ Atlantis. First of all, we have a full 2 separate room, one bedroom, waterfront suite at Harborside that overlooks Nassau Harbor. In Hawaii, we had a one-room studio/efficiency with a dorm-style refrig that we could barely keep anything without it frosting over because it would not close. We had a glimpse of the ocean and NO BALCONY - we pushed our table over to the sliding door to see the view from our North Tower, but we were right over the outdoor restaurant that was always very noisy. As SPG Gold members, we did not feel this was anywhere near an even trade - when we asked for an upgrade, everyone just shrugs and says, \"Well, this is Hawaii.\" Also, there were no resort-style activities that are abundant in Atlantis. Of course, there are activity charges, but they charge for everything in Hawaii as well and add in the cost of a rental car to get anywhere to do them while Atlantis is very walkable and has a free shuttle. But why take the shuttle? Walking among the yachts everyday is wonderful! Sitting in the hot tub right on the Harbor over Christmas and watching festively decorated international yachts come and go is not to be missed. There was even a charge for beach lounges (numerous beaches and no charge at Harborside) and you could not go into the Ocean without cutting your foot. There were no private, quiet areas and at Atlantis you can always find a niche - we love the Olympic pool area and the opportunity for lap swimming and there is no lap swim in Hawaii. Remember - all amenties, pools and all the areas at Atlantis are FREE for Harborside owners, then you can come back to the resort and unwind at a very quiet, waterfront pool area and really get an exclusive owners-type experience, rather than a hotel. Plus, we felt that Hawaii Westin Villas was also a hotel - we found could just book a room there, so we didn't feel like it was exclusive for owners as we do in Harborside - which is sold out for timeshares. We asked in Hawaii about how they could say they were sold out for timeshares, yet still rent rooms as a Westin hotel, but never got a good answer. Also, when we had our owners meeting in Hawaii, we felt like they just wanted to sell us, where in Harborside, we were treated more like owners with updates on the property and they asked for our input on future plans. Remember that Atlantis is a partnership and not fully owned by Starwood, so they do not seem to be as much aware of how much in additional to beaches and water activities there is to offer at Atlantis (world class casino, nightlife galore, top restaurants, full free movie theater) - perhaps they do not make as much profit here, so they steer people away Bottomline - Hawaii is wonderful to experience and we would go more frequently if it was an easy jaunt. The Caribbean, however, gives you an international flavor and for East Coasters, it is just easier (direct, reasonable and shorter flights) to get to - and much, much more available as well as better, larger rooms at Atlantis. Harborside is a private resort for owners within a fantastic, international first-class destination resort. Ka'anapali, while lovely, is just a resort.

As we arrived, we were lucky enough to have the man at the parking lot podium, (who wasn't always there), direct us based on our reservation to the correct lobby. There are two...south building...and north building which in newer and according to reviews, much nicer. From the outside, it was very hard for me to see the difference. The room we received was a one bedroom, which is disconnected from the area with the couch, primary t.v., dining area, kitchen, and laundry area at the foyer. The bathroom was quite large with a shower that easily fit two adults. The double shower head was awesome. There was always hot water and great pressure. The toilet is in its own area, but is only concealed by a glass door that matches in style to the shower door. It's not totally private, so it may take a bit of getting used to if you have more privacy at home. The tub was great for the kids. Our 8 and 3 year old loved bathing together every night. We reserved our room through Pleasant Holidays and therefore received full maid service daily, and the breakfast buffet each morning. We also had the choice to dine at the Sheraton and The Westin down the road. We made it to the Sheraton, but were disappointed to wait nearly 30 minutes for a table. We had it great where we were. Mike, who works the poolside grill at breakfast always made us feel very welcome and stopped for personal conversation for a few minutes. He seems very content with his lifestyle. We made our own sandwiches each day and cooked most of our dinners in the unit. We bbq'ed a few times as well. Quite nice, but the units don't come with safe flatware for bringing down to the bbq area. I was always scared I was going to break something, but never did. The pools were as clean as can possibly be. Security comes around every 3-4 hours and kicks everyone out for a five minute inspection. Yes, it happens, kids do make there mark in the pool. They're great about keeping on it though. The grounds: hats off to the crew. They were always on duty, but never interupted the flow of the visitors. From my balcony I witnessed on multiple occasions different employees stopping to pick up bits of garbage here or there left behind for one reason or anther. The beach: on our particular stay, the beach was perfect. We had a few days of great waves for body surfing, followed by a few calm days for great snokeling. Food/Beverages: unless you can afford it, buy it at Safeway and make it yourself. Of course, even the shopping is expensive, but you're on an island, so that's expected.

We also ordered tickets for the luau down the street, but found them much cheaper through the Hertz rental car magazine. Ulalena: great show at the town theatre....a bit expensive, but worth seeing.

I'm not completely sure what sort of difference that might have made, but from what I've understood over the past year in reading about this place, that's probably why we were put in the older South buildings instead of the newer North. We had a two bedroom condo (the one bedroom suite plus the efficiency lockout), which was relatively spacious for the seven of us, though my husband and I drew the short straw and were put on the couch bed. I understand from my family that the beds are very comfortable, but the couch bed is pretty horrible. You have no chance of sleeping if you leave it on the frame, so we had to pull it onto the floor, and then called room service to ask them for several more comforters (they may ask why, but they'll give them to you) and formed sort of a pallet on the floor every night (the biggest problem was that in order to use the living space AND keep the 2-year-old from constantly playing on it all day long, we had to put the darn thing away every day and pull it out again each night). It was survivable, but not great. The bathrooms are enormous and very nice, and having the washer and dryer in the unit was awesome - fantastic for beach towels, if nothing else (I'll get to those later). The dining and living area in the place was nice, and we had a full lanai off the one-bedroom that was nice to hang out on (the \"lanai\" off the efficiency was a joke - I'm not really sure why they even exist). We allegedly had an \"ocean view\", but the ocean was actually off to the right and blocked by so many palm trees, you could hardly see it (that was a little frustrating) - the view we had straight off the lanai was partly parking lot, and partly the park next to the resort (which could have been worse - the park was at least nice to look at!). Honestly, the South tower is a little run down, especially compared to what I've heard of the North - it was very clean, but there were obvious signs of wear and tear in the furniture and carpet (oh that couch bed!), and it could probably use a facelift. However, I'm also told that the rooms are bigger in the South than in the North towers. Meals: The full kitchen space in the one-bedroom was great (you can cook in the efficiency, but it's just a small dorm fridge and a two burner stove), and we went to the Safeway up the road (yes, it's going to be more expensive than the on the mainland - just expect it! Still cheaper than eating every meal out) several times throughout the week so that we could do most breakfasts and lunches in the condo, and chose to eat dinner out every night except one (we were there to experience cuisine, after all - we couldn't cook EVERY meal in the condo!). The one night we didn't eat out, we chose to do steaks on the grills down by the pool, which was really nice. We didn't have any problems claiming a grill, and it was fun chatting with the other grillers on such a nice night. We did eat at the Ocean Pool Bar and Grill one night, and thought the food was very good (and priced pretty typical for Maui), but I seem to recall that the service was awfully slow. Hubby and I did hang out at that bar one evening (we were two of four people at the bar at 9:30 pm -- evenings in Hawaii end early!), and found that to be very pleasant and low-key. Activities: We love to snorkel, and over the course of the week we snorkeled and snuba'd at least four different venues (highly recommend trying snuba if you never have - lots of fun!), including Molokini Crater, Maluaka (Turtle Town), and Black Rock down at the Sheraton, but honestly some of the best snorkeling we experienced all week was right off the beach at the Ocean Villas - gorgeous! DO NOT rent your equipment from the resort, as it's an incredible ripoff at $18 per day (that was the pricing as of October, anyway). Go to one of the dozens of dive shops in Ka'anapali or Lahaina and get equipment there for anywhere from $1.50 to $8 per day and it's just as good for a fraction of the price. We went to the Boss Frog's in Ka'anapali and were perfectly happy with the $5 per day equipment (my bro-in-law even settled for the $1.50 per day stuff since the mask fit his face better, and he was perfectly content) that we rented and kept for three days. Pools: The resort has several pools, and plenty of space for everyone to play! We were nearest the South pool with the slide, and we hung out there several times and didn't really think the number of obnoxious kids were too out of control. The \"grotto\" hot tub being located right outside the entrance nearest our condo was nice, too. Having said that, we did wander over to the North pool several times, too - the pools, being newer, are a bit nicer and are quieter due to the lack of the slide (which obviously attracts the kids!). There was an adults-only pool on the North side, but it was jammed back into a corner that was a little depressing due to sheer lack of activity and sunlight (and it was way too far from the bar!), so we never used it. The kiddie pool was adorable, and we did take my nephew over there to play for a little while one day, but at the time he was still getting used to pools and beaches and didn't want to play for long. As for the towel situation, I think that you were supposed to check them in and out every day (I don't remember if there was a deposit involved?), and was already seeming like a big hassle on day 1. However, on our second day we found an giant stack of beach towels at a completely un-manned towel station, so we grabbed enough for all of us and just kept them throughout the whole week, washing and drying them in the condo every day. Then at the end of the week we simply left them in the condo. The shuttles: The inter-resort shuttle was really nice, and we ended up using it several times to get to the Sheraton (once for the luau went to down there, and once to hit Black Rock for some snorkeling) and the \"regular\" Westin (we hired a photographer for a beach photo shoot down there). There is also a shuttle that runs between the resort and Lahaina, that my husband and I picked up at Hilo Hatties one night when we wanted to stay in Lahaina while the rest of my family returned to the resort in our rental vehicle. Both are very handy, but make sure you pay attention to which shuttle you're getting on. I can't tell you how many ignorant tourists got on the inter-resort shuttle thinking they were heading to Lahaina and then yelled at the shuttle driver for their own obliviousness (it made me mad, since it specifically stated which shuttle it was ON the bus!). Overall, it was a nice resort and a very pleasant stay and I would consider staying there again, though I'd probably investigate other options first. It is definitely a resort more geared toward families, and I probably wouldn't recommend it if you're a couple looking for some romance. A group of older people might consider something a little less family-oriented, too.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellevue, Washington", "Title": "\u201cExceeded our expectations....\u201d", "Author": "Karasdad", "ReviewID": "UR32739156", "Content": "We rented a two bdrm lockout for our family with two young girls and my mother in law.

The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows (I am not easily pleased when it comes to pillows!) and our baby daughter slept well in a ''Heavenly Crib'' at no extra cost. The kitchen was small but more than adequate (fridge, 2 hob rings, microwave & a dishwasher) and there was also a washer and dryer. Baby high chair was also supplied on our request. Great location with a lovely beach and amazing snorkelling. Pools were also great and there were plenty of sunloungers available. Poolside restaurants offered tasty food at prices you would expect at a Westin resort but were not unreasonable. Happy hours every day from 4 - 6 pm were very enticing. Plenty of barbeques available poolside too, if you want to cook outside. I've never seen so many concierge desks before and so information was easy to come by. Parking is free and there is also free access to high speed internet, if you have your own laptop. If you're looking to shop for groceries, then Costco near the airport is the go or Safeway in Lahaina (make sure you apply for a clubcard if you haven't already got one). Snorkel Bob's in Napili or Lahaina will look after you well when it comes to snorkel and other rental stuff. If you play golf, make sure you play the Plantation Course at Kapalua - most stunning course I've ever played - pricey but play twilight, if you want to save some dollars.

After inquiring at the front desk, they said that there should have been a full complement of sundries. We also noticed that there were french fries on the floor next to the sofa.....obviously missed by housekeeping. In addition, the furniture on the lanai were dusty and never cleaned. After reporting this to the management, they cleaned the entire unit, but the results were only slightly better.....this was a true disappointment for a Westin property. Also, on check out, we were charged for a phone call that we did not make (we have our own cell phones).

It is a beautiful property on truly one of the best family beaches on the island. We were there two weeks - the first week we saw whales and dolphins and tons of marine life snorkeling right on the beach. We saw an eel, thousands of reef fish, green sea turtles and . . . 1 4' white tipped reef shark. It was amazing. The second week the waves picked up a bit and so the snorkeling wasn't as good but the kids had a ball riding the waves (our children are 2, 4 1.2 and 7) The property is beautiful, the rooms very comfortable and quiet. The kitchen is stocked in equipment but there are no spices or condiments. The BBQ's are a plenty and I have no idea what these people are talking about getting lost on the property?! My 4 year old can find his way around just fine. Weird. Anyway, I have been to Maui over 20 times in my lifetime and this is by far the nicest and most family friendly place we have ever stayed. Oh, one note. I inadvertantly left my cell phone in the room upon leaving. I was fairly upset as one could imagine, but I called the next morning at about 7am Maui time and the housekeeper had found it, turned it in to security and I had it back in my hands on Tuesday. I was truly amazed by that. Thank you Westin Kaanapali, we can't WAIT to come back! Oh, the only negative is that there are signs saying kids can't go in the spa - the kids are freezing after getting out of the pool on windy days, it's unreasonable to expect them to just towel off. We were only asked to have our kids out one time.

A very helpful drive attendant immediately radioed someone somewhere and found out that we were booked in the North Villas which was comforting since this is the newer building. At the end of the drive, we found a well marked North entrance and were also immediately assisted by friendly valet and bellmen. Check in was a breeze even though it was a busy day (Sat.)

The room was beautiful, clean, and well equipped for a lengthy stay.....washer/dryer, full size kitchen, two tvs, huge entrance closet, and a large lanai. The furnishings are tastefully Hawaiian and not tacky tapa cloth everywhere. We felt right at home. As we ventured out and about, we could see how the property could be confusing, but we marked our trail and payed attention to the well placed signage. The pool was very nice and we particularly enjoyed the coi (koi) fish pond with the abundance of Hawaiian flora. We never had a problem finding a lounge chair and the literature states that after 60 minutes, towels can be removed from the chairs, but I doubt the staff would intervene since they did not pay one bit of attention to all the kids running about and hopping in the jacuzzi. They should just take down the 16 and older signs for the jacuzzi's because this is a joke.

We have been to Maui before, having stayed at the Sheraton (which we loved). The villas are lovely but they have zero Hawaiian character. You could be at any Westin anywhere in the US. We are owners at another Starwood property and exchanged here for this vacation. We had a 1-BR unit on the South side, \"ocean view\". Ha. Our ocean view was blocked first by a row of trees, then a couple of rows of parked cars, a full public parking lot for the adjacent public park, then the park.... If I stood on my toes and stared between a couple of trees, I could see glimmers of water. The unit itself was very comfortable. The beds were \"Heavenly\" as was the shower. The bathroom was huge (but IMHO a huge waste of space that could have been better used as living space), The furnishings were showing age, and the carpet was a wreck. We were told that our building was next up for a renovation, which they claim to do every 5 years. This place is more of a hotel than other timeshares we have been to, with bars and restaurants galore. It is HUGE and as others have said, a real maze to navigate. We always BBQ when we timeshare vacation, but the grills were very inconveniently located and a good 10 minute walk from our unit. My daughter and I did the spa which was very nice, but again, devoid of anything remotely Hawaiian. We also did a number of the activities offered, such as wine tasting, lei making, etc... All were really well-done and the staff was delighful and always friendly. Two beefs: 1) Chair saving is prevalent here, esp at the South pool. At 10 am, we could not find 3 chairs because almost every one had a towel on it , yet no people. When we mentioned it to the staff, they basically said they were powerless to stop it. 2) There are no free chairs available to sit on the beach. If you want a chair, you have to rent one.

The beach here is rocky about 4 feet in, which can be painful if you're just looking to splash around in the water. Snorkeling is better at the Sheraton Maui near Black Rock. The sand at this beach is not as nice as the beach farther South. But you do get the benefit of a quieter beach since less resorts use the beach fronting the Villas. And it's a great place to whale watch during Dec-early Apr. That said, everything else about this timeshare resort is spectacular. THE VILLA: We were booked into a 1-bedroom Island View and received a room in the newer North building. We are not timeshare owners but have stayed at the Villas before and must say that the rooms here are incredible. It's fully stocked with a full kitchen with almost every appliance that you could possibly need (we, being Hawaii residents, were disappointed to learn that the kitchen doesn't come with a rice cooker). Having a fully stocked kitchen is a great advantage of this room compared to other rooms, as you can save money by cooking your own meals. A Star Markets is only a 5 minute drive away North of the hotel and is open 24 hours. Washer/dryer in the room is great for drying your wet bathing suits. The vaccum is great for getting all that sand off your floor. The villa is also stocked with a DVD Player, which is great if you want to rent movies prior to arriving (note that there is no in-villa pay-per-view movie offerings as there is at other hotels). The TV has HBO and a full compliment of cable channels. There's also a Bose player in the room, though we couldn't catch any good radio stations. The bathroom is incredible and is at or above Westin standards with Westin amenities. The shower has the two-shower head Westin Heavenly Shower. And there must be special mention of the hot tub that comes standard in every villa. It was immaculate and a great way to unwind and relax following a day at the beach or the pools. Another great way to end the day was the Westin Heavenly Bed. For those who've stayed at other Westins before, this is your standard Heavenly Bed. POOL AREA: Great pool offering. We never had to fight to find a chair (though it seemed that occupany was fairly low while we were there). There are four pools at the Villas. The first is one within the main building, which includes a fairly dull water slide (the Westin Maui's water slide is probably the most exciting for adults). The second is a kiddie pool in between the Main and North Towers, which has a pirate ship play toy. The third is in between the North Tower, which has a basketball and volleyball net. And the fourth is an adults only pool at the northern most end of the Hotel in the North Tower. The pools are great when the beach gets tiring. There's a towel card that you must to get your towels (and you must return the towel card when you check-out or be charged $15), but other than that hassle, there's no other hassles involved. Do note that unlike other resorts, pool-side service was non-existant, meaning that if you wanted drinks or a bite to eat, you most likely have to venture to the pool-side restaurant (at the North pool). There was also a hot dog vendor on site at the North Pool. RESTAURANTS: With all the ono (delicious) food offerings that the Ka`anapali/Lahaina area has to offer, we didn't eat on site. Food was generally pricey but within reason for a resort. The hot dog vendor mentioned above charged $7 for two hot dogs or $5 for one. We opted to hold out for dinner and head to Sansei's (in the Kapalua resort) 50% off late night menu that includes great sushi and appetizers on Thurs and Fri nights. We also cooked our meals, having purchased groceries at the 24 hour Star Markets mentioned above. Make sure to purchase your groceries before arriving at this hotel as while there are two markets that are fully stocked with grocery items, the pricing is outrageous. OTHER OFFERINGS: The Villas offered its usual Westin Unwind. Specifically, on Saturdays, the chefs from the restaurant have a cooking demonstration, which we visited. The chef prepared egg rolls (it's different every week) and allowed viewing guests to sample. Not bad. COMPARISON TO OTHER HOTELS: We've stayed at the Sheraton Maui, the Westin Maui, the Hyatt, along with these Villas in the past. These Villas win hands down. First off, you're getting so much more for your money. You can use the in-villa kitchen to cook your own meals if you'd like to save more coin. Most importantly, there's no resort fee, so there's no need to worry about extra charges. Parking, internet (both wired and WIFI) are all included in the room rate here. The Sheraton, Westin Maui, and Hyatt all charge resort fees upwards of $25+/night. GRIPE: My only gripe is the check-in/check-out is 4 p.m. and 10 a.m., respectively, and non-negotiable, even for Starwood elites (who normally can request a 4 p.m. check-out at non-resort hotels). Other than that, we'll be back.

Although we were only able to stay one night, we were very impressed with the location and staff during our time there. Our reservation was for a studio island villa. The front desk personnel kindly upgraded our family to a one bedroom when she saw there were 4 of us. The room was very nice. I have to admit, comparing this to the one bedroom we stayed at with Marriott, the living room was half the size. So our family of 4 was a little crowded for the one night. If my family had stayed here for a week, it would have felt very tight. The bathroom was nice is some ways.... the shower was awesome, as was the jetted tub. The weird thing was the \"toilet area\" was not enclosed. There was a \"door\" that gave some privacy but had a one foot gap between the floor and the door. My teenager did not like not having complete privacy and would not allow anyone else in the bathroom area to get ready while she was in there. The bathroom is open to the bedroom but you can shut the \"shutters\" for more privacy. Maybe I missed it (we were a little tired when we checked in) but I did not see an oven. We had a full size oven at the Marriott and it came in handy on many occassions.

Stayed one week in January. Then last two nights at the Sheraton. We booked online at Westin website. Booked and ocean view one bedroom villa. We checked in at 2 or 3 pm and our room was ready. We have been to Maui many times and from my experience not everyone in the hotel business is extra nice or helpful but not the case here. Pulled up, very nice kid watches our car, unloads our groceries from costco... we walk into the lobby, met by a genuinely friendly front desk staff and w/in two mins had keys to our room. Building 8 (north side) second floor. Told us where to park, on second floor of garage and the vallet will meet us at the room. We park, walk up to room where valet meets us with our stuff and we walk into true bliss. I had read many reviews. I half expected some room over a parking lot and hwy. I could not book ocean front online nor would they change when I phoned them. I think these are for owners but we had a great room. Not sure this type would always be an option depending on occupancy but lucky for us it was. If I had just an \"ocean view\" which I assume would be looking at pools and then ocean, I would request highest floor so at least people would not be at eye level when you are sitting in robe having coffee and breakfast. If I had little kids I would probably prefer ground floor non ocean view as the patios open up to run around. I was debating garden view one bed villa or ocean view one bedroom villa but went with the ocean view in hopes of paying more, getting the upgrade. We have rented luxury homes on the islands, stayed in condos, hotels... I really liked the combo of having a better than suite style of hotel room with a seperate living/kitchen area, great br, daily maid service, pools, beach, service of hotel but condo style accomodations. I felt we also had the privacy. Of course there is more privacy when renting a countryside estate in Kauai but in doing so you forego the hotel aspects of this place. I also liked the little things like the rock formations that had a subtle music piped in when walking thru the property. Nothing loud. just a little jack johnson or izzy hawaiian music that u can hear, if u are listing, when walking or laying by the pool... In comparing the service at sheraton vs. westin villas there was only one small diff. The welcome and genuine service at the Westin was superior. Pool side service at the westin was available. You just needed to raise a hand or make eye contact/ask for a menu... At the Sheraton poolside the servers actually asked you if u wanted anything and came by fairly frequently to ask if u wanted anything more. No big diff to us. It did not trouble us too much to sit up and make eye contact w a server. Sheraton spa was still under construction. Westin's spa is great. Pools were not too busy at Sheraton or Westin. The Westin has two jacuzzis, one ocean front. I loved taking a jacuzzi in the mornings and at night before bed. There is a store on site. It has a starbucks and most basic groceries one would need. I found prices not much more than safeway and atmosphere, selection, staff much better. Lahaina Safeway is kind of a pit. Not much selection, high prices, very busy. I was fine with a bill that may have been a dollar or so more but more of a Larry''s market atmosphere with supprisingly better selection. Our flight arrived around 11 am. Came from snow and cold and were dying to get to the beach... We bit the bullet and did the Costco deal prior to going to kaanapali. It paid off. Bought steak, seafood... all at higher prices than Costco at home but in comparison to cost and selection at safeway in Lahaina we did great. We used about 60% of what we purchased. We BBQ'd several nights. BBQ's are by the adult pool and building 8. They are a little busy 5-6pm but outside this time they are pretty open. On the south property the BBQ's are ocean front. We also ate at the outdoor pool bar for lunch a few times. Had good food at less than half the cost of the Sheraton. Ordered hot wings one night at the pool bar that were subpar but otherwise food was good. My guess is that if we had only eaten out on site vs. bbq or in our room it would not have cost much more. We love to cook and bbq so it was great to have the option to do both. Also ate at Kimo's in Lahaina one night and food, atmosphere, service was fab. The Westin south and North properties are connected by a walkway but other than walking on the path we did not see much of the south property. No need to. Each has everything u need. I think the north is the only one that has the westin spa but they are two min path walk apart. Both north and south properties looked similar. Each with seperate pools, common areas.... we were never asked once about a timeshare presentation, nor did anyone phone us. The timeshare deal did not seem to really be evident. To us it seemed like a hotel stay with hotel service. At other SPG properties and hiltons, marriotts... it is more evident than at this actual \"ownership\" resort. I was supprised.

Very nice place. Reminiscent of an upscale Westin hotel with the convenience of a kitchen and living room included. We arrived late and were initially assigned a first level room.

The beach is right out the back door with great snorkeling. There are better swimming beaches a five minute shuttle ride away at Black Rock, as there is a lot of coral here, but overall it was definitely swimmable and as long as you are careful around the coral, a good beach. The pools are nice too, although only 4 feet deep for some reason. The south pool is big, with a waterslide and wasn't overly crowded. We never had to fight for a chair and the poolside service was a nice touch, although not executed perfectly. It seemed like you had to really flag them down if you wanted a drink or sandwich. They went out of their way to not interrupt your sunbathing, which is to say they seemed to ignore you if you weren't calling out to them. The location is also really convenient. Ten minutes from Lahaina, fifteen from Kapalua. Great restaurants in both places and five minutes from Fish Market Maui, which had great fresh fish sandwiches at great prices.

It didn't bother us too much, but we did end up buying some bleach cleaner and cleaned the most used areas (light fixtures, door handles) after seeing those 20/20 reports about fecal matter being found in hotels rooms during undercover investigations (some people lack hygiene, including kids). The hotel grounds are nicely kept, but the hallways are also showing wear and tear. Walls are scuffed, and carpets dirty. Overall, it wasn't enough to affect our stay as we have seen much worse before. However, I can't imagine why someone would want ownership in a place that isn't kept up to standards. I would expect more if I paid what they are charging. The hotel beach is nice, but narrow and steep to walk. There's a nearby beachwalk that extends for miles..great for daily walks. As for Maui, it's a beautiful place. Front street in Lahaina is a tourist trap with store after store selling t-shirts, art, jewelry and tourist trinkets. A car rental is a must to get around, unless you intend to spend your entire time at the hotel. We toured much of the island and took plenty of pictures. Must sees are the Haleakala crater, winding road to Hana and beyond, and whale watching. Kihei is more modern and has some nice shops. Food is more expensive than on mainland as is expected. For example, a loaf of bread costs $5. The biggest rip offs are the pineapples..there's a road stand next to Chez Paul's restaurant on highway 30 about 10 miles south of Lahaina. They sell pineapples for $10. The same Maui Gold pineapples go for $5 at the local grocery stores (Safeway, Lahaina Farms, Walmart, etc..). Even the airport sells them two for $18.95.

However, my stay was excellent and I would really recommend this hotel. One of the problems for first time travellers is to figure out how this hotel is laid out, so I have scanned and attached a map of this hotel which shows you the building locations, etc. (see my attached photos). North vs. South side: We stayed in a studio in the North side. There is no separate kitchen like the South side but adequate for simple meals. Every room on the North side has a lanai (balcony). The South side pool is more fun for kids (they loved the slide) but you can walk over to that pool easily. Westin Villas vs. Westin Hotel: Don't confuse the two. The Villas (this review) is for timeshares, etc. and the Hotel is a hotel and located a few miles away (you have to drive there). The hotel is situated in a more lively area, near to Whaler's Village, shops, etc. The Villas are in a quiet area, with a very nice secluded beach. Activities: The snorkeling on the beach right outside the hotel is excellent. I have snorkelled in a lot of areas in the Carribean, Maldives, etc. and this beach was close to top of the list when you factor in the convenience. My kids also went on the underwater scooter and loved it (they rent it in the hotel itself with the instructor, my kids are 8 & 9 yrs old). Remember to go snorkelling to the Black Rock beach also (near the Westin/Sheraton Hotel). One more notch for this hotel was the free WiFi i could get sitting right on my room balcony.

I tend to get the most enjoyment out of sitting poolside or on the beach and relaxing, so I am a pretty low maintenance guest. Of my prior stays, I would rate the Four Seasons the highest due to the general atmosphere, great service, and incredible beach (the sand is like baby powder and the calm ocean like a warm bath). I would rate the Sheraton behind that (a little lower in all categories, though the beach itself is overall the best on the island, in my opinion). I note this just as a frame of reference, as everyone has different preferences and enjoy different kinds of resorts and amenities, with different priorities. I went on this trip based on an invitation from Sheraton Vacation Services for the Sheraton. I requested a date within the 60 day window, for which they had nothing, but they said that they were able to book at other Starwood resorts, and had a cancellation for the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas. So I booked that for $750 for 5 nights, with rental car (mostly) included (guest responsible for taxes) plus a $75 credit, so it was a really good deal. Getting confirmation after paying was a challenge, but given the short notice, I have no complaints. Upon arriving at the resort, it is a little confusing as to where you are supposed to go, in that there are multiple buildings, poor signage, lots with dead ends and no where to turn around, and some construction going on (the back row of two rows of part of the main parting lot is blocked off by dumpsters). The lobby of the resort and views are very nice, but it is not as \"inviting\" as other resorts I've been to - i.e. no greeting, no lei, etc. While we visited the resort on a \"deal\", we did request a room upgrade, if available, prior to arriving. When checking in, we were told we received a free upgrade to an \"ocean view\" studio. Interestingly, in checking into the room and opening the drapes, all I could see is a parking lot filled with cars. This was not a problem, as I expected as much from the rate/package, but it was puzzling. The rooms are very nice. I'd probably rate the rooms with the highest mark, as far as reviewing the property overall. The room was \"new\" (compared with say, the Sheraron, etc.) and contemporary. For a studio, it was a decent size. It also included a little kitchenette with range and microwave and granite counters and dishes, knives, silverware - the basics you might need. It also included a mini clothes washer and dryer - very convenient. The shower, jacuzzi tub, and large king-sized bed were all very nice. No complaints at all, apart from the \"ocean view\" (which I had no expectations for) and the lack of a lanai, which isn't the worst thing in the world, as sometimes where you have lanais your neighbors get noisy and carried away. Also, even though it was looking out (ground floor) the packing lot and an A/C unit, it was very quiet with everything closed up - you'd never know. Generally speaking, when on Maui, I see the room as a place to sleep, so for me, it worked out fine. As far as the resort itself goes, it is very large and the grounds expansive. There were several pools and pool areas. It was very crowded and noisy - lots of people, lots of families and kids. So I would definitely not recommend this resort for honeymoons, etc. There were a number of restaurants, but we did not use any of them. It also is not the kind of resort where they come up to you at the lounge to take drink orders, etc. So all in all, a very different atmosphere. We were told that 95% of the guests were \"owners\" (i.e. they bought time shares) - I don't know how accurate that is (more on that later). But in talking with other guests, it does seem very family-oriented, with people stopping off at Costco on the way in and cooking meals for their families, etc. So all in all, definitely a different \"vibe\" from other resorts I've stayed at - not saying this is good or bad, just different. I know my sister and her family with three kids stayed there and loved it because of the accommodations, so it just depends on what you are trying to accomplish with your stay. The beach area was nice. While near Sheraton/Black Rock, it is not as nice but still very nice none the less. The beach/sand area itself is not near as deep (between the row of bushes/trees and the water) and the water itself has more rocks and coral than sand - so better for snorkeling than swimming. The key \"selling point\" to me on the resort and the vacation package was, in addition to the \"deal\", the promise to be able to go to the other Starwood resorts (the Sheraton and the other Westin adjacent to Whaler's Village) and use their facilities and pool area, and to get to and fro via the free shuttle service. As far as the shuttle service goes, it was very convenient. It was supposed to come around every 10-15 minutes, and while we waited upwards of 30 minutes a few times, it was an enjoyable wait (you are on Maui, after all). Without going into the long details, we were disappointed by the fact that every person you speak with at all three resorts seem to have different views of their policies as to using sister resort facilities. Leading up to the trip, I spoke with four different people through the Starwood Vacation line and one person with Sheraton about cross-use of pools and resorts, and they all consistently said that you can use all the pools and facilities at all resorts if you are a guest of one resort. In practice, we were treated quite rudely at times, and it seems the \"official\" policy is that you can use the restaurants at all the resorts, but *NOT* the pools and pool areas. This really doesn't make any sense, because anyone can walk in off the streets at any of the resorts and use their restaurants, so what exactly are they promoting? This was disappointing, as we had planned to use the pool/pool area one day at the Sheraton and one day at the other Westin, and upon checking in and arriving, we were told we could not. We did contact our \"Vacation Services Coordinator\" on site at the Ocean Resorts - I don't know if we can use real names in this review, so I will refer to him by his initials - \"JDM\". JDM was, overall, very unprofessional. He essentially accused me of lying about my conversations with other Starwood employees about use of services at other sister resorts, as well as my conversation with two employees at the other Westin while on the island. He badmouthed the other properties, implying I was misguided for even wanting to visit them (and in the case of Sheraton, revisiting). He was very nervous, would cite \"policy\" as having changed years ago that we later proved to be incorrect in talking with other employees, used profanity under his breath, and was generally just very negative. There were a number of little things he said I was \"wrong\" about which proved right, but it's really not worth getting into most of that (things like having a voucher for the rental car - I said I never got mine but saw someone else who had the exact same vacation package as us at Avis with one, Avis asked us for one - he said they don't exist - and I've since received it in the mail since returning from the trip). I was actually just shocked by our interactions, in that I was not angry or upset - just seeking clarification on what was marketed to us, and he was just very unprofessional. But, again, being on Maui, I just found the entire thing really more amusing than anything. Just very surprising that this individual was our sole point of contact for and representative of the resort. Shocking and bewildering, but ultimately harmless as to our enjoyment of the stay. The most interesting part was that he kept bringing up our \"ocean view upgrade\", which I told him was incorrect (and again, he implied I was lying about it). He proceeded to pull out a map of the resort which did not represent reality. He pointed to our room (#3101) to show it had a park in front of the \"lanai\", not a parking lot. I pointed out that we did not have a lanai, and again, he disagreed, saying I was wrong. He said it was two feet deep and you could walk out onto it. Eventually, I was able to get him to walk to our room so I could show him that the map was simply incorrect in its depiction. So we were standing in front of the room (#3101 for anyone who would like to verify this themselves), staring at the parking lot, and looking at the map showing no parking lot. He said, \"it's not a parking lot, it's an employee parking lot\". That and the adjacent parking lot are contiguous, so I couldn't help but laugh, as I stood there looking at a giant parking lot that the resort representative was also looking at, telling me it was not there. I also pointed to the \"lanai\", which could not be more than one foot deep. Again, it's not a big deal, I just found it incredible a resort representative would essentially call guests liars and say something as big as a parking lot - right in front of you - does not exist. Later, he did offer to switch us to another room (not something I asked for). He was leaving, so interrupted our leaving for dinner to meet his time table (one minute notice); ironically enough, he pulled up in his BMW in the parking lot that doesn't exist... It was his idea to meet us there... He gave us the key, told us it was a one bedroom room with a full lanai and ocean view and that he previewed it) and drove away. We went to the room, and while you could see the ocean if you stuck your head out the window - it was not one bedroom, but a studio like we had, and again did not have a lanai, but a one foot little balcony thing. It just wasn't worth it to us to go through the trouble to change rooms. We were also told that there is an adults-only pool, but every time we walked the property, there were lots of kids in all the pools (another point with which JDM told me I was \"wrong\"). Anyway, I don't want to harp on one little negative (but interesting) little \"blip\" on the trip, but just to provide other potential guests with some information. If you receive a letter in the mail with the initials JDM prior to your trip, just prepare yourselves. All in all, the room was great (with the thick window shade pulled closed), the shuttle was a nice feature, it was cheap, and we had a great time, because, after all, it is Maui. The negatives would be the Starwood people selling us, pre-stay, on a feature - using the full facilities of the other Starwood resorts - which does not seem to exist in practice (though your mileage may vary). Also, our interactions with \"JDM\" our \"Vacation Services Coordinator\". I, personally, would not stay there again, as the only real plus is that the rooms are very new and clean and comfortable with some nice amenities, but like I said, people with kids like my sister would probably prefer that over resorts that I would personally prefer. I've stayed at other resorts that I've found more enjoyable, but everyone is looking for something different. I would just say this is more \"family with kids\" oriented. I'm also not fond of crowded resorts, so that would be a negative for me. I am also the type of person who would never buy a timeshare, so that is not something that appeals to me in the least, and that seems to be the purpose of the resort (though we were invited to participate in a \"personal tour\", we declined). Having stayed on Maui several times, I would definitely highly recommend the Four Seasons and then the Sheraton if you are looking for less people, more relaxing atomosphere, better service, and a more \"vacation\" feel. The other Westin (by Whaler's Village) also looks pretty nice going by the resort and pool area, but I've never seen the rooms.

Both properties have their pros and cons. The only negative regarding what we call the \"South\" (original) villas is that the studio side does not have a lanai. On the North property, both the studio and one-bedroom have lanais. The rooms in the original villas are a little bigger than the North and the South property is easier to find your way around. The North tends to be a little like a maze as it is a bigger property. Also, there is a full size stove with oven in the South units whereas the North units have a cooktop and convection bake microwave. However, both properties are beautiful and carry on the Westin tradition of luxury and comfort. I don't think you can go wrong with either property, but then again, as an owner I may be a little prejudiced. I would like to respond to one of the reviewers who remarked on the lack of cleaning/maid service. These resorts are not hotels and the maid comes in three days after your check-in date to refresh the towels, empty the garbage, change the bed, etc. Otherwise, you are responsible for the housekeeping chores. They do make it very convenient to get rid of your bottles, cans, garbage, etc., but you are responsible for running the dishwasher and making the bed during your stay. If you have the opportunity to go on a cut rate to listen to a timeshare promotion, it really is a good value for your money.

We are owners and this was our first visit to the property. Our first week was spent in the studio side of our 2 br lockoff unit. We own an ocean-view unit and were placed in Building 7 on the 3rd floor. Unfortunately, there was no view of the ocean due to the trees and right at the pool. I returned to the front desk and complained about the lack of view, spoke to the Manager and was moved to a unit on the 4th floor of building 7. This unit did have an ocean view in the distance, but was very close to the road and there is massive construction on the north side of the property. It was impossible to sit on the lanai b/c of the noise. The third day I went back to the front desk and noticed they had a sign stating upgrades were available. Alicia found us an oceanfront unit in building 6 that was fantastic. The rest of the stay was fabulous. The studio units are very roomy. the bed cozy and the bathroom was huge. Our second week was to be spent in the one bedroom side. Since we had voiced our concerns to the Westin Corporate office, they hand picked our unit for the second week. We were back in building 7 on the 6th floor. When we arrived, housekeeping was just finishing up \"bombing\" the unit for an unpleasant smell. The view was OK, but there was still the road and construction noise to deal with. The next morning we woke up to a rather foul smell in the living room. We noticed urine stains on the carpet and stains of some sort of body fluid on the couch. So much for the bombing the smell away. So, back down to the front desk to ask for a different room... We were given and ADA unit in building 6 on the 5th floor. The unit overlooked the lower pool and had a spectacular view of the ocean and sunsets. The unit itself had a very small shower (unusual-ADA units are often larger), but a huge bathroom the size of a small studio apartment. The rest of the stay was fabulous. So, during our two week stay we ended up in a total of 5 different units. We did learn the system and know what to book and when to ask for an upgrade for the next time we return to WKOR North. As an owner, I was very upset that the units deeded to be \"ocean view\" were lacking a view and so close to the road, as it was not represented as such when we purchased our unit. In fact most of the \"oceanfront\" units would be deemed as ocean view down at the Marriott. I was also upset to see the lack of care and concern regarding the cleanliness of the carpet and couch in our first one bedroom unit. Be that as it may, we were in Maui, the resort itself is beautiful and most of the staff were very accommodating. (Thanks again, Alicia and a shout out to Julie at the pool) We walked on the boardwalk every day, took the shuttle to Whaler's Village and had a great time exploring the beauty that is Maui. Our favorite restaurants were the Gazebo or Plantation House for breakfast, the Hula Grill and Leilani's in Whaler's Village (have a lava flow), Bale Vietnamese restaurant in the Cannery Mall, the fish market in Pa'ia, Lappert's for ice cream and of course Costco for home cooked meals. The Star Market up the road, Safeway and Lahaina Farms near the Cannery Mall were the best stores for stocking up. Everything is expensive on Maui. It's wonder anyone can afford to live there.

Early in the a.m. as the sun came up we could just lie in bed and watch the beach brighten as the sun came up over Haleakalah. The grounds are amazingly beautiful!!! Well kept, no dust in any of our rooms or grounds. As you walked around the resort, they were in a constant state of cleaning the areas. The pool areas and koi ponds were wonderful. Though I found the hot tub a little too warm for my taste. In the evening sitting out on our lanai we heard conversations of the people in the pool. I guess the sounds drifted up. But did not penetrate into the rooms. Pools close @ 10 so it all ends up being a peaceful evening. The staff was superbly friendly and nice. I can't imagine finding anyone who did not exhibit the aloha spirit. In fact, on our last morning, we took our bags down to the bellman (they will keep your larger items until your departure) and my hubby was sweating. A staffer who was chatting at the front desk got him one of the towels they keep on hand that is kept cold and moist for hot travelers. It was such a nice perk that has never been offered anywhere to us before. They have a late departure lounge which was nothing special but served it's purpose. Showers, towels & soap were readily available. The only slightly negative statement I have is that the property is so large it is easy to get lost.

The resort was much more than I expected. I read other reviews and was a little concerned but this is how I saw it. The staff was exceptionally nice and helpful. From the moment we got there our room was ready an hour early and as requested, we got a top floor ( room # 6629 ) looking over the center of the resort ( pool, gardens etc. ) You really can't get an ocean view unless you actually own there. We own 2 weeks in Orlando but just bought there because the price was right and we always planned on swapping locations anyway. It was a smaller resort but it was just my husband and I and it was very relaxing. There were families there but the parents managed to keep their kids under control. The beach was FABULOUS and just beyond the pool. It was very peaceful and the water so crystal clean. The only bad thing was that you had to rent a lounge chair. The price was $ 10 for a regular one and $ 20 for a bimini ( the ones with a cover on them to block the sun). If you go later in the day, there will be ones that people left. so it will be free. I'm one to stay all day so it was worth it to pay the $ 20 bucks. The pool bar has good food and great drinks. Overpriced of course but we expect that. We both watched football with the other vacationers and had a blast. Lots of screaming and cheering. No better way to meet some people...Football and the cocktail of the day..( which was only $6 ) Try the Volcano.....My husband doesn't remember who won the game..lol. only kidding. We ate at both the villas north pool bar and the regular villas next door several times for dinner. Had fun The fancy restaurant in the middle of the villas North is nothing to brag about. Terribly overpriced and I was not impressed with the food. The atmosphere was very nice but save your money and either go into town or eat at the pool bars. The town of Lahaina is very cute. Lots of shopping and restaurants. Try the Bubba Gump restaurant for the best fried shrimp. Its got all memorabilia from the movie. Its right on the ocean. Casual and good prices. We went for lunch. There is a Safeway on the way from the airport to the villas..It will be on the left hand side right before you get there. We bought our essentials and always had cheese and crackers and wine before going out for the evening on our balcony. There is hardly any night life, Unless your young and like the loud music. Those days are over for us and we prefer a quiet night sitting by the pool and having our cocktails there. Our room was located on the good side according to how the sun set. ( room 6629 ) In the morning it shined on us but in the evening it was all shade. Thats when it was more important to sit outside anyway. All the other villa patios were blaring with the sun. Ask to have your room on the left side when you walk out through the foyer. Our room was very clean and new. We have never been dissapointed. We always request a 1 bed premium because we like the full balcony. All in all I was very impressed and had a very nice time. I got to read a lot while my husband played lots of golf. I would recommend this resort to all. Its smaller than most but you really don't need much when you go to just relax and have a good time. I just found it so tranqual and loaded with beautiful flowers and greenery. When you see the grounds on all these locations you understand the yearly maintenance fee is justified.

We found it through an owner ad on Craigslist. Despite reading a variety of reviews on Trip Advisor (most very good but a few that concerned me after I'd already paid the deposit) - we were very happy and so relieved that our room was exactly as pictured. We rented a Studio Premium Villa (North Side Bldg 5 - Room 5402) - it faced the ocean. The room was spotless - we had no issues with dirt or run down furniture/bedding. The Heavenly King size bed was amazing! The room size was very spacious - more than enough for 2 of us - very large bathroom area which was nice. The kitchenette was great - stocked with utensils and appliances so that we could cook there if we wanted. A couple of nights, we bbq'ed using the gas grills on the property and ate on our balcony. From everything i could tell, the staff was on top of keeping the place clean. A couple of nights, we left our trash bag just outside our door and it was picked up right away. We used the workout room which was also clean and had nice new equipment with TV's. The pool area was large but this resort is also located right on the beach so we spent time on the sand as well. The location of the resort was great - just close enough to Whalers Village and shopping but not right in the madness - easy access to Kapalua and Kanaapali. Staff was helpful and friendly. We did not eat at the restaurants at the resort so I can't comment on those but they looked nice - over priced as much as all the other restaurants in Hawaii. To address some of the negative reviews I read on this site, someone made mention of a bad smell and a sewage site next to the resort - there is no facility next door. There is a water reclamation plant just down the road on the opposite side of the road - I did not once smell anything foul - and we had some windy days. I think this place is great for families and couples without kids - we found it to be very comfortable and well kept and one of the nicest rooms we've stayed in. I would definitely go back.

I think this was the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. We rented a 1BR and were upgraded to an Ocean View. The room was massive with a full kitchen, a living room and a bedroom. There was a roomy balcony on the side with clear views over the beach and ocean. Though nice I think the 1BR was a bit of overkill. Unless you need the space I would doubt any normal person would need the two rooms, particularly for a couple. On the other hand I had trouble with the massive time zone shift and so was always up at 5am and so having the extra room to repair to so as not to disturb the Mrs.' sleep was helpful. Some of the reviews talked about this place being loud with lots of kids. We didn't notice that. It was crowded and bustling but no more so than you'd expect for a place of this size. The hotel beach was actually very nice and pretty quiet. I really appreciated this after we'd been there for a day or two and we ventured down the beach to the neighboring Sheraton (forget name but at Sheraton there was a nice reef for snorkeling and even a few sea turtles). The beach there and beyond was mobbed with people so I was very appreciative with how relaxed the Westin beach was in comparison. Also convenient was the shuttle that ran back and forth to Lahaina. Even though we had a car it was nice to be able to hop in the shuttle and not worry about parking in town. So in summary this was a great hotel.

The rates available were excellent, best we found through any online source. Naomi was an excellent resource for our trip, getting us the room we wanted at the Westin Villas. I HIGHLY recommend using Maui Hawaii Vacations for booking your hotel/condo in Maui! As for the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Villas: this is our second trip to this property. We stayed in the older section in 2006 and returned this year to stay in the new \"North\" section. The north section is lovely, the grounds are beautiful and the ground floor villas have direct access to the gardens or pool areas. If you are traveling with a young child a ground floor villa is perfect because there is plenty of room for your kids to run and play on the lawn just off your lanai. However the rooms in the older south section of the resort are larger and the kitchens are equipped with a microwave and a conventional oven. The north section kitchens are equipped with a microwave/convection combo. If you are planning on cooking your meals while on vacation you may want to consider staying in the south section of the resort. If you are not concerned about cooking or you don't mind using the microwave/convection combo for all your meals then the north would be fine. The resort offers nice outdoor grills for its guests but claim one early if you want to catch the sunset while you cook out. If you are traveling during the holiday season or the busy season you may want to stake your claim in the early afternoon. I also suggest getting in touch with the pool attendant 30 days prior to your arrival if you are interested in booking a gazebo while you are visiting. Gazebo's go quickly! All in all the Westin Ocean Villas is a great place to stay if you have children or if you are traveling with several family members. The two bedroom lock off is an excellent option but if you have only one child the one bedroom will accommodate you quite comfortably. I would not advise the studio if you are traveling with a child, it would be a tight fit. If you want more space for your money request the south section. If you want flat screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and newer carpet then book the north section. The south sections villas are still in good shape it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a simple fact that the north section is newer. It simply comes down to a matter of preference. One of our best meals on the island was at Pulehu Restaurant located on the lower lobby level of the north resort. We eat out often and we eat at upscale restaurants; Pulehu can compete with any of them. If you are looking for an excellent meal and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to drive to town then give Pulehu a try I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you will be disappointed.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "RJZee", "Title": "\u201cA Fabulous Resort Property\u201d", "Author": "RJZee", "ReviewID": "UR20292785", "Content": "We just returned from a 7 night stay at this resort. This was our 6th trip to Kaanapali Beach, and we found this to be our favorite property in the area. We arrived late morning, but our room was ready for check-in. We were in the newer Building 6. The room was exceptionally clean and efficient. Just enough of a kitchen to make breakfast and lunch quick and easy. A full size frig was nice. The bathroom had a large shower as well as a deep whirlpool tub. Westin's \"Heavenly Bed\" is always wonderful. The resort is somewhat spread out, but that is because each courtyard has it's own pool area. The pools are beautiful. We tended to use the original pool since the other two seemed to draw more small children. We couldn't always get pool chairs close to the pool, but we were always able to get a chair somewhere in either the sun or the shade. There are a couple of bar/restaurants on the resort, but they also have a hot dog vendor in the pool area that sold a great dog with all the toppings, chips and a cold drink for $7. We love to snorkle, and we found the beach at WKOR to offer the best snorkeling on the island. The Black Rock is fine, but always crowded. We also snorkeled at Ulua Beach in Wailea - nice, with lots of turtles, but still not as good as the WKOR. We also did the Blue Water Rafting Snorkle Trip. It was a great trip, but still the snorkeling did not compare to the beach right outside our villa. We have stayed within the main Kaanapali Beach resort area before (Sheraton, Whaler condos), and we always enjoyed it and kept returning, but we found the WKOR to be less crowded, quieter, and away from all the hustle and bustle of Whalers Village. The Westin shuttle made it very easy to get down to Whalers Village to shop or eat dinner, or to snorkle at the Black Rock. All in all, we loved our stay at this resort. We are not \"high maintenance\" guests - we are quite independent and know our way around the island. Every encounter we had with the employees was pleasant. The front desk people and the concierge services were outstanding. The maid service was never intrusive but always thorough. We have no complaints at all. We enjoyed fabulous dinners at Pacific'O, Plantation House, and Kimo's. The upper level of the Mai Tai Lounge is cool - great appetizers substituted for dinner. A really sweet find for dinner was the Royal Lahaina resort, which you can walk to down the beach from WKOR. Follow the boardwalk until it ends and then head for the 2nd red flag. It was a nice surprise. Their pleasant restaurant is poolside/beachfront and feels very \"Hawaiian\". There was a torch lighting ceremony at sunset, followed by an authentic Hawaiian singer and a hula dancer. The food, service and price were great. If you decide to drive to Haleakala, plan to stop at the Haliimaile General Store for lunch on your way down. It's awesome! We would have returned for dinner but it's a bit of a drive from Kaanapali. Our best snorkle tip: We always rent the best equipment we can get from Snorkle Bob's for the whole week. This time we also rented beach chairs for $5/week. You can strap them on like a backpack and take them to whatever beach you go to. They will save you $10/day if you want chairs on the beach at WKOR.

My wife and I were on our honeymoon, and despite the reviews that say it is mediocre for honeymooners, I thought it was excellent. We had a 1 bedroom villa. The full kitchen was awesome, as well as access to the BBQ grills. We cooked a few meals on the grill, and ate breakfast and lunch in the room a few times to save money on food. Restaurants in Maui are expensive, especially if you are on a budget. The jacuzzi tub and dual head showers were great! The Westin beds and pillows lived up to the reputation as well as the two flat screen TV's. You don't watch much TV there, but we did watch a movie one afternoon when we were exhausted from all of the snorkeling and touristy activities. The staff seemed friendly enough. If you are looking to be waited on hand and foot, you will be disappointed. I personally don't care if I see a staff member once I check in. As long as the front desk is accessible, that's all I need, and that is what we got. My wife and I don't drink alcohol, so we can't comment on the bar. We didn't eat at any restaurants at the hotel either. We were there during the third week in September and it was not busy at the Westin at all. It seemed like we had the place to ourselves. The beach at the hotel is awesome. We did a few sunrise and sunset walks which were awesome, and also snorkeled once on the beach in front of the hotel. It was great. We had a rental car, so we never took the shuttle. I would recommend a rental car to anyone who stays here. You can get by without it, but the transfer from the airport to and from the hotel is about $70 per person if I am not mistaken. We got a rental car from Alamo for $110 for the whole week. It was very convenient to have the car. Contact me if you have questions on getting good deals on rental cars. A few of the good restaurants in Lahaina are Bubba Gumps and Mala Cafe. The best restaurant we ate at was the Plantation Restaurant at the Kapalua Plantation Golf Course. We had an amazing breakfast there. We also had a fun snorkel cruise through Maui Adventure Cruises. They took us out to Lana'i we had some great snorkeling there and saw some turtles. I would highly recommend it. Also, we drove north on Highway 30 from Kaanapali to this little banana bread stand. It was awesome! The drive is short and very scenic. And much shorter than the famed road to Hana. And the banana bread was awesome! If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

We called around 4, and found our room ready, so we headed right back up to the Westin Check in was friendly, we were given a room in building 4 which is the building to the back of the property in the original, not North section. Off we go to the third floor and open the door, at first glance it seemed bright and nice, on closer inspection it looked as though it hadn't been cleaned in the last 6 months. Chocolate (or something) smeared all over the sofa and the sheer curtains in the living room, a dirty tissue under the tv stand, and the rugs were so filthy I wouldn't let my son take off his shoes. Then I went into the Bedroom to look at the bed, the mattress pad was covered with a grainy dark red substance and had hairs all over it. Just gross. My call to the front desk didn't produce another room, so I went down in person and told the nice gentleman at the front desk that I was not going to stay in that room. At this price point (479.00 per nt plus taxes) I would expect a higher level of cleanliness.

In exchange for this, we had to go to a 90 minute timeshare presentation, but it was actually quite pleasant and took less than 90 minutes. The guy who gave us the tour seemed a little high (eyes were bloodshot, no Westin card to give us access anywhere, didn't know where the game room was) but this made it a lot easier for us to say no (which we were going to do anyway), so we didn't mind. Of course the sales manager came in at the end to try and sell us one more time but we said no again and that was that, definitely worth saving $1500+ off the regular room price. Oh, since it was a special occasion, they upgraded us to an ocean view (not so close but could still see the ocean) studio. It came with a couch, flat screen tv, microwave, washer/dryer, Westin heavenly bed, bubble tub, etc. It was a beautiful new room in the North wing. The pools were nice, not over the top like the other Westin property but perfect for swimming, water basketball and volleyball. They had 2 tennis courts outside if you wanted to play, and 2 nice general stores with a lot of different things to buy at reasonable-for-resort prices.

We had visited last year for the timeshare and knew we 'd want to stay here .. WE almost bought but then decided not too. but we traveled for our wedding w/ our family my fiance's two kids 5 and 8, our son of 6 mths old and the two grammas. WE got a great deal on the 2 bdrm villa.. First let me say the property is gorgeous exactly how it was last year. plenty of pools ,plenty of space not overcrowded except the Pool with the slides was hard to find a shaded area upfront.. we spent most of our time on the north pool and or beach it was hard to do the beach everyday but the beach location is great too. Last year we stayed at the Sheraton and love that beach and location too , the beach is a tiny bit of a walk but not that bad. We got there around 2 or so and they said no rooms were yet available check in is not til 4.. kind of late, one of our complaints and we didn't get a room until 4 no earlier.. then we got a room int he North side which was fine the room is gorgeous as others have explained , plenty of room.. but our complaints: we were very far to the north end w/ 3 kids two grammas that meant for alot of walking to and from the pool, to the cars and elevators our room was like the last on the 3 hallways away from the elevator. we asked if we coud be moved NO she said.. so ok we sucked it up and got used to it and found our way around I don't mind the walking but when you have a baby in tow and two grammas you want to make it easy.. The other complaint was the parking. the spaces very small, all virtually all compact so you have to squeeze your car or our VAN we had into these small spaces w/ making it hard to load/unload everyone. We suggest they make larger spots for those larger vehicles that most people have. The other complaint was the service on our safe. Our safe was broken on the 1 bdrm side they came right away and they couldn't fix it but said they'd be back. the whole week went by and noone returned to fix it. fortunately we had the other room/studio and used that safe.. The pool service there- was NO food or drink service would have been nice and i think for them it would totally drum up buisness for them. we would have loved to order a cocktail by the pool or some lunch w/out getting up .. Also more shaded areas needed by the pool w/ the slide.. not many areas and the pool was always packed. Other than that service was great. everyone was friendly at the hotels from our maid service, the concierge the activities desk etc.. the restaurants are nice even tho we only had lunch at the pool bar and wasn't bad at all.. the grounds are amazing. the villa comes w/ everything you need. we even got a nice rollaway crib for the baby etc.. we shopped when we first got there and did all our breakfasts and most of our lunches in the room so made it very nice and the kids had there own area/bed and tv so helpe dout and a huge bathroom on both sides. by far the greatest to travel w/ Kids . we didn't use the new spa or the shuttle just not enough time. maybe next time. we'd definitely go back as it had all the amenities of a hotel but a huge condo that works w/ kids . also they have some great grills /bbqing area and lots of people us ing them.. next year for sure i want to do that a few times and just cook out and relax!!! again we loved it here just w/ the few minor complaints all in all a great stay..", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "utah", "Title": "\u201cHorrilbe\u201d", "Author": "glhowland", "ReviewID": "UR19489874", "Content": "I purchased 4 weeks at the Westin Ocean Villas.

The sofa was filthy with stains and general brown grime. The \"heavenly bed\" comforter was stained with black ink. The dust ruffle was just that...dusty and brown. There was black mold growing in the noisy refridgerator. There were dirty fingerprints on the bathroom door. And the general cleanliness of the room? The toilet seat was left in the \"up\" position and there was no evidence that it had been cleaned. Finally, I found long black hairs on the floor and short and curly hairs in the shower. Even the towels in the room were dingy and gray. No joke. I spoke with the night manager who seemed genuinely concerned about the problem. I was immediately moved to a new room in the North Tower.

Free shuttle to Lahaina Beach suitable for swimming More than ample free parking Polite and helpful bellman Cons: Confusing to get around, we got lost twice Huge property and a lot of walking Hard to find lounge chairs w/shade Buildings not marked w/#'s Parking a little more difficult at night Not very \"cozy\" because of the large size of the resort All-in-all, my husband and I would definitley stay at the Westin again on our next trip to Maui. A kitchen is a must w/kids and if you want to save $ making your own meals. We saved over $1000 just by cooking breakfast, lunch and some dinners.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lee's Summit, MO", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "Crazytiger42", "ReviewID": "UR17266119", "Content": "The resort was great!

The first time we reserved a 2-bedroom lockoff with an ocean view in bldg 3 (on the left side of the pool) and this time we're staying in bldg 3 in a premium deluxe 1-bedroom with an extra long lanai (w/ 2 lounge chairs and 2 upright chairs with tables), facing the waterfall fountain. The rooms are excellent, as is typical with all Westin time share properties, and this time around we have enjoyed the pools and beach almost every day. We even enjoyed the kids' pool with our young children (age 6 & 3) with friends who were also staying in Maui and have young children. Our daughter also enjoyed the Westin Kid's Club during our owners update. This year, we were able to visit the North property and had dinner at Pulehu which has an excellent view of the koi pond. The ambience kind of reminded me of the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas near the Okada Japanese restaurant. The room accommodations are nice and while KOR doesn't have the flat panel TVs like the KOR North property, this is of minor point since the rooms are larger in the South property. I personally think the pool is also nicer on the South property. What can we say about KOR except that it is one of the nicest Starwood time share properties. Our parents also own at Princeville and we own at Mission Hills (Rancho Mirage), Lagunamar (Cancun) and separately at Walt Disney World (Wilderness Lodge). We have stayed at Rancho Mirage, Desert Springs, the Kierland, and stopped by to see the St. John lobby when we were touring the island. My only two minor complaints about our stay are 1) I wish the TV cable connection was cleaner (there was ghosting on a number of channels) and 2) I wish the room had filled salt and pepper shakers. Other than that, there are plenty of pros to list. The concierge staff was able to book reservations for an underwater sub tour on the Reef Dancer for ourselves and our kids and even worked behind the scenes to credit our account when our tour was cancelled on our first chosen day by the Reef Dancer tour and then subsequently re-booked us for another day. We also attended an \"owners update\" to find out the current inventory on hand for sale. New units are practically all sold out on the North property with the South property being sold out long before (only a few units are available on hand from owners trading in for units in the North property). The sales staff was very pleasant and did not try a \"hard sale\" on us as we have experienced with other time share companies (we've tried them all). Unfortunately, the units that we would ideally like to purchase (Ocean View on the North Property) are already sold out so we opted to not purchase one of the remaining Island View units nor purchase the current Kauai (Princeville) property since our family already owns that property. We will definitely be back at KOR and perhaps we'll add to our Westin collection if we can find our ideal property on the open resale market since Westin no longer has inventory for our ideal unit.", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cCondo convenience, resort amenities, spectacular location\u201d", "Author": "gnolect", "ReviewID": "UR17109205", "Content": "We are owners at the Sheraton timeshare in Orlando and swapped to stay here. This place is wonderful. We knew what to expect in terms of unit features and it fully lived up to expectations. Units are fairly new and well appointed. This was our second week in Hawaii and after a first week of hotels and going out for breakfast and trying to snack in room, it was wonderful to have a full kitchen. Everyone got up at their own pace, I had my Kona coffee sitting on the lanai.The extra space in a condo-unit makes for a much more relaxed attitude. The pools are excellent. Crystal clear and warm. There are several between the various buildings and all beautifully designed. And you are 100 feet from the ocean on a private beach. A board walk leads you down. Towel service was extremely convenient. Picked up a little sand? No problem,. just trade your towel in for a fresh one at any of the towel booths. They also offer snorkeling and other equipment for rent which is great because you will definitely want to swim with the fishes (not in the Godfather sense). The poolside restaurants are very relaxed and convenient. You can spend the entire day eating, swimming, body surfing , snorkeling, relaxing, drinking and never have to even put on shoes. The complex is huge, connecting both the south and north units which are treated as separate resorts, but it's really all one big place. It's located 10-15 minutes north of Lahaina (depending on traffic). Driving is very easy but parking in Lahaina can be tricky. At teh resort there is nothing within walking distance other than the resort restaurants so you'll definitely want to get out once in a while. There are many good restaurants along the main road and in Lahaina. And there is plenty of parking at the resort so it was never a hassle coming back. We were there second week of May and it was still considered \"off season\" so it was wonderfully uncrowded. It was easy to find open chairs in the shade any time of day. While you are there, be sure to do a Luau. There's plenty to choose from. They all sound similar. We did the one at the Hyatt and it was what we expected. If you are a but more adventurous, you can try scuba diving. I highly recommend Jay at Scuba Gods (scubagods.com). Nicest guy you'll meet, patient and great with beginners. None of us had gone scuba before. We did an 'introductory dive' where he provides basic training just to get comfortable with equipment and breathing underwater, etc.. Then he guided us out along the coral reef for about 45 minutes. It was an awesome experience. And I recommend you opting for teh second tank as you will want to do a second dive! And most definitely take a helicopter tour of the island. There's many to choose from. We went with Blue Hawaiian. My only advice is don't skimp because of cost. It's expensive anyway, so go with a full island tour. Our tour included landing on Haleakala to sip some pineapple \"champagne\". There are many many resorts to choose from on Maui.

As we knew this was primarily a time share resort, we were a bit hesitant to stay here as had concerns over service and being unduly pushed about purchasing a time share. However, we were drawn by the convenience of having more of a condo set-up than a traditional hotel room (w/kitchen and ensuite laundry) and decided to give it a go. Things did get off to a bit of a rocky start. Upon checking in, we found our room to be lacking in cleanliness. While neither my wife and I are neat freaks or are overly fussy, we do expect a certain standard to be met (especially upon initial check-in, we didn't necessarily expect to have full cleaning service during the week). Walking into a bathroom that had a dirty toilet seat (I won't go into details) and hair (clumps not the odd strand) in the shower did not really set a good tone for the first part of our stay. A stained comforter and a sticky drink spill on the kitchen floor didn't help much either nor did not replenishing our soap and shampoo the first couple of days. We did politely raise with the front desk our first night and asked them if they could do a more thorough clean when they came in the next day. When this was not done, we escalated our concern into more of a complaint and they actually got the housekeeping manager to personally address with his team the following morning and to his credit, the cleaning was better the rest of the week. Other hotel service such as the pool attendants, bar/restaurant staff was just o.k.. Not bad but not great. It was sort of like Westin has fielded their \"B\" team while the the Westin Hotel down the road probably has the \"A team. They may want to consider reallocating some of their small army of time share and activity/excursion concierge folks into base services. However, again in fairness, this is again primarily a time share resort so I do have to keep everything here in perspective. On a more positive note, the resort facilities are good. The grounds were well maintained and I liked the spacious open air layout and the amenities were more or less up to regular Westin standards. The beach is decent although you can't really swim due to the coral (but the main Ka'anapali beach is just a 5 minute shuttle away). While we didn't use it as much as we had planned, having a kitchen was convenient as was the ensuite laundry. If you have kids (we don't) you could probably save big bucks. We figured we saved about $400 in not having to pay any hidden daily resort fees, preparing breakfast and a couple of lunches in our room, free Internet etc. Of course, with this set-up this resort is primarily a family oriented establishment that does have more than its fair share of kids running around (but this is par for the course in general in Ka'anpali!). We'd probably look to go a couple of weeks earlier or perhaps in October the next time around while the majority of schools are still in session. Overall, I'll give the Villas a passing grade. I'm not sure if we'd stay there again (and would probably lean to the actual Westin or Sheraton hotels down the road) but I would still recommend this to folks, especially those with families. Pros: -No hidden charges (i.e. no daily resort fee) -Kitchen and ensuite laundry -Nice open concept grounds and pool areas -Decent gym and spa -Complimentary wireless Internet -Free shuttle to main Ka'anpali strip (i.e. Whaler's Village) every 15 minutes and to Lahaina hourly Cons: -Not same Westin service as at one of their hotels (notably housekeeping) -Marginal restaurant/bar facilities -Late departure lounge/locker room facilities poorly serviced (again, primarily from a cleaning standpoint) -No ocean swimming from beach -Timeshare pushing (although not anywhere near as bad as you get in other places like Mexico)", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation, but be careful what you book...\u201d", "Author": "Silva9006", "ReviewID": "UR16898974", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin Villas for one week in March.

We re-booked for a 10-day stay this coming September (2008) and can't wait. Last summer (2007) our room was in the older original section and we were happy about that since the units are larger than the new ones-North, and just as nicely appointed. We were assigned a 1 bedroom premium that was on the 3rd floor at the far south end of the building overlooking a landscape fountain near the front entrance of the property. From our room we could sit on the really spacious lanai and see a lovely ocean view and nearby public park. We know that many people may likely NOT have preferred this room location with the constant fountain sounds , but we LOVED IT!! We are light sleepers and were thrilled to leave our slider doors open every night and hear the fountain...it was like the ocean and it masked out any in-coming traffic from the main highway. No complaints! Got be sure to tell EVERYONE to please order the homemade chicken soupat the ocean bar and grill...main building. OMG! It was so good we ate it several times while there...and the service was terrific....everywhere we went on property. One day at lunch at the pool grill, I'd kicked off a pair of expensive new leather sandles and then left to go back down to the beach. The helpful staff at the pool restaurant had retrieved them and were holding them for us and saw that we'd gotten a message in our room. The Westin concierge/greet staff was fabulous and helped set the tone immediately for a great stay with their helpful info and cordial assistance that started many weeks earlier when I'd called to have some dinner reservations made...and a floral arrangement delivered to our unit upon arrival. Having the Westin shuttle at our disposal was wonderful and we really utilized it many times when we just planned on running down to the Hula Grill at Whalers or into Lahaina for dinners and wine or the Cannery for quick grocery trips. Note: If you're a distance speed walker like I am...it's only about 4 scenic miles from the resort right into downtown Lahaina...and if you're too tired to hoof it back...just pick up the Westin shuttle that has several stops in Lahaina at KOBE restaurant, Hilo Hatties and also at the Cannery Mall a little bit north of downtown Lahaina. Maui is indeed paradise.....but the real paradise is being able to enjoy the island from such a lovely 'home-base'....the Westin Ocean Villas!

Since all the units have full kitchens, I imagine they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting you to dine in. The pools are very nice and were not crowded.

The rooms went quickly--we were barely able to confirm the reservation in time--and they clearly went out of their way to help us. When placing the reservation with Maui Hawaii Vacations, we had asked for rooms that were close together, on a high floor, and preferably not overlooking any parking lots. All requests were fulfilled. We had adjacent island view rooms in the Westin Villas North that also had views of the ocean. The front desk made keys for all the rooms for all of us and promptly answered service requests (e.g., rollaway beds, extra blankets). Our travel agency's package included daily maid service. They were thorough and professional--one member of our group couldn't find a book after a cleaning, and the staff searched thoroughly and promptly for the book and eventually found it (it had accidentally gotten wrapped up in sheets and sent to the laundry). I was also impressed (and relieved) that the hotel did not require us at the end of our stay to re-sort the dishes and kitchen supplies provided in each room; group dinners meant that we occasionally combined dishes from several rooms. The shuttle to Lahaina, free parking, grills, and excellent snorkeling outside the hotel were all handy amenities. Perhaps because we didn't go during a busy season, we had no trouble finding free pool chairs. Our only minor complaints were that the concierge was only occasionally helpful, and the fitness center was way too small and industrial. (Would've been nice if it had a view of some kind.) I've heard they're opening a new gym. There were also some jewelry vendors in the foyer. They seemed slightly inappropriate for such a nice resort. I stayed at the Halekulani in Waikiki, a hotel renowned for its service, in December. Service at the Westin Villas was the same quality, and the resort was much more comfortable. I'd also recommend Maui Hawaii Vacations for booking.", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Costa Mesa, California", "Title": "\u201cthe westin maui resort & spa...Just what the Doctors ordered\u201d", "Author": "xplr8n", "ReviewID": "UR15994319", "Content": "The Westin Maui Resort & Spa/ Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas was just what the Doctors ordered!

We especially love the in room washer/dryer and kitchenette. They are invaluable assets when traveling with kids! We can prepare breakfast, keep drinks cold in the fridge, have ice at the ready, prepare easy meals. We have a crib for our daughter, which easily fits in the entry way (like a mini room for her) which gives us more privacy. If I were traveling with 2 kids, however, I would definitely get a 1 bedroom villa instead of the studio. Who wants to go on vacation and sleep in the same room with their kids?? Not us!! In the 1 bedroom villa, the kids sleep in the livingroom and the parents can have the bedroom to themselves. Though the resort caters to familes, it is very elegant and the landscaping is magnificent. We love the koi ponds, and the lush tropical plantings. The pools are fantastic, though we spend most of our time at the two toddler pools, which our daughter loves. They are super clean, safe, and so much fun! The resort's restaurants are decent, but not amazing. The great thing is that kids eat free, which works for us. When we wanted to go have a really good meal, we used Happy Kids babysitting service so my husband and I could go out by ourselves and check out the new sushi bistro at the recently remodeled Ritz Carlton. Highly recommend it for tasty sushi in a lovely setting. In sum, can't go wrong at this resort. The weather is absolutely perfect, not as cold and windy as Kapalua. The beach is gorgeous, the staff are friendly, the resort is relaxing, comfortable, and totally easy with kids. Probably would not recommend this resort for people looking for a quiet getaway.

We usually stay in Napili at the Outrigger (a lovely, low-key property), but since my husband couldn't join us on this trip, I was looking for a slightly upscale place that had a wide range of resort-type services (room service, onsite dining, beach gear rentals, and onsite beach activity rentals), and where my kids could be comfortably set loose at the pool for the day. I also wanted a place where I could fix a few meals if I chose to. This place fit the bill perfectly. Checkin was a breeze. We arrived via rental car, bearing loads of groceries. The bellman asked if I wanted it all taken to our room while we checked in, and I said sure. They put away all my groceries for me, and gave me a full tour of the resort while my kids settled in. They really made me feel special, and valued. Valet service ($9 day, self-parking is free) was quick and friendly. Parking is no problem at all. Each complex has an underground lot, very useful as cars left outside during the heat of the day can get quite hot. It also rained nearly every morning/night we were there, so the underground parking was the way to go. I booked a one-bedroom \"island View\" villa, knowing full well from the other reviews that this meant a view of the highway and parking lot - I was willing to gamble that a free upgrade might be available. Upon checkin, I politely asked the front desk attendant if there were \"quieter\" rooms available away from the road, as I was worried about the road noise and car alarms. She hated car alarms, too -- and so gave me a partial ocean-view villa fronting the pool, a huge improvement (Rm. 2211 in the South complex). The rooms felt very big to me, and the bathroom was large, clean, and well-stocked with amenities. We never used the jacuzzi tub but I liked the fact that you could soak in it while watching TV if you wanted. Maid service was daily, which suprised me (I expected just once during the stay) and they always restocked our free laundry detergent, fabric softener, dish soap, etc. The villas were very quiet and well soundproofed. I never heard any noise at all from another room. The pool is open until 10pm, but the windows seal wel and close out most sound from outside. At first, I couldn't figure out why the A/C wasn't working, then I remembered another reviewer said you have to make sure all the windows are closed completely. I had to push the balcony slider hard to make contact with the switchplate inside the panelframe, and then it kicked in. Not a problem, really. The Westin Villas' location on North Ka'anapali Beach means less crowded conditions & plenty of sand for everyone, and great snorkeling is found right offshore. The reef is close-in and is still very healthy, as the water is just deep enough to prevent the coral from being trampled, but not so deep that you can't see the fish & marine life. I used to live near here, and was worried that this reef would be destroyed by all the people, but thankfully this has not happened, largely owing to the rather steep dropoff from shore. During our stay, the ocean was very calm, no waves at all, very good for swimming/kids. (Even during a swell, this beach doesn't get big breakers, but big surgey waves.) The pool was very warm which I like -- and the hot tubs were HOT! Delicious after snorkeling. The villas are a ten-minute drive from the north end of Lahaina, and there are free shuttles to the Kaanapali Beach resorts/Whaler's Village shops (every 15 mins) and to Lahaina (every hour). If you have a car, do your grocery shopping at Star Market in Honokowai, just 5 mins. to the north - they have a much better quality and selection than the Safeway at Lahaina Cannery Mall. Also try the Honokowai Okazuya (takeout) for delicious, restaurant-quality takeout - the lemon-caper mahi mahi is legendary. This resort is far less crowded than the other Ka'anapali Beach resorts, and I was impressed by the lovely landscaping. It's really very nicely done. I have to say I prefered the South complex to the North, due to the openness of the South Complex to the ocean (the North Complex is a bit closed off at the ocean end, obsuring the view from the grounds), and better pool (the South's Ocean Pool is larger, and has a waterslide for kids). However, if you are booking a studio unit, the ones in the North complex have actual walk-out lanais; the studios in the South unit only have balconettes (you step out to a railing). In all, I would recommed this place highly for families w/kids.

To begin, we were greeted by a 45 minute wait to check in that was reminiscent of a airport security line. Given the crowds in Maui over spring break, the hotel's staffing of two receptionists on a busy Saturday afternoon was inexcusable. Our assigned \"villa\" (really a glorified hotel room with a small kitchenette) overlooked the parking lot and the main Kaanapali strip. While the room was adequate, it wasn't very clean with an unappetizing wad of hair left in the shower drain and some dubious looking brown spots on the telephone console. During our stay, the maid service was very erratic and rather than coming during the day while we were at the beach/pool, it either arrived at 9:00 before we were ready to leave for the day or at 5:00 after we retunred to get ready for dinner. On several occasions, the bathroom sink wasn't even wiped down after cleaning. The property is decent -- although not particularly special -- but the number of guests completely overwhelmed the facility. We arrived at the pool our first morning at 9:00 AM and were unable to find four beach chairs together as the savvy timeshare owners appear to make a habit of going to the pool in the early morning and \"reserving\" a chair for the day with their towel and personal items regardless of when they intend to actually use the chair. The overall pool experience is pretty mediocre on top of that with too many people crammed into too small a space. While the beach in front of the property is nice enough, it was super windy while we were there and not comfortable after about noon. I can't say whether this is typical or not for the property. On the plus side, the snorkling was very good. On the negative, the reefs are quite close in and are rough on the feet for general swimming. We left the Westin and spent the final four days of our vacation at the Four Seasons Koele Lodge on Lanai and the contrast was remarkable. We went from being one of the masses to special guests in an instant. While you do get what you pay for, the price difference between the Westin and the Four Seasons isn't all that great given that the Westin nickels and dimes you for everything and many items at the Koele and its sister resort the Manele Bay were provided for free as part of their great service. For example, beach chairs, umbrellas, and snorkling equipment are complimentary at the Koele/Manele. Those same items cost well over $100 per day for a family of four at the Westin. And that doesn't even take into account the free cold pineapple slices, popsicles, ice water, lemonaide, cold towels, and Evian mist at the FS.

(wear swim shoes as it can be rocky and you can get cut on the coral or step on a sea urchin) -Old Lahaina Luau Really fun best in Maui great food and took tons of pics bought a bunch of tiki's and turtles -Bike down Haleakala Yes you have to get up at 2am. It's worth it as the view danger and breakfast at the end where incredible. Just be careful, it is dangerous. When we where up on top we saw a girl with a girl with a broken leg from the day before and a few days later a woman got killed. Black Rock- At the Sheraton really fun jumping of the cliff and again great snokerling better than wasting money in going out to Molokini (big waste as it's rare they actually take you out there and instead you go ot some crappy spot where you see no fish and waste your time) Also they have a show which is really cool at sunset. Lahina- Go down and havea few drinks at one of the local bars walk the street sand do some shopping and relax in the quaint little town feel.You can also take in one of the various shows and sign up for a time share presentation to get discounts from here. We just went to boss frog's rented gear for 7 people plus cameras for free just for me and my g/f to go to one which saved us over $300 as we then got huge discounts to all the events for 90 mins of saying NO NO NO :) We ate at Moma's Fish house which was amazing if you can stomach the prices it's worth it. Also ate at Sanz in the Hyatt great food. The food at the resort was just so so. All in all it was such a great vacation and surley on I will never forget. There are tons of things I'm forgetting but ce la vie.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cKid-friendly Resort\u201d", "Author": "traveldadOntario", "ReviewID": "UR14360154", "Content": "We were assigned a room in the North Villas. We weren't given an upgrade to a one bedroom but we did get a partial ocean view upgrade on the 4th floor and a later check-out for no extra charge so that was nice. The grounds are nicely landscaped with koi ponds and pools. They have a water slide for all ages at the main pool and a separate pool with the pirate ship in between the north and main villas for children only. There is also an adults only pool at the north villas. The beach isn't rocky or windy at all but it isn't as wide or as busy as the main Ka'anapali beach. They have signs up that indicate that they in the process of rejuvenating the beach but don't worry it's still very nice right now. We didn't really use the kitchen except to make breakfast and to keep the drinks cold but it was still great to have. I think it is perfect for families. PROS: 1. Spotless 2. Brand new & looks exactly like the photos 3. Huge bathroom with jacuzzi tub and separate shower with a dual shower head 4. North Kaanapali Beach is nice - steep drop off in the ocean but that makes it even better for snorkeling - no need to go out too far 5. Free Parking 6. Free in room Wifi 7. Free access to business centre (Internet, faxes, printing) 8. Room amenities - washer/dryer also provide broom & vacuum 9. Kitchen amenities - fully stocked kitchen including a dishwasher, toaster, blender etc. (they also provide a free starter kit including Tide, Bounce, scouring pad, Palmolive, tea towels, tea/coffee & paper towels) They don't provide salt or pepper so don't forget to pick that up at the market. 10. Daily housekeeping - they even did our dishes for us! 11. In-room Entertainment - LCD TV with 100+ channels, Bose CD player/radio & DVD player (movie rental machines are in the lobby though we didn't use them) 12. NO Resort Fees!!!!!! Yay! 13. Free local calls 14. Free shuttle to Lahaina and the other starwood resorts (we never used this though since we had the car) 15. Free 4x6 photo taken by a professional photographer. 16. Nice sized Lanai overlooking the pool - only studios in the north villas have a Lanai in the main villas studios just have a juliette balcony 17. Huge gas BBQ's for use CONS: 1. Shallow pools ( this might be listed as a pro for you but for us we would have liked something deeper - at its deepest the pools are I think 4 1/2 feet) 2. Some hallways in the North Villas seem unfinished - room is gorgeous but the hallway is un-carpeted in parts and seems a bit utilitarian not like the rest of the resort ( I think they're still working on this, though there was no construction going on while we were there) 3. North Amenities aren't finished (spa and 15,000 sq ft gym still in progress) though you can use the amenities of the main villas. 4. Early check-out. Regular check out is 10am and even though they extended the check-out for us our flight wasn't leaving till 9pm. They do give you full access to all the amenities and a guest lounge. But you have to use the gym's locker room to shower and change in. That was crappy I would have preferred a hospitality room like most other hotels provide. 5. Somehow the beds in the N. Villas are queens and not kings (so weird apparently it was some mistake and they are going to order all new beds or something - not that we really needed a king bed but just kinda odd) 6. No access to the other SPG (Sheraton, Westin) pools. Apparently they had to stop that last year do to overcrowding. You can still charge things at the other Starwood resorts to your room but that's it. They also have a full list of activities but we didn't do any of them as we were mostly out and about or at the beach. But if you want to do one I recommend the free cooking demonstrations by the chef from the Sheraton. We just happened to walk by when that was happening and they just invited us over. So we pretty much learned how to make some delicious gourmet food that is easy to make and then ate it all. Yummy. And then he did a giveaway of his cookbook (which we didn't win but maybe you'll be luckier!) So as you can see there are a lot more pros than cons.

We have a 2 bedroom which only translates to a studio in Hawaii. After being awake for 22 hours we arrived in Maui. The bellman opened the car door and immediately started telling us he will park our car and take our luggage for us. Nothing like giving us a moment to get our thoughts together to check in. I told him just hold on, that we needed to check in. I went to check in - I asked if there were upgrades available, I thought that maybe since we were owners in the Starwood network that we would have a decent chance). The clerks looked at each other and convinced themselves that all 1 bedrooms were booked, although there were a lot of dark windows that week in other condos. They never made the effort to check. The best was that I received an email the week we were there, as a general email to Starwood owners about all of the current available rooms at the Westin Ocean Resort Villas North. I guess that's just until you get there. We went back to our car and I went to get a luggage rack. Big No-No here. The bellman appeared and informed us that we weren't allowed to use them. that only the bellman can (kind of snotty, may I add). I went up to check on our room while my husband parked the car (he took the luggage out and set it by the bellman's desk). I misunderstood the room number (the first number is the building #, not the floor # - my husband said they did tell me, but I was exhausted and didn't hear that). Bottom line, the bellman disappeared and we had to take our luggage up ourselves. Sorry, couldn't use one of the 34 luggage racks sitting there. I was quite ticked and let the desk person know in no uncertain terms. We would have had the bellman do it, if he were around (there was only one there that night). My husband had one of the bellmen bring up groceries later in the week on the luggage cart. That guy was very nice. We get to the room and the carpet was stained in several spots. Hmmmm, was I at a Best Western and no one told me? Nope, because I could at least use the luggage rack at Best Western. This was just a deluxe hotel room. We did luck out with an extra large lanai because we were right over the restaurant in the main building. In the room there was very little space for clothes, personal items in the bathroom, or items in the kitchen. The toilet was plugged up, the shower door wouldn't close properly, the kitchen sink/garbage disposal plugged up and the safe wouldn't open (yes I did a test run before I locked it). Any of the people that came to fix things were very nice. The grounds were nice, the pool was nice. We called about a channel guide and they said they didn't have one, although we did later find one on our welcome pamphlet that had gotten buried (remember - no space). Also, there were no computers available for use in this complex - you had to go to the regular Villas lobby. How hard is it to set up a few computers? Also, the general store is still under construction. The bathroom is set up kind of strange. There are windows that open right above the jacuzzi - I guess for if you want to watch TV while you're in there, can't think of any other reason. There is no duct in the bathroom, so once you close the door, you get absolutely no air in there. Also, fyi, as soon as you open the lanai door, the air stops working, so make sure you close the door tightly when you leave.

The room set up was perfect for traveling with kids and the property itself had many kid friendly activities including a great kids pool with a mini pirate ship. We were also able to arrange for a crib in advance for our 3 mos. old which made for one less item to bring along. The only thing that I did not like was the plantation shutters between the bathroom and bedroom area. The shutters are next to a wonderful large jet tub that when open allow the person in the tub to look into the master bedroom. Romantic yes but not so good when you are with two little ones. The bathroom (sinks, shower, tub) were in a large room w/ floors that were tiled which made it kind of loud in the bedroom next to it.

We paid $3,400 for the week through Maui Hawaiin Vacations. This rate comes to around $242/night for a one bedroom condo which I was pleased with esp for the Kaanaapali Beach location. We shared with another couple and had a mini \"foyer\" like hallway between the two suites. Our suite (master) had a spacious bedroom with the heavenly bed which was so great! We had a spacious bathroom as well with double sinks, jacuzzi tub (which we never even used) and of course, the heavenly shower. Nice flat screen TV in bedroom and another in living area. Our living area was also very spacious (a completely separate room) with a couch and chair, coffee table and a full size dining table and six chairs. The living area had a lanai entrance too (shared with the master bedroom) with two wicker chairs. The kitchen was done nicely with complimentary dish soap, coffee and all needed utensils and dishes. To top it off we had a stacked washer and dryer off the kitchen enclosed in a closet. They even included Tide and dryer sheets. The adjoining one bedroom across the \"foyer\" from us had it's own entrance and was similar to our suite just smaller. Their lanai was very tiny, could barely stand there, no chairs to sit. Their living area was like that of a larger hotel room where the bed and living area are the same room, not separated like ours. and they only had a kitchenette with mini fridge and not all the amenities we had. Their bathroom, although spacious, only had one sink but they did have their own washer and dryer too. Same heavenly king bed and shower. We did not know the accomodations would be different but it worked out fine for all of us even though one suite was a little larger. Since we traveled together and shared the cost it worked out fine. Although I did feel a little bad that we arrived first and got the nicer, bigger suite. The pool was above average and the beach area is nice. The grounds were very lush and tropical, very well maintained. The concierage was excellent and we used different ones for different activities depending on who was at the desk that day. All were friendly, competent and very knowledgable. An awesome value for 2 couples traveling together but would also work well for families. Our suite alone could have slept another two out on the pull out sofa - no heavenly couch there but kids don't care, right? The adjoining suite could have also accomodated 4 with the pull out couch.

The bartender, Mike was fun and made us a yummy drink called a volcano on our first night. Also nightly entertainment on the lawn around the pools. A local dance studio put on a really great hula show one night we were there with boys and girls ages 3 all the way up to around 17. They were excellent and it was very entertaining with great hawaiian music. We just sat out on the lawn with our mai tai's then walked over to the beach for the sunset. They alternate nights between the North Resort and the one we stayed at. The North resort can be accessed by walking over and you can use their pools too. They are a little newer and had a fancy restaurant overlooking their koi pond. We ate there and the food was good but it was a little overpriced and stuffy.

We had a nice stay, but the property didn't excite us. The property has a very modern, luxurious feel but I have to agree with a previous reviewer that there is a lack of Aloha here. We were in the North building, in a studio, and our room was very beautiful, comfortable and clean. Having a washer and dryer in room is a huge bonus when traveling with kids. Everything we needed was provided. The North building is not complete, and many of the services are located in the South building and some services in the South may not be provided in the North building. It is a very short walk to the South building, but in the wind and rain it was a little annoying. The atmosphere in the North and the South buildings are completely different. The North building is very quiet, felt more sophisticated and my kids were the only kids at the pool. I felt uncomfortable being there because I didn't want to bother the adults in the quiet , relaxed atmosphere. Then we decided to check out the South pool. What a difference! Life! Activity! Families! We were obviously in the wrong building. The South pool is great for kids with the slide and other families. So, if you are an adult with no kids and don't want to be bothered by other people's kids, stay in the North building. If your traveling with your kids, stay in the South building if they will let you. I'm trying figure out myself why this property didn't wow me, when it was beautiful, had everything, and it should have. I have to say it was the lack of genuine friendliness from the staff, the constant wind at the property, the timeshare presence and being put in the North building instead of the South. The staff was always courteous but not relaxed and genuinely friendly like at the previous Starwood property we stayed at on Oahu. It was more like a forced courtesy because these guests are paying a lot to stay here. They must have mistaken us for a fussy, wealthy travelers. There was also a constant wind at the property the entire 6 days we were there. The Kaanapali area in general is a windier part of the island, you have to go to Lahaina to escape it, but I couldn't stand it. These weren't gentle tradewinds, but constant gusty winds. Sitting at the pool or beach everything had to be anchored down and the sand stung you during the big gusts. The lobby was like a wind tunnel. No one else has mentioned these winds, so maybe this was a fluke, and it is not the hotels fault, but it was hard to enjoy the amenities. Future reviewers, mention the winds if they are worth mentioning. I'm curious to know if it is always like this. They have a handy shuttle that will take you to the other Starwood properties and to Lahaina. Using the pools at the other properties is not allowed. You must be a registered guest at that property to use the pool. I can understand why this rule was put in place. Check out is early at 10 a.m. and we were finishing up packing when at 10:10 we got a knock on the door from housekeeping that they needed to clean the room for the next guest and that we were past check out. I appreciate that they want to have the room ready for when the next guest arrives, and it was past check out, but it felt like an eviction as they waited outside the door for us to clear out. We were out the door by 10:17. Overall it was a good stay, and I could recommend this property to others, and I would stay again if I can stay in the South building, the winds are more gentle and the staff was more genuine.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenacres, WA", "Title": "\u201cHeaven!

We were not required to attend a presentation but received an additional \"gift\" for doing so ($100 hotel voucher - on top of the $75 voucher that came with our package deal which consisted of an Avis rental car and Studio Villa). First off we arrived a little late, I believe close to 8pm and we didn't receive a lei greeting but we were more concerned with getting checked in and seeing our room. We asked if there were any complimentary upgrades and to go from a studio to a 1 bd they wanted another $200 per night. They did however upgrade us from an Island Studio Villa to a Deluxe Villa which we were told was slightly bigger. Sadly we were on the ground floor and did overlook the parking lot to the public beach but for the price we weren't' complaining. The building was exceptionally quiet and we were a 60 sec walk out the door to the beach. We would have loved to be on any floor above ground level but as it was we just closed the blinds most of the time. The rest of the room surly made up for it. The bed was a dream, the room was very roomy, and having our own washer & dryer came in handy after our Kaanapali Zipline tour. The rooms has maid service daily on this package whereas renting the standard week does not offer daily service. Also, coffee, teas, soaps (Laundry & dish) were all provided. The bathroom is absolute luxury.. . huge counter space, jacuzzi tub and separate dual head shower. Wonderful. So then came the calls. After checking in we hit the lounge for cocktail. When we got back to the room we had a voice mail telling us to stop by in the morning to pick up our voucher and this was also so they could arrange a time for our timeshare tour. Everyone was extremely nice and always had a hello. Had we wanted to avoid taking a tour we could have ignored the call(s) or just not checked our messages. They were not pushy and were all very nice about it an always had a treat of somesort. We got chocolates and postcards when setting up the tour time and then durning the tour we were offered beverages and snacks. I recommend the Iced lattes :-) The tour did run a little long but we got through it and got this out of our way our 2nd day at the resort. This left the remaining 3 days of piece and knowing we wouldn't be bothered any further. I highly recommend taking this deal if you come upon the offer. We enjoyed all the pools and hot tubs at the resort. The snorkeling right out front was excellent and great for first timers. Going in October I guess it was a bit slow, we had no trouble finding chairs or space on the beach. There is also a free shuttle to Whalers village every 15 min for hotel guests as well as a free shuttle to Lahaina. We had a rental car but often took advantage of the shuttle to save on parking. All in all this was a great trip and we loved everything about the Villas. We are already planning our trip back in Feb 09.

Let me preface this review by saying that we came from the VERY luxurious Marriott on Kauai before staying at the Westin Villas. The Westin is a totally different atmosphere that the big Marriott on Kauai. So, nevertheless, our expectations were high after our stay on Kauai. We traded on Interval International as a gift from my husbands parents. We were initially supposed to stay at the south property...but ended up at the north property. Upon check in (which took forever), we were told a room wasn't ready for us. Although we arrived well after the 4 pm check in time. It took about an hour for them to get us a room. When we got up to the room....it was as bad as it could get. We were stuck in what was supposed to be an \"ocean view\"...but was behind the public parking lot for Ka'anapali Beach Park. It was in the corner on the first floor. Needless to say, as honeymooner's...we were disappointed. Not only was the room in a terrible location, but the hallways were crowded with kids running without supervision and were extremely loud. The south property itself was VERY crowded and overrun with people in the lobby and at the pool. We could tell that it wasn't the low key vibe we were looking for. The front desk at the south property was of no help....so we ventured to the north side. We asked if there was any way that we could transfer and our wish was granted! They moved us to a studio in the North property (3rd floor) and sent us a bottle of wine for our troubles. This whole process took about 4 hours, which did cut into our evening plans. But, we were so happy to be off the south property...we didn't care. Now for our good experience with the Westin south property. Our room was beautiful and hadn't even been stayed in yet. The resort was only at about 60% capacity because construction was still going on. The room: Typical Westin modern rooms. Our room overlooked the courtyard and the koi pond, but still had a good view of the ocean through the buildings. There was a full kitchenette that was stocked with everything we needed. The bed was only a queen size and we were expecting a king. But the bed was \"heavenly\" There was a full lanai which we took full advantage of for morning coffee and many meals. The bathroom was very luxurious with a separate shower and jacuzzi tub. The jacuzzi tub overlooked an opening in the wall into the sleeping area. We had a mid week clean up which wasn't really up to par, but we didn't care too much at that point. The pool: Very quiet and serene. We never had a problem finding a lounge chair. The pool at the south property was more crowded and a little larger, but we liked how quiet the north pool was. There is a separate adult pool that was not ready when we were there. The beach: Ka'anapali beach is just beautiful. Although, if you have been to Mexico, Virgin islands etc, you will be disappointed to know that there aren't loungers on the beach. This is the case in all of the islands. You can get loungers on the beach, but it will cost you $30-$40 per couple, per day. The snorkeling off the beach was great. We saw lots of turtles and tons of fish. Black rock was good for snorkeling too, but it was quite a hike on foot. Overall, service at the hotel was great. The staff was helpful and the concierge was great. We did get some pressure to do the timeshare presentation, but mostly in the form of voice mail in our room. I think this is a great hotel for families. It would not have been our first choice for a romantic honeymoon spot, but it was free and we ended up loving it. If we were paying ourselves, I would not have chosen this hotel. But, for a free week in Maui,,,we loved it!

The restaurant food and service, both inside and pool side were nothing special but there are many great places to eat if you take the shuttle bus to Whalers Village and the $1.00 town bus to nearby Lanai. Dave Scott's Lanai Grill is fabulous, and we had wonderful meals at Longhi's. The week before our arrival heavy rains backed up the Treatment plant, so ocean bans in place and the beach was not available.

We would go back, but this does not compare to the Westin St. John or the Bahamas Atlantis.

The North property has only been opened for around 4 months and is about 70% complete. I'm not sure if some of the observations I will list are things that will be attended to within time. Most of the loud/external construction is finished while they complete the interiors of the farthest-most north wing and the last adult pool. The staff is attentive and helpful. Upon entering, the lobby is less grand and simpler that the Original KOR. It has a similar open style but something about it seems less dramatic (less flowers perhaps?). The whole layout of the wings are closer together which gives a more intimate, close-in impression as you walk the grounds.The landscaping is very pretty but cannot yet compare to the more mature growth of the older property. The main pool is smaller but meanders so there are more unique areas to sit. There are also more pools with the inclusion of a very sweet Pirate Ship pool for the very young that looks like fun. The Original property is more spread out and has a larger pool with a slide. Therefore, there is much more energy around that property in general. The halls are also less appealing. I venture to say, downright ugly. They are all open-air which prompted them to install plasticated, mold-proof flooring and the most basic of ornamentation There are even places where there are no baseboards which leads to a very unfinished look. There will be more Ocean Front rooms although some that are listed as ocean front, you must actually look over the top of the pool restaurant. There are no screens on the glass sliding doors and although insects in the area are few, we were forced to close our door at night to prevent mosquitoes. This is a shame since we love the sound of the breaking waves while we sleep. We did not see the Ocean view category of room but the Island View suites would be much more desirable on the North side. There are no units looking a parking lot as with the Original building. The units themselves are very, very similar. Layout and caliber of appointments are virtually identical except the square footage of the rooms in the new property is considerably smaller. They've chosen to decrease the size of the living and bedrooms while the massive bathrooms remain the same. The walls are thick and we did not hear another person within the unit the whole week. Even though Westin is a non-smoking property, they do allow it on the lanai's so unfortunately, you can have someone smoking around you and the smell will waft in through an open door. The trademark Westin bed and shower/bath are awesome! They even changed to a frosted shower door on the 1 bedroom side. this is great if you have multiple people in the unit that sleeps 4, the person in the shower can have privacy if others want to use the room. They have replaced the rectangular dining table with a round one that only sits 4. I'm not sure of the philosophy of this decision and I don't think it was an improvement especially if you are using the 2 bedroom option with more than 4 guests. The restaurants, although open, are not at their full capacity. We were told that both properties are being currently being served from the same small kitchen in the original building. The rumor was that the only thing worth eating at the beach restaurant are the burgers since they are cooked on-site. Our choices (not burgers) confirmed this impression and were not very good. The other main restaurant is currently be run as a buffet. It was often empty since there are kitchens in the hotel's rooms. We were told that they will at some point convert this to a first class destination restaurant. The beach is inviting and the surf is approachable. The surf had a a nice balance between not being too calm or too rough. There is a very nice snorkeling reef not far from shore. They rent individual chaise chairs with shade cloths on the beach. Around the pool, they have both cabanas and double chaise with shade overhangs for rent and \"palapa\" style umbrellas scattered around for shade for free. We visited on a non-school holiday so most of the guests either had very small children or none at all so it was much quieter. This could also change when the hotel is at full capacity. It was our observation that the North property is better for adults and very young children whereas the Original has more going on for school-age and older families.

The beach is fantastic: clean, with a nice wide swath of sand for sunning, and the water has a soft clean sandy bottom with no rocks or coral out at least 20 ft from shore. Compared to the Hyatt (3 hotels down the beach), the Westin is not quite as upscale, but the Westin's beach is far better (the Hyatt's beach is almost nonexistent, and rocks come right up to the shoreline). Overall, we had a great stay here, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Tip: there's a great shopping center about a mile before you get to Kaanapali, with a Longs drug, Safeway grocery, and ABC general store (lots of inexpensive clothing, souvenirs, etc). Stop here and buy boogie boards, beach chairs and umbrellas, snacks/drinks etc. The cost of the equipment is less than a 1 day rental at the hotel's beach shack, and you can save substantial $ on the food (sunscreen is also plentiful at mainland prices, so don't worry about packing a ton of the stuff).", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sussex", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Resort\u201d", "Author": "Killpards", "ReviewID": "UR8660294", "Content": "This resort can only be described as outstanding.We travelled all the way from the UK and all i can say is it was worth every hour spent getting there.

We had a studio with kitchenette. Our room was on the first floor and in close walking distance to the pool. It was very quiet, and I rarely heard any noise from outside or upstairs when we were in the room. This was despite the hotel being fairly busy. It was definitely a big plus how close we were to the beach. It was nice to just take a short stroll down to the water, and be able to play, swim, and snorkel there. The water was nice and fairly calm. Our kids were able to run in and splash without too much worry. Plan to catch the sunset from the beach. You get the best view right there from the hotel's beach access. The pools were also really nice at the hotel. They have 3 different pool areas. The one on the north side has kind of like a lagoon/river sort of arrangement, which is very nice. This pool was always less crowded than the main pool on the south side of the resort. This main pool had the big slide by the waterfall, so obviously it would be the most crowded pool. Then there is a smaller pool area for those with toddlers. It has a big pirate ship that shoots out water and has small slides for little ones. Kids eat free with each adult meal at the hotel's bar and grill, but we were disappointed with the food. It really tasted like it was just reheated frozen food, rather than fresh-made-to-order. We preferred to take the complimentary shuttle into Lahaina and try the restaurants there. One place we enjoyed and found to be reasonably priced was the Aloha Mixed Plate restaurant behind the Cannery Mall. You should definitely make a stop there at least once to have some local food. We also went to the Hula Grill at the Whaler's Village, which had really good burgers. I also highly recommend taking advantage of the complimentary shuttles into the different parts of Lahaina. No need to stress on driving and parking! Overall, we had a great stay, and would recommend the Westin Ocean Resort Villas.

Upon our arrival the smell of the lobby certainly gave the Maui ocean feel... The valet was quite nice and assisted us with our bags.. Upon checking in the girl behind the front desk said she had a BEAUTIFUL room for us with ocean view and high upgraded... The first thing I noticed when I we were walking to the room was the amount of running wild children. No parents in site.. Running up and down the halls in soaked swim trunks making the hallway have a watered down stench.. The room was attached to another villa which shared a public door although it was locked... From there I noticed that the maid service only occurs once a week.. Our bathroom in our room looked as if it was made in the 1970's.. Our water pressure was terrible and the so called jacuzzi still had sand stains on it from the previous occupants... I was quite annoyed... The next morning I wake up to the pounding sounds of children screaming and crying throughout the hall... I look outside our so-called ocean view room only too see the large pool full of children running wild.. The first thing that came to my mind was there has to be pee all over in that water... My girlfriend and I wanted to catch some rays so we attempted to find a space with ample sun.. This was near impossible... The few cabannas they had were rented for 2 weeks out! So it was up to us to find a spot to lay around all these running and screaming children... We finally find a space where we had to literally lay down right next to someone else.. It was like flying coach on airplane.. We crawled into our spaces over a child who was swining a towel at another child while screaming about it... I thought Maui was suppose to be about relaxing.. I finally just am fed up with it... I would rather spend time in my private room then be around these children.. The next day we found that there was an area just being finished called the \"North\" side which seemed to be quite fresh and new... No children around... Just adults eating their breakfast... From there I new we needed to switch rooms... I asked the front desk if it would be possible to switch.. Nicely enough they switched us! :-) I thought it was only uphill from here... Until the next day... I went for a workout in the Westin's gym.. Just a quick note on that... The YMCA in Scottsdale looks better than this! After finishing my workout I went back to the room.. As I approached the door my key card didn't work... I was somewhat upset because we had just received our keys the day before and this was suppose to be a totally new room.. Just finished July 27th I was told... I walked to the front desk in the \"North\" property which has a much nicer lobby than the South... The girl named Jessica behind the front desk greeted me... I told her my room number and that my key wasn't working... She gave me a new key and I was on my way... ALTHOUGH!! She didn't even ask my name!! Anyone could have said my room number and she would have given them a key!! This was quite alarming.. Not what you would expect for a 5 star property... Upon returning to the room I get to the door and the key doesn't work again!!! Now I was upset.. Instead of walking back down again... I called the front desk and \"Jessica\" whom I spoke with before answered the phone... I told her this key wasnt working either... (Not to mention this whole time I am on crutches with a broken ankle). She asked me to hold... I waited 15 minutes on hold!!! I was very upset at this point...I walked/crutched back down to the front desk with my cell to my ear still waiting on hold... I get to the front desk and she is just standing there doing NOTHING!! All the while I am still on hold...I demanded to speak with a manager.. She came out very friendly and asked Jessica again to give me a new key... Also she asked security to walk with me back to the room so this wouldn't happen again... The security guard indicated to me that the flashing yellow light indicated the key was expired... This was only after one day!!! We walk back to the room and finally I get it... I was VERY upset... We are regular Maui vacationers.. Typically twice a year... We have stayed at the Four Seasons in Wailea (which is the REAL 5 star property although you'll pay $6000 for a week easily!).. The Ritz Carlton right up the road in Kapaula is another regular place we stay... Currently they are under renovations which made it not possible for us to stay there this time... So we tried the Westin.. I thought since it was just finished not even a month ago everything would be crisp, clean, and ready for use... How wrong I ever was...

What a wondeful resort!!! The resort itself has everything you need and is gorgeous. The Staff: Absolutely wonderful and always helpful. We were greeted by Akamu as we pulled up to the resort and throughout our stay was always smiling and making you feel at home. The rest of the staff was great also. It does get crazy on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays though due to a high level of check-ins/outs. So, be patient with the Bell Service staff. The Rooms: We stayed in a one-bedroom. For a family of 5, there was plenty of room (and we even had a roll-away bed in the room). Having a full-kitchen in the room was a great help in keeping our vacation costs down. And after realizing how much it costs to take the family out to eat, it was a blessing in disguise. Because this a timeshare-resort, room service is weekly. You can pay extra if you want room service to clean-up your room regularly. We had a partial ocean view room. The room had a great balcony to soak in the morning and view the beautiful Maui sunset. Location: The beach by the resort is a great place for snorkling!!! There was no need to take the family anywhere else. We did snorkel at other beaches, but the beach at the resort topped them all. Boogie boarding/body surfing is not good though, but there are plenty of local beaches to the north of the resort (Fleming's) that will satisfy your hunger for boogie boarding/body surfing. The resort beach is also a great place for the little ones. There is plenty of room for them to play in the water and the sand without a lot of waves. You can rent lounge chairs from the resort for an all-day fee, but I recommend you reserve these in advance. They get picked-up quickly. Poolside: There is a slide for the kids. It's kind of slow for the older kids, but perfect for young cjildren. I would rather hang out at the beach, but a lot of the guests prefer hanging out at the pool. (I don't get this?!!?) Lounge chairs are at a premium, so you need to claim them early in the morning. Good luck in trying to find a spot during the day. Shuttle Service: The Westin provides a great shuttle service to Lahaina and to the Whaler's Village area. The shuttle runs until 10:00 p.m. every evening. We found this very convenient for our family to get around. Timeshare presentation: Be aware that you may get swept into a timeshare presentation. But, let me tell you, the Westin Resorts are a great deal if you own at one of their properties, especially at this resort. They are building another bigger and better resort next door. How it can be better is beyond me? I can't wait to check it out. Resort Services: The resort has a poolside restaurant/bar and the food is always good! The breakfast buffet is fantastic and kids are free with an adult purchase. They do serve drinks/food poolside and the servers come to you (at your lounge chair). The resort also offers plenty of activities for adults and children. Our kids enjoyed feeding the Koi Fish and learning to make Lei's. There is a decent workout room and game room also. Also, each building has a concierge station to help you plan your stay in Maui. The resort also offers concierge services in the main lobby. We'll be back next summer!!!

We too booked almost a year in advance and specifically requested a room NOT overlooking the construction of the additional units. Of course, that is exactly what we ended up with when we arrived. We were told we couldn't change rooms because they were booked. No apologies. When I asked what time construction started in the morning, they told me by 7:00 a.m. So, we were unable to leave the sliding glass door open. Not to worry though because when you are in a studio, there is NO BALCONY. Just a sliding door to NOWHERE. The pool area, although pretty, was packed. The lounge chairs, if you could get one, were so close together and so uncomfortable (hard plastic) that we didn't venture out there for more than maybe 10 minutes. We were told however that if we wanted something more \"cushy\", we could pay $10 a day. The pool water was a bit cold for my liking. Not pleasant. Also, way too many kids. We're recent \"empty nesters\" so the condo life is not our cup of tea. Now the good. If you have a family traveling with you, this could work for you. You can cook in the room and BBQ on the grounds. (Not sure why you would want to do that on vacation but I suppose that's why Baskin and Robbins has 31 flavors!) We really liked the room. It was very nicely furnished and the \"Heavenly Bed\" can't be beat. It was also nice to have a full sized fridge and a washer and dryer.

Certainly, February is the best time to go to Maui, as the Maui Channel is basically teaming with Humpback Whales. So much so that they could often be seen from the beach itself - but this is true ANYWHERE from Lahaina to Kapalua during this time of year. The portion of Kaanapali beach that fronts this property is probably the weakest aspect of this place, as it is rather narrow and in some places a bit sparse of sand. The section of Kaanapali somewhat further south, between the Sheraton and the Hyatt, is generally wider and has more and softer sand. But other than that, this is a beautiful place. The pools are quite beautiful and large, but right now, they tend to be quite crowded, as this resort is not fully built out yet. When it's done, there will be twice as many rooms, but 3 times as much pool. The rooms are quite plush and spacious. I tend to book a 1 bedroom studio, which is the smallest option, but for one person or a couple, it's HUGE, and the size of a typical small hotel suite, with a full kitchenette, spacious bath with separate shower and jacuzzi tub, and separate living/dining area. A two bedroom villa would be perfect for a family with kids. The hotel has a nice fitness center and game room as well. The dining options are basically typical poolside restaurants, but I generally ate either in my room using the kitchen (breakfasts), or at the nicer dining options in Lahaina or Kahana/Napili.

We've been to Maui a few times, but this is only our 2nd time we traded & wanted to try this place out. Westin is about 45 - 55 min fm the airport and on the beach. Our bldg had underground parking. We arrived early so they let us check in since our rooms were ready. There was 5 of us & it was perfect. This is the nicest trade timeshare(hotel) we've been to. We booked a 2 bdrm (which was a 1 rm villa + a studio w/seperate entry doors). The villa is a mster bdrm w/ a full kitchen, dining rm & living rm. The studio was basically a hotel rm w/ a mini kitchen. Both rooms had King size beds (VERY NICE), whirlpool tubs, walk in showers, etc. (Their website will tell you what it comes with). The rooms were very nice. We were in bldg 2, 6th floor. We had a partial ocean view & of the new additions (they are adding another part of this hotel). Construction was ongoing & we did see the crane that everyone talked about, but we rarely stayed in our rms except for dinners & sleeping. It wasn't disturbing to us at all? If you can, try to get a pool view, it's beautiful. The conceirge (Deidre) was very helpful. We ordered take out (we have a 3 yr old) from the Ocean Pool Bar & Grill & brought it to our rms. The prices were moderately comparable to other restaurants on the island, but everything we ordered was wonderful and convenient. We had Penne w/shrimp $27.50, the Prime Rib $ 21.95 was really good. They do have daily dinner specials. We cooked breakfast in our hotel room most mornings. Stop at the Costco or Safeway before you check into the hotel. It's easier and saves you money. They do have a small market, but it's pricey. The pool was nice. Our son had a good time in the kiddie pool. He forgot to wear his rubber swim shoes one day & he kept slipping so remember to pack those water shoes. The pool had a waterslide, every kid seemed to enjoy. Cabana's were rented out & the lounge chairs were not that hard to get in to. Towels had to be re-checked in or you would of been charged. They also had pool stuff for sale where towels are checked in. The beach was windy, but you can't control the tradewinds. It has really good reefs for snorkeling & it's just a 3/4 of a mile walk to snorkel at Black Rock, which is easier for beginners. We did see some turtles in both places. They do have daily activities like lei making & keiki's hula show. They have shuttle service to Hilo Hatties, Lahaina Cannery Mall & the Whaler's Village. They have a business center to print out your e-tickets for your flight the next day. They have a nice work out room. We used it to weigh our luggage to make sure it wasn't over the limit. =) Now since we were timeshare traders, they only did a mid-week towel replacement and trash pick up. Which was fine with us. They did not replenish anything else. No worries. Overall, the hotel was very nice and exceeded our expectations. It's probably one of the nicest we've been to. We will return next year!

We are owners at Westin Kierland in Scottsdale AZ and this was our first experience as Starwood owners and the Westin Villas did not disappoint! The resort is beautiful. The staff is very accomodating and the few times we dealt with the concierge staff we found them to be very professional and helpful as well. We stayed in a studio unit, which was more than enough room for myself and my husband. We were lucky enough to get a unit that had an acutal lanai/balcony vs one of the units with just a ledge or no acutal balcony you can go out on to enjoy the beautiful trade winds and ocean breezes. We didn't eat at the restaurant on the property so I can't comment on that. We chose to stock up on provisions at Safeway to cook at home most nights. Just a tip, when you are at Safeway, sign up at the service desk for a saver card and get discounts on any sale items the store is offering that week. It just takes a minute and you get your card right away. The stainless steel grills were spotless and well maintained although it was a bit disappoining not to be able to have an adult beverage while grilling out before dinner. But understand there is an ordinance that prohibits this. The pool area was nice but very crowded and we found it difficult to get a chair, much less one in the shade. The cabanas rent out quickly and I understand that you must make a reservation well in advance to secure one. The temp of the pool was a little chilly and the time frame we were there it was crowded with lots of children, but to be expected in summer months. The beach out front is a very nice and we heard the snorkeling was great although didn't get a chance to check it out. Tiki torches light the pathways at night and that was a great tropical touch. Little attention to detail is what really makes that resort. The general stor was very nice too, very well stocked, prices as you would expect for Hawaii and they had a nice deli/meat case with pre-marinated steaks, chicken etc ready for the grill. Prices weren't that bad. Note, if you want utensils for the grill get them at the general store and go early as they get checked out quickly. The studio was very comfortable with the signature heavenly bed that was just that, heavenly. The bathrooms are spacious for the size of this unit, with a jetted tub and a large shower also, double vanity etc. We spent at day driving upcountry and went to the Tedeschi Winery. Awesome drive and beautiful tranquil place. First time I ever experienced upcountry and the area around the winery and it was stunningly beautiful and peaceful. If you go, pace a picnic lunch to eat while at the winery and soak in the scenery or stop the the Ulapaulakua ranch store just across the street and sample an elk burger for lunch, excellent! The wine was great too, we picked out a mixed case to have it shipped home and are just finishing up the last of our wine just in time for our return trip to the Westin next month. WIll post another review upon our return. We took a sunset cruise on the Scotch Mist a 50 foot sailing yacht the last night of our trip, it was a thrill to experience an actual sailing yacht and the crew was great. I would recommend them highly, the night we went it was a small group, just myself and my husband and another couple so it was almost like a private cruise! They served champagne and chocolates and some interesting tales of sailing the waters in and around Maui. They also offer day snorkel cruises in addition to the sunset cruise. To sum it up, the Westin is wonderful, the experience is what you would expect from a Starwood property, top notch.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nor Cal", "Title": "\u201cA little Sterile\u201d", "Author": "AlohaTime", "ReviewID": "UR7407178", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin Villas in March.

Park your own car, the valet will browbeat you on arrival to let them do it. The parking is easily accessed by all the rooms and works out to be closer than going to the valet usually. The snorkeling is a little murky due to the shorebreak most of the time but has a very nice variety of fish and coral. Getting in and out can be rough. Whales were frequently sighted off-shore and many turtles right off the beach. There is a nice little park right beside the resort. Great for picnics. The bed was so soft it was hard to sleep. We travel a great deal and usually can tolerate the various feels, this was just way too soft. The staff was pleasant, particularly in the restaurant. The store was well stocked with essentials for cooking. The barbeques were clean and have lights attached - which is a nice touch. The rooms and resort interiors seemed rather sterile.

(She owns a timeshare here) We stayed on the 3rd floor (2315) 1 bedroom, and had a view of the pool area and the ocean. As stated by others, the kitchen had adequate amenities, the bath had a huge Jacuzzi tub and walk-in shower, and the bed was perfect. I wanted to sleep with all the windows and sliding door open, but my sister couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep with the waterfall noise and palm trees blowing. So we called Housekeeping the next morning and ordered a rollaway bed (I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do the couch bed) the rollaway was wonderful! Thick mattress, with nice sheets and blanket. Every morning we were able to just lift the bed on end and roll it near a corner, no problem. It would be nice if there were room on the balcony for a table with the chairs. (We improvised and took the luggage rack and placed the wooden service tray on it and used it as a table:) Someone mentioned the foliage was rather sparse. There were gardeners with flats of plants out most of the time we were there. The mangroves on the ocean side do look icky, but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they protected? Even though we had coffee available to brew in our room, I would go down in the morning a get a large coffee in the little market and my sister and I would take off on an ocean walk south. You kinda need to do a joggle around the Sheraton, but we picked the path up and continued to the Hyatt, which is the end of the road. We stopped and had the buffet breakfast at Swan Court and walked back to our place to continue our day. In the evening, we took a beach walk north and checked out the construction next door. (My sister has a week in the new building also) What will be great about the new buildings is they are in a V shape, so the ocean views will be much nicer. I believe one of the buildings will be open in July and the other in November. It looks like a kiddie pool is in the works with a little pirate ship at one end. I think the pool area and foliage will be very nice. The Concierge took care of all our restaurant and spa reservations. The business center offered free Internet and we made car reservations for Kauai and checked emails. No one was ever in there except for us. Housekeeping completely changed all our bedding and towels, trash and cleaned up mid-week. The little market has drinks, a bakery, fresh meats you can grill, sandwiches and a little bit of everything from souvenirs to drug store items. Every day out on the lanai, there would be several local artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selling their wares. We did not experience a lack of chairs available at the pool, but there is in fact a problem with people leaving towels on chairs and not returning for hours, sometimes all day. You need to sign for towels with your name and room number. I did not care for this. We got a call later that afternoon that someone used our room number and name similar to ours at the pool bar. I thought maybe someone saw our little pool towel slips and tried to forge? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. We had smoothies at the pool, which were ok, but did not contain fresh fruit as was touted. The coconut shrimp was good and the Lava Flow drinks were darn good! Some restaurant reviews: Mala Ocean Tavern in Lahaina. On the water with tiki torches and the sunset, awesome. They serve a guacamole type dip that is actually made with edamime. We had a lovely white wine similar to Pinot Grigio. Very laid back and full of locals. Hula Grill was ok. My Mahi was a bit dry, but the sunset and wine made up for it. David Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lahaina Grill: Out of this world. Expect to pay about $200 for two with wine. Elegant but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel stuffy. Splurge and have dinner at this establishment. Pineapple Grill at Kapalua: Took my sister here for her birthday. They have a nice wine list. The fish was jumping off the plate fresh. Not a great view (Tennis court and golf course) but it was evening and the atmosphere inside was pleasant. Plantation House, Kapalua: We had a nice lunch here. Fresh Mahi over salad with a silky tasting dressing. The restaurant sits up on a hill and the view was a lovely, plush golf course and you could see right to the ocean. A little annoying was birds flew in the open air windows (cardinals) and perched on chairs. If you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in motion, they would take it as an invitation to come snack on whatever was on your table. A fun place to eat up in Pa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ia is the Paia Fish Market. Just a little place on the corner with a menu board above. It is popular now, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to pay 8 bucks for the Mahi plate anymore.

All are first class - really interested in making your stay wonderful and memorable. As owners, we bought an ocean view so we have never stayed in a unit overlooking the construction site.

Kitchens are completely outfitted. Heavenly beds are...well, heavenly! The rooms are very soundproof, so we didn't hear noise from other units. The bathrooms are quite large (amazingly so in the 1 bedroom unit, and still very good size in the studio). We thought the drinks were a little high at the pool & bar, but the food was a good value and well prepared. Servings are large (their club sandwich could easily serve three people). Take advantage of the pool work-out or the yoga/pilates class. Very well done! There were some places in our 1 bedroom that weren't quite up to the cleaning standards we expect so we called housekeeping when we checked in on Sunday.

We are owners at the Westin Kierland in Scottsdale, and were able to use some of our StarOption points to book the WKORV as an add-on to our Hawaii vacation. The resort was just outstanding. The lobby entry (dimmed lighting showcasing the pool and ocean view through the far end) set the tone for a very high quality property. The internal courtyard with pool and waterslide was very nice and well maintained. Some of the pool decks are raised, providing better ocean views. The pool areas was on the crowded side, but there always seemed to be a few available chairs here and there. I will agree with previous posters that a non-owner will take some risk as to their unit view. Some units (about 10%?) overlook the back parking lot with Hwy 30 in the background. We were fortunate enough to get a room overlooking the pool area with the ocean in the distance, about halfway down the building on the 3rd floor. The pool was the perfect temperature. There did not seem to be much activity at the neighboring site to the north, so perhaps the major phase of construction has been completed. I would guess that ocean front would virtually impossible if not an OF owner. The balance of the units will vary as to views. For those concerned about the next door construction, there did not seem to be much activity /noise at the neighboring site to the north, so perhaps the major phase of construction has been completed or is on hold right now. I think there was still a crane on site so it may resume at some point. The rooms are quite soundproof. The snorkeling is supposed to be excellent here; however, a storm system that had come through earlier in the week made the swells too big to snorkel. We thought the food was good quality and \"reasonably\" priced for a top Kaanapali resort. As an economical option, there was an on-property hot dog cart selling a $6 combo for hot dog or sausage, lots of toppings as desired, chips, and a soft drink or bottled water. Generally, I think it's difficult to vacation in Hawaii on a tight budget, and it's far easier to simply pay the higher prices found everywhere and not compare pricing with establishments back home. The rooms had a feel more modern than Hawaii style, but were great quality. The bathroom in particular had a rich \"spa\" look. The washer and dryer were easy to use and were tucked out of the way in a closet behind the front door. Also, the resort is very accomodating to those with a later flight. There is a spacious late departure lounge with adjoining locker rooms. We used these to shower and change a few hours after checkout so we were able to enjoy the nice facilities and Hawaiian sunshine as long as possible. I wanted to briefly investigate the North villas info. (the adjoining property under construction) for future exchange possibilities. However, with so little time, I didn't check into the North property. And, my wife thought this property was so wonderful that she would rather return here.

Let me start by saying this resort is BEAUTIFUL. The staff is wonderful and the free amenities are amazing (wireless network - free parking - computer room). From everything we have heard from other travelers these type items are not free at the rest of the hotels/timeshares on Maui. Our first week was in a 1 bedroom (4307). The unit is nice and the kitchen is wonderfully done with all amenities you could possibly need. This unit has a nice view of the ocean. Our 2nd week we were moved next door to a studio unit. This unit is a bit small and a few warnings - the fridge is not a true fridge - no real freezer - this really an icebox and not a fridge (I wish I would have known this because we had TONS of food that did not fit in the mini fridge). There also is no oven in this unit. There are 2 burners which is nice. Excursions - Whale Watches - we did several whale watches (2 Pacific Whale Foundation tours and 1 Adventure Maui Whale Watch). The 2 Pacific Whale Foundations were AMAZING. I would highly suggest Pacific Whale - in fact I have a few more days on Maui and I am thinking of taking yet another whale watch with Pacific Whale. I will attach some pictures of these - we got close to the whales - I would say for about an hour or so there was a group of whales within 25 feet of our boat on one tour and the other tour we saw a breach and a competition pod with whales slapping thier tales - etc..... We also went on a raft with Adventure Maui but we did not really see anything on this tour - nothing special. HELICOPTER - Sunshine (Circle Island Tour). This was supposed to be a circle island tour West Maui - Haleakala - Hana. We only saw Haleakala - Hana and one waterfall right after take off. This tour was expensive ($275 each) and I would not recommend this tour. When we complained that we only saw part of the island they did not have much to say. Also if you are seated on the opposite side of the pilot you only really get a good view of the coastline - everyone else on the helicopter leans forward to see the stuff on the left side and if you are on the right all you see our heads - no real sites. I was extremely disappointed with this tour. DINNER SUNSET CRUISE - Spirit of Lahaina - ($89 each) - this tour was alright - but not what I was expecting. The food was VERY GOOD but I was hoping for a romantic sunset ride with dinner at individual tables and this is not was it was - It is a buffet dinner and you are seated in cafeteria style bench seats (six to a table). Once again the food was good. We only went out a bit on the ocean then parked the boat slightly off the shoreline and reamined at that spot for the 2 hours. Considering this was only $89 I was not terribly disappointed but it just was not what I was expecting. We have a Lanai snorkel tomorrow as well as golf over the next couple of days and I will post more after then.

My feelings were mixed before I went. Would the pool be cold? Would there be too much construction noise? Would it be the best trip I ever took? Well, suffice to say, I was not disappointed at all. After thinking about what I had read, I tried to put everything in perspective. Here goes: Yes, the pool is refreshing. When it's 85+ degrees, do you really want to swim in a pool that's 85 degrees? The irony is that the kiddie pool was the coolest but it was still nice. We had no trouble with getting chairs by the pool (people were not putting their towels down early). My advice-try not to travel there when they are at full occupancy. I could see it being a problem but it wasn't when we were there. The construction noise was hardly noticeable. I'm sure that was our timing and location. It wasn't a big deal at all. There was no pressure to go to a time share presentation. That's what happens when you pay full price. If you only paid $700 for this nice of a property, well then, you're going to have to give 2-3 hours of your time. In general, think about your vacation. We have 2 kids under 3 years old and this was great for us. I wanted a place where we could have the kids sleep while we were in another room watching tv or hanging out (hence why we chose the 1 bedroom apt style). I loved the kitchen. We were able to save money on our meals, control what we ate and give the kids the food/snacks that they liked. The kitchen was well stocked with kitchen items but not stocked with any food except coffee, decaf, tea, sugar and powdered creamer. I wish I had known that and I might have brought salt and pepper. I would also like to offer recommendations. You can shop at Safeway (south) or Star Market (north). If you have a car, you can easily get to these markets. If you don't have a car, use the shuttle. The store on the hotel premises is expensive and doesn't have as much variety. If you want some really good fish, go to this fish market. Head north. When you get to the turn where the Star Market is, take a left there. Stay on that road and then you'll see a small strip mall with a pizza hut and storage place. The fish market is in there and they will marinate and prepare your fish for you (just grill, pan fry or bake when you get back). Hubby says it was the best fish he had all week! If you stay on this road (I think it's Lower Honoapalani road), go a little further. On the right is a store called \"Farmers Market\" good for natural, healthy, organic foods. Great banana bread as well as guacamole. Also, on the way out of Kahului, there's a store called Down to Earth which has wonderful organic foods as well as bulk foods. They also have a nice salad bar and hot food bar. My takes on restaurants-I liked the Gazebo at the Napili Shores Resort (my husband was less impressed). The Hula Grill in Whalers Village was good (both of these offer good kids meals). Pacific' O in Lahaina was tasty but expensive. If you eat in the hotel, kids eat free (for every adult dinner). That's a good value! If you have a chance, check out the spa at the Westin hotel. Very nice and relaxing. I hope you found this review helpful!

They made it clear that they could not guarantee a view which we interpreted to mean we may get a mountain or garden view vs. a pool or ocean view, but nothing could have prepared us for what we have experienced so far. First, we are on the first floor with a view of the construction going on next door (upper floors are worse, not better). Construction starts at just before sunrise - we know because that's when the trucks pull in (just before 6:30 a.m.). Then the pounding and the racket begins. We have to keep our shades drawn for privacy (the workers are nice, they wave at you). When we took the problem to the manager, his response was that they put 99% of the people coming in on this package on this side of the villas (building #2, even number), and that there's nothing he can do. He referred us back to the Westin Call Center who booked us in. He did send us a bottle of wine to make up for it... whoopee. If you plan to come here, be very clear with them up front that being placed on the construction side is absolutely unacceptable, and if they can't guarantee that won't happen, don't come. This is a waste of our time, our money and their marketing dollars. The front desk even told us that this was a reason to buy into their timeshare - so we would be guaranteed not to get this bad of a room. If we do not go to the timeshare presentation, we will be charged full rate for the room. I was somewhat surprised at how aggressive the Call Center was prior to our coming here, particularly in light of it being a Westin. Now I understand why.

Check in was quick and easy and they had the one bedroom side ready for us at 1:00 PM. Although we didn't stay there that first night we checked in at got our keys. The foyer between the units is a complete waste of space and I had to buy door stops to keep the doors open between the units so my Mother in Law didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel unwelcome to come into the living room and kitchen located in the one bedroom side. The kitchen was a nice size but the refrigerator and freezer had a horrible smell so I went to the store and purchased 2 boxes of baking soda and put one in each location and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even touch the smell. The dining room table is too big for the space and the furniture placement wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best. The furniture was well used, very soft and needed to be replaced. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was not very Hawaiian and really could have been any Westin anywhere. It had more of a Southern California feel than a hawaiian feel. Having the washer/dryer unit behind the entrance door was a real pain if you wanted to keep the door to the unit opened. I had heard the washer/dryer was a complicated to operate European set however our unit had a whirlpool stackable set that was very simple to operate. The bathroom was huge and very nice and I loved the heavenly showerhead. The pocket door to the toilet area was extremely heavy and hard to close. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why they would use a solid core pocket door for a toilet area. We never used the very large jetted tub. The bedroom was a decent size but the heavenly bed was way too hard for both my husband and me. (This was a disappointment because we need a new bed and I was waiting to try the heavenly bed before buying a bed because everyone seems to love them). When I called housekeeping and asked for 2 egg crate mattress toppers they seem shocked I did not like the bed and asked me to check under the mattress to see if a board had been placed there for a previous guest. There was no board and they do not have any mattress toppers for the heavenly beds so we made due with the mattress toppers they provide for the sofa beds. The studio side was very nice and I really liked the mini kitchen set up. I thought they did a very good job getting everything you would need into a small space, mini refrigerator, dishwasher, sink, microwave, smooth top 2 burner cook top, toaster, blender, coffeemaker dishes and utensils. The studio side would be just fine for a couple or small family. The only negative to the studio was no balcony. The grounds were nice and the resort is set back from a beautiful beach with excellent snorkeling. The resort is set back further from the ocean than I expected and I missed not being able to hear the ocean when out by the pool. The pool slide was a big hit but the pool seemed too small for the resort especially when they were using part of it for water aerobics classes. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine how busy the pool area must be during the busy Holiday and summer seasons. The pool temperature did not seem too cold for us. It felt cool (refreshing) when you first got in but in a couple of seconds it was just fine. If you wanted an umbrella you needed to find one by 7:00 AM and the pool shack does not open until 8:00 AM. At the end of the day we would get fresh pool towels and take them up to our room to use for the next morning and that worked out fine. One morning around 7 a woman placed towels and books on lounge chairs under an umbrella and did not return until 11:30! At about 10 I mentioned this to the pool staff and they said there is nothing they can do since they also have personal items on them, although there is a notice at the pool shack stating chairs cannot be held for more than an hour. The wait staff at the restaurant and pool were extremely nice and I cannot say enough kind things about them. They worked very hard and always had a smile on their face. The food at the pool side restaurant was good although we never ate dinner there, breakfast (off the menu) and lunch (usually by the pool) was just fine and we were always satisfied. We were not on the construction side and never heard any construcion noise so it was not an issue for us. All in all it is a very nice resort but offers nothing that I would say is exceptional for the price you have to pay to own at this resort or to rent from an owner or directly from Westin except that the units are spacious and unless it was a super great deal or free (which it never will be) we would not return to this resort.

All you see is water from every place in the villa, including the shower and tub. We know we always want an ocean front view so we purchased an ocean front unit. Apparently there will be many more ocean front units in the new phase that is currently under construction. I also read some reviews online that complained about the garbage removal. We called the front desk and asked about what to do with our garbage and they told us to have it sitting outside in the morning before 8:00 a.m. and they would collect it from outside our door and leave us a new bag. No problem with that. The staff at the resort was friendly and helpful. We were there during the earthquake and there were no problems. They had generators on quickly with lights in hallways, etc. We were told that the building codes on the new buildings in Hawaii are more restrictive than California in regard to earthquakes. Although this earthquake was very strong and we felt it roll for what seemed like a very long time, the building never creaked. No cracks, chipping,etc. We were happy to be in a relatively new building; something we had never thought about prior to this trip. The grounds are beautiful, the beach is awesome and the ocean water temp. was perfect. We used the BBQs 3 times during our stay and they were always clean and in working order. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed in this resort. It has everything you could want on a Maui vacation. For those who are unhappy with the rooms, views, pool temp., patios, some spots on the carpet, etc., simply go down a mile to one of the Ka'anapali hotels and rent a hotel room with an ocean view and see what it costs you for a room with only a bed and a bathroom. And those hotels are showing their age. No matter how you look at it, the Westin Ka'anapali Resort Villas are a bargain on Ka'anapali Beach, and a luxury slice of paradise.

The visit included some family friends (two adults and two small children) and myself (single adult). We had a 2 bedroom deluxe island view unit on a corner. The resort is easy to get to from OGG and looks beautiful upon arrival. The wonderful weather and blue oceans made the open-air lobby very inviting. Check-in was fast. I asked if an OV was available, just in case, but unfortunately there wasn't one. However, we were very lucky and pleased to get the best IV unit at the resort: top floor facing the lobby building, pool and ocean. I couldn't believe this was an IV unit! The rooms was standard Westin: huge Heavenly beds, jacuzzi tubs in both bathrooms, granite counters, tons of amenities, Internet, etc. I can't think of anything that was missing. I let my guests take over the main 1 bedroom unit while I took the lockoff. The keyed entry leading to our separate doors was perfect; we could keep them closed for privacy or open them up when we wanted to connect. With the doors shut, I couldn't hear much noise coming from their unit. I ended up using the mini-kitchen quite a bit. There was plenty of room and I felt absolutely relaxed throughout the week. My friends thought the pool temp was on the cool side, but otherwise no complaints. They attended one of the movies and participated in a couple other activities. The general store has just about everything you could need. Room service was on the weak side (limited menu), but you can order from the grill and pick it up, which I did the first night. Service was generally good, no issues there. I went to the spa at the hotel on the last day. Service was also good but not necessarily memorable. Allow 30 min if taking the shuttle; it took 15 min just to arrive at the villas, but the ride itself was fairly quick. The concierge was excellent; they staff several desks throughout the property and are available for extended hours. There's a lot of construction going on now, but we were far enough on the south side not to hear much of it. Avoid the north building if you can. Other than that, there's not much negative than I can say about the stay.

Don't be put off by the bad reviews on this site, you will love it. 1. rooms- We had a garden view and it was very nice and quiet. The beds are wonderful and the housekeeping is great. Our friends stayed on the top floor (floor 11) and I noticed they were in the process of renovating this floor so carpets were newer and stuff. Not like the matters though, the other floors are in good enough shape too. They did say they heard the elevator and a little bit of construction on their floor. We stayed on the second floor and it was nice and quiet. 2. pool- is gorgeous and a great temperature. There is a fun waterslide there too. There are plenty of lounges so we never had a hard time getting one. My one complaint would be they need more umbrellas to shade the lounges by the pool. People get up at the crack of dawn and put their towels on these chairs and then leave so they are hard to get. These people are total jerks but I have been on vacation at a lot of different places and unfortunately they are everywhere so it is not unique to this resort. I guess some guests are so type A that they can't just relax and be fair about it. Nonetheless, you will still be able to get a lounge chair. This is a very kid-friendly hotel but they do have an adult only pool. 3. the beach. gorgeous, one the the nicest . The water is warm and clear. A bit steep, not much of a wading area. 4.location- great! 5 minutes from the town of Lahaina, right next to Whaler's village with great shops and restaurants. You can't ask for a better location.

We stayed for two weeks at the Two-bedroom Ocean Front Deluxe Lock-off Villa (1 week in studio, 1 week in 1-bedroom, total 1750 square feet), which are corner units with awesome views of the beach and ocean from our rooms and lanais. Both units are new and gorgeous with minimalist designs and comfortable furnishings. Beds and baths were heavenly! The kitchen in the studio was small but had all the conveniences of a microwave/convection oven, sink, refrigerator and stove. The kitchen in the 1 bedroom was truly a full-size kitchen with so much counter space that you can spread all your groceries on the counter without having to store them anywhere. We traveled here with two young kids so having kitchens made it much more comfortable than staying in a hotel room. We cooked breakfast and lunch there very often. Not only were the accommodations wonderful, the beach is beautiful and has snorkeling a few feet from the sand. Black Rock was just a short walk south, where there were many green turtles. Food at the resort was good, not exceptional. Try the spicy chicken wings. There's a general store in-house that also sells all kinds of essential items at reasonable Hawaiin prices. You can also order marinated meats to grill at the poolside barbecue areas. The pool area was wonderful for the kids and for suntanning. Westin is building a sister resort next door that includes 3 pools, including a kids-club area that should be awesome. I hope we will be able to use them as well. (By the way, the construction noise was minimal. We stayed in building 2 near the construction site and couldn't hear any.) The location is terrific as we felt that we were away from the hustle and bustle south of Black Rock at the Whaler's Village area, but are only 5 minutes from them with a complimentary shuttle ride. One thing to point out is most of the non ocean-front rooms (ocean view rooms) do not have spectacular views. If you come hear and book an ocean view room and expect a great view, you may be disappointed, since the buildings are perpendicular to the beach and you may be stuck at the back of the building. Also, the lanais of the studios are almost non-existent. Furthermore, a few of the staff at the resort (especially at the Pool Bar area) should be more trained to be more knowledgeable and service-friendly. I can't wait to come back next year when everything near the resort is more developed, and enjoy watching the whales from the lanais with my pina coladas.", "Date": "October 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cAnother quality Westin stay guaranteed\u201d", "Author": "rkuchel", "ReviewID": "UR5895168", "Content": "Great rooms, friendly staff in the midst of beautiful Maui.

I have been reading reviews on here for over 6 months, and I have to admit, I was a little concerned about going. We actually bought a week from a timeshare owner (via ebay) that was not able to use their week (or they just wanted to make some money?). We got a great deal, no where near the listing price on the website of 350-400/night. I called back in February requesting a building on the other side of the construction, as well as an Ocean View room. (Neither were guaranteed) When we landed there was a 2 hr delay getting our car rental, so we weren't going to arrive at the resort until 8pm. I was sure by then that we would be facing the construction, plus not being an actual owner....I was prepared for it. I called to let them know we were going to be late and they were very courteous on the phone. To my delight when we arrived, we had building 5 with an Ocean View. I've heard people complain that you have to strain your neck and look down the side of the hotel to see the Ocean, but we had no problem with our view at all. We could stand on our Lanai, overlooking the pool, and see plenty of the Ocean. I think all the rooms that face the pool would have a similar view, which i thought was great. The room was clean, Westin quality stuff. (nice) The construction....was not an issue at all. We were staying on the other side, but I work in construction industry so I was intrigued and I stopped by to gaze at their current work, and it was never overly loud with 'jackhammers' or anything. Even if we were facing it, I dont believe that it would have been as big of an issue as people have made it out to be. The pool- There were more hesitations here when so many people said the pool was cold. The pool was maybe cold if you sat in your air conditioned room all day, then jumped in the pool in the shade and stood still. The pool was very refreshing, albeit cool. Neither my wife or I are big swimmers but just playing around in the pool, we were very comfortable. I wouldn't want the pool any warmer, it wouldn't be refreshing. We ate once at the restaurant/bar and it was fair. Expensive as expected and really just convenient. I would only eat there again out of convenience. What received high marks in my book were the grills. Beautiful stainless steel gas grills, that were kept very clean. There must ahve been a dozen or so. We grilled a few times. Either buy stuff from the general store at the Westin (that seemed actually reasonable) or at the Safeway/Walmart, etc. They give you the utensils for free to use, and each morning they cleaned the grills. Our second to last night we grilled and ate at the tables and watched the sunset. It was wonderful. We didn't have any problems with the staff. In fact, our toilet got clogged and I requested a plunger, and they actually sent a guy to do it. I offered to do it, (as it is embarassing) but he said its his job and he had it flushing again in no time! We did have 2 voicemails on our phone about timeshare interviews, but we were never hasseled or anythign to go. We never returned teh calls, but the people I did see that were walking around the resort during the interviews, didn't seem to be pressured or anything. There did appear to be some people on their honeymoons, but I woudl say the majority of the people their were families. I guess this should be expected in part if you're staying at a place that has multiple rooms/suites and full kitchens. We didn't have any issues sharing the pool with kids. We didn't have any problem surprisingly with parking. We were able to park every day/night in the garage below ground. There was one night when we returned it was rather crowded and we had to park on the far end of the garage, but for the amount of cars/people there I was pleasantly surprised that we never had to park in the lot....but if we had, I can't see why that would be a big deal. The tennis courts looked nice, which had a basketball hoop which we shot around on for an hour one day. Nothing really special, but a nice amenity for those who play. We loved the resort. I don't think I would have paid 'full price' of 350-400/night, but I dont think I'd pay that for anywhere. I would have paid 250-300 a night though. Overall we were very pleased. A few things you should do: 1. Buy Maui Revealed. Everyone has it, and it's unbelievably helpful. Even some residents we ran into had it just to help them get around that had been living there for 8 years! 2. Take the drive to Hana and use Maui Revealed. The bamboo forests were amazing, truly like something out of Hollywood. The 4 waterfalls (I forget the name) where he says most people only go to the first two and stop. Go there. Youcould even go with kids. We stayed in Hana one night, and would definitely do it again. 3. Mama's fish house- Don't go with kids. Its expensive, very expensive, but some of the best food we've ever had, and teh atmosphere could not be drawn up any better for a romantic evening at the beach. We spent a lot of money here, but the waiter, the food, that atmosphere, was all top notch.

We purchased in 2003 before it opened when staying at the Sheraton Maui (best resort on Kaanapali beach). We video taped the presentation and the test room since some family back home was interested in purchasing. Well a few things that were told to us on tape were not the case when we first stayed there in 2005. Some of those things were that we would always be in building 2 (the first one open) and that the parking under the buildings would be for owners only. Well when we checked in August 2005 we were put in building 4 that does not even face the same direction as the two along the beach. We were looking at a parking lot from the 2nd floor with our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd way in the distance. After complaining we were moved to building 2 the next day but not until 5:00 (wasted one whole day with no room to be in). There were some other issues last year but it was mainly because they tried to open the 2 last buildings at once without increasing the staff. Well this year we were put in building 3 just above the pool restaurant. Not the best view of the beach but not the parking lot. Service was good and the resort was in great shape. The food at the pool side restaurant was better than many of our favorites on the island. Lobster at Hula Grill (awesome place) was 8 oz for $38. Lobster at the Westin Villas was 10 oz. for $28. Parking was not as bad as I remembered last year but maybe it was the times I was trying to park. The reports of the pool being cold are no where near the truth. We were at the Sheraton and Westin Hotel before checking into the Villas and it was the same temp and equal to the ocean which they said was unusually warm (reported 80 degrees). Even the little kids we had with us did not react to the water temp when put in the big side of the pool. Some problems we encountered were the abuse of people going down early and leaving stuff or towels on all the chairs with shade but not showing up until the late afternoon if at all. One morning we went down at 7:30 AM and there was not a chair without a towel under an umbrella and we have little ones that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just sit in the sun all day. That same day I hardly saw one of those lounges occupied. They need to do what the Westin Hotel does and have signs that tell them that if towels on lounges are left unoccupied for more than 30 minutes they will be removed. Also the rental of the cabanas or gazebos is run by an outside company. Not only are there too few for that size resort but they let people call and book as far out as they want. Lets just say not only were they booked for this entire summer but next summer is almost completely booked. We hardly saw them used even though someone booked them. The Westin said they only way that will change is if enough owners complain about the outside service. Another issue I had was the two newer buildings had slightly different things that what we had in the original building. For one the refrigerator in the studio is half the size of the original room design. Also the chairs on the balcony are not the lounges that were in the original building. You would think they would keep it the same. Now this location is perfect and the snorkeling right at the beach was even better than a snorkel cruise we took. Save your money and snorkel at the resort. Also there are plans to expand the resort with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153North\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd addition. This will add more pools (kiddy, family, and adult) as well as two restaurants. There is no construction allowed next to the new part of the resort (it is a greenbelt) but beyond that is a new village style shopping and restaurants going in from the same designers as Whistlers village. They are trying to make this a better version of Kaanapali south with Whalers Village. Because of what this area is going to become as soon as 2008 we sold back our every year Ocean View full double lockoff unit and paid the difference to get an Ocean Front in the North addition. One reason was to have an Ocean Front and not worry about where we will be put in the existing resort (parking lot, or next to an air conditioner or looking at the building next to you). The other reason was to be close to all the new amenities. The original resort was designed by another company and they could not afford to finish so Westin bought it but could not change anything. The new resort is all Westin designed. The rooms are similar but with better used spaces and the studio side now has a balcony you can sit out on as well as the one bedroom having a full table on the balcony to sit at and eat. We have visited other villas and nothing compares to the Westin room and now the location will be hard to beat once everything is done. We were ready to sell after last year but things are getting better and the new North Villas should remove the last few worries we had.", "Date": "August 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cMust go!!!\u201d", "Author": "30yr-old.traveler", "ReviewID": "UR5543175", "Content": "We stayed here after having a bad experience at the Ritz in Kapalua.

Had read some mixed reviews but mostly positive ones. I guess the main complaint people had was the construction noise of the new phase. We had a one bedroom lock-off villa which is actually a one bedroom unit and a studio unit. Each has a separate entrance but a common foyer. It was in Building 4 and nowhere near the construction. We did not have any construction noise. Parking is free and easily accesible from all buildings. Each building has a concierge in each lobby which is also nice. The units were both spacious, extremely clean and beautifully furnished. The staff couldn't have been nicer and the service was superb. We had a couple of things like a burned out light in the bathroom and one t.v. in the bedroom that had bad color and engineering was there 5 minutes from my call to fix the problems. The beach was beautiful with snorkeling right in front of the hotel. We had 2 kids and they loved the pool and the pool slide. The pool was perfect temperature - some complained it was cold! This was not the case. Having a condo with all the amenties of a hotel was fabulous. The on property restaurant was average priced for a hotel restaurant and kids eat free for breakfast and dinner.

They also have barbeques which people utilized nightly and eating areas right next to the barbeques. You can buy prepared meals to cook - pricey but very convenient. Actually the markets are so expensive there - the price is worth the convenience. The only downside was that we had an island view room which looked back at the highway. It was noisy on the balcony - but we were rarely in the room and the grounds are so gorgeous that we enjoyed our evenings out by the pool with all the tiki torches. We were really pampered here - the concierge called me on my cell phone a week prior to my arrival to welcome me and ask if I had any questions and if wanted any assistance in booking daytrips.

The pluses are beachfront with ocean views, a cool minimalist design, well appointed suites (all with kitchens, DVD/CD players, bose stereo, washer/dryer), luxurious bathrooms, great clientele (this is not party central), friendly non-obtrusive staff, a small but functional gym, a concierge who can refer you to restaurants and activities, and free shuttle service to the mall (Whaler's Village) for your teenagers. It's not uncommon to see 3 generations travelling together. There is a really nice poolside bar with TVs. People say the pool is chilly, but I didn't find that at all. If you'd like, you can rent you own poolside cabana. The studio suites are an enormous value compared to smaller, older hotel rooms in Kaanapali that don't have kitchens or washer/dryers. Westin keeps this place IMMACULATE, as they should because they are successfully selling interval ownership units (timeshares) in this resort and its Phase II next door, which is 80% completed. We attended their timeshare presentation, which was professional and informative, without any hard-sell guilt trips. If you're in the market for an interval ownership, Westin is a great operator. What's the downside? If you're not paying top dollar, you may only have a sliver of an ocean view, or be looking across the way into another building or into the parking lot, but that's only fair. Freebie upgrades to the best units went out with the 1990's. Currently, you're not within walking distance of shops and restaurants.

There are plans to add more shops and restaurants within walking distance, along with the Phase II Westin Villas and an adjacent condo project. Finally, traffic has become more of an issue in West Maui, but is bearable. If you buy here or stay here, I strongly recommend getting out to see other parts of Maui. We toured the volcano in the afternoon and it was great (have breakfast at the Kula Lodge on the way up). Swimming with fish and seeing an occasional sea turtle is something I'll never get tired of (we snorkeled). If you can, spend a night or two in Hana (the hotel Hana-Maui is very romantic and has a nice spa). It's a scenic drive and it's really like visiting another island (have breakfast in the town of Paia and check out the stores on Baldwin Ave.). Stop along the way to check out some of the funky places on the road to Hana. Go to the 7 sacred pools at the state park and the other beaches in Hana, or go horseback riding. Another good excursion is Makena beach in Wailea or the Winery near Wailea; bring a book, a cooler, and have a picnic lunch--heaven.

We are owners at the Sheraton Vistana Villages in Florida and switched out to this one. We stayed in a two bedroom ocean view lockoff in building 3, 6th floor. Our villa faced the park, parking lot and had a partial view of the ocean. I'll address two recurrent issues in postings: THE VIEW: Contrary to the many irritated reveiwers on the site, I did not have any problems with my view and enjoyed spending time on the balcony in the evening. CONSTRUCTION: I was not on the construction side. Therefore I would not have been able to tell construction was going on had I not seen the crane when driving up to the property. I think both of these issues are VERY overblown unless you are on the construction side. POSITIVES: * Wonderful rooms typical of the Westin. Spacious, minimalist Westin decor, Westin beds. * Beautiful!!! ocean view from the pool, lobby and restaurant area * Easy access to the beach * Shuttle to other Starwood hotels and to shopping in Whaler's Village * Responsive concierges helped with activites and dining options. * Clean towels quickly provided. NEGATIVES: * Yes, the pool is COLD. I can't understand why when it was 88 degrees. My kids only went in a few of the days. * Food at the restaurant was terrible!!!!!! The breakfast buffet was the worst. * Check out is at 10:00am. They have a late stay lounge (which is nice) with lockers and a shower room which was DISGUSTING by the time we wanted to use it at 4:00pm. Wet towels all over the floor. No washcloths. No soap/shampoo. ICK! HANDICAPPED ISSUES * Housekeeping had a shower chair for my mom to use in the shower. * Villas are close to the pool / restaruant area which helped since my mom is partially handicapped and can't walk long distances * Westin's wheelchair is old and rickety. Order one in ADVANCE from a vendor - the places they referred us to were booked up OTHER * BUY FOOD AND COOK IN THE VILLAS!!! Most of our dining out dinners were so-so yet cost $300 for the five of us. There are nice grills on property * Rent and reserve a shaded cabana IN ADVANCE for your check out day. That gives you a place to hang out once you leave your villa. * Go to dinner at the Heile Meili General Store. PHENOMINAL. Overall I enjoyed my week but probably won't go back to Maui.

For the months preceeding our visit, I was looking at the trip advisor reviews for the Westin. I was shocked that a Westin was getting such average reviews. I've stayed at Westins before and was always very satisfied with how nice the hotel was. Anyway, read lots of people complaining about the construction, hotel staff, pool temperature, wind, etc. My main concern was the construction. Once I checked in I realized we weren't facing the construction and was relieved. If you had a room facing the construction, I imagine it would be a big letdown. The room we ended up with was an oceanview - facing the ocean with a parking lot inbetween. A lot of reviewers seem to think oceanview is similar to oceanfront for some reason. Regardless, the oceanview was great, lots of beautiful trees, good balcony, parking lot was hardly noticeable. I heard the construction once or twice the entire week and that was while on the beach. The construction was not a problem for us. The actual hotel room deserves 6 stars. We had a one-bedroom villa and it was huge! Gigantic bathtub with jets that can open up to the bedroom (you can watch tv from the tub even). Bed was extremely comfortable, room had washer and dryer, everything was clean. Better room than the Four Seasons. It was nice to be able to eat-in and use the grills on site once in awhile too. The location of the hotel is perfect. Easy to drive to Lahaina. Star Market and Safeway are both close by (I found Star Markets a better option). Plenty of restaurants nearby. I heard in advance the hotel restaurant was bad so I didn't bother. The beach is wonderful. Yes, there are rocks and coral everywhere so it's perfect for snorkeling. You can just step out and dive in and look on tons of great fish. Didn't see the advantage of walking down to Black Rock to snorkel, had better luck right outside the hotel. Go to Snorkel Bobs in Lahaina and get the cheap snorkel gear for $9/week, it works fine. No need for beach chairs, you can find plenty of spots to lay down on the beach and there is shade for trees that you can find if you need it. At the pool there are plenty of spots to layout and, if you are diligent, it isn't too hard to find chairs that are shaded. The pool was a little cold but not too bad. Very pretty pool and quite big, not very busy with people. Some kids but nothing that bothered a couple honeymooners. Hot tubs by pool were nice and rarely occupied. Overall, I was very satisfied with the beach/pool. It gets a little windy in the afternoons at the Westin, but it's nothing that should ruin your day. The hotel staff was nice from my experience. I'm not incredibly demanding so I had little contact with them. Didn't even look for workout room, got enough of a workout swimming and walking up and down the beach. No problems with timeshare people. Basically no problems at all. If you are looking for a great location, great room, great beach/pool, you won't be disappointed. As I said earlier, we stayed at the Four Seasons after the Westin, and I by the end of the trip, I think I liked the Westin Villas more than the Four Seasons. Even if you get a room facing the construction, I think the Westin VIllas would be worth your time. In closing, I have the feeling that most of the negative/average reviews are from very picky people. This is a wonderful hotel, I recommend it highly.", "Date": "June 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat 2nd time experience\u201d", "Author": "oc4", "ReviewID": "UR5236912", "Content": "We stayed in a Deluxe Ocean View One Bedroom Suite as we did last year. Both times we paid a lot ($400-500 per night) but both times we weren't disappointed. We got the view we expected (ocean and pool) and tons of space. People who go at the super low special rates are of course going to get a construction and/or parking lot view. This year the construction is almost unnoticeable. It is hidden to the far side of the hotel which you never see unless you were driving up toward Kapalua. No noise and no problems. Love the Heavenly beds (no icky bedspreads) and the shower is fantastic too. If you are going to stay in a suite in Maui at a nice/luxury hotel you are looking at $700/night so I really prefer to stay at the Westin villas. You also get the benefit of the full kitchen and washer/dryer which is essential with kids. You can probably get a better deal on a condo but if you want to stay at a nice hotel with kids I highly recommend the Westin Villas. Yeah the pool was kind of cold but as the summer warms up I am sure it won't be a problem. Great snorkeling at the beach and love the proximity. Maid service is spotty but we just gave the front desk a call and they came the one day they forgot. I wouldn't necessarily recommend the hotel for honeymooners or 20 somethings (not much of a social scene) but again great for young families. Not too many kids or people at the pool - not hard to get a nice lounge chair (they have the nice padded wooden ones) and you can sit by the umbrellas if you get to the pool by 9am or so. I still think it's worth the money - I have stayed in a regular room at the Hyatt which is like $400 and the Westin suites are easily triple the size.

This time of year seemed very good as the weather was great and the water was warm enough to swim (~78 degrees). One of the added benefits is that they are linked to the Sheraton and Westin one street up in Ka'anapali. To set expectations, there is not much as far as activity at the Westin Villas and the pool area is kind of bland (comparatively). The beach is often too windy and there is a lot of coral in the water (even at the beach edge), so if the water is rough, you may get cut up. The restaurant at the hotel is not good (avoid). One more comment, if you will be hung up about whether there is a parking lot between you and your Ocean View or if you have to look right to see the ocen in your ocean view room, you will not like it. We had Ocean View and had a parking lot between us and the ocean, we lt it go as we were on vacation and would be out at the ocean. Like I said, though, there is a FREE shuttle that runs every 10-15minutes all day and night long between the Westin Villas and the Sheraton/Westin Maui. At the Sheraton is Black Rock which has some great snorkeling and a jump off point at the top of the rocks. The pool area is wonderful at the Sheraton. You can charge anything at the Sheraton and Westin back to your room at the Westin Villas. We rented boogie boards, went snorkeling, lounged in the river-like pool, had drinks at the pool bar. You can also get your towels from the Sheraton. There are also plenty of really nice restaurants in Ka'anapali, Kapalua, and Lahaina to eat instead of the Westin Villas restaurants and we bought groceries from Safeway for breakfast and some lunches. It is not a money thing, you will prefer to eat chicken nuggets from the freezer section that eat the food at the hotel. Some nice restaurants are: Plantation House (Kapalua), Vino Italian Tapas (Kapalua Golf Course), Longhis (Lahaina), and you must do either the Old Lahaina Luau or the Feast at Lele (includes fire dance).

While I am glad that I made the decision to stay there, I am not convinced that I would go back. We got great value. If I was paying $300+ per night, I would NOT feel that way. First the negtives: We were fortunate enough to stay at this resort at the Friends and Family rate of $125 per night. We knew that this would mean we would get the worst room in the hotel, and Iwe were not disappointed. Our first-floor construction view room gave us the sights and sounds of the next phase of construction 6 days a week from 7am on... and even when there was no construction happening, we could not open the sliding glass doors because the air conditioning unit for what seemed like the entire building was right outside the doors. There was no lanai in our room, but fresh air might have been nice. While we got what we expected in terms of a room, it seemed like we might have been the only ones. Every time I was at the front desk, I was next to someone who was unhappy about their room. It appears that everyone was on owner who reserved an ocean view room a year ago and is now stuck inthe back of some building and they want to be moved. Now. It's no wonder the front desk people were cranky - and they were. Housekeeping - They have different schedules for owners versus nightly folks. We got no housekeeping the first day because we were incorrectly identified as owners. Housekeeping also seems to come VERY late in the day, and there is no opportunity to ask for early service by way of a door-hanger like you can at many places. Out of 5 days, we had no husekeepingthe first day and turned it down another day because they came as we were getting just getting back to the room to shower for dinner. Gym - Very high windows, no view although it FACES THE OCEAN - seems like a wate of the view to me, and it felt like a prison. Beach chairs - It was $39 per day for 2 beach chair rentals. Why? Timeshare sales - Very pushy about signing up for the presentation, which we never did. Check-In/Check-Out - Check in at 4pm, check out at 10 am. They mean this. Now the positives: The room was wonderful. Spacious, comfortable, loved the full kitchen! We went the grocery store and stocked up on breakfast items and also had a few lunches inside - beasts the $11 from the pool bar for a veggie wrap! Very comfortable bed. Beautiful property. Loved the grills and the outdoor tables for eating. Never ate at the hotel restaurant, so can't address othres concerns in this area. Nice location. Convenient to get to Lahaina, but not as crowded as Kaanapali 'proper'. Pool - Temperature was comfortable - but then again, it was nice warm weather that first week in May, so the pool was refreshing! Value - We had a smoking rate. That made a lot of the negative stuff easier to swallow. In closing, if you get a great deal (I saw someone say they paid $600 for 6 nights bplus a rental car credit) in my opinion this would be a great place to stay.

This was my second stay at the resort and am ready to go back. The first thing I would like to coment upon is the wind. First of all the Westin is not responsible for the wind. For those of you who do not get to Maui that often, let me tell you, during this time of the year, it is always windy here. The Wailea side is calm. During the months around Septemper the Trade Winds change and it is calm and hot at the Westin KOR. So if you do not like the wind do not go during the months it is windy! The other comment I would like to address is the pool being cold. I was at the resort during Easter weekend and the pool temp was great! The only problem I had was with all the kids. But what do you expect at Easter time! The only complaint I have of the Westin, is that the Jacuzzi specifically states children under 14 are not allowed. However, this was not enforced. At any given time there was between 10 & 15 unsupervised kids in the Jacuzzi, leaving no room for us adults. At one point, I even counted 22. That's right 22! While I don't mind a few supervised kids in there, this was out of control. I beleive it was especially bad since our room was above the Jacuzzi and could hear the kids all day and night. I decided to resolve this problem by selling back my ocean view room and as of next year, will have an ocean front room at the resort next door. Everything else went great. The staff was wonderful as was the service. We had a small maintanence problem that was quickly delt with. The food at the resort, is good but not great. However, you can not beat the fact it is so convienant. Having the little store and market is a plus as well. We took the shuttle to the Sheraton and snorkeled at Black Rock and then had breakfast there. This was the best breakfast buffet I have ever had! Later we took the shuttle to the Westin, or actually to Whaler's Village for some shopping and dinner at Leilanie's. This was very good and much less expensive than the hotel food.

The big fluffy robes where a hit with the kids, and housekeeping brought us all the extra towels we needed. I have read the prior recent reviews and I agree that the pool was way too cold. We were told that it was not being heated due to the island-wide propane shortage, however, I question the veracity of this story. Notwithstanding the cold termperature, however, my son spent hours in the pool, and the ocean water was warm, so the temperature of the pool did not affect my review as much as it apparantly did others. Snorkeling at the beach at the resort was fantastic, better in fact than some of the snorkel trips that you might pay for (which we did as well). We saw hundreds of fish, as well as turtles and an octopus within 40 yards of the beach at the resort. My kids also took the resort scuba class and went on their first dive at the beach at the resort (I am a certified diver and went along with them). We found the staff at the resort to be very courteous, even if the concierge did get the time wrong on several dinner reservations and always asked if we wanted a tour of the new units being constructed (read - timeshare sales pitch). The poolside restaurant served tasty food for both the kids and the adults. There was also poolside service of food and drinks. In sum, I would highly recommend the Villas for families with children. During our stay, there were lots of kids playing on the grounds, and my son made at least one friend with whom he spent time playing on the grounds and in the pool. The resort is new and beautifully maintained inside and out. Parking is free and is plentiful. I would probably not recommend the Villas to newly-weds or couples without children who are looking for a more quiet, exotic Hawaiian experience. For them, I recommend South Maui which is certainly quieter and more upscale.", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redwood City", "Title": "\u201cAverage resort, hard to get a room with ocean view.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4983797", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin Villa during Spring Break after we received an invitation to stay for a promotional rate which included credit towards food and car rental.

We kept running into owners who complained so much about how hard it was for them to get a reservation (many of them made it one year in advance), as well as not getting what was promised by the sales people. I can understand their frustration; I would be upset if after having paid so much money (probably between $40k-$100k) I need to call every month, every week, or even every day to reserve ocean view, something that was promised to you anyway when you purchased the property. Honestly I think the management oversold the units; every day I see tons of people from the other Westin resort and Sheraton coming to \"preview\" the property and pressured by the sales people to purchase their new units. We were also pressured to go to the sales presentation however we never returned their phone calls after hearing all the comments from the current owners.

Having made reservations 9 months before my arrival in a one bedroom premium deluxe suite, I was shocked when I opened the door to my brand new beautifully decorated unit. The large balcony in the livingroom and bedroom directly faced an enormous construction crane and work site with a slight ocean view. Although I could detect the ocean, I faced the construction crane on the fifth floor. I was devasted and immediately left the unit to request a room change. There was no way I could sit on my balcony with that view. Prior to arriving at the Westin, I contacted reservations about 4 or 5 times to ensure that I would have a pool and ocean view. I was told that they had my request for a 6th floor unit facing the pool and ocean. Management was not willing to change my unit, as they were filled to occupancy as I was told. I was also told that since I booked late for owners, there was some first come first choice policy I was subject to. I was absolutely furious and demanded a change of units. Having traveled over ten hours by air, and paying more than a luxury car for my vacation ownership, I expected to be pleased by my view, not sickened by it. I threatened all sorts of actions, because I felt I had been subject to fraud and deception. I demanded that the daily renters be given those units, not the owners; who had invested a lot more than weekly rates. Actually no one should have had to face the construction site, unless they wanted to, at a discount rate. I can't even imagine what the noise was like. I was not told that I would be able to move or be accommodated that day. I felt that this was the worst mistake in my entire life. In my lifetime of travel, I had never experienced a situation like this. Management was so insensitive. The next day, several units became available with better locations. I picked one, but had to wait until 2 pm to move. Two days of my seven were wasted on packing, and repacking. There were some mishaps with our luggage and belongings in the move as well. I met several other owners who had unhappy similar experiences with the construction views. With anger like mine, some were able to move. For my inconvenience I demanded some compensation. I was offerred some room credit as well as points. I really wanted another vacation that was not spoiled by such a horrible experience. That was not provided to me. My anger and stress compromised my immune system. I developed a slight infection which prevented me from going swimming, or engaging in normal athletic activities that I routinely do. I never swam in the Pacific or in the beautiful but crowded pool or hot tub. Eventually both my anger and infection subsided as I was able to gaze out my balcony and look at the ocean. The Pool side restaurant was excellent. The concierge terrific. I felt like I had a personal assitant arranging all my travel plans very well. Although it took some persistance finding chairs by the pool, it was very pleasant there. The property, except for the construction site was beautiful and well maintained.

We loved the Fairmont (see my review of that separately) and were sad to leave. I was really worried about our location and the construction at the WEstin and did lots of research, on this site and others, before our trip. We called at least 3 times explaining that we had a 2 yr old and were seriously considering purchasing a time share (we were as we love Hawaii and the planned expansion in Kauai is very appealing-our favorite island). When we were in Wailea, we also called and checked on our room. We had booked a Deluxe island view ($500/night) which we thought would be fairly quiet and somewhat nice albeit not an ocean view. When we checked in, we were given a 6th floor room in Bldg 4 directly facing the huge crane and the road of traffic. It was extremely loud- all rooms seem to be pretty loud here. After several calls, and rude service we were moved to a much better unit. Our parents however were not and sadly are facing the crane the remainder of the week. The rooms are great though, typical westin and I think are better than most on the island. My major issue with this property is that it feels very crowded and I think with the new units going up next door it will be a madhouse unless they create more open space. After staying at the Fairmont- where we paid less for a suite- where it was lush and quiet I felt like were sardines on the lounge chairs here. It is pretty and I love the room but for the # of units they need more green space, pools and lounge areas.

We had our first visit to the Villas in September 2005. The resort looks great but as much as we enjoyed our stay it was a little bumpy. It started out that we booked 1 day out of our owner preferred booking time so we were put into a room in the back building (behind the two buildings on the beach) and as the Hawaiian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He kuikawa ka 'ikena o kela wahi ho'oku ka'a e waiho kala'e ihola ma 'o!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (This view of your parking lot is incredible!) We asked them how we purchased an ocean view room and we end up with a parking lot view. They said that you could see the ocean past the parking lot. Also we were on the second floor so we would sit on the balcony and look into the windshield of people pulling into a parking spot. When we signed up they told us we would never be out of the building where our unit number we purchased was. That turned out not to be true in their presentation. Also we were told that owners were the only ones to have access to the underground parking (that goes fast) and that turned out not to be a true statement during the sale either. We asked to be moved and they could move us the next day but we had to check out early, wait in the long like at check in with everyone else at 3:00 and that try and get our bags delivered by 5 or 6 PM. So there went one whole day. Once we settled in it was nice. The rooms are great but not kept very clean. Great amenities but stains on the carpet and dirt on the tile. One of the Jacuzzi tubs did not work and was not fixed until the last day. The food was not great at the restaurant and was expensive. The beach was nice and quiet with great snorkeling but the beach was smaller and steeper than when we stay at the Sheraton. I actually find the Sheraton to be the prime location of Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali beach and we might trade in our villa to stay there again. We stayed at the Sheraton a few days before going to the villas and it was nothing but perfect. I realize that the report is harsh and makes it sound as if we did not enjoy the villas at all but we are not sorry we purchased. We have used the points all over the world. The resort is well done if they learn to keep it up. They did listen to our complaints for a few hours and took notes because their goal and ours is for the villas to be a wonderful place to stay. We are going back this next July and I hope the experience is better than the last visit. The things they are adding should be an improvement once they are done with the construction (which can be a loud experience depending on where your rooms is). If you are an owner and have seen problems it is important that we bring it to their attention so that it gives them a chance to respond. I still believe it is one of the best properties they have and I realize that many of the problems we encountered were because they had just opened two buildings a month before and were trying to run it with the staff that was set up for one building. They are expanding their villas to other islands (Hawaii, Oahu and Kauai) so owning Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali is a huge advantage to getting into the other Hawaiian resorts. They have the max amount of points offered out of all the villas.

Be wary of stranger or thieves trying to enter your lanai. The kitchen was great as we cooked half of the time. The lobby area was beautiful; staff was great including front desk, concierge, pool staff. The pool area was good too. The gym was good though it should not be so far back of the hotel.

The hallways of the buildings were very very nice, clean, and professional. The store was well stock and fairly priced. The restaurant was ok, not great but not bad; of course overpriced for what you get; but it was worth the ambiance of seeing the sunset during dinner. I agree w/ everyone that non-timeshare owners do not get the best room views. We got no view facing another building but a 1BR is better than a studio so I'm not complaining. We were so impressed with this resort that we bought a Timeshare(we already own one in Cabo so not sure how I got roped into this; had to be good)at the new one they are building(Villas North). The view as you enter the lobby area is very impressive as you see the water and palm trees.

I had even asked when the \"nice sales person\" was trying to get me to purchase the packet ... is it hard to get a date? Oh NOOO! It's VERY easy. Just try to call about 60 days ahead! Truth is ... I tried at first a month out ... o.k. too early, no go; 4 months out ... again, too early; 7 months out, nothing; fine 13 months out ... too far in advance. I got to a point where I was thinking I had to just take initial the $400 already paid into it as a loss and a lesson learned on my part never to fall for something like this again. The operators were HORRIBLE ... they acted like they were doing you a favor to get you a date. TOTALLY not customer oriented AT ALL! YOU had to keep calling back ... and they advised NUMEROUS times a day to try to get a date ... not only that ... every week and a half or so, their system updates and they have no access to any dates for a few days or so at a time ... but YOU are the one who needs to keep calling back. I even asked well, can someone call me back when the system updates ... nope. You need to call back. To top it off, they tell you not to book an airline flight until you get a date ... well, in my situation, I was trying to get our family over on mileage flights ... well, that's pretty hard to get in general ... but ... you had to wait to get a date from them first, then wait 2 weeks or so for their confirmation letter to arrive BEFORE you book your air because any changes on their part is an additional $25. I really thought I had to climb all these hurdles to get an actual date. We FINALLY were able to get an agent that actually was actually sympathetic to the customer and was willing to call back when the system updated and dates were available to view on their system ... I finally got the date I was hoping for and had on hold with the airlines. I wound up calling Westin/Starwood Hotels again about a week later to see if the dates were confirmed and they were.

In the meantime, rates for jet fuel have skyrocketed even though we told Westin we would like to get a reservation set as soon as possible so we can secure our flight at a decent rate. But they simply did not care. One Westin agent was \"empathetic\" and said they will call me when something opened up. But guess what. No such luck. We tried to get a refund back on our deposit but Westin said tough luck. Once a deposit is made and X number of days lapse, too bad for you. Well Westin has caused all that time to lapse.

A good price $800 for 5 nights. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always wanted to stay in one of these beach front hotels and play in their pools and walk out to the beach.

We were assured that we could still use the facilities at the Westin Hotel including the spa and pool. On top of that we could use the facilities at the Sheraton as well. When we arrived at the Villa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s we were told we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the pools at the other hotels after all and that there was a new policy put in place banning use of the pools between the different policies. Strike One We booked a Luau through the hotels activities desk. Promising a good show, good food and open seating so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be wise to get there early. We got to the luau early so we could get close seats and waited inline for 1 hour. Guess what, seating was open by section and we were in the back section. Talking to other guests at our table we found out that we paid a 150% more per ticket than other guests at our table! The Westin Villas obviously was not looking out for our interest or enjoyment on that evening. After that.. we priced a trip to Molikia through the hotel and ended up buying through a retailer downtown because the hotel wanted $170 more for the same trip. Strike Two. We were told as part of our package (prior to booking) that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be expected to participate in a 1.5 hour presentation on ownership. We were up for that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was part of the deal and we were going to uphold our end of the deal. After about 2.5 hours of presentation and our answer (no thank you), we were asked why we had requested the tour and presentation. Apparently the sales pitch wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of our deal and it was our choice to go or not go.

What I would like everyone to understand is that even owners can't depend on getting a room with a decent view either. I am the owner of an \"Ocean View\" unit at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas and my family recently made our second visit there to use our timeshare. We love Hawaii and usually go to Maui due to the abundance of nature, activities, and the great people there. As another reviewer commented, Maui is getting over-developed, but we decided to purchase a timeshare at the Westin anyway, as it promised so much. We're now having second thoughts. Our first visit was fine, as the resort had just opened, and everyone at the Westin was focused on making things perfect. Our second visit last month was a disaster. Not only did they fail to put us in an Ocean View unit (my contract says I own one), but the front desk manager was unable to change our room and even claimed that all units are \"partial ocean view\" (who cares what a contract says anyway). We got a view of asphalt, tailpipes and back of building (more below). Definitely not what we travelled to Hawaii for. After complaining to Westin in writing, I was informed that the unit we were placed in is considered to be an \"Ocean View\" room. I've posted a picture I took from that unit's lanai - you decide for yourself whether you would agree that this is an Ocean View room. I doubt that Westin would want to use this in any advertisements. The main problem with this property, in my opinion, is that Westin got a bit greedy and decided to build a third building back behind the other two. The majority of the rooms in the newest structure, \"Building C\" provide views of not the ocean or pool area, but of the back of Building B, a huge parking lot, and/or the highway. Making reservations at this property is definitely hit-or-miss. Finally, if you plan to visit this property, please keep in mind that there are 3 buildings full of guests, so there is a huge demand for space. If you leave your towels, etc. on a beach chair next to the pool and go for a swim for a while, when you return you are likely to find that either your stuff has been removed or a friendly note has been placed there informing you that your stuff will be moved to the activities cabana due to \"high demand for chairs.\" Also, don't plan on having an outdoor barbeque dinner if you like to have a drink with your meal - alcoholic beverages are banned from the barbeque / picnic table areas.

They were woefully unprepared for the additional people that came with that opening. They did not have enough pool and beach chairs for everyone (the GM stated that 150 additonal chairs are on a barge to Maui right now), we asked for items that are promised to us as owners such as a high chair and diaper genie and they were completely out (the head of housekeeping told us that she requested additional from the GM prior to the opening but was told that they would not need the extras, and that they have since placed a large order), three of the six new BBQ grills were out of order, the landscaping was not even close to being done around the new units (this will be very nice in a year), and they did not have enough staff to handle check in or the bar restaraunt. They also canceled the \"Stay at One, Play at All\" pool benefits with the other Starwood resorts on Maui. They still had it on brochures and their website that were in the rooms after they told us at the desk it had been canceled. This cancelation came as no suprise to me after they opened the new buildings, but Greg Lundberg the GM has a long way to go in effective communication. There was no advance notice and they flyer under the glass notification at check in was unprofessional. The rooms and facilites are top notch, but it is clear that they are struggling. I think they need a new GM or need to give additonal training to Greg and his staff. This is the flagship property for Starwood Vacation Ownership and they have too much invested to allow it to fail.

Owners do not get daily housekeeping services unless they pay extra for it, whereas it is included for hotel guests. Well, we must have fallen off their list because 2 out of 5 days, we did not receive any service. The 1st instance, after returning from sightseeing at 6:30pm, our room was still not cleaned/made up. I called to complain and their reason was they had a number of people checking out and were behind. I countered that it isn't my problem and that I would like the room cleaned and fresh towels. Fortunately, we had 2 extra towels. Well, someone finally came at 7:30, so we dcided to leave for a quick dinner. When we returned, our room was serviced rather poorly. The trash was emptied, but the beds were made quite sloppily. the worst thing, though, was all the dirty towels were taken away but not a frsh towel was left, we had not a single towel, not even a face cloth. I called the front desk immediately and they said we would have some sent up. I waited over an hour and by now it was bed time. We never received towels. The next morning I stormed downstairs demanding to speak with the manager after explaining my plight to the desk clerk. She offered to get me some pool towels for now which I declined. Her supervisor saw how upset I was and said someone will deliver towels to my room asap and offered a $50 credit. I told her $50 does not even cover the inconvenience, time and aggravation I spent. The second instance happened on our 3rd night where we again had to call for service once returning in the early evening. It took over an hour for someone to service our room but it was still inconvenient to have to leave once we returned to relax. The desk clerks are rude and not customer-oriented. They have a \"there's nothing I can do at the moment\" attitude. I don't think I was out of line either. DVD's can be rented on a daily basis through a credit card machine in the lobby. Another problem was the DVD player did not work, like it overheats after about 1/2 hour of the movie. The remote control didn't work either. We called the front desk about this. Without the remote control, it is inconvenient to do anything aside from playing the movie. Well, engineering left a note saying the the DVD player worked fine and they replaced the batteries on the remote. I had to argue again to get credit $7.95 for the movie since it is a daily rental. Well we started the movie again and wouldn't you know it? The player stopped in about 1/2 hour again. I called and said just replaced the player instead of telling me there's nothing wrong, which they did. How aggravating. The rooms are very nice and well furnished. The bathroom was spacious with an exquisite shower and separate jacuzzi bath. The bed was very comforatble. The kitchen was convenient as well as the washer and dryer.

It will give you maps and details on all of the major attractions in Maui. The first adventure we took was the road to Hana. You need to plan on an entire day and leave early, but what a blast. The views are spectacular and there are lots of interesting side trips to see waterfalls and beaches. The road is very narrow with lots of twists and turns but it is worth it. We decided to turn back at Hana which was a mistake...we should have continued all the way around the island (the roads are okay even though you will hear different opinions). Another trip was to Haleakala Summit. We didn't go for the sunrise or the bike ride, but arrived around noon. Unbelievable views of the island as you drive up, and the crater looks like another planet. Take some warmer clothes, because it's a lot cooler at 10,000 feet. Also, if you plan to watch the sunrise take really warm clothes! On the drive to the crater we took a sidetrip to hike to the redwood forest. It was an interesting trip, but the drive to the trail was tough with the last 4 miles a narrow dirt road. We spent several hours in Lahaina and there are lots of shops and places to eat. We made a trip past Kapalua to the top of the island and hiked to a blowhole and tide pools. If you take these trips have some shoes with a good grip, so you can hike down the hill to the ocean. Some tips for the side trip. Buy a cheap cooler and take your food with you. There are great places to stop and have a picnic with a beautiful view of the ocean. The Safeway in Lahaina was the best bet for groceries. We went to the Drums of the Pacific Luau at the Hyatt and had a good time. If you want to be in the first groups to eat then sit on the left side as you face the stage. Unlike the Big Island you really don't need 4 wheel drive in Maui. The roads are close to the ocean, so the hikes are short. Since 4 wheel drive will cost you more save the money and spend it something else.

Their general rule on the island of where to find calm water is \"in south swell go north (generally summer), in north swell, go south (generally winter, spring). When we were there in June we went all over the island looking for good snorkeling spots with our kids, only to find the very best was right out our front door! We saw turtles, and more fish there than anywhere. The waves at the Sheraton just south of Black Rock knocked me over and just about swept our daughter out to sea, whereas the weather back at the Westin KOR was perfect.", "Date": "April 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland Ohio", "Title": "\u201cLuxury Rooms - Iffy Weather\u201d", "Author": "sooeeypig", "ReviewID": "UR3344262", "Content": "We spent five nights starting March 28, 2005. You will be hardpressed to find rooms that are this new and in good condition anywhere else. Granite countertops, nice carpet and tile floors, etc. The complaints about the views etc are probably justified, but it's just for certain rooms - most seem to be \"as advertised\". We stayed in a 1BR, with our three daughters aged 4,6, and 8 and there was plenty of room. The thing that bothered us really was the weather, something that I haven't heard many people complain about on this thread. The wind was just awful - blowing almost constantly everyday at 25-30mph plus I would guess. Also, it was often accompanied by a light rain/mist - again several times a day, sometimes for at least several hours at a time. Several people told us that it had been going on for at least two weeks. Funny thing is, even driving down a mile or two south to the Westin or Whaler's village is was much calmer and sunnier. It makes me wonder if the weather on far north Kaanapalli where the villas are, is consistently worse than even the south part of Kaanapalli. We would be in Lahaina (5 miles south) where the weather was gorgeous, virtually no wind and only partly cloudy and by the time we got back to the villas is was raining with huge wind gusts. To me, that is a major issue. I think it was also why there was virtually nobody at the pool most times. your towels, even your shoes would just blow away if you weren't there to hold them down and you could basically forget about reading anything. It also made the water very rough on the beach beside the hotel, making snorkeling virtually impossible as well. We would strongly consider buying a timeshare week here, if we were confident that the weather wouldn't consistently be this bad. I'm curious if others that have stayed here did not experience the same high winds and consistent rain/mist as we did - or if it just didn't bother people as much. Conversely, Wailea was just beautiful weather-wise compared to Kaanapalli.", "Date": "April 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "S.

We booked 11 months in advance and the room location was extremely disappointing. It was on the first floor facing the empty lot to the North. Outside was the air conditioning unit for the north building. The balcony had negligible ocean view and the air conditioning made it too noisy for use. We asked the time share folks and front desk how this room and others adjacent can ever be considered ocean view. And also Westin plans to build 6 stories condos on the North side. The location of the entire project is great and they did a nice job on the interiors and grounds. HOWEVER, buyer beware when Westin tells you are buying ocean view !! Their sales tactic is highly deceptive in my opinion especially when they are putting up six story high condos to the north.

It was expensive, but the place and the experience is flawless. There is the usual \"lounge hogging\" that goes on at most sunny resorts, but we're not into the melinoma scene, preferring to be off hiking or snorkeling or touring. I snorkeled the coral reef in front of the hotel several times a day and always saw turtles and even a few rays and eels. Since it is humpback whale season we celebrated every sunset with drinks and binoculars to watch the whales leap just off our beach. The bed is the most comfortable I've ever encountered, and the bathroom is huge and luxurious. The kitchenette in the studio is small, presenting a challenge to preparing a large meal, but I have to say that it is completely equipped, right down to the dishwasher detergent. The people at the front desk, at the activities desk, at the pool center are all polite and responsive. Clearly this is the best resort on Maui. The only thing I can think of that detracted from our week was some light construction noise, and the slightly irritating fact that the water slide at the pool isn't steep enough and I got stuck a few times. But maybe that's just my new swim suit.

Price: about $200/night via Expedia. This resort is 5-star, without question. It is the most conscientiously constructed building I have ever been in. Great attention has been paid to all the important detail -- water pressure was at least double what it is in most business hotels; 2 shower heads; great bed as advertised; high ceilings (at least 10 feet) with tasteful moudling; nice prints on the wall; etc. The staff was attentive and attractive. Our one gripe is that they play by the book too much, like when the bartender made us go back to our rooms to get ID. But then he gave us a round of drinks for free. The setting is SPECTACULAR. This resort is north of the older Ka'anapali resorts, and so the beach is uncrowded and unspoilt. The 20 or so acres next door are completely undeveloped, so there is a nice view of Molokini and some undeveloped beach next to the hotel's yellow sand beach. There are 8 grills with a view of the ocean -- we used to get fresh fish from the supermarket each day and grill up lunch looking at the Pacific. This place is also cleaner and better maintained than most resorts. Perhaps this is because it was just built (in 2003, I think). They are still working on a 3rd wing of the hotel which is a minor nuissance. Parking garage downstairs is always full at night. The 2 tennis courts are concrete and usually empty -- this is obviously not a tennis resort. The concierge went out of their way to be helpful -- from morning orientation sessions about what to do on the island, to giving us a free \"Road to Hana\" CD ... if there is anything wrong with this place it is the pervasive (and I mean PERVASIVE) sales culture ... every staff member exists to SELL you a time-share in one of their units, in some subtle way.
