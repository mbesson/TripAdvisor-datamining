Our rooms on the 4th floor (402 & 403) gave out onto an alleyway where junkies gathered every night and made an unbelievable amount of noise. Windows were not double-glazed, so it was hard to get a good night's sleep. The heating was not easy to adjust (mostly too hot), but opening the window was not really an option. We were surprised that the hotel did not serve breakfast. On the good side, the rooms were clean and reasonably sized for a city centre hotel and the bathroom was large. The hotel is just a few minutes walk from La Rambla and the Liceu metro station.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great value, clean, friendly\u201d", "Author": "gaddingabout", "ReviewID": "UR19085854", "Content": "Just got back from a four night stay in Hotel Alba. It is a fantastic location putting you just off La Rambla mid way between Plaza Catalunya and the Port area. The nearest Metro is Liceu on the green line and very handy. The best part is that the hotel alba is right near a fabulous food market where you can pick up delicious fresh food and juices for breakfast or lunch or eat right there if you like. This makes up for not having tea/coffee facilities in the room which i usually must have. I paid \u20ac350 euros for the four nights and it ran into a bank holiday weekend at that. The staff were all very nice and friendly. It was very easy to access the free fast wireless internet with your laptop in the room. Yes, there are hookers about but i challenge anyone to find a hooker free spot in barcelona. Barcelona itself is elegant and electric place - i will go again as soon as i get a chance and will stay at the hotel alba again.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in the center of Barcelona, very clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "Germany2", "ReviewID": "UR18894699", "Content": "Very good location, city center, next to Ramblas, clean, nice-looking rooms.
