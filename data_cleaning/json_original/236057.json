Our room was on top floor and stairs are very steep but for us it was not an issue (others may find it difficult), Room was very basic but all we needed and expected at that price point was a bed to sleep on. Amenities are shared although we had a bathroom in our accommodation (twin room), not sure if it's the case with other rooms. Breakfast is included so we were more than happy with the price.

The staff were pleasant and helpful, even getting out the kettle and teabags when we all piled in too late for the coffee machine (which was actually pretty decent coffee). The breakfast was a help yourself to toast, cereal, cheese and eggs affair. The shower temperature was a bit random. You had a shower in the room and the toilets were on the landing - these were very small rooms with air fresheners but not always very fragrant! The other guests could be noisy but that is to be expected in a hostel type room, turns out the neighbours were from the same town as us (evening all!) - so we know what you got up to and who you are! On occassions, you got the whiff of wacky bacy being smoked in other rooms but then that goes for most of Amsterdam too. The downside to this hotel, was the extra guest - we had left some \"cookies\" out and during the night, we could hear rustling and then we clocked a mouse! ..... I saw a mouse! Where? There on the stair! Where on the stair? Right there! A little mouse with clogs on, Well I declare! Going clip-clippety-clop on the stair, Oh yeah - I'm still seeing the funny side of this - to be fair, we saw no signs of mouse before this incident or after.

First of all, the infamous stairs - they're ridiculous and treacherous. Can I suggest singing \"Climb Every Mountain\" as you ascend, it adds to the adventure. We had a twin room with a sloping ceiling (under the roof) - meaning, you CAN'T STAND UP STRAIGHT! The walls were literally prison walls - white concrete with no pictures. The curtains were threadbare and had holes burnt through them. The linen, and the room itself, was clean, but the mattresses were so thin you could FEEL THE FRAME BENEATH! All of this I could handle - unbelievably, I've stayed in worse - but what really got to me was the noise. I don't think I slept a wink the first night.

Hot water came through the tap when there were no other showers on in the building and when there were 20 running at the same time it was always a fight to see who could twist the handles fast enough to get the hot water! The plug in the shower was blocked so we had to turn it off let the water drain for 5mins then turn it back on and fight for hot water again, the fan was broken meaning that all the steam went into the bedroom.

OK, it isn't the most glamourous hotel and is probably better described as a hostel rather than a hotel but it would perfectly adequate for most travellers. The room had enough bunks to sleep twelve, a sink, shower and table / chairs and sofa. This meant we were able to relax in our room as well as in the common room area downstairs. The common room area has a couple of vending machines (which sell beer) and a pool table as well as Sky TV and plenty of seating. The hotel is quite large and I would imagine that at peak times of year the common room could get pretty busy but it was alright while we were there and a lot of guests stop in for a last few smokes before bed and to watch some TV. Smokers will like this hotel as you can smoke in your room as well as in the common room area. Soft drugs are tolerated throughout. The price was the biggest bonus of the whole thing, I paid just under \u00c2\u00a390 for my five night stay.", "Date": "March 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cnot good\u201d", "Author": "gas", "ReviewID": "UR3841558", "Content": "hotel hortus was clean..the staff was polite but in their own worlds the rooms was small and like cells...my room was absolutelly like prison....the breakfast was not good...and furtermore the last day when we pay we gave 54 euros for a double per day then 50euros we knew and they had told us...!!!!also i can say that the true word of this place is hortus miserable...no any funny atmospere or a celebration or even something that will make you feel nice(things that are musts at youth hostels)..i will not also forget the doors of the rooms it was something like a war and you couldnt sleep at least one min..when they close are shouting like bombs. i was asleep when one door closed... a mizery place to smoke downstairs with football channels...if you want to feel like prissoner is the best place..and this was the only funny thing there....the next time i will prefer much better hostels and the only advantage was the location...", "Date": "September 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australis", "Title": "\u201crelaxed\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3002833", "Content": "The hortus was our first stop on our long journey. Although the rooms were very small, we did only have two per room, and for saftey reasons this was a bonus. Also because each room has its own safe it was very comforting to know your valuables were ok. The party atmosphere wasnt huge but the hortus was very relaxed and many joints were shared in the common room. The staff were friendly and helpful and so far it is the only hostel we've been to, to cook eggs every morning!!!! I would definately stay there again.
