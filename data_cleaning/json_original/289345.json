Rooms and bathroom were very nice, exceeded mine and my girlfriends expectations. There was no AC in the room, but we just left the window open while we were out during the day and the room was fine to sleep in at night as the weather was wonderful. The hotel is located in a great, safe part of town, close to La Rambla, or a main metro station (three blocks away) which can then take you anywhere with in two to three stops. The night before we left for an early flight out to Rome, we requested a cab be ready at 5am and a wake up call at 4:45 am. Both were right on time, with the cab outside waiting for us. My only complaint was the restaurant in the lobby, had the fixed menu dinner for 18 Euros, not good at all, but plenty of restaurants near by that are great!

Also the rooms are very very small. While the bathroom is adequate is isn't layed out very well. When you sit on the toilet your knees hit the vanity. We had gotten the hotel on Priceline as a 4 star property. While I think in general it does deserve the rating in many of the categories, the room just brought it down for us.

But the worst, and ultimately unforgivable transgression was when my girlfriend left her wallet behind after breakfast one morning in the empty restaurant. In the time it took us to go upstairs to our room and come back down, the staff had already moved it from our table to the office behind the front desk, and yet all the large denomination bills were missing. The thief had left all the ID cards and small bills behind, as to avoid us being required to report the theft to authorities. I asked the front desk how it could have been stolen in such a short amount of time (in THEIR OFFICE, no less) and his reply was a shrug and, \"it's like leaving it on the street.\" So, we wrote it off as our fault for leaving it behind (which it was), but we'd hoped that common decency would have been applicable here.

The hotel also features a small restaurant that opens out on to a patio at the back, and the prices are quite reasonable. There is a grocery store located directly across from the hotel that has a decent selection of wines, cheese and fresh-baked goods. This came in really handy as it allowed us to pack a picnic and enjoy lunch on the go, without worrying about finding a restaurant that would meet the requirements of the picky eater in the family. Probably the best feature of this hotel is its location. You are close to everything, but far enough away that you can get a good night's sleep after a busy day of seeing the sights. It is a five minute walk from the Diagonal subway station, one of the major lines that bisects the city. It is also about a ten minute walk to the Passeig de Gracia, where you'll find amazing shops and restaurants, as well as some of the famous Gaudi architecture. One other little gem you will find on the street is the Bodega Joan. It is a little local bar across from the hotel. It looks like nothing special, but the food is so good and unbelieveably inexpensive. It's been around since the 1940s, so they must be doing something right. Have to give this little place a mention because you'd probably bypass it in favour of something more upscale otherwise. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Evenia Rosello.

We made a rookie mistake of keeping money in a locked up suitcase in the hotel to keep it safe from the infamous pickpockets of the city, only to have it stolen from the dishonest staff of our supposedly four-star-hotel. While we can't be 100 percent sure that it was the staff who did it, the nochalent attitude of the receptionist was disappointing. He was very quick to imply it was our own fault for not locking our doors properly, while the doors practically close themselves when we leave the hotel room. We only noticed that someone had meddled with our suitcase after I could not open it. After much difficulty in opening the suitcase, we noticed that everything (camera, passports, credit cards etc) was still in place except for the money. We went down to the receptionist to report this and all he could say was he could only check the records of who went into the room the next morning. We also realised to our horror that there were no security cameras in the hallways of the hotels. We insisted on having the police come to the hotel. The police, upon arriving, seemed really professional. However, there was nothing they could do. They told us to go back to the police station the next day with the hotel's report. The following morning, a report by the hotel showed - surprise surprise - that no one else but the hotel staff and us entered the room. And since the hotel had clearly implied that it couldn't be the fault of the hotel staff, we decided not to waste our holiday by bothering with a police report that definitely would not help us get our money back.

Both hotels are modern and new, with good location. Cotursa Rossello is in a neighbourhood called Eixample, i think its a great place to stay, you can go walking everywhere, you're close to the center but its also a quiet place at night, unlike Ramblas area or Born. Well, this hotel as i said before is new, bedroom was a bit small but had all you need, a good bathroom and breakfast was delicious, with good variety and quality. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel, i liked it very much. I would recommend it to a friend, as well as Villa Domat, wich may be less expensive.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire, England", "Title": "\u201cWhere's the gym?\u201d", "Author": "Marc_IT", "ReviewID": "UR5557467", "Content": "I stayed here for one night in July and again one night in August. It was a business trip, both times and the hotel was booked by the local office staff. It is used regularly by the company and everyone has been pleased with the hotel. The bar is a typical hotel bar, lacks atmosphere but there are bars very close by, also the restaurant is never too busy but I chose to eat in restaurants either side of the hotel and both are good. The hotel bar does very generous measures so drink with caution! My only disappointment was with the fitness room. It was difficult to find, had to negotiate darkness until finally finding a light switch. Very basic exercise bikes and a solitary treadmill. No resistance machines and no water supplied. Other than that all is good, rooms nicely appointed, bathrooms are good and everything is clean. Breakfast is a buffet with a really good choice of fresh produce. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "August 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield, England", "Title": "\u201cGood contemporary 4 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "gpg", "ReviewID": "UR5503180", "Content": "Stayed here for two nights on 20th July 2006. Good location - less than 5 mintues walk to Provenca/Diagonal underground stations. Just turn left out of the hotel and walk two blocks. Or 10 minutes walk to Gaudi's Pedrera and the Tourist Information office in Palace Robert at Diagonal. The hotel is brand new, modern, contemporary and very clean - that is, apart from the corridors upstairs. Who knows why they are not vacumed properly - not a big issue - but strangely noticeable in new hotel. Ask for a room at the back - its very quiet overlooking the restaurant terrace and childrens playground. We had to take a smoking room but there was no smell at all. We paid 70 euros plus tax per night through a discount hotel website. For this price, they give you one of the handful of less spacious double rooms on each floor - but still with excellent king size bed. These rooms are really set up for single business people on overnight stays but a couple will be very comfortable for a few days. The lunch time set menu in the restaurant is very popular with local office workers - its only 10 euros for three courses - but only on Monday to Friday. The same menu is also available in the evening but the price increases to 18 euros. At the weekend the set menu increases to 20 euros at lunch or dinner. The plasma TV only has two English channels - CNN International and BBC World. But, BBC World was not available. There is Wi-Fi but no internet terminal in the hotel - a big negative. The reception desk will direct you to a copy shop about 10 minutes walk away on Diagonal. However, there is a very inexpensive internet cafe in the next street - 60 cents for 30 minutes. Turn right out of the hotel - turn left at the next junction - the cafe is half way down on the right. There is a large supermarket - Bon Preu - behind a small door over the road from the hotel entrance. Lots of deli stuff to take home or eat in your room. There is a great local brasserie very close to the hotel - excellent set 3-course menu in the evening for 8.5 euros including bread, wine and water - La Tasqueta de Muntaner. It says \"Braserie\" above the door. Turn right out of the hotel, turn left at the next junction, the restaurant is immediately on the other side of the road. There are bar tables in the main room and restaurant tables in the back \"salon\" plus a couple of tables outside. A very pleasant place. Overall, a good hotel in a good locality, an excellent value four star hotel.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot a bad hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ehzoyzdcr", "ReviewID": "UR5015682", "Content": "We stayed at the Cotursa Rossello with our 7 year old daugter for a 3 night break in April. Our room was on the 2nd floor at the front and the traffic was quite noisy but then we expect that in a bustling town centre and we actually slept very well. There was nothing especially positve or negative about the room but the bathroom was nicely designed and very modern. The staff were friendly. The location is very pleasant, away from the main tourist area and in an upmarket area full of independent shops boutiques and restaurants. Having said that, most of the tourist attactions are quite a walk away and perhaps that is why we slept soundly! But taxis are cheap so you don't have to walk and the tube station is nearby. We highly recommend a nearby cafe for breakfast called Paul. We didn't try the hotel breakfast although it looked good. There is a children's playground directly behind the hotel so this may be a good option if you have young children. Our big surprise was the hotel restaurant. It looks quite uninviting - first it is empty, the menu is not displayed and they don't dim the lights - but we ate there on the last night when our daughter was too tired to go out walking again and were pleasantly surprised at the good quality of the food and it was also incredibly cheap compared to the other meals we had eaten. The service was also exceptional (just as well as we were the only ones there!) They were also happy to prepare a dish for our daughter who does not eat meat which was not on the menu. It is a shame they do not do something more about the ambience to attract some customers. We do not know what we paid for the hotel as we got a last minute package of \u00a3215 each for scheduled Iberia flights from Heathrow (at very good times) and 3 nights in the hotel but this seemed like a very good value hotel for that price. We recommend getting a taxi from the airport as it is only 20 euros.", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prestatyn, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPleasant City Centre Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Maverick911", "ReviewID": "UR4827633", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for a 3 night long weekend break in March.

The room faced onto the main street but with the window closed noise was minimal. The room had a laminated floor and as a result we could hear other guests walking around and furniture being moved. Of the two lifts only one was in use during our stay. The reception staff were attentive and arranged for early morning calls and taxi's. The restaurant staff were hard work smiles at a premium but the food (mainly breakfast) was very good.
