I explained my husband was over 6' foot and I needed space with windows that opened and a nice size bath. He said out oui.. I said are you sure you understand me, he \" yes, Madame, absolutely., I just finished reading your email, and he was laughing. I thought that was a bit rude , but I let it slide.he asked for the credit card. I asked him how much and he confirmed in euros and American dollars. At this pont, I was locked in.. When we arrived, we saw a sweet young lady and she gave us our key, the elevator was tiny, bad sign, when we got to the room I thought I would die . We're they kidding me. It was smaller than the hotel I just checked out of, was this a bad joke. No window that opened, it was sealed shut, no tub, actually no real bathroom, it had like salon doors, no privacy, no shower doors, lke half a glass wall,had to stand side ways to fit in bathroom and I am a small woman, bed was tiny, no way my husbands 6'1 frame was fitting on it, it was nothing like the b,ack white and red picture, this was dull, beige, they were kidding me. I went right down stairs, no manager to be fond. The sweet girl, couldn't help me, manager wasn't come see or talk to me. Never came and cleaned my room all day , left me with no clean towels or shampoos, it was a disgusting mess and then to get the bill for 3 nights, 820 dollars, really, they lied to me, by over 200 dollars and no, I didn't mix up euros for dollars I had taken 12 years of French I knew the difference , they ripped me off.

Literally 1 block away is a hotel that will cost your 4x as much, but theres a reason. When we arrived i was a bit dissapointed, because the pictures on the internet make it look a lot nicer. The lobby was decent. Rooms are small (big deal) but when you enter you can see that were was a very poor renovation/remodel done. Paint peeling off, not painted nicely. Seemed run down and not very well taken care off. This was probably our least favorite hotel of our entire 17 day trip to europe and also one of the most expensive hotels (thanks paris lol) Breakfast was included which at the time of checkin the guy tried to convince me otherwise. Staff was friendly, however one instance we came back to the hotel and the gf had held going to the restroom and was going to go when we got back, however the 1 gentlmen manning the frontdesk was helping someone, he completely ignored us for 5 minutes as we stood there waiting to get our key instead of just excusing himself for 5 seconds to ask which room we have and handing us the key, made us wait like we were strangers. Probably wouldnt have bugged me, but the fact that the gf had to use the restroom made it worse. Our room was extremely noisey. So cramped and small you could hear everything. We had some family next to use or above us (couldnt tell) with a little kid running around banging at 2am. I finally got so fed up and hit the walls and yelled SHUT UP. They still didnt quite down. Opened the window and let the \"city noise\" drown them out. After the first night that left a bad taste in our mouth for the rest of the stay there.

Absolutely no reason to be - location is excellent - right in the heart of he Champs-Elysees area. Room was excellent - right, modern, tasteful and spotless. Breakfast has received some harsh criticism from other guests - I can only say it must have improved greatly - we were totally satisfied with what was on offer.

We arrived before the check in time and were lucky enough that our room was ready so we were able to chec in. Staff was very friendly. There was a free Wifi access.

The Hotel is in a wonderful location in Paris. Within walking distance of just about everything! A few days before we arrived we discovered that one more person was joining us for the first night and we therefore upgraded our room from a 2 bedroom to a 3 bedroom. The Hotel was very accommodating considering the last minute change of plans. The triple room happened to be a \"Deluxe Room\" which was VERY nice and modern. Coming from North America it is comparable to a room you would get a 4 or 5 star hotel. However the remaining 2 nights we switched to a \"Classic Room\" which we regretted. They don't show pictures of this room on the website for a reason. They Classic Room hasn't been renovated since probably 1970 and is extremely small. I highly recommend paying the 30 Euros for a Superior or Deluxe Room, it will make or break your experience. Also, the front desk is very strict about guests, we had friends in the area and they were not very fond of them coming up to our rooms. Overall: Good Hotel aslong as you book the right room! It was also very clean by the way", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cGood location, clean, that's about all we can say\u201d", "Author": "di29di", "ReviewID": "UR78210666", "Content": "We booked this hotel for 5 nights based on everything we read in reviews and their website \"Renovated this year, we invite you to discover its 35 rooms, all decorated in a unique and very original style\" and other travel sites. We booked a classic room but found it musty, unrenovated, an old bed and a terrible bathroom so we upgraded to s superior room for an extra 30E/night. The design of the bathroom allowed the water to come out of the shower stall so we had to put towels down to prevent the water from going into the bedroom. The shower head is placed in front of the tap so you get soaked with cold water when turning it on. They are very cheap with their towels and toiletries. There are no drawers to put you clothes into. They advertise safes in the room but in fact only are in the superior or deluxe room. You have to give them your room key when you leave and have to wait for the receptionist to get it back. One of the reading lights in ourroom was broken and they could not fix it. There are only 2 English speaking channels-CNN and BBC. The hotel owner told us there were many English channels when we checked in. Be sure to bring books to read if that is your only language. There was a woman receptionist that was most helpful, the men had attitiute and could barely speak English enough to be helpful. The walls are paper thin. You can hear connversation and the opening and closing of your neighbours doors at all hours of the day and night. The good things: It is very close to the bus stop (#72) to take you to The Louvre and the Left Bank. It is a very close walk to the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triumph. the walk to the Metro is far if you want to go to the Left bank. However the walk to the Metro for Versaille is close. There is a grocery store around the corner and a fantastic bakery called Midori-fabulous bread, flan, cheesecake and more. A choclatier making chocolates in the window as well. On Wednesdy and Saturday there is an open Market on the boulevard at the end of the street. I would recommend this hotel for location to the Champs Elysee , the Eiffel and the Arc and if you are upgrading. If you want to be where the action is stay near the Left Bank, but be very careful on hotel selection, a min of 4 *'s.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cBest Service Hotel\u201d", "Author": "D777799", "ReviewID": "UR75575252", "Content": "I have Stayed in many hotels in the world be it 5 star to a 1 star.But i might say this lil Gem of a hotel is got a very good service in France.As you know French and their Attitude , this hotel is perfect .The service is good .Breakfast could be better.Try and get the deluxe or the superiour.The classis is really small.
