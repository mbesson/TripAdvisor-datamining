It is perfectly located within walking distance of the cool neighborhoods of Madrid, the rooms are clean and comfortable and overall excellent value. Only drawback is that our room was perhaps a bit noisy in the morning.

I then cancelled the booking and contacted directly the Hostal. They answered, confirmed the booking with correct price and asked me to re-confirm few days before arrival. Unfortunately when I wrote back few days before arrival, they didn't keep my booking and they hadn\u2019t any available room. I contacted them sending the emails we exchanged and they didn't even reply!! It\u2019s not in the centre of the city, and with the same amount of money you can easily find better value.
