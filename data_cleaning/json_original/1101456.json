The hotel was very intimate, only a couple of other guests and the service was outstanding. Everyone who worked there was incredibly helpful, including the Manager who would make a point of talking to all the guests on a daily basis. The staff helped us organise diving in the area, trekking in the jungle and also onward travel from Pemuteran. There was building work going on at the hotel but we were completely undisturbed by this. We had a deluxe ocean view villa which was everything we could have asked for - the outdoors bathroom was amazing too, something special about showering under the stars!", "Date": "Dec 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR970462543", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "LauraLLondon"}, {"Content": "Excellent value for money, very friendly staff       View from the boat", "Date": "Dec 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR939939064", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Shellsforever"}, {"Content": "BEST PLACE IN BALI! This hotel was SO AMAZING, it spoiled us so that no other place in Bali could compare, so we had to return on the same trip!we were truly sad to leave. if i ever go back to bali, i will only go to stay here. i think there are few places like this in the world that i have found.The staff was genuinely giving and kind that it was really an unbelievable experience. You didnt get the feeling that they were doing just to get money from you, as you do in much of Bali today. I felt that this hotel truly expresses the wonderful people that Bali is famous for, in part because the area is minimally touched by tourists.Staff: Part of why the staff is so wonderful is that many of them previously worked at a 5 star hotel, so they have an unbelievable standard for excellence. YOu mention you are thirty while on the internet to your friend, and before you know it, you are holding a mango smoothie. We loved it so much, we decided to stay an extra night, and the staff felt badly that they had to have us switch rooms, that they gave us a FREE, 'ROMANTIC DINNER' by the sea. they custom created a cuisine based on our diet, which was some of the best food i've ever eaten, truly cuisine. Every detail is attended to: they leave little flowers everywhere for you, on your bed etc. Not only are they so professional, competant and speak great english, they are really joyous, so fun to chat with, and this really helps connect you to the culture. you feel really comfortable, rather than a feeling like a cold, employee relationship like at many other hotels.They dont push their agenda on you. many hotels were trying to sell you on trips as their goal, they were happy to help, even to schedule us to go to other hotels in other areas, but not for their own pocketbook. price: The cost is so low for this quality. trying to find something comparable in this range i dont believe is possilble. it may be so cheap because they are still new. even the restaurant is cheap, they dont take advantage of you at all.area: The area is so relaxed. If you want to get away from the tourist hourds in Bali, this is the perfect town for this. In other areas, tourist shops and aggressive shop owners are everywhere. Here, the beach is right at your toes. you are surrounded by fisherman, and locals, who are so nice and really like us. it is like a safe, comfortable way to be a tourist and actually SEE what bali is reallky like without the spoils of tourism.you can walk down the beach and get to other small hotels and restaurants, cafes reight on the beach. they are darling to hang out during the day or everning, it makes for a nice night out, but we were always so happy to return to the comfort of ADI ASSRI!The water is SO CALM, like oil, flat, perfect for swimming. The pool looks right over the sea. it is so beautiful. the water is clean too, lots in bali are not. it is very clear (not turqoise color, but down the way it is, and near menjangan island where you can go for the day on a boat). I would definately come here as a woman alone, if i wanted a quiet get away. you feel safe, and can chat with others and meet new friends. lots of couples and some singles come here. very calm and quiet, nice tourists. great atsmosphere. down the beach is the sea turtle reserve, menjangan island, and a great natural springs at mimpi resort (day entry $5!) You could stay here the whole trip and visit nearby areas for the day. ROom;s: the rooms are gorgeous. marble floors. so clean. not one insect int he room. climate controlled. all newly built. huge gorgous beds. so romantic. ocean view-definately best. all glass front, slider doors. open air bathroom, tubbing under the stars!Dive: The instructor is so competant and patient. perfect for new divers. you can get a private instruction. he is british and has a high saftey standard. great boat trips too and snorkel!spa: many hotels rip you off for this knowing we will pay more. they dont. they have FOUR hand massage (two people massaging you). Really amazing. then a flower petal bath, and they bring you tea. it is the ultimate pampering. other places missed the mark for me, even the fancy ones. they really know how to cater!", "Date": "Nov 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR864439371", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mochamv"}, {"Content": "A gem in North Bali       View from Restaurant", "Date": "Aug 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR599247108", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RabidMongoose"}, {"Content": "A really great place we stayed there for four days, originally with the plan of using it as a base to explore the area, but ended up staying there for the whole time!it was really nice - the pool is two metres from the beach, which has really good coral for snorkelling, plus if you dive there is an even bigger reef just off-shore. So we ended up lazing by the pool, swimming, snorkelling and making use of the spa - nice massages!It is an excellent hotel for two reasons - 1 - the staff - they are so friendly and helpful, and really went out of there way to make us feel welcome - 2 - it is priced like an average hotel, but what you actually get is something much better - the bungalows, the restaurant, the service - its all top notch, but also really good value.We travelled around Java and Bali and Adi Assri was definitely the best hotel we stayed, and the only hotel we would go back to.", "Date": "Aug 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR800895109", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sheabie"}, {"Content": "Perfect Stay Simply the best value resort in town. I know because I walked through all of them before selecting Adi Assri. The rooms, grounds, food and service are all top notch.

I will summarize my ramblingly detailed review below by saying the following: fantastic hotel, exceptional value for the money ($65 per night deluxe ocean bungalow with breakfast), delicious hotel restaurant and a delightful, friendly and helpful staff: book this place now if you are planning a trip to Bali. With that said...The Adi Assri Hotel was the next to the last stop on our six month odyssey through Southeast Asia. We picked the hotel strictly based on the first (and only) Trip Advisor review. Other than that we had no idea what to expect. Everything was booked via handphone and confirmed via email. Right away we knew we were onto something special for Indonesia. The staff is exceptionally diligent with follow up: several emails back and forth to verify details and then David (the Director of Marketing) called us the day we were scheduled to arrive to make sure everything was going smoothly.After a long day of travel from the Gili Islands we finally arrived after dark. My wife and I were in no mood to play around: it was room, then dinner, then bed. With little preamble the staff ushered us into our luxurious deluxe bungalow, one of five units facing the ocean. They served us our welcome drinks directly in the bungalow and told us we could complete the registration process the following morning...both gestures very much appreciated. Dinner was excellent, the in-house restaurant deserves high marks, but more on that later.The following morning we got a chance to really examine the room and the property. Deluxe bungalows ($65 per night including breakfast) come with a king-size four poster bed, AC, ample closet space (with in-room safe), hardwood floors and an outdoor bathroom. Due to the hotels very recent opening just two months ago there are a few details needing to be addressed, especially regarding the outdoor bathrooms. Specifically, there is not enough shelf space to actually store your toiletries outside, there is no mirror over the sink so shaving (for men anyways) can be challenging, there are no outdoor electrical outlets and the shower configuration is lacking. However, the staff is well aware of these issues and plans to address them all during the low-season lull. On the plus side the outdoor bathrooms are very spacious and there is something to be said for a gloriously hot shower or bath under the stars.The grounds are meticulously maintained with a small army of gardeners and we both can\u9225\u6a9b wait to see how the extensive plantings develop (lushly I am guessing). The previous review mentioned the pool being under construction but that is now ready and very nicely executed: seriously refreshing after a hot tropical walk, just footsteps from the beach and with many comfortable deck chairs. We spent many an afternoon lounging poolside with a drink in hand. The onsite restaurant was a breath of fresh air after six months on the road. Most restaurants can claim three or four items as their \u9225\u6e02est\u9225?but after eight days we sampled almost everything on the menu and found nothing wanting. All items are well prepared, garnished beautifully and portioned amply. The resident chef and the general manager work together diligently to ensure the daily specials menu is varied and deliciously tempting. Fresh seafood purchased from the adjacent fishing village is a real treat and should not be missed. The staff arranged a surprise private romantic dinner for us on our third night which turned out delightfully. Flowers, our favorite local wine...no detail was overlooked.One of the best activities during our stay was a Balinese cooking class. We had originally inquired about the possibility on our first day while talking with Ode, the general manager. He initially told us they had no such offering but started asking questions about our meal choices during the following days. After a few days I guess he had accumulated enough information to offer us a customized cooking class. We were able to identify one each of appetizer, soup, main course and dessert that we had especially enjoyed. These became our class menu. Ode arranged a visit to the local market with the chef to purchase all the necessary ingredients and also produced a recipe list that included descriptions for all the uniquely Indonesian ingredients. Our dishes became our dinner, which was again arranged as a private romantic evening...maybe a good thing in case you\u9225\u6a99e not a fantastic cook :)Another unique aspect of the Adi Assri is the onsite dive shop Sea Rover. While still a separate entity the two businesses work closely together to ensure guests have a predictably good time. Most dive sites are only minutes away from the resort, easily reached via Sea Rover\u9225\u6a9a modern six-person twin engine dive boat. Paul\u9225\u6a9a (the owner) philosophy is to \u9225\u6e1eun a dive operation I\u9225\u6a87 like to visit\u9225?and he excels at it. Knowledgeable staff, brand-new equipment and a wide variety of scuba-related educational courses all combines to make a top notch dive facility. It certainly doesn\u9225\u6a9b hurt that Pulau Menjangan is only an hour away and offers incredible wall diving and surreal coral gardens to spend your safety stop in.Finally, the staff at Adi Assri really makes the stay. From the General Manager Ode and Director of Marketing David all the way down to the individual wait staff members or room maintenance personnel, everyone is absolutely wonderful. They really make you feel welcome, quickly learn your likes and dislikes and go out of their way to help you learn a little Bahasa Indonesian or even Balinese. In fact, the informal language lessons were one of the most enjoyable experiences we encountered: it makes you feel like you\u9225\u6a99e on your way to becoming a local. And the satisfaction you\u9225\u6a92l derive from ordering your meals in Bahasa, especially the smiles on their faces, will go a long way towards enhancing your holiday.", "Date": "Jul 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR655512529", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GlobetrottersCali"}, {"Content": "Very friendly and astonishing located bungalows       View from restaurant", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR551101730", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "onomato"}, {"Content": "New hotel - great value       Beachfront room looking out", "Date": "Jul 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR166981691", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "WeLoveBali2"}, {"Content": "deuxi\u732bme lune de miel   showReview(19373308, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR933315980", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ParisChristian"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608493-d1101456-r23343421-Adi_Assri_Beach_Cottages-Pemuteran_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1101456", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
