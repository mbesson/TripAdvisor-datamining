The hotel is in a beautifully restored building looking onto a central courtyard. Probably would have given this 5 stars had it not been for noise and a few issues with breakfast.

Positives - Beautifully restored building and rooms - Very comfortable beds; rooms also have ironing boards, safes, free wireless (ask reception for password), big flat screen TV with a large selection of channels - Best shower I've had in a hotel - rainforest shower with great water pressure and a skylight two floors up - Incredibly friendly and helpful staff - especially the bell boys - Great location - easy walk to Revolution Monument, to the historic district and the main city square - Rooms very clean Negatives - When the roof top bar is open (it was on Valentines Day), fairly loud music is played in the courtyard which carries clearly into the rooms - although it didn't go on too late - Breakfast on the first day took over an hour and not all items were delivered, although they still tried to charge for them - On second day, although breakfast was meant to start at 7am, by 7.20 it still wasn't open, so we had to go to Starbucks across the park", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cTravelling across the time in the Boutique Hotel de Cort\u00e9s\u201d", "Author": "michelangelof", "ReviewID": "UR123839623", "Content": "Walking down the \"Alameda Central\", we stopped in front of this facility.

But go ahead and tip them, they deserve it. They were always helpful and smiling even after I had as an experiment delayed tipping by a day. The exterior has the old architecture look but inside is quite modern with an angular theme. Sink, toilet bowl, knobs etc were square or rectangular. The floor was well done parquet. I stayed at room 108 from the 3rd. to the 7th. The room was of adequate but not luxurious size and I loved the comfortable bed. There were enough lights, controls and electrical outlets to suit any traveller and any mood. I liked the idea of the DVD player and radio in addition to the television. The lack of a bathtub did not bother me as I am only comfortable using mine at home. The floor of the bathroom was also made of wood. There were adequate toiletries and towels, a complimentary new pair of bedroom slippers, enough clothes racks, an iron and very clean and stainless ironing board. For some reason, I occasionally lost hot water during a shower. What I found quirky was the clear glass door to the toilet and shower. You have to be sharing the room with someone with whom you are very familiar to be comfortable with that feature. I wondered why smoked glass was not used. If you have rambunctious kids and teenagers you have to warn them. While the glass door to the bathroom swings inwards, the one to the adjoining toilet slides makes contact with masonry to fully close. With no damping material installed I think it can be broken if sufficient force is used to close the door. Apparently there have been no such incidents. Taxis are always available in about 10 minutes, but ensure that you get the hotel to have the taxi driver to commit to a price. In my experiences, the taxi driver always charged 25% more than the price indicated by the hotel. The hotel is near to restaurants, shopping areas and a park.

I mentioned this to one of the staff members who said they had been working on what some saw as a problem. It is a stone courtyard, and sound will echo, even if it's someone coming in late at night or leaving early in the morning. It's well worth a little bit of noise to stay in this magnificent building. I did not hear any loud thumping music noise during my entire stay which included a weekend. The food in the restaurant is excellent. If there is any improvement to be made...then I think a good addition to the menu would be small plates that could be ordered with before dinner drinks.

The people going to the bar seemed to be young prosperous locals. The bar would have been a nice place to sit and have a drink, it has a nice view, but it was just too loud and the music was really really bad. The other complaint is the odd door to the bathroom.

None of the previous reviews on here are really applicable. I've stayed at every major design-oriented hotel in DF, and the de Cortes tops all of them, even the vaunted Condesa and Habita. Although I only saw a couple of the Cortes's rooms, the ones I saw were nothing short of huge, particularly in contrast to the Condesa & Habita. The new decor is completely contemporary; you wouldn't even know the building was hundreds of years old if looking at it solely from the inside.
