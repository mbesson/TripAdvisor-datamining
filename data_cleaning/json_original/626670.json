Ok where to start...We arrived at 16.30hrs & First impressions not too bad. On entering the hotel Builders were wandering around everywhere so not a great start. On entering room it is VERY small but clean & all downhill from here.....It states tea/coffee facilities in room but there were none & no where to even put it. The bed is a cheap flimsy uncomfortable argos/Ikea metal frame with rubbish mattress & wafer thin pillows. On requesting more pillows I was told that there are only 2 allocated per room so we could'nt have anymore. Moments later the banging & drilling started from below. The hotel is still being converted & 2 floors are only open. This noise contiuned on till around 18.30hrs & started again the next morning at 07.30hrs. On complaining the staff did'nt seem to care & shrugged it off...BREAKFAST: Continental breakfast contained of tea/coffeee/juice, COLD STALE toast & COLD croissants. I requested some fresh warm toast which was met with a dissaproving look & slight hostility, So we left the hotel to eat breafast on both days elsewhere. We actually spent as much time out of the hotel as possible to avoid the noise and lack of space.

Reading the reviews after I booked I was nervous. Reading the recent reviews well after my trip make me think the people who rate this hotle so poorly are used to the Ritz.

The rooms are small, but you're really there to sleep. If you're spending all your time in your room you don't know how to travel. Get out and see the sights. I found the room to be a perfect size, and the bed was fine. The bathroom was a bit cramped but it's the European standard. The location of this place is awesome, just a short walk to Hyde Park and even a shorter walk to the Tube. If you travel with my mindset \"the hotel is for sleeping, spend the extra money on activities\" then this place is fine.

Firstly, it is not hard to find, exit Bayswater Tube, turn left, cross the road and it's a doorway next to 'Bella Italia', took us about two minutes to get there from the Tube. The reception is on the first floor and there are stairs (so no good for those in wheelchairs but thats what you expect from this type of place). The receptionist was perfectly amicable, said please and thank you so I can't say I need anything else. Both the reception area and stairway was clean and tidy and well lit. Ok, the place isn't the Ritz but in hotels you get what you pay for and, if you book online and don't pay the 'walk-in' rate (who does pay the 'walk-in' rate at a hotel these days???) then you get get a double room with breakfast for less than \u00c2\u00a340.00 (we paid \u00c2\u00a338). The breakfast is fairly basic, croissants, applles, yoghurt, cereals and toast (which is pre-cooked in a basket but I asked the staff member to toast me some fresh which she did so it wasn't cold). There are jams and cheese as a choice for your toast. Also tea, coffee and juice. I'm not saying any of it is the best quality but, once again, as good as you get somewhere like Holiday Inn Express and better than Travelodge/Premier Inn where you get nothing unless you pay extra. The room is small but perfectly adequate, ours had two small bedside tables (one not next to the bed as there wasn't the room but at the foot of the bed) a full length wardrobe with two more drawers underneath and a small table with a kettle, cups, tea, coffee etc. All clean and perectfly serviceable. There was also air conditioning and a hair dryer (we used neither but both looked fairly new). There was a small TV up on the wall which had the main channels and worked fine. The shower room is tiny, there is no getting away from it but it was clean and we had plenty of hot water (those complaining of there being no hot water must have little patience as it did take about a minute to heat up). If we were really fat we might have had problems there but my husband is 6 foot and 14 stone (around 200 pounrds) and he managed it fine so shouldn't be a problem for most people. We slept well all night, at the front of the building with the window open and had no problem with noise but guess it could be worse at the weekend. Ok, the room was a bit chipped around the paintwork and it wsan't brand new and shiny but I've stayed in fair worse 'chain' hotels and paid a lot more so all I can say is use your head, you get what you pay for and this place is fine for those looking for cheap, convenient, basic accommodation in London.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "aus", "Title": "\u201cI give bad places a fair go, I'm going to slam this joint down!\u201d", "Author": "tsubs", "ReviewID": "UR116080551", "Content": "The ONLY reason I stayed here is because I needed to rush home so I got my flight agent back at home to book me a flight and she booked this accomodation for me.

Nothing \"Royal\" about this place and its not even next to or near hyde park where you think it would be. Lets get to the staff. when I got to reception I was greeted with a filthy look as in why are you here.

I'm the type of traveler that only needs a room to sleep and shower, having a few requirement: cleanliness, good location, inexpensive. The hotel room was very small (which is typical of many European hotels), but it included two single beds, over-the-bed lights, two small wardrobes, an electric tea pot, a tv, a bedside table, a full length mirror, an AC, & a tiny bathroom with a shower, toliet, and sink en suite. The linens were changed daily, and new towels provided. Everything was very clean. At check-in the staff was very friendly and helpful. They have a place to lock your luggage up if you arrive before check-in. There's a small room for breakfast as well. The only downside to the hotel was there is no elevator and three long flights of stairs with 50lbs bags is quite a trek. The location of the hotel provides easy access to the tube (both Bayswater & Queensway), and is close to Paddington Station as well. It's near several restaurants, shops, a small Tesco (groceries), and Hyde Park.

The entrance to the hotel was very easy to miss, but thanks to a comment from another reviewer we found this easily. The receptionist was friendly and quickly located our booking despite the computer system being down. The room itself was on the second floor and was small but as we were only staying one night, it was OK for our purposes especially as it had an en-suite shower. The definition 'newly refurbished' on the website I think referred to the new wardrobe, kettle, beds, shelving, TV, shower, sink and shower base but the actual decor and condition of the room and bathroom was in very poor condition i.e. I could barely see out of the window (dirty exterior), mouldy walls behind the wardrobe, peeling paint in the shower, stained and rusty looking tiles, scuffed walls and electrics hanging off the wall. This is a very old building which is in great need of TLC. Having said that, the room was clean, bed comfortable and shower powerful and hot but I would not recommend this hotel if you are planning more than one night or want somewhere you can spend a bit of time as the rooms are not a pleasant place to spend an extensive amount of time and there are no leisure areas to relax. The hotel was however in a very good location, in easy access of two underground stations and walking distance from lovely gardens and shops. There was a small amount of tea, coffee, sugar and milk provided in the room and clean bath towels (one each), soap and a small sachet of shower gel. The breakfast was very dissapointing. The breakfast room like the bedrooms has new tables and chairs but poor attention to maintenance. Tea, coffee and fruit juice provided but foodwise only cold, very slightly toasted bread along with jam sachets, butter sachets and wrapped cheese portions.

We complained about this and were told it'd be fixed the following day. The following day we returned to find that the main light had been fixed, but not the bedside light - okay, no big deal, at least the main light works! I went to the bathroom and low and behold, that light now no longer works! Do you think maybe they just switched the bulbs around?! So off we went to complain again, only to be told there was nothing they could do (the handyman was unavailable it seems!) and we were offered a small desk lamp to plug in and shine into the bathroom! Anyway, we come back the following day to find that yet again it still hasn't been fixed! You have to imagine the smallest bathroom in the world ever, basically you bend down to sit on the toilet and you bang your head off the sink! So to say it was very dark in there, is an understatement (oh and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even provide soap to wash your hands with after going to the toilet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c surely a basic requirement!) So we had rubbish lights throughout the stay, this doesn't include the fact that it didn't appear as though the bathroom had ever been cleaned (they obviously haven't heard of Dettol Mould and Mildew remover!) and the shower leaked all over the place! When I say leaked, I mean leaked, you could have taken a bath in it or better still a swim, had the place been bigger!! Also the pictures on the website make it look really nice, fresh and clean, well this might have been the case when it was first refurbished and opened, but certainly not anymore! It was dirty, grim and disgusting and in need of one hell of a major spring clean! Oh and another point to mention, when you pay a cheap cowboy builder to do your work for you, you get just that - a shoddy cowboy finish!! It looked like Stevie Wonder had been allowed to renovate and decorate the place! Anyway, I digress! On the final morning, I went to take a shower, only to find that there's no hot water! This is at 7:30am, after a long, hot sweaty run through Hyde Park, So I NEED a shower! If you're thinking why not just have a wash in the sink, believe me you can hardly clean your teeth in the sink, let alone any other parts of your body! So off I go downstairs in my towel, to once again complain (are you seeing a pattern here?!) and the girl comes upstairs and asks have I run it for long enough?! I've run it for 10 minutes, tried turning it off and on, up and down every other thing you can think of and it's still freezing cold! Her solution, try turning the tap on in the sink (Hmmm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Now there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a permanent solution for you!). So I have a little bit of a lukewarm shower, before the sink starts to nearly flood and my Mum has to turn the tap off, which then results in freezing cold water again! The only plus point was that this was the only time it happened, but after a weekend of rubbish, it was the final straw! Oh and when they mention breakfast, I wouldn't get too excited (toast which is thinner than a piece of paper, the hardest, driest croissants in the world and the worst waitress ever \u00e2\u20ac\u201c talk about a face like a smacked bottom!), and would actually recommend going to Tesco's along the road! The staff were all Polish, however (apart from one of them, who didn't speak much English and wasn't very helpful - why work in an English hotel, if you don't speak English?!) I found them nice and as helpful as they can be when working in the Polish equivalent of Fawlty Towers in London!!!! The only thing it had going for it, was that it was next to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, my favourite parts of London, hence choosing it, so I could go running every morning, but I'm afraid that is its only positive point! Would I stay there again - NEVER - Not even if you paid me and I had the best room in the house - if they even have such a thing!

We complained but everyone just shrugged, we were given an e-mail. I felt so awful as a group of Spanish holiday makers eat white toast that must have given such a dreadful impression of hospitality. The heating came out of the air-conditioning and made a noise so couldn't sleep with it on. Thin duvet- waking up to a dirty shower with occasional hot water. I want to know how the hotel was awarded 3 stars it shouldn't be given 1.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cbad hotel\u201d", "Author": "astria57", "ReviewID": "UR11147489", "Content": "The room was very small but beding was clean staff was very hard to understand Shower was broken the bathroom was so small there was no room to swing a cat.

Good price but small room with the most basic of facilities provided e.g. one towel, one small soap, one pillow and one mug but no glass to drink from. The air conditioning worked and was a blessing as it was a hot night and my room on the top floor was very warm. If you opened the window you could hear the loud noise from the street below all night, so it was best not to have to do that. The best things are that it is close to the Bayswater Tube, there are good restaurants and bars nearby, the decor is modern and I thought most of it seemed very clean. I did find some things irritating though including the hairdryer and TV remote not working in my room. Most things weren't the effort to complain about as, from the 4th floor, you had to walk down steep flights of stairs (no lift) to get to reception. The breakfast was very basic and seemed to mainly be help-yourself in style. The staff did not go out of their way to help me when all I asked for was a cup of coffee. This was the same attitude on departure when noone even acknowledged me when I went to give in my key. Other gripes included a member of staff smoking in the dining area (now illegal!). Apart from that everything was fine!!!! Glad it was only one night. Such a shame that London hotels are so poor in service and quality compared to the rest of the country. What a bad impression they must give to overseas visitors. This could be a fantastic hotel and presumably a profitable business if the owners/managers just made a very few adjustments to their service.", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich", "Title": "\u201cDon't panic!\u201d", "Author": "zurich67", "ReviewID": "UR8256791", "Content": "I read the reviews of this hotel and simply had to say something... I go to London once or twice every year and being on a very tight budget, I am forever searching for the ultimate deal in hotel rooms. In 15 years, the Royal Hyde Park was the best hotel my budget could buy in London. If you think you can find better for this kind of money, you are very wrong. I stayed for several nights last year and I had a private shower/bathroom, the room was clean, the staff was polite and attentive and I felt safe. These are in my opinion the basic requirements that budget hotels should meet and this one does. The room even had the bonus of tea & coffee making facilities and a tv. Plus the location is great if very noisy: close to Hyde park and all the basic shopping for regular visitors (M&S, Boots) on your doorstep. Lots of restaurants, and a shopping centre with a cinema complex inside. If you expect things like edible breakfast, rooms large enough to walk around the bed, bathrooms big enough for two people to stand in, quiet nights, American style service etc., then save up and go and pay for three stars upwards, as anything beneath will not ever provide what you are looking for.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "2", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shropshire", "Title": "\u201cDream destination, (not)!\u201d", "Author": "Travelswithasuitcase", "ReviewID": "UR8185583", "Content": "The Royal Hyde Park Hotel is a dream destination if you have nightmares! Payment is requested before you even see the room which is probably just as well, as you would probably change your mind if you saw the room first. The very small twin room we had was grimy though the bed linen was clean. You had to walk sideways round the beds as there wasn't enough room to walk normally. There were a variety of broken light fixtures hanging from the wall but the bedside lights eventually were coaxed to perform. The shower was held up by a rubber band twisted round the water pipe and secured by a small pencil. The water control of the shower was faulty and when turned off switched itself back on, gradually increasing the water flow until it was fully on. The noisy hot water running in the bathroom lent the unpleasantly sweaty humidity of a sauna to the room. The process was repeated at regular intervals throughout the night! A complaint to the management simply brought someone who turned the shower off and therefore \"fixed\"it! The language barrier was a real problem in this situation. Breakfast was a croissant which was fine and weak coffee. Don't go there!
