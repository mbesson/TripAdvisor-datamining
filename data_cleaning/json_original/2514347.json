The hotel itself isn't bad - but there are definitely some things to keep in mind when considering it. The staff members: They were great, ESPECIALLY the guys at the door and the housekeeping staff. One doorman actually ran up the block to 10th to get us a cab, which was really above and beyond. The front desk people weren't quite as great, but one of them helped me out with a map when I asked him. The location: OK but not fantastic - it was a solid 15-20 minute walk to either the subway at 34th or 23rd, and before we got wise to having the cabs drop us off on the corner of 27th/10th or 27th/11th, we got overcharged by them looping around due to the one way streets. The street itself is strange - a Lamborghini dealership next to a high class strip club next to a trendy Italian restaurant. But it was quirky and we liked that it was a little grittier than the heavily touristy areas. And the tasty Italian food directly across the street from the hotel was a definite plus. The hotel: The lobby is nice. The bar was expensive even for NY (probably due to the limited options of anything else nearby), and nothing special. We would have LOVED to check out the rooftop bar and pool area, even just for the views, but it was closed. That was a huge bummer for us, since so much of the advertising for this hotel is based around its awesome rooftop views. If they had the roof open, just at least for those, it would have been nice. The free wi-fi for the whole hotel was a very nice perk, but I also wish there had been a gym (even just a couple treadmills would work) for guests. The room: The rooms are small. But again, that's expected in NY. And, expect to be getting up close and personal with your roommate, if you have one. If I'd been traveling alone, or with my significant other, the room would have been fine. But I was with a friend, and let's just say it's a good thing we're close. This is not the place to stay with people you're not familiar with. There is no desk in the room, just a ledge and a green stool. There are no chairs, except for a ridiculous black patent faux-leather bean bag chair that is terribly uncomfortable and awkward for anyone over 110 lbs. The beds, however, are CRAZY comfy! It's a good thing we were mainly using the room to sleep, because that was one of the best features of the room. There was a decent sized closet, also. The bathroom: The shower has transparent glass walls, and you can see straight through to the toilet if the shower curtain isn't closed. (NOT awesome on the privacy front - this is what I mean when I say expect to get up close and personal with your roommate!) There is NO counter space in the bathroom, with everything that they clutter up the small glass ledge with. There's also nowhere to put your clothes while you're in the shower, except the toilet or the floor. The towels were large and fluffy, and there were enough for both of us, which balanced out the lack of space a little bit. Overall, I don't know if I'd stay at this hotel again. If the price and situation were right, then maybe, but the lack of privacy was a real issue for us.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cWOW!!

I try to avoid anything mid-town these days and have opted for smaller, quieter hotels with the hope that I find something that offers the unique combination of style and comfort. When I read bout the Hotel Americano, I thought it seemed right up my alley - decent location near the Highline, from what i could tell a nice aesthetic and design. Prices seemed high but NY prices are always rather exorbitant so I assumed it was just par for the course. But please do not fall into the trap that I did by seeing this hotel on design blogs and assuming it's lovely and amazing. It's nothing of the sort - in fact, it's a Saturday Night Live-worth farce of a hotel. I checked out after only one night and wish I had asked for my money back - it easily goes onto my list of top worst hotels I've had to suffer through. I will say that the overall look and feel of the lobby was actually quite nice. It was a little sparse for my liking but I generally thought it wasn't too shabby. It smelled nice and had a good vibe. Cork stools, etc, are a bit dated but there was a general beauty to the simplicity. The hotel staff all seemed nice enough, but a bit lost and clueless. I felt like they were hired actors playing the part of hotel staff for the most part and dealing with them was extremely frustrating. You'd ask a question and they'd have mostly blank or slightly panicked stares. I chalked that up to the hotel being somewhat new. The room itself, however: Wow. You walk in and realize that the joke is most certainly on you. First off, the lights were controlled by a pen stuck into a hole in the wall. If you even barely nudged the pen, the lights and air control would go off. This grew frustrating in just a few hours when the pen would adjust on its own and you'd be left fumbling around in the dark. There was an inoperative fireplace hanging in the middle of the room, along with a ridiculous bean bag chair that was a glossy plastic that would have done well in art spaces 10 years ago. The sofa was low, too deep to relax in and hard as a rock. The \"chair\" by the ipad chained to the wall was a stool for a supermodel. The bed was frankly the nicest part of the room and even that required rolling out of the bed to get up given how low it is to the floor. Honestly, this place felt like one of those tacky Euro furniture stores where everything is overdesigned and overpriced and generally low quality. The bathroom was a complete joke - and as others have noted, it's basically just poorly constructed all around: from the preposterous length of the shower curtain, to the lack of any shelves to put toiletries, to the postage stamp-sized sink and ridiculous shower that basically was installed incorrectly, allowing people to look in but you unable to see out, to the too-short shower head that forced you to basically stand at the very front of the tub to get the full effect of the shower. Industrial design at its absolute worst. I asked for an ironing board and iron (btw, there is nothing more annoying that not just having one in the room at all times) and 45 mins later it showed up, only to be taken away later that night while I was out having dinner. I called to get one the next morning and it took them another 45 minutes to rustle one up. The elevator was excruciatingly slow, especially in the evenings when the rooftop bar was in full swing. And then there's the noise. You hear EVERYTHING, including a ridiculous elevator for the rooftop partygoers that actually runs right up the front of the building. Every time that sucker rose and fell, you heard it rumbling through the room. And because of the \"comfy\" concrete floors, you heard every echo of the building, every footstep of people outside, every conversation of people in the hallway, every open and close of the door. In short, this is an example of trying to fool people into believing this is what modernism is - it's sad joke foisted on people who have too much money and no taste. Cheap, non-functional, sparse decor masquerading as high design. And poorly designed rooms that may be nice to look at on websites but ridiculously impractical in person. If this is the quality of Mexico that people have come to expect, I feel sorry for those people.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNightmare experience\u201d", "Author": "anonymous159238", "ReviewID": "UR126172198", "Content": "A former New York in town for business, I was quite excited to check out the new, hip Hotel Americano. The bar scene in the lobby was hopping and breakfast at the restaurant in the morning was delicious. The room itself was ok, location a little far west. But never in my life have I had such an UNPROFESSIONAL encounter in New York. My second day I had difficulty getting the door unlocked (yes, they have physical keys and not key cards), a door which had to be yanked open to get out of the room since arrival. When I came down to say I was having trouble, I was not escorted back up but told to try again, sometimes you have to force it a little and if I still had trouble, then they would come help me. When I went back up to 'force it a little' the key quite easily broke off in the lock. This resulted in me be locked out of my room, without access to any of my belongings for nearly 15 hours. The front desk had no idea how to handle the situation. In New York City, where you can get anything at anytime, they insisted there was no one who could help until the engineer arrived at 8am the next morning. For some reason a 24hr locksmith wouldn't do the trick? I was given another room and only after asking was I given contact lense solution (but no case... if I needed a case could I call back to the front desk again?) and a tooth brush. At one point they even asked me if I had tweezers they could borrow to try and get the key out???? No breakfast or coffee offered immediately the next morning. The engineer who was promised to arrive at 8am didn't arrive until after 10am. At no point was a manager available after repeated demands to speak to one. Eventually, after the engineer broke the door, a locksmith was called. The only reason any of this was done was thanks to the kind and attentive doorman, Leonardo. In a City where superior client service is the norm and not the exception, I could not believe that their was not a manager on duty or called in immediately to handle this, nor did the front desk staff seemed to have any sort of training to handle anything more than passing out keys and taking credit cards.

Modernity with a little frill. Rather than concentrating on the modern interiors of the hotel, the concept behind allows for a rehashing of the definitions of modernity. It derives that utilitarian aspect of providing only the necessary of luxuries without overburdening the visitor with hotel formalities.

We'd planned to stay for two nights, but couldn't wait to escape this morning. Now comfortably ensconced elsewhere. Where do I begin to describe the horrible experience we had -- four of us, in two adjacent rooms? Our experience was similar to that described earlier by MaureenColorado. She wrote, \"The hotel's designer seemed to mistake cheap, sparse decor for good design.\" Please don't let the photos of the rooms on the hotel's website -- or elsewhere -- fool you. A bare concrete floor looks quite nice in a photo, but actually living in a room with a concrete floor is a bit like sleeping in Costco. There are (essentially) no chairs in the room. The stool beneath the teeny, tiny desk is impractical -- nobody could actually sit on it. And the beanbag chair isn't soft, and doesn't envelop you. You sort of sit against it, rather than in it. Totally useless. So your choice is to sit on the bed -- on the floor. There was a peculiar lamp hanging over one side of the bed, with probably a 20 watt bulb. But the switch for the lamp was on the other side of the bed. The other choice was the florescent light bulbs behind the bed -- but they were incredibly bright, and could not be dimmed. The bed -- essentially on the floor -- was surprisingly comfortable, but the sheets were too small and instantly became untucked. The bathroom was awful. It reminded me of a concrete version of a bathroom on an Amtrak train. Tiny shower cubicle, tiny sink, tiny shelf -- and very weak lighting. The towels were on a shelf at least (and I mean this) seven feet above the ground. I'm 6'2\" and almost couldn't reach the towels. Her Ladyship is 5'6\" and couldn't reach them at all. With so little light in the bathroom there's no way to put on make-up. Although we booked two double rooms, each only had one robe, and one pair of slippers. (Remember the floors are cold, bare concrete.) We had an iPad in our room -- chained to the wall -- but someone had apparently left with the device that charges it, so the battery was all but dead. There was no battery in the clock in my sister's room. We could not control the air conditioning or heating. The rooms had one temperature -- hot. In his reply to MaureeenColorado, Will Jordan wrote, \"should you come back this way again at some point in the future, we will have the stool in your room replaced with a chair from our office.\" That's exactly what they finally did for us -- they brought us two desk chairs, vintage Staples. They were comfortable, but hardly gem\u00fctlichkeit. The hotel does not have parking. You need to go two blocks downtown -- yourself -- and park your car in a parking lot. This was explained to me ahead of time. Dinner was actually very good, and our waitress was very friendly and efficient. It was the only nice part of our short stay. But we then found we didn't have any hot water in either of the rooms, and at breakfast the next morning we encountered the snooty waitress from hell. Burnt croissants, no cream cheese (I had to send them out to buy some -- which they did, without much grace). The lack of hot water, hotel-wide, put us way, way over the tipping point -- and we checked out a day early. The hotel did not charge us for our stay -- which was gracious of them. Too bad they couldn't give me back a day of my life. Her Ladyship and I have stayed at the Adam & Eve Hotel in Turkey. It, too, has concrete floors and low-down beds -- but somehow it seems to (generally) work at the Adam & Eve, and doesn't work at all here. This hotel is definitely, absolutely NOT for people like us -- in our early 60's. It's not for families. This is a hotel for young couples -- it looks like it's the perfect place for an out-of-the-way assignation. (Who will know you on West 27th Street? I've lived in Manhattan for years, and have never set foot on this block of West 27th Street until yesterday.) But if you're planning an assignation here -- you'd better hope that the lady likes showers rather than baths, likes sleeping on the floor, and doesn't need light in the bathroom to put on her make-up.

Stylishly appointed but as another reviewer pointed out, that\u2019s not the same thing as stylishly designed. The concrete floors and uncomfortable furniture are less than inviting, and if you frequent boutique hotels when you travel there\u2019s nothing here that you haven\u2019t seen before. On the bright side, there\u2019s a beautiful rooftop terrace with bar service and a seating area cleverly separated by the elevator bank from a small, heated pool and lounge area. The space isn\u2019t lush but it is relaxing and the views are fantastic. The staff members I dealt with from the lobby up to the rooftop were always professional and accommodating. Location-wise if you value being close to the Highline (right next door) and Meatpacking district (kill me), this hotel is ideally situated, otherwise it\u2019s a bit far-flung. Usually hotels this far west compensate with a better price than more centrally located hotels, but not this one. The reason I\u2019m giving Hotel Americano only two stars is because of the inferior construction that I believe went into the building\u2019s renovation. The plumbing is so incredibly noisy, and the walls and doors so incredibly thin that I was besieged with noises all weekend long. The sound of running water behind the walls from other guests using their toilets and showers was as audible as if only a sheet separated our rooms, and every conversation in the hallway, including the SHOUTS for service from housekeeping at 9:30am were enough to keep me on the edge of sleep all weekend. When I weekend in New York it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that both evenings I will be half-drunk, hard to keep awake after 2am, and even harder to wake before 10am that same day. In other words, it takes a lot for me to not get a good night\u2019s sleep, but I could not sleep at Hotel Americano. Along those same lines of bad construction and/or design, the bathroom kind of stank. The drainage and ventilation system were poorly thought out or installed, because the bathroom never dried out. I can brook these unpleasantries in an economy hotel, but it\u2019s unacceptable at this price point.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cThis is a review of the restaurant ONLY\u201d", "Author": "onestopnyc", "ReviewID": "UR119071271", "Content": "I am a local and had the pleasure of eating at the restaurant within the hotel. They had only been open for a week or so and the level of service and the quality of the food were excellent. We had a party of four, were seated promptly, everyone in the staff was pleasant and professional. I had the steak tartare followed by a grilled duck with figs for the main course and we shared an excellent bottle of red from Oregon. Add two desserts for the table and the check was just over $100 pp with tip and taxes. The Chef has worked at Ducasse and Daniel Boulud's restaurants in the past and some of us were working (or still are) in the food industry and loved our experience there. It's a small space so reservations are a probably a good ideas, while they will certainly take walk-ins.

The hotel's designer seemed to mistake cheap, sparse decor for good design. Yes they were trying to work with small paces, but aside from the large windows providing light, there was nothing that constituted good design. Lighting was dark in the bathroom, and in the bedroom it was poor. There were no chairs except for an uncomfortable felt-covered stool and a black vinyl bean-bag chair. The hotel had just opened yet already the shower seemed to be backed up and a light was broken. Storage in the bathroom was non-existent. Front desk staff was friendly and felt slippers were provided to shield feet from cold hard concrete floors.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cYou'll either love or hate the rooms, some problems with this new hotel\u201d", "Author": "Popepys", "ReviewID": "UR118572670", "Content": "Stayed here for one night while travelling on business. The hotel is very cool with an excellent rooftop bar. However, you'll either love or hate the rooms. Super modern with an iPad to entertain you in every room. But the concrete floor, bean bag for a chair and somewhat dark atmosphere even with all the lights turned on won't be to everyone's tastes. The bed is low down and more like a fouton but was reasonably comfortable. Biggest problem was a few inexcusable issues with this new hotel. No rail or hangers in my cupboard left me with nowhere to hang my suit! No hair dryer in the room. No coffee in the room, although there was a mini bar. These glitches were pretty annoying for the price but hopefully they will sort them out. The staff were very friendly and helpful, but the rooftop bar closed at 11pm which for such a trendy hotel was a bit annoying when coming back from dinner. Overall, you'll only like this place if you are into super modern hotels and can put up with some of the glitches.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Americano", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d2151571-Reviews-Hotel_Americano-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$293 - $627*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">518 W 27th St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10001</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514347", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f2/40/f24009879417289372e56b81c6aebd2a1large.jpg"}}
