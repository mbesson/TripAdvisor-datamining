The Savannah House Hotel was a good place to stay. The price was reasonable and the accomodations were fine. The room was a bit smaller than I am used to, especially for a suite. We were a bit cramped with a king size bed and a pack and play in the room, but it was fine. It was comfortable and you really aren't going to spend a lot of time in the room anyway in Branson. The hotel is split into two sections, and we stayed in the back section, which is a seperate building. It had its own pool and food services, so you could get the complementary breakfast and late snacks in either building. The food was standard hotel breakfast fare, which is fine. They did have sausage gravy one morning that was a pleasant surprise. The room had easy open doors on both the room and the bathroom. What I mean is that my two year old could easily open them. I have to wonder if that was intentional, with so many older visitors to Branson if they purposely made the doors easier to open? We just set our suitcase in front of the room door and it was fine.

Good selection of cereals, yogurts, breads, and beverages, plus the make-them-yourself waffles were better than most I've tried. A real treat were the cobblers (berry and peach when I was there), ice cream, and cookies available between 9-11 pm each night. I don't recommend the chocolate syrup, but the rest was wonderful.

It was an okay place to stay, and I might give it another try someday down the road, but my first stay did not exceed my expectations. The location of the hotel is good, it is off the strip, and it is easy to get to stores and gas stations, without having to go through the traffic on the strip. The hotel is quite beautiful from the outside, with plenty of places to sit throughout the grounds, giving it sort of a cozy feel. Check in was easy, the front desk clerk was friendly. We were placed in the main building, so after we checked in, we drove to the back of the building, parked, and entered the building through the back door. Inside the hallway, there was a huge fan blowing onto the floor... drying it out, I assume. Our room looked pretty clean... not spotless, but clean. There were stains on the carpet, and there was a bit of dust in the shower. The room had an odd, unpleasant smell to it, and the bedspread on one of the beds smelled like dirty feet. The beds were pretty comfortable. There was no refrigerator or microwave, though they are available for an extra charge. It wasn't easy finding a place to plug in cell phone chargers, there was only one free outlet that was somewhat easy to get to. Plugging in anything additional required a lamp or clock to be unplugged. The tv was old style. The decor was good. The toilet seemed like it had trouble flushing. I could see my car from the window, which was comforting. The cobbler, cookies, and ice cream each night at 9 was a nice treat. The cobbler was delicious. The first night, they had peach and berry. The next night, they had cherry and blackberry. Topped with a bit of ice cream, it was delicious. The dining area was spacious and comfortable, and always clean. The breakfast was good: Two varieties of scrambled eggs (plain and with ham), a better than average bread selection, Krispy Kreme doughnuts, yogurt, fruit (peaches and mixed fruit), oatmeal, cereal, biscuits and gravy, and a few other things. The coffee was excellent. The orange juice tasted watered down. Coffee, cappuccino, hot chocolate, and ice water were available in the lobby at all times, which was really nice. Again, the coffee was good. The pool was a little on the small side, but was clean. There was one pool per building, both were outside pools. Check out was easy, and the staff throughout the entire stay were pleasant and helpful. I might stay at this hotel again, perhaps the other building is newer and better taken care of. This hotel has a lot of potential, but they need to do some updating of their building... fix the slow toilet, fix whatever it was that caused the hallway floor to need to be dried out with a powerful fan, launder their bedding on a regular basis, and perhaps lower their prices a bit.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cOut of the crowds!\u201d", "Author": "Agape4u", "ReviewID": "UR135493467", "Content": "We like to stay at Savannah House in Branson when we go down for conferences and church events.

The location is really very good, located off the Branson strip but with plenty of options to get to the theaters and other touristy stuff. If you're just looking for food or someplace to shop, it's a quick no-hassle trip from the hotel. The room (a double queen) was clean with a nice bathroom including iron and hairy dryer. It was a bit worn, with scuff marks and divots taken out of the wall where furniture had hit it in years past. The bed was slightly below average in comfort. I wish motels would do away with bedspreads that can't possibly be laundered between guests. The room smelled strongly of fresh paint, which isn't an awful smell when you're repainting your own house but not exactly pleasing at a motel. I left the door open and ran the A/C and it eventually faded. The A/C worked very well. The TV (a Zenith CRT) was fine with a selection of about four dozen channels. The welcome was fine. The staff indicated that my room was in \"our other building\" which immediately set off alarm bells, but the buildings looked similar in their amenities, with a slight edge to the \"primary\" building depicted in the pictures. The internet did not work upon arrival; one could connect to the network (Savannah5, Savannah11, Savannah7, and so on - they should really tie these together!), but the network did not have internet access. I tried with two devices. I called the front desk and they didn't seem to understand the issue. Several hours later after getting back from dinner I tried again and it worked. The following morning it did not work again. The pools are quite small but they got a lot of use by the other guests. The \"fitness center\" appeared to be a tiny room with three cardio machines. The cobbler and cookies are a nice treat, but don't expect too much. The ice cream is the soft-serve variety. Breakfast is fine - typical egg product, biscuits and gravy, cereals, yogurt, juice, and make-your-own waffles. It won't win any awards but if you need to fill your belly for a long drive it will do the trick. One good feature is that the place seems quite soundproof. I know there were neighbors on either side but didn't hear so much as a peep, bang, or flush the entire time. All in all, it's a fine place to spend the night, and reasonably priced.

We rarely got stuck in a traffic jam and were never late for a show going the back way all the time. CONS: Parking is on a steep hill both sides of the hotel, if you drive around back you can park on a level surface, but then must enter on the second floor and walk the full length of the hotel to get to elevators, hallways for elevators narrow and hard to manuever luggage carts sometimes, especially when people are waiting to take elevators, breakfast was ok, but not great in our opinion. Eggs, that come in a bulk bag and cooked so they taste like egg beaters instead of real eggs, sausage gravy from a can, biscuits that don't stay hot, canned fruit, ie peaches, boxed donuts, waffles, you make either blueberry or vanilla malt.

We had one of the Presidential Suites (2 bedrooms, living room & kitchen) and a double room. We were traveling with 6 adults & 3 children. First off, check in was easy, front desk staff were very friendly & helpful. Rooms were very clean. The presidental suite had 2 bathrooms, one of which had a huge jacuzzi tub. AWESOME! Full kitchen, with small oven. Warning, if you are baking pizzas, be sure to turn the exhaust fan on. We managed to set off our smoke detector! Pool was nice, not huge, but nice. The kids thought it was fantastic. They have warm cobbler, cookies & ice cream in the evenings. All three were great. Breakfast was abundant with food, lots of choices, and unlike a lot of hotels that offer a full breakfast, this place replentishes food as it runs out. It is one of my pet peeves when a hotel lets the food run out and doesn't attempt to replace it. Hotel is very close to one of the outlet malls. It is a few minutes drive from \"the strip\" area and other attractions, but that is fine with me. Less noise that way. Easy to navigate the are from the hotel's location. Check out was smooth. Waited a couple of minutes because the front desk clerk had to use his cell phone to dial 911 because the hotel phone wouldn't dial it for some reason. Someone had fallen into a diabetic coma in their room and a family member had called the desk. He handled the situation very well,:calm, professional, helpful. I was impressed. Hopefully the gentleman will be OK. One recommendation for the area: rent a pontoon boat and go out on Table Rock Lake. The water is so clean and warm.

After hours of searching hotel reviews, we settled on the Savannah House. It was a good decision. Originally reserved for one night, we arrived a day early without a reservation. The hotel staff was courteous and placed us across the hall from the Jacuzzi suite that we had reserved for the following day. The room was nice, although the building that it was in smelled of paint due to the current construction. The beds were clean and comfortable as well of the rest of the room. The evening reception consists of cobblers, a soft serve ice cream machine, and various cookies. Coffee and other items are always available in the lobby. It was a nice treat. Breakfast was nice, as well. Scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs with ham, buscuits and gravy, donuts, cereal, and other items were available. It was very crowded when we came down for breakfast, but the workers were quick to restock everything. Checkout was at 1pm. I explained to the front desk that we were changing rooms for the night and they cleaned the Jacuzzi suite early so that we could move over before the 1pm check-out time. Jonathan was a big help in this process. He even offered to have someone help transfer our bags to the new room. I would definitely reccomend the Jacuzzi suite. It was nice to relax in the Jacuzzi as well as the comfy recliner. As recommended by a previous review, we parked on the upper part of the lot which had less of an incline. That was helpful when using the cart to load and unload the car.

We paid $54.00 midweek for a king room. We used a coupon from one of those travel magazines we picked up at the Missouri Welcome Center. Good points include a large room with a nice leather recliner, a table and two chairs. The property was very clean and freshly painted. The complimentary breakfast includes scrambled eggs, bisquits, bagels, yogurt and a belgian waffle maker that guests can use to make fresh waffles. However, it lacked fresh fruit - they only had canned peaches and fruit cocktail. From 9:00 - 11:00 pm they served ice cream and cobbler in the lobby. The ice cream was the soft serve kind - very creamy and similar to Dairy Queen. It was a nice touch although we probably could have done without the extra calories. We stayed in the rear building so had to walk to the main hotel for breakfast and dessert. We stayed from Sunday through Wednesday and were one of the few guests in the rear building so it was very quiet. There were several negatives about the property and if it were not for the low price we would have found another hotel. The beds were very firm - not the pillow top mattresses found at Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express. There were no coffee makers in the room and we had to go to the lobby for coffee. The iron cord was bolted to the wall so I had to iron in the bathroom with the ironing board straddling the toilet to make room. The bathroom was small with little counter space and the shower head was mounted so low we had to duck to wash our hair. The AC vents were on the ceiling blowing cold air right at our heads. The thermostat seemed to be broken - even when set at 90 the AC would not stop. I'm a mid 50's menopausal woman and I don't usually ever get cold but I was freezing!!! Also, this property is pretty far away from the action in town and it took us a couple of days to get our bearings.

So we want to be clear that this review is more about Savannah House not meeting or exceeding our personal expectations than it is about the quality or value of Savannah House in general. That being said, we offer our story. We stayed here for our anniversary. This was our first trip to Branson, so we were choosing hotels blind. Tho we were very encouraged by the majority of the reviews, (after all, it had the #2 rating when we were looking!) we wanted to make sure the hotel understood this was a special occasion and a first trip for us. So I PERSONALLY talked to Scott (the Man in charge) about the reason for our visit and the type of room we were looking for before making a reservation. I ended that conversation with renewed confidence in our decision to stay there. (I should add that the reservations were made well in advance of our arrival date.) After a 7 hour drive (and being stranded just outside Branson for another hour + due to an accident) we arrived very tired late that afternoon/early evening. You can just imagine our dismay (many other emotions played as well!) on discovering we had been given the ONLY room in the hotel with a window looking dead on at a pool filled with kids. If it had been a door, we could have walked right out and jumped in! There could not have been a noisier or less private room. Understandably, acceptable noise level in a pool area is much different than what is acceptable anywhere else, and we would have preferred the choice be ours as to WHEN the curtains needed to be closed or how much shrieking and yelling we wanted right outside our window. A very rude front desk would/could do nothing at first . Our [what should have been unneccessary] polite but firm persistence finally led to an offer of a handicap accessible room 2 doors down from where we were. We took what we could get. Basics, like complimentary toiletries are an industry standard in even the most price sensitive chains; but a little foil shampoo sample and tiny bar of soap was as good as it gets here. Nit picky? Perhaps-but it is also intended as a heads up for others who have become accustomed to not having to pack basic toiletries! The common dining room was clean and spacious. We never made it back in time to partake of the cobbler and ice cream offerings so will defer to past reviewer comments. We are more fruit, eggs and toast breakfast people and less of doughnut/pastry/cereal eaters so we cannot comment on the complimentary breakfast either. Then again, the complimentary breakfast was not a deciding factor for us. Being somewhat lazy in the mornings, we would have preferred not having to leave our room to get that first cup of coffee in the morning. Again, not the end of the world. But fueling the experience were our dashed expectations after taking that walk to the breakfast area and finding the coffee barely luke warm and extremely weak. Understand, our displeasure is not with Branson, which we cannot wait to visit again, or with any of the shows, which were awesome (Dixie Stampede and Branson Landing is a must see and do!) or even with the hotel in general-which was relatively clean and easily located. After all, the majority of our time was spent outside of the hotel. No our disappointment is with the questionable integrity and customer service policies of the Savannah House management and staff. And those will keep us from recommending Savannah House to anyone else. .", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "camden ,ar", "Title": "\u201cLoved it !\u201d", "Author": "topher5402", "ReviewID": "UR8615933", "Content": "The savannah house is indeed a nice hotel !

Wasn't sure how Savannah House would work out but after reading some positive reviews, thought we would try it. Actually, we were lucky to find something as it was the Summer Car Cruise in Branson and some of the other hotels were sold out. Savannah House is away from the main strip so traffic wasn't really a problem at all. The room was clean, comfortable and the price was definitely right. Nice touches included the 20 item breakfast - we loved that. It was also quite nice to return from a show and enjoy blackberry or peach cobbler with soft serve ice cream in the evening. We've never stayed someplace that offered that special touch, so kudos to Savannah House for coming up with that nice touch of hospitality. The staff was courteous and accommodating. The pool was on the small side but it offered a refreshing way to beat the heat and our kids (11, 9) didn't complain. We saw two shows during our stay in Branson. The Hamner & Barber Variety Show was quite close to the Savannah House and there were absolutely no problems with traffic. It was a great show - very entertaining - with the comedic antics of ventriloquist Jim Barber and the mesmerizing illusions of Dave Hamner. There was some singing and dancing too and we all enjoyed ourselves. The next night we went to Presley's Country Jubilee which was a colossal disappointment. Seems they've been resting on their 40 year laurels too long. The talent was mediocre at best. Many of the performers were wooden and just not very entertaining. We left early to try and beat traffic on 76. But overall, a fine family getaway.
