The staff is great and all the services provided were great. Rooms are really spacious, excellent bed. Shower is very good but it was hard to open it in my first days, it was fixed but reveals that there are some basic infrastructure issues that should be dealt with or maybe become a hazard in the long run: in particular, as many reviews have mentioned the carpet in the room is sure to be a low point, it is old, and it should be either removed or changed. TV also does not have many options in English channells, and there is a limited offer of sports and movies channel. Location is great, near both metro stations (Plaza de Espana and Ventura Rodrigues) and within a walking distance from many restaurants, movie theaters, fast food options and a supermaket located in Calle Princesa, inside the El Corte Ingles. It is just a 5-10 minute walk and the store is complete, including, added to market, food court, clothes, supplies and so on. Also, if you feell like walking you can reach the major attractions in Madrid from there, including the Gran Via, Plaza Mayor, Debod Temple, it is 15-30min uphill, but not that difficult. In the morning, I had breakfast at the hotel, the buffet, and options are quite good. Although you have several options outside, it is much more confortable to eat inside, in particular if you have to leave early in the morning (and things in Madrid tend to open after 8-9am). It is not worth the trouble even for the price, since the hotel offers three choices, buffet or two fast meals which are cheaper. I would definitly stay here again, but the hotel should be more attentive to the carpet issue and some other maintainance things regarding the air conditiong (it works, but, I for instance, like it cooler than I managed to get).", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "MONNA22", "ReviewID": "UR134653186", "Content": "I stayed for 4 days in this hotel and it was really great.

We really enjoyed this hotel as it is close to everything you could possibly want to be close to in Madrid. Positives: 1. Location. Sandwiched between two metro stops, plaza de espana and Ventura Rodriguez. 2. Easy to get to by metro from the airport. Take pink line to nuevos ministerios and transfer to line 10 to plaza de espana. This journey takes between 30-40 minutes but is so easy. 3. Metro. When you arrive at the airport you can buy a 5 day pass for 25 euro. 4. Room was a great size for the price in Europe. The balcony was a bonus. 5. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel as there is a bunch of places like Starbucks and te y cafe located 1 minute away by foot in a nice office tower square. Also a McDonald's and burger king in the same square as well as a few tapas places. 6. Staff were friendly and provided some helpful tips - I.e. go to mercado de San Miguel for a great experience near plaza del sol. And if you want to go to the bull fighting in plaza del toros just go buy your tickets on the day of the event. 7. Best toilet paper I've ever used in a hotel ever and that says a lot given it is in Europe! 8. 12:00 check out. Not so positive 9. There is no kettle in the room if you like to make tea or coffee, but we were ok with starbucks nearby. 10. We did not eat breakfast here, mostly due to one of our travelers need for non gluten food items. It is typical European style and not really what we look for in a breakfast but the food on display did look good. Overall: Madrid was one of the best cities we've visited in Europe this year.

Heavy door with innner hallway and second inner door. We never heard anyone. - Room security: Excellent secure lock on door. The safe was the largest I've ever seen and I could fit my laptop in it easily. - Cleanliness: Very clean - Heating / AirCon / Water temp and pressure: All good - Breakfast: Excellent variety of food choices including fresh cut fruit, yoghurts, whole wheat bread, capuccinos. Best part, staff kept restocking the food....even asking us if we wanted anything else at 11am when the breakfast ends. - Location: excellent To improve: - Breakfast: oddly they charge extra (2 Euro) for eggs - suggest they could include eggs in the price, as the baccon and other hot items are included. - Front desk staff: Sometimes seemed to look a bit surly, but once you engaged them in conversation, they seemed to warm up and then they seemed friendly. - When a renovation is planned, lighter color choices in the lobby would help.

The hotel was convieniently located between the two Metro stations, Ventura Rodreiguez and Plaza de Espana it is about a five minuite walk from either. The hotel is located in the heart of plaza de espana, filled with local restaurants such as Saaron Tapas, Gino's Italian Restaurant as well as a McDonald's, Burger King and Starbucks. The area itself is pleasant and is located near the Red Bus Tour bus stop -- aimed at tourists. Upon arrival we were greeted by the receptionists who seemed polite and friendly and showed willingness to help. We had read reviews on here stating that you may be able to get a balcony room -- unfortunately there was only smoking balcony rooms at time of arrival however the staff were able to cater for us, placing us into rooms on the 4th floor which had a connecting door to each room, ideal for families booking two twin/double rooms. The hotel had a pleasant scent throughout and had period features such as the lifts and old fashioned telephones, the hotel had luxorious thick carpets. The room was located to the side and was overlooking a block of flats. It also had a shower which had instant hot water and plenty of towels, in addition to a face cloth which had lavender placed on the top. The room had 3 telephones, one in the bathroom, the desk and bedside -- calls to other rooms are free. The room also had an electronic safe and minibar which was \u20ac3.50 per item however there is a vending machine in the lobby which is much cheaper (around \u20ac1).

Breakfast -- it is advertised around the hotel that you get 3 croissants and a drink for \u20ac2.75 or a larger serving for \u20ac5 -- the picture is deceptive and makes the portions look bigger, there is no differention to the menu (eg. You can't swap the coffee for orange juice). The hotel does serve a breakfast however it costs \u20ac14 and it is contiental -- this is the only negative point as this price is too high based on choices avaliavble.

My review is based on only one night at the hotel. When I went to check in for my week in Madrid my scheduling error was discovered. So I only stayed at this hotel for one night, but it was a very good introduction to Madrid. The hotel is hard to find, but my limited Spanish helped me get there. I arrived and slept most of the day, but when I needed food the Swan was located just across the street. The manager was Ramon the night I went in, and The Swan became my return to reference point for my Madrid trip. They poured an excellent Guinness as well as Black and Tan, served up tasty tapas every time I went there (almost daily), and the restaurant upstairs had a strong menu and wine list. The Mercure rooms are old, the carpets threadbare, the balcony outside the units has an odd tilt as did most of the balconies there. The breakfast buffet, usually included in the room price, ends each day at the minute and second advertised, beware if you sleep late which I did. Even though the hotel is worn it was a nice place. My room had a balcony overlooking The Swan restaurant and one of the local plazas, and it was a good view. However, on the American Airlines site the hotel Mercure is more expensive than Hotel Liabeny, which I ultimately stayed at, and the Hotel Liabeny is a far better hotel than the Hotel Mercure.

The building was very nice, some of the reviews here say it \"needs updating\" but I loved the classic style of it. Also the hall always smelled like it had just been cleaned. Staff was quite friendly and everything was very clean. GETTING THERE: We took the pink Metro line 8 at the airport* to the last stop (Nuevos Ministerios) and then got on the blue line 10 there and got off at stop Plaza d'Espa\u00f1a. From there it was just a short walk to the hotel. At Plaza d'Espana you could take the yellow line 3 and blue line 10, and also line 2 but for that you had to walk quite a way underground. *Look out because there are two stops at the airport: there's \"Aeropuerto T1-T2-T3\", which is where you have to get on/off if you come from that part of the airport (I think those are for national flights), but you get on/off at \"Aeropuerto T4\" if you come from T4 (we came from Belgium and that was our stop, so I guess that's just international flights). \"Aeropuerto T4\" is line 8's final stop, so if you have to get off there, that's very easy, you just stay on the Metro until the last stop. Also, when you go back from the hotel to the airport, you can't just get out of the Metro and in the airport; you have to buy a new ticket at the vending machines upstairs from the Metro at the airport. It's because they ask a 1 euro fee per person if you want to go to the airport with the Metro. FOOD: We had breakfast at the hotel. This was a nice buffet, not extremely large but good. We asked them where we could go have dinner and they told us we could to to C\u00e0scaras, which was very close to the hotel. We had dinner there on the last evening and it was great, so that was a really good tip. You could also have food brought up to your room, like a hamburger, pizza or pasta (there was a \"menu\" on the table in our room). I never did this so I don't know if it's good, but the price was OK so I guess it's worth a try :) ROOM: As I said before, it was clean and nice. We got shampoo/conditioner and shower/bath gel in the bathroom and there were clean towels every day (even though this wasn't necessary) and a hairdryer in the bathroom. There were no shower caps, so bring your own if you need one. In the bedroom there was a small table and a comfy chair, a desk with chair, and a TV. Our beds were comfortable and extra cushions and blankets were in the closet. Our closet was in the hallway and had a safe and a minibar. Everything in the minibar costs 3,5 euros, which I thought was quite expensive, so it's cheaper to go to the lobby and buy food or drinks at the vending machine since it's much cheaper there. SURROUNDINGS: The hotel is close to the Plaza d'Espa\u00f1a and you can take a walk to the Palazo Real from there. DOWNSIDE: The only thing I didn't like was that the room was very hot when we just arrived, it felt like the heating was on but it wasn't. But that got better when we turned the \"heating\" on and put it on 10\u00b0, when the colder air started blowing into our room it got a lot more agreeable.

Let's get them out of the way first. Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment. Although there was a reasonably good choice of hot and cold buffet (with some lovely local ham!), the coffee was a bit of a problem. Coffee came only from a single self-service coffee machine. I was there at the same time as a number of elderly people who were obviously struggling to operate the machine, so I had to wait for quite a while before the machine was available. It didn't even make particularly nice coffee. They really need to either serve you coffee like most hotels do, or at least put in a couple of extra machines. Also, the kiwi fruit in the fruit selection were not ripe. But apart from that, breakfast was fine. As other contributors have noted, the bar shuts at an unreasonably early time. I came back from dinner at 10 pm expecting to be able to have a beer in the hotel bar, but it was closed. The internet connection was included in the room rate that I paid, but it looked like it was quite expensive if you didn't have it included in your rate. Do check on this when you book if you want to use the internet. Apart from that, the hotel was pretty good. It used to be a Sofitel until a couple of years ago. As you probably know, Sofitel is another brand of the Accor group, who also own the Mercure brand, but Sofitels are generally more up-market than Mercures. The overall feel of the hotel was therefore considerably classier than the average Mercure. The bedroom was a good size, and had a very modern and nicely kitted out bathroom. There was a nice big in-room safe with plenty of room for even the least compact laptops. Oh, one more very small negative point: the choice of channels on the TV was rather limited. I'd normally expect to at least be able to get BBC World or CNN, but I couldn't find either of them or indeed any English language channels. The reception staff were perfectly helpful, and I didn't have to queue for one at any time.

There were two types of cheese. There was chorizo and something else. After all, it is an Accor hotel and it is decent enough. The room was neat. We booked a room in the upper floor to enjoy the balcony and the view to the city but I think it is kind of pointless to have a balcony which is as big as the room itself if not bigger.

Easy walking distance from Plaza Espania yet also quiet as tucked just off the main road. Very friendly and efficient staff. On check in we were asked if we prefer a smoking or non-smoking room. Neither of us smoke so we said non-smoking. The receptionist however said that the smoking room had a bacony whereas the non-smoking rooms that he had available did not. We took the smoking room as the idea of a balcony sounded good and we were not disappointed. We thought this was nice of the receptionist. The room we had (410) was large (by european standards), very well appointed and clean. Same can be said for the lobby and corridors.....all seemed to have been recently refurbished in classic continental style. There is wired internet in the room or a PC station in the lobby for charge. WIFI both in the lobby and room however is free. If I had to find any negative aspects: Services within the hotel are quite limited. The room service menu is extremely limited. Literally a choice of sandwiches and the like. Not a problem for us as we had no plan to use room service with the plethora of eating options on the hotel doorstep. Also there is no bar or restaurant in the hotel (the bar aea is only open at breakfast). Tea and coffee facilities would have been nice in the room. And it seemed that perhaps they could do with an extra staff member or two. At 9pm on the Sunday night while getting ready for an evening out I realised my shirt could do with an iron. I went down to reception to ask if they had one I could borrow but the receptionist said he was the only staff member in the property at that time and couldnt leave the desk. It wasnt a huge deal for me but I could imagine that for perhaps someone that had a business dinner or similar to attend it could be an issue.

The hotel is easy to reach on foot from the Plaza De Espana metro station, providing easy access to the airport (you need to change trains twice, but it is very easy and quite fast), and the Noviciado metro station is a bit further away, but still walking distance. The area around the hotel is nice and quite lively, since there are many cafes and bars on the main street one block from the hotel, plus a little plaza one block from the hotel hosts food stores, coffee and a convenience store. You can walk to the Palace and the Opera, and take the metro to the outstanding Madrid museums. Getting to Puerta del Sol and the Plaza Mayor requires a bit more walking (25 around minutes) or two metro stops. The metro is very fast, efficient and runs late at night, so the location of the hotel works well for everything. The hotel itself is very nice, it has an old world charm and the rooms and interior decorations are on the grand side (especially the ground floor). Apart from the furniture which could do with some reworking (being chipped at many points), the room was in an excellent condition, the bathrooms were fine and the Internet access (included in the price) very satisfactory. Cleaning was meticulous. Breakfast was very good but not as excellent as in some other Mercure hotels; it could do with some more variety, although everything on offer was of excellent quality. The reception was very helpful with whatever we asked. Finally, the advance booking rates for the hotel were a real bargain for this level of hotel. Madrid tips: The center of Madrid is not so big, so if you don't mind some walking, don't buy daily metro tickets, just get a 10 trip ticket, it will last long. Get the Paseo Del Arte card and make sure you visit the three great museums (Prado, Thyssen-Bosnemisza and Centro De Arte Reina Sofia).

The room is of good size (please note that they have 2 types of standard rooms with small balcony and and without it - rooms without balcony are bigger for the size of this absent balcony - as was our room - so if you want bigger room ask for one without balcony, or go for higher category where the balcony is big and room also big), with huge and comfortable bed (when I booked this hotel was still Sofitel, changed at the end of last year to Mercure, but at the moment the bed is still the famous Sofitel bed!), the bathroom is OK, with bathtube, bidet magnifying mirror and standard Mercure amenitites, bathrobe and slippers. The buffet breakfast was of good quality, but a little overpriced as for me (18 Euros/person) taking into account that some standatd things for hotel of such class were missing (e.g. no smoked salmon or possibility to cook omelette). Also they have express breakfast option - big croissant, orange juice and coffee/tea for only 5 Euros - very convenient if you don't have time, but want to eat smth. The location of hotel is very good - 2 minutes by foot to Venturo Rodrigues metro station and 4 minutes to Plaza Espagna (were another metro station is situated), at the same time only 5 minutes by foot to Debod castle and not more than 10 minutes to Royal Palace.

The hotel itself has a really good looking lobby, but the rooms themselves are dated.

It was 23.50 euros per person, for a buffet! We decided even before arriving that it was worth a walk to find food, but there are bars which open for breakfast on the doorstep of the hotel. If you want \"chain restaurant\" fare then there is also Starbucks, MacDonalds and Burger King, as well as some large Spanish chains. There's a VIPs store which is open until 2am.

Many are outstanding and feature highly in TripAdvisor's league tables, e.g. New York, Montreal. This Sofitel in Madrid is not one of those. Overall, my 4-night stay was disappointing (compared to other Sofitels, that is), although in terms of value for money compared to other 4-star Madrid hotels, it comes out very well. The location is good, just at the western end of Gran Via, very handy for Metro stops, 100m from the Princesa cinema complex, which shows first-release movies in ENGLISH rather than appallingly dubbed into Spanish, which is the norm in Spain. The street is quiet. The building itself won't win any prizes for elegance, but I agree with other posts on this site that praise the ground floor lobby-lounge-bar-breakfast cafe area. The room was adequate in size, just, and decorated in \"traditional\" style. I greatly prefer the sleek modern Sofitel style. The bathroom was also adequate, no more, and configured in a somewhat awkward way. Do hotel guests really want bidets these days? To me thay are a complete waste of space. The Roger et Gallet toiletries are an excellent touch. What the room lacks is an armchair in which to sit and read; there is a large desk and a chair, but that's not where I would want to read a book or newspaper. Other reviews have commented on the beds: it is true, they are remarkably comfortable. What disappointed me on this stay was the service. The staff are friendly and multilingual, but requests to the front desk or housekeeping sometimes were forgotten or ignored. The night staff seem particularly stretched: for some reason, the fancy flat-screen TV in my room would not turn off at 11.30pm, so I called for assistance. The receptionist said he would come to my room \"in 10 minutes\" when he finished his shift. At 12.30am I called again, only to discover that this gentleman had \"gone home\" and his replacement was \"not allowed\" to leave the front desk. Incredibly, it seems that a 4-star, Sofitel hotel in the middle of Madrid does not provide a night security guard. Moreover, at about 1.30am, there was a knock on my door, which I answered, only to be confronted by a young man who was clearly not a paying guest, and whom I surmised may have been expecting to be paid (not by me) for his nocturnal services . . . he had been sent to the \"wrong room\".

This hotel is an easy walk from the Ventura Rodriguez metro station and a 5 minute walk from the Plaza de Espana.

There is a Mcdonalds, Burger King, Starbucks, and a few small restaurants within a 5 minute walk. Check in was easy on a Saturday afternoon. The building is full of character and a walk down the staircase showed lots of nice things to look at. My room was cozy but not tiny. The fixtures etc. were fairly new but the wallpaper was coming off at the seams. I couldn't quite figure out if a face lift was needed or the paper hanger did a lousy job. The room was not spanking perfect but I couldn't find anything to complain about. There is no elevator noise as they are outside the room corridor. I had two single beds with no view and it was extremely quiet. There was a smallish LCD TV and the reception was good. It was very clean with the standard 4 star hotel amenities. There was a full shower and bath tub, although there is the usual Euro 1/2 door for the shower which made the width of the shower area quite narrow for us football player shoulder types. The Gran Via becomes H. Princessa and the hotel is like 1 1/2 blocks from where this changeover occurs so you are essentially at the NW end of the Gran Via in 2 blocks. I walked down to the start of the Prado area in about 20 minutes. I didn't try the food and didn't have any issues so I can't rate the hotel service. I didn't see a concierge but did see the front desk staff giving directions and helping guests frequently. The entrance is locked from midnight to 6 AM, the two times I returned during those times someone opened the door right after I buzzed. All in all an excellent balance of cost and location, I'm really happy I didn't pay quadruple for the 5 stars I was originally considering.

The room was spacious, with a nice flat screen TV. Contrary to other reviews, we found the room to be extremely quiet and peaceful, perhaps due to the long hallway from the door to the bed area.
