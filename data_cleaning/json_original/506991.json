The biggest negative before deciding on this hotel was the reviews down that the music played by DJ was too loud. But there was no DJ music disturbing even on second floor (were our room was). Not even on weekends! Not even for a minute! The sleep was quite silent. The check-in time of hotel is 2.00 p.m. & check out is 12.00 p.m. We expected that being check-out time 12, we would get room by atleast 12.30 or utmost 1.00. We reached hotel by 12.30 p.m. As we reached, we were told that the they could give room only by 2.00. So we went out for Lunch. We came @ 2.05 and asked that whether room is free to check-in now. The receiptionist looked at the Watch and said that now she can give the room. SHE WAS VERY RUDE IN TALKS TO EVERYONE. No Flexibitlity at all. At check-out also, she called up at 11.00 and asked that when are we checking out (though the check-out is at 12) Regarding Hotel: The hotel & rooms are very neat & clean. Location of the hotel is okay though there are much better hotels on the same road in terms of location. One has to walk around 15-20 mts to find a good resturant. Burjuman Mall & Metro stations is also far off and not at walking distance (though on same road). The bus stops are just 2 minutes from the hotel. Breakfast is just ok. Lot of options for Non-vegetarian but very less for Veg. It was repeat on almost all days. Jain breakfast available on request. They would give only one hot breakfast for Jain Veg. Rest one has to choose from the spread. Overall it was filling to keep you going till late afternoon.

We chose to stay at Highland City based on the reviews here and weren't disappointed one bit! The rooms and the bathrooms were very clean and most of the staff were very courteous and helpful. Yes, the continental breakfast is not all that great but we were surprised that they also had an Indian spread for breakfast for the entire period of our stay, not sure if this is available throughout the year though. Like the other travelers who have reviewed this hotel mentioned, there is quite a bit of noise from the hotel's Night Club located on the Mezzanine floor, None of us lost sleep over the noise, probably because our rooms were on the 4th floor but am sure it will be a major inconvenience to guests allotted lower floor rooms! I would suggest you specifically ask for a room on the higher floor to stay away from this noise! For the Indian/Vegetarian specific travelers, this hotel is operated by the Sarovar group of hotels who are an established brand in India, most of the staff are Indians and their hospitality is very good! There are also quite a few Indian restaurants around this hotel, the closest being Rajdhani, just a few hundred meters away. WIFI Internet is available but on a chargeable basis, I paid 40 Dirhams for 24 hours of usage with a 3 day validity, fair price! This hotel is also equipped with a pool located on the top floor!

Therefore we arrived at the hotel pretty early, around 10:00 am. We were told that we had to wait for check in but asked if there was no chance of getting a room anyway. After 1 minute we were given a room at the 1st floor. The room was OK, nothing to complain about at all (expect for the view - but who cares, we weren't in Dubai just to stare out of our hotel's window!). Clean, nice tv, nice beds, fresh toilet etc. We decided not to stay in the hotel for a long time and walk around the hotel to see whether it was a good location or not. After spending one week there I'd say that it's a pretty good location (if you take the price into consideration). Bur Dubai and Deira really felt like the old Dubai which was kind of cool. The creek was around 10 minutes of walking from the hotel, just perfect. Bur Juman shopping center (and today also a metro station) was around 20 minutes down the street. Al Ghubaiba bus station (where bus number 8 and 8A depart, which are really useful if you want to get to Jumeirah Beach Park or Burj Dubai for 2 AED) is very close as well. The hotel had its own rooftop pool plus a jacuzzi, nothing special but we used it a few times actually. From the roof you were able to see the famous Dubai skyline plus Burj Dubai. Reception staff was good, help us with the booking of the dessert safari. They also helped us with airport transfer for our departure (which could be needed since it's not always very easy to get a taxi in the street). There was nothing special about the breakfast, however the courses changed a few times which was nice.

We arranged a shuttle from the airport to the hotel and we think in the long run this may be easier rather than fighting for a cab. The location of the hotel isn't all that interesting as you find yourself near the docks of Dubai and no real tourist attractions. Although everything can be reached by a taxi ride of around 15-20mins, heading out on foot means you will no doubt be breathing in a lot of the pollution that dubai has to offer. The hotel is modern and clean and the rooms are well dressed and modern. The bed was comfortable and the shower had good pressure. The breakfast of which we bought was expensive but seeing there didn't seem to be many other options in the area it was easier to stay in and pay the extra. It was buffet style with everything from Omlettes and Juices to Curry and Naan for breaky. One thing we didn't like was the fact that the hotel has a dico / live concert room in their basment. Normally this wouldn't worry us but the fact we were flying half way around the world and had to be awake at 6.30am made it a little annoying. When I phoned reception and asked them what time the music would finish she politetly told me that they would be finishing at 2am.

I didnt have much to do with the hotel staff and my mum paid for me to stay. She hated the hotel so much, she didnt like the staff which were mostly immigrants from India and the cleaners were mostly from the Philipines (they were lovely). The Hotel: The rooms are ok..theres a small fridge, a tv with some good channels, a really nice bathroom with towels/shampoos etc and the beds are comfortable. But on the down side their sea view isnt great, you can barely see the sea..unless you look through gaps of buildings in the distance. The hotel has a nightclub and a restaraunt which is also a sort of nightclub so there loud music in the night, I could hear them but it wasnt so bad that you couldnt sleep over it. The staff were a bit dodgy and yes you really do have to keep your luggage padlocked. The hotel has a really nice swimming pool on the roof and also a little jacuzzi which the kids really enjoyed. There was a life guard and he was a pervert. This may sound a little horrible but with most the staff being immigrants from India expect Indian style service not Dubai style service. The hotel has a small sauna which no one really used (Apart from my sister and cousin) and also a gym that no one used but it looked nice. They also have high speed internet connection in a computer room which doesnt cost a great deal of money to use. No one really used the swimming pool and there wasnt many tourists at the hotel, just what seemed like immigrants from mostly India. The Location: Taxis are very easy to catch and you can take them to nearby restaurants, some of which are fantastic. This hotel is in a very immigrant area, its run down looking and not the cleanest. In the evening the outside of the hotel is packed out with Pakistanis who will perve on you and believe me, nothing will stop them. This really got me angry, there was just no respect for women from these people. The only reason im mentioning where the immigrants were from is so you can have a better understanding and idea of how it was, especially if youve been to Pakistan (which I have) and India (which I might). On the plus side the taxi ride to the beach (a gorgeous beach) isnt very far and neither is Dubai zoo which when I went, had lion cubs. Overall the location was more like India than Dubai but youre just a taxi ride away from the real Dubai. I wouldnt recommend lone female travelers but a bunch of guys on a budget would probably love it. Oh and they did do breakfast: the chef made really nice omlettes and breakfasts were over-all nice but make sure you get there early or you wont have anywhere to sit. For lunch, you can take a taxi to mcdonalds or Pizza hut (the pizza hut staff were lovely) which arent too far away.

Given below is the portion from my travel blog which relates to this hotel. \".....When we reached hotel, we were welcomed by friendly staff there. After some waiting (our check in was at noon), we were allocated room some three hours before our normal check in time. Hotel seems to be a good one from outside though the reception and lobby area is undergoing renovation works. But that is not much of inconvenience as such. We were given room on 4th floor. When we reached our room, we found it very neat and clean. A very nice accommodation by 3 star standards. Toilets were clean, equipped with tub, 24 hour running hot and cold water. Rooms are with TV having satellite connections. There was a hotspot internet facility in the hotel but I found the rates very expensive (10 AED for an hour and 40 AED for the day). I didn\u2019t opted for it. Making international calls from hotel too was very expensive. Soon I found an alternative from it in form of calling cards which you can buy from any shops which can be found just next to hotel. There cards can be used in any of the commonly found pay phone booths on the streets. As we had a long flight and my kid was tired, we decided and then to explore the next option.....\" In nutshell, highly recommended for stay in Dubai. This is a good hotel for family, very centrally located and nicley priced.

I would concur that this is an excellent place for singles, I had a riot ;o) However be aware as a single person booking, you cannot have 2 people staying in your room so a small charge is made if you want to increase the number of occupants in your room, even if only temporarily ;o) Food was middling in the \"family\" Indian restaurant downstairs, but the dancing girls and live music made up for it, despite it being played so loud the waiter could not make out what I wanted and brought something totally not what I ordered...It was still ok though. Nice roof top Jacuzzi and small pool too. I took a junior suite and it was nice and big with a smart new bathroom and a flat screen TV too. All in all, a very nice stay, the staff were excellent to. I would recommend here if you want a lively place that is way better value than the big chain hotels. Despite it being not ideally located, taxis are everywhere and cost next to nothing. Good Chinese restaurant and an Irish pub just down the road within easy walking distance, but prob better off grabbing a cab and heading to the Marina which is about 20mins and \u00a35.00 in a taxi. Best bars I found there were The Barasti and Bhudda, both in hotels and Bhudda is where the money and the famous go.

It was fantastic, I checked in without any problems, porter brought my suitcases up for me, even ripped off all the security tags for me :P The manager Mahesh Kumar was lovely, He showed me how the AC and all the amenities worked in the rrom. In the hotel lobby is an Excursion company called Suncity Tours, who have amazing excursions going on for a reasonable price. They are also very helpful and polite. I didn't really wake up to have breakfast while I was there, but one morning I did and it was a buffet style breaky with a large variety of dishes, warm and cold. In the room is a food menu from the Restaurant downstairs, they have a good variety of dinners and lunches, Very cheap too, ( try the chilli Chicken) The hotel DOES have 3 clubs however I was on the 3rd floor, but by the time I came in from a hard day travelling out in the sun, I was too tired to acknowledge the club and the noise and use to fall straight to sleep, I actually found it difficult to get myself out in the morning. Very close by to Deira, gold souk, spice market, mina bazzar, carefour, boat creeks. Jumerih beach is about 10-15mins away in taxi not expensive at all. Airport was about 20mins away, However the Hotel does provide a shuttle service, If getting a taxi it's around \u00a35.00. The hotel provides facilities for safety box in the back office of the reception. Overall realli good hotel, Dont get put off about the noise not really a big deal, by the time you get back at night your too tired to realise whats going on.

Upon arrival, our transfer guy was there on time to collect us (Shuttle bus), he carried our bags and was very polite and helpful. The hotel ride was about 15-20mins. On arrival at the hotel, our rooms were ready but not conjoining as we requested, we were told that a room next to mine would be availbale after two nights and they would move my mum n sister next to us but that didn't happen. We were given complimentary bottles of water and 'not complimentary' snacks, which we realised only when we checked out and received our bill...which taught us a lesson! First impression of the room was avergae (damp smell in bedroom which wore away but bathroom smell remained throughout our 6night stay), comfortable and clean but not completely accomodating. There was no clock or ironing facilities. Bathroom was average size, no complaints! The staff were very polite and hospitable- always ready to help- again no complaints! Breakfast is good- mostly the same verday though! Perfect location, easy to get taxis around! Fab juice shop next to the bus stop outside the hotel- I was hooked! A piece of advice for anyone tourists visiting Dubai- DON'T use the hotel to book excursions. They charge so much more, its a complete rip off! Always book them yourself in advance or while you are in Dubai- there are looooooads of tourism companies. Near the reception area- there is an Indian 'family' restaurant... uhhh I don't think so! I went with my family n we walked back out. 95% in there were men, old pervy types n the live entertainment was perfect for them....I'll leave you to judge! I requested the top level floor in the hotel by reading previous reviews about noise and believe me, I am happy I did! There is a club on the first floor and the noise can still be heard on the 7th floor- just not as bad. I wouldn't advise this hotel as being a family hotel at all- in the evening lots of men arrive at the hotel, looking for entertainment- at the same time, lots of 'lovely' females stroll in....again I leave you to be the judge! The rooftop pool is wonderful, small but nice. Sauna is okay- not bad! Overall, you get what you pay for from this hotel- nothing more and nothing less! Not a family hotel! More for couples and adults! Not child friendly!

It was largely male dominated as the entrance to the 'dawat' club is through the recepion area and was frequented by men only. This was a bit of a nuisance if you have kids with you. The noise from this club could be heard on the 3rd floor till late night though it was only a muffled noise, not too bad. The breakfast was good with a quite a variety to choose from, the restaurant, I thought was expensive hence not very busy. Swimming pool and gym on the top floor/roof top was satisfactory.

The hotel is in a good location, walkable distance to Meena Bazaar (great for cheap electricals) and short cab rides to Jumeirah Beach, Main Town Centre and all Shopping Mall. Cabs are easy to get from outside the hotel. Staff are brilliant. Only one thing, the Highland is located in \"Old Dubai\" so the local men STARE at any women (Although they are harmless!). There are not many women in the area. If this will freak you out, then it would be better to stay nearer Jumeirah beach where there are more tourists.

The hotel is in a good location and its 3stars are well deserved. We stayed up on the 6th floor so the noise from the nightclub was not really a problem for us. We went to the nightclub on our first night after arriving and it was our last time going there, it was a little seedy &I'd imagine if I wasn\u2019t with my partner he would have gotten plenty of offers from all the Asian girls in there! The towels and the bed linen were changed every single day, which was great. The room was a good size with a massive king size bed. The usual TV fridge etc was also in the room; we had no problem getting an iron&ironing board from housekeeping when we needed them either. We also had the paper brought to us in our room a few mornings with breakfast. After the first morning we realised that it cost the same to have room service bring up your breakfast as it did to have it in the Coral Restaurant downstairs. So we opted to have it in our room most days. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were extremely polite &helpful especially the nighttime manager. Maybe they could actually teach a thing or two to workers in western hotels!! In relation to the phone in the hotel you can buy call cards in the shop up the road for 20 or 40 dirhams and use them on the hotel phone so all that you are charged is a few cent connection fee, I think it works out at about 20cent which is great! The staff at reception will explain how to use them but they are very easy&a great idea. The pool is quite small but ideal if u want to relax after a days sightseeing after all you hardly go to Dubai to sit at the pool all day!! Taxis can be hailed outside the hotel no problem and are very cheap to get around in. You really have no other choice but to use them. Jumeriah beach is about 15minutes away in taxi&costs on average 20dirhams(about\u20ac5). You can pay 5dirhams to get into the public Beach Park and is well worth it as it\u2019s immaculately kept. So overall I would have no problem going back to this hotel or recommending it to family or friends as its a great 3star hotel.
