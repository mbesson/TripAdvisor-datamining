The place is a jewel : neat, clean, tastefully decorated, with a gorgeous little pool in lush gardens. The rooms are quite simple, but spotless and large enough. We had an upper room, with a large balcony over the gardens... The staff is extremely kind, breakfast delicious... We had the best of times here. We used the services of a taxi driver we met there, he was very kind and helpful (drove us to Ubud with some stops at interesting points, and he helped us find a nice hotel in Ubud).Besides, Lovina is quite a good option because it is less crowded than Kuta (though you have hawkers as well), and you can watch dolphins and go snorkeling. The local fishermen all offer the same prices for dolphin watch, no need to bargain. There are good restaurants too near Rini - try the local specialty of babi guling (roast pork).", "Date": "Aug 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR149206039", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297699-d309342-r16504786-Rini_Hotel-Singaraja_Bali.html", "HotelID": "309342", "Price": "$57"}}
