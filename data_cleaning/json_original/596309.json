The service, rooms and stay is okay. But the hotel is located close to upmarket malls and shopping areas of Istanbul. Great place to be in after work. The Sapphire Observation Deck and Mall giving a bird's eye of Istanbul is close by. The Hotel has functional and clean rooms and okay service. However, if one is looking out for the tourist destinations, this may not be the place of stay, as there are other hotels near the Blue Mosque and Bazaar.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGood place, in average position\u201d", "Author": "etr500", "ReviewID": "UR126670345", "Content": "I have been in this hotel for 3 nights, to attend a conference at the ITU University.
