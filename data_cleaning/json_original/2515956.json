I selected their \"Perfect Parking Package\". From my very first call to make the reservation, I could tell this hotel was extremely guest friendly. They suggested I sign up for their guest loyalty program and gave me a $10 \"Raid the bar\" voucher and asked what location of room I enjoyed, what type of pillows etc. When I arrived, I was able to easily pull my car in front of the hotel. There was a baggage person to immediately unload my luggage for me and a driver to take my car to a secure location. I was greeted at the front desk for check in by one of the friendliest agents anywhere. I was allowed an early check in as we had made good time in traffic and had somewhere to be before the usual check in time. They noticed I was in their guest loyalty program and bumped me up to a nicer room at no charge. I was given a corner room, as preferred with an amazing view of the city. While settling into my room, I heard a knock at the door and there was a kind man bringing me the type of pillows I preferred. The room was super clean and there were niceties such as a robe to use. I wasn't sure I would like the \"artsy\" decor but it was great although I understand they are remodeling. I was invited to have warm cookies in the lobby and a complimentary wine tasting in the evening. There was coffee and tea in the lobby in the morning. The most amazing part of this hotel for me was that every single person who worked there was very interested in making my stay pleasant. The valet, the baggage man, the \"pillow\" man, Scott, the front desk manager and everyone else was so professional and friendly that I will never forget that place. It is right at the gates of China Town and there is a great Irish Pub just around the corner. It is close to everything I wanted to see and do, including booking a great facial at the Aveda Institute just around the corner. For the price, I expected a clean room and parking, what I ended up with was an unequaled experience from their amazing staff.

I will give them straight A's for customer service, staff attitude, location and the like, but the hotel itself is showing it's age.

The tub was slow to drain, but again, this is an older building that has been nicely restored. The bathroom was small, but functional, with newer counters and the like. There was a nice robe and a hairdryer in the room - nice touches. Because it was my first stay, I was given a $10 credit for the mini bar which yielded a large bottle of water and a package of gourmet gummy bears. The room was maintained in an adequate manner each day - the mirror on the bathroom door was not cleaned and my towel was not replaced - very minor things, and not issues, but something to keep the rating away from excellent.

It is true that oftentimes you can hear the traffic outside but I'm a sound sleeper and that didn't bother me.

Taxi drivers know it which is always a bonus. The nearest cable car stop isn't too far away and the city sightseeing hop on / hop off buses stop right outside. There are plenty of decent shops and bars close by and there's a Starbucks opposite if that's what you need to start your day. There's also a bistro on the side of the building which served decent food and drinks. The lobby is great - it's well designed and has a warm, friendly and welcoming feel when you first arrive. It was bustling and there was always plenty going on. I'm afraid that's pretty much where the positives end. The staff were friendly but not overly helpful, we had an issue with our booking that wasn't handled well by the hotel team - our booking via Expedia didn't correspond with the booking they had received and as the hotel was full we were stuck with a small twin room on the third floor, rather than a king suite. Not the end of the world but it wasn't our fault and after a long drawn out conversation, we turned down the offer a bottle of wine in the cramped bedroom and accepted their offer of a complimentary breakfast next morning. Not what we had booked, or paid for or expected. Maybe not the hotel staff's fault but certainly not mine either and I expected better handling of the situation by the staff, especially based on Kimptons reputation. I'm not one for complaining - anything for an easy life in fact - but this wasn't on. It wouldn't have been so bad if the third floor we were stuck with didn't smell so bad - kinda like how your grandmothers house might smell, y'know stale overcooked cabbage. We couldn't wait to leave if I'm honest. There were venetian blinds on the window that didn't keep the light out, the air conditioning unit was incredibly noisy and the sink wasn't in the bathroom it was in the bedroom which was both very odd and became an irritant. The beds were uncomfortable and needed changing and I'd have been more comfortable sleeping on a sack of potatoes than using the pillows. Maybe we were spoiled having just stayed at the brand new Aria Hotel in Las Vegas but this room was $60 more per night than we'd paid there and to be totally honest, if we'd only paid $60 p/night at Triton, we'd have felt that too expensive. The free internet access wasn't strictly accurate, you had to register in order to get it. Not the free high speed service we had experienced at other SF hotels. Who wants to register? Just let me get online. So, all in all if your choice of hotel is more about comfy beds than artwork on the walls of the lobby, prefer a pet-free hotel and staff that put the needs of guests first, you might wish to stay elsewhere, but to be balanced, if you want a hotel in a decent location, a nice lobby with a dog to greet you and guest house style rooms with lumpy pillows, book away, i doubt you'll be disappointed.

I know SF is known for having a bed bug problem but I was really disappointed that even the Triton had them. That the receptionist didn't seemed shock at all is also really disappointing.

Our first impression was that of the great mural wrapping the walls of the lobby. Bright colors with amorphous designs depicting the history of San Francisco's beat, hippie, cool and cosmopolitan history and cultures. The hotel is on Grant Avenue near the city's Chinatown Gate. Good restaurant and shopping are just steps away from the hotel's big double (and heavy) double front doors. Wine and juices are served each afternoon between 5 and 6. Because Kimpton's is a pet friendly hotel chain we were entertained during the happy hour by the antics of the bell man's well behaved pet dog. Vintage movies and classic MTV videos play on the lobby's big TV screens and as soon as we walked in the hotel the vibes were set for an entertaining and fun experience. After taking the light show motif elevator to our floor the experience calms down to to reflect a more conventional older, but well kept up property. The hallways are painted in subdued colors while the hall carpeting gives thought to a wild Las Vegas casino style pattern. Sounds like a culture clash so far but believe me the designs seem to work. Our room was small but every amenity was provided. One wall was a deep red and the other three walls were painted robin's egg blue. Hotel room colors never interested me before but with this hotel chain I have learned to look for the unusual in decor. The rooms main lighting fixture was a three pronged, three color globes or orbs. I won't try to elaborate further. Service was great. Location is right down town. The room rate was very reasonable for the quality of the experience and for the location. Although we here on an entertainment only basis the hotel is just a short walking distance to the city's financial center, and a weekday morning shuttle service is provided from the Triton to the financial district. Anything negative? OK, because there are water flow devices on the bathroom fixtures the toilets run slow and the water pressure is a little low.

Also, the A/C didn't work well - the room was pretty warm and the windows opened, but not enough to make a difference. That aside, the room itself was fabulous. There were 3 different cool light fixtures in the room and everything was colorful and very funky. They managed to find room for a mini-bar and we got a $10 credit because we are Kimpton In-Touch members. The bed was comfortable and the foam pillow that I requested was waiting for me.

The hotel is right across the street from the Chinatown gate, and within walking distance to all kinds of bus stops. As soon as I walked into the lobby, I was pretty certain I'd made a good choice. The decorations are bright and fun, but not tacky. The lobby is large and has a nice seating area and TV (which they played the World Cup games on, which was nice). We checked in at about 11pm, and the young man at the front desk was very nice and upbeat. In fact, every time we walked by the front desk, whoever was there would always say hello or welcome back, and seemed quite genuine. We also ordered a cab the night before we checked out, and the young man who did that for us was also very helpful and friendly. Check out was a breeze and only took about 30 seconds. When I made my reservation, I signed up to be a Kimpton In Touch member (free), which gave us free internet access and a $10 gift card for the mini-bar that came with a note from the manager. Nice touch. We booked directly through the hotel website and got the \"Stay 3 and save\" deal, which saves you 30% if you stay 3 nights or more. This put us at $135 a night. I thought this was a good deal. We were in room 721, a Deluxe Room with a queen bed. The mattress was soft, the blanket was dreamy and the pillows were feather (can be foam on request). I almost always have trouble sleeping, even at home, and I slept great in that bed. The room had two closets, a desk, a nice looking flat screen TV, dresser and mini-bar. The bathroom had a shower/tub combo and nice Aveda soaps. Another nice touch is the artwork by local artists in the room. I really liked the atmosphere and design of this hotel. I would definitely stay here again. The only real reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is that they don't have breakfast. I would have given 4.5 if I could.

Also, the rate was excellent and I feel like I got my money's worth at this hotel. I have only one complaint.: The ventilation was not very good. I needed to keep the air conditioner on the entire time and it was not particularly humid. It's San Francisco and simply opening the windows provides natural air conditioning. Unfortunately that wasn't an option because the AC unit was located in the only window.

Love the decor of this place...it's not your run-of-the-mill hotel! Cartoonish wallpaper, metallic fabrics on the furniture, Michael Jackson videos on the flatscreen, and rubber duckies in the fountain...you know you're in for something different as soon as you pull up. We paid $143 a night with an additional $38 charge per day for parking. I have stayed in nearly every major city in the world and have never paid this much for parking. I did feel that the price of the room was VERY fair compared to other San Francisco hotels of similar quality. Our room (208) was a second floor, corner room directly across from the southernmost Chinatown gate and Starbucks. Great view! My only complaint is that this room, being a corner on a lower floor, was very loud on Saturday night. We were awakened numerous times by very loud, partying people (well after midnight) and traffic. Sunday night was better...we heard no people and turned on the AC unit for some white noise. I didn't ask to move rooms on the second night because I really didn't want to move for just one night - but potential guests should be aware of this if they want to get some sleep. Other than that the stay was outstanding! The room was very comfortable and I was impressed at how this older hotel had been redone to serve modern needs. Great flatscreen for watching movies, comfortable bed, interesting art and decor, and a very nice sink area with lovely amenities. The honor bar is exorbitantly expensive!! I know that all hotels charge crazy amounts for in-room snacks but $3.50 for a Snickers bar and $6 for a bottle of water is just stupid. This hotel is an easy walk from Chinatown (literally right across the street), Union Square, the Financial District, and the Embarcadero/Market Street area. A bus stops right outside the hotel and the Muni is a short walk away. They have a fantastic little French bistro next door that has some of the best croissants I've had outside France. I loved that complete selection of French-language magazines for sale and getting a chance to practice my French with our waiter! Such good coffee - I was a little hesitant to stay here with my son thinking that such a funky hotel would be full of youngish people trying to look hip and pick up on each other...there was some of this but there were also plenty of older people, families, musicians, and regular folk staying. I felt very comfortable staying here with my son! I will certainly stay here again when I come to San Francisco - it's a good value for this city.

The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and small but perfectly sufficient. We also had pretty fast internet connection via the free Kimpton rewards wifi. The coffee service in the mornings was free which is an amenity that is hard to find lately. Moreover, the coffee was tasty and strong and there was soy milk in addition to milk and cream. I would be sold on the coffee service alone. I have absolutely no complaints. This was the perfect hotel for a young couple from the East coast, like my husband and myself.

The closet was a good size and there was a wardrobe for storage as well. The bathroom was small but serviceable, with a nice shower and plenty of shelves for storage of products. We did not have a view (the room looked to the small inside courtyard of the building) but the blinds allowed for plenty of natural light to get in while still giving a lot of privacy. The room also had a source book for all of the organic materials that went into it as well as a guest book signed by previous occupants that was fun to read. The staff was beyond friendly and helpful, and like all Kimpton Hotels there was an evening complementary wine hour from 5 - 6 pm where all guest gathered in the lobby and relaxed on the couches and drank wine. It was a fun way to get to know fellow travelers as well as relax after a hard day sight seeing.

Doing various web searches for budget-style hotels (I'm typically a budget traveler, even staying in hostels around the world), I found the Hotel Triton to have an incredible sale. For ~$100 / night, I figure I couldn't go wrong considering the truly great location in central S.F. I wasn't wrong. Triton fulfills some major requirements that I look for in hotels: Proximity to public transit to/from airport (only a few blocks walk from Montgomery St. BART Station and even close to cable cars and certainly many bus lines), price, and wireless Internet (it's even free). It's central location is the major bonus for me. The hotel is a small-ish boutique hotel right across the street from the Gates of Chinatown, and within walking distance of North Beach, the Financial District, Tenderloin, etc. It is a bit of a haul on the electric trolley or Muni to the Castro - but I only went to the Castro once or twice. Most of my time was spent sightseeing the central areas of the city, and happy hours in North Beach (Vesuvio is an absolute must). Yes, my room was small and my window looked onto an alley - though I didn't spend much time in my room. I was visiting San Francisco to explore the wonderful city, not the insides of a hotel room. In fact, the staff let me bring a bike that I had rented into my room for safety. The afternoon wine reception was nice (and free), though the wines were, of course, not the best quality (read: free). One complaint - the 2nd day I was there, the maid did not replace my bath towels. I only had one towel out of 2 left. Not the end of the world, but I had rented the bike and needed to shower when I was done with riding for the day (riding up and down those hills can make a guy sweaty), so I had to use my last towel to shower that evening and then use the same one the next morning.

This time we did, via Expedia, and it was the best decision! My teenage daughter and I stayed in a small double room on the 7th floor with a view of the street below. We loved the bright, fun, but tasteful decor, zany bed heads and furniture, light fixtures, and exhilarating bathroom with good powerful shower. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the two double beds with their luxurious pillows were the most comfortable hotel beds we've experienced in a hotel. The bathrobes were also a nice touch and although we didn't buy one, we were sorely tempted! We liked being able to open the window to fresh outside air as well as having access to an air conditioner, and appreciated the obviously environmentally-friendly policies (recycling, \"green\" products, re-using towels if willing, etc.) the hotel follows. They even welcome pets! As we drove through the night and then spent the entire day walking our feet off in the city prior to checking in, the Triton provided just the comfort and fun atmosphere we craved. True bliss! Crazy-bright decor and furniture in the lobby with complimentary wine in the late afternoon and good coffee in the morning, a bustling cafe next door and a Starbucks across the street, the entrance to Chinatown a few steps away, and helpful staff on reception at all hours made our stay most memorable. The hotel also has a good location, within walking distance to many highlights, and close to public transportation. Usually we object to the high cost of valet parking in the city and choose to leave our car in the Union Square underground parking garage and walk to our hotel, but this time we made the right decision, leaving our car with the Hotel Triton valet staff. For only a couple of dollars more (plus tip which they deserved!), our car was whisked away, in an out privileges were available (not available at Union Square at the less expensive 24-hour rate), and they even let us park outside the hotel on the street for a little longer so we could walk to the Museum of Modern Art area where it's really hard to find parking. We really appreciated their concern and assistance. My daughter also loved the Triton rubber ducks floating in the fountain at the entrance. Nice touch! We enjoyed sipping coffee in the lobby in the morning, watching people discovering the ducks with amusement as they walked by. Good photo opportunities! We highly recommend the Hotel Triton, and will stay there again.

First up, if you are staying there, make sure you ask for a quiet room away from the garbage trucks. On my first night I was awakened at 3am by horrendous noise. Garbage collection lasts about 30 minutes, and it was hard to get back to sleep afterwards. When I spoke to the front desk about it, just wondering what the noise had been, they immediately moved me to another room, overlooking Bush St and much quieter (there were no noise problems on any other night I was there). They did concede that the garbage collection noise is a major and ongoing problem in the hotel. The room I was moved to was smaller than the first one, but it was generally fine. It was a 'Zen Den', which is one of the smaller categories of room, and there really is no spare space at all, but that wasn't a huge problem. If you want to do yoga in your room or anything, there's no space! It was so small the bathroom didn't even have a bath tub - something they didn't tell me at check in. Nice touches in the room: an iPod player. Fantastic to be able to hear my own music in the hotel room. Huge flat screen TV - but I didn't ever use it. There had been a picture taken down from the wall, and there were clumps of plaster missing from the wall - but it hadn't been repaired, so it looked pretty crappy! hey also claim to have 'internet access on the TV'. Mine didn't work, and they had no technical support at all - front desk admitted they didn't know how to work it, because 'most guests had their own laptops'. On the whole, staff were very helpful, responding promptly to queries. There's quite a variety of people on the desks, so it's often different people there - makes it a bit anonymous. Overall, the hotel seemed unable to make up its mind whether it was trying for 'rock n roll cool' or 'new age zen hipness'. Loud music pumping outside the front door on the street and in the elevators; bright garish colours, party time with the wine in the lobby at 6pm, versus organic cotton sheets, free tarot readings in the lobby... It was all a bit mixed up in terms of what the Hotel's identity was. But on the whole it's fine: the location is excellent - opposite the Chinatown gate, near Union Square, short walk to all public transport and attractions. And next door is the outstanding Cafe de la Press - I ate dinner there twice, and had breakfast there every day. Really good food, reasonably priced, excellent atmosphere, good for people-watching.

Gemelli, the bellman, was terrific- he retrieved new card keys when mine didn't work, got ice, explained the new flatscreen tv, etc. He always called me by name and was just overall gracious, as were all the staff I encountered.

I didn't use valet because I just garaged my car most of the time I was there. I wanted to use public transport and experience the trolley. I found it very easy to find parking in lots nearby a block or two away that were cheaper. Had I wanted to go in and out, though I have no idea if this would've still been cheaper. There places to eat close by (i.e. a Starbucks across the street), so food was easy for me to get. The cons were most of the people who worked there. Where the courtesey they pay you to have in hospitality? Where's your SF pride? Such a great city. You have so much to be proud of! Not the friendliest staff or the most helpful. I think I met one nice person behind the counter. They put cookies out in the afternoon and they'd good. I probably wouldn't return to this hotel unless they have a major customer service overhaul and mainly b/c I didn't prefer the union square/chinatown area. I definitely wouldn't pay full price for it.

You can't beat the location right at the foot of the Chinatown Gate and five minutes from Union Sq. I suggest that if you take your dog, walk him/her around the corner on Bush Avenue to St. Mary's Park; it is a lovely, safe park. I'm happy to say SF is very pet friendly. BTW don't put your pet's excrement in the trash barrels. Many people, unfortunately, scour the trash cans for food. Our room faced Grant and Bush Avenues and was quiet. Request Room 209! Our bathroom was spotless and modern (the new marble and stainless steel wash basin is separate, an alcove, in the main room). No peeling paint, fading fabrics nor foul carpeting. Very comfy king sized bed, comforter and freshly starched linens. Try the Cafe de la Presse downstairs. And the cookies. We would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat. My suggestion to future guests: be specific as to your needs and preferences. Do you have vertigo? Vacation in Dayton. Don't want excessive noise? Request that you not be placed in a room overlooking the alley. Don't like dogs? (and one guy in the hallway totally freaked when he saw our 5 lb. dog on a leash in the hallway) well, don't stay in a hotel that allows pets. Do you like inexpensive, creative homestyle Japanese/Chinese/Vietnamese food? Chinatown is two minutes away.

This stay was business for my husband, but pleasure for me, so this reveiw takes both perspectives into account. We are in our mid-thirties, used to live in SF, and like staying at nice hotels, but not stuffy hotels - so we chose the Triton over the W or the Clift. As previous locals, we would have stayed in another neighborhood if it weren't for the conference (staying downtown can be intense), but since we were here for business for him - it worked out great. Positives: -The Triton hit our criteria of staying where other folks our age stay, not being stuffy, and being within walking location to transit (great bonus for heading out to dinner in other neighborhoods) and the convention at the Moscone Center - perfect. -Our room was between a maid's closet and a stairway, so was very quiet. We were here over a weekend and during the week and I never heard anyone partying or being loud. -FREE Coffee in the morning in the lobby was awesome. When you travel a lot it is a pain to have to shower and run down the street for coffee every morning for a week. It was so nice to bop down to the lobby to get some free organic coffee that tasted pretty good. -Small fridges in the room so you can get yogurt and water, etc. and keep it in the room is a huge plus. Nice to have breakfast for yourself to cut down on the eating out 24/7 (even though it is heavenly SF). -Staff was nice and helpful. One thing though - they forgot our 3:00 am wake-up call and 4:00 am taxi, but it worked out. -Huge bed - I barely knew my husband was there. Negatives: -I took an earlier review into account and asked not to stay along the alleyway (good call), but our room was facing the courtyard and had absolutely no view. I think I would prefer to be along Grant or Bush. -We didn't book for the decor - which online looked obnoxious, and it was, but that's okay. -Our room was small. We looked in some other rooms which seemed a bit bigger, but we decided it being quiet was a trade off for size. -The decor needs to be updated. The room seemed worn. This hotel could really be served well to update itself. I hate it when the bathroom grout is grey/black and all the floorboards are beat up, the wall paper is peeling, etc. Though our housecleaning was great - the room just seemed like it could be cleaner. We stayed in an ECO room and the carpet is the same we have in our house, but it was time to replace it. The little rugs were kind of nasty. If you are walking around SF you really need to take your shoes off in the room, they should have a shoe tray by the door to help emphasize that. Overall, I would stay here again because the positives outweigh the negatives, but I would investigate other places first. We like places that are a little cleaner and a little better updated. If you are used to the Ritz, don't stay here - if you like a funky edge, the smell of cannabis floating through the halls, seeing healthy young American's and European's, and an overall good location for downtown business, then stay here.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced tiny room\u201d", "Author": "zuttoman", "ReviewID": "UR7190614", "Content": "I have stayed at several Kimpton properties around Union Sqare.

Having read Time Out's review and some on this site we booked for three nights. Arriving in San Francisco with our young kids and full of high hopes, we stayed for just one night and couldn't get out quick enough. OK, it's in a good location, has a quirky reception and groovy carpets, but that doesn't make a good hotel. It's cramped, dated, tired and ill-equipped. The idea you may \u201c\u2026bump into Cher or Courtney\u201d here is laughable. Perhaps they did once stay here a long, long time ago but I bet they never came back.. Pete Doherty would probably like this place. Here's five things we particularly hated about it. 1. Small rooms - the first room we were shown had two small beds (double double) crammed in, leaving no room to even open a suitcase. All the bathrooms we saw were tiny. 2. Grotty decor - we were then moved to the 'Gerry Garcia suite' for an extra $100, which looked like it was last cleaned 15 years ago. Gerry must have been very stoned when he 'designed' this room, as the only 'design' was a poorly painted nicotine brown chequer board effect on the walls. It looked like a crude stage set. Were the floral curtains and (greasy) headboard borrowed from Gerry's mum's house? Gloomy lighting, chipped paint, knackered furniture, worn carpets - it had it all. We accepted because we couldn't face moving again with young kids after a long journey but it was pretty grim. What constitutes a suite? This was one medium size room with a double and sofa bed. 3. The noise from the rubbish trucks at 10pm, 3am and 4am, right outside the hotel was deafening and unbearable. It woke us all up, and just as we got back to sleep another one would crash around, reverse lights beeping, crushing glass bottles just below the window. It turns out that the street next to the hotel houses all the bins for the street's shops and bars, but god knows why they needed to empty them so many times during the night. And why the hotel doesn't invest in triple-glazed windows to keep the sound out is beyond me - I can't believe anyone would experience that level of sleep deprivation and stay a second night, let alone come back or recommend to a friend. They knew full well about this but still proceeded to put us in this \u2018suite\u2019 quite happily. 4. The staff - nice and well-meaning but not great on service. We asked for a babysitter, and the guy at the desk spent an hour looking before giving up. Only he didn't bother telling us that he hadn't found one, and when I went back to ask him if he'd found one he said he'd been looking on Google but couldn't find one! At this point it was too late in the evening and we had to take our tired kids out to dinner with us. Maybe they're not used to children, but they're part of the Kimpton Group, so all he had to do was call a sister hotel for their recommendation. Also, our DVD player didn't work and the guy they sent up couldn't fix it and really didn\u2019t know what he was doing. And the wireless log-in didn't work, so I had to call the support line. At this point I was getting pretty cheesed off with the place. When we complained about the noise the following morning the manager nodded knowingly \u201cAh, yes, the garbage trucks..beyond our control I\u2019m afraid\u201d. 5. There's no bar, and no restaurant. Yes, there's a bistro next door, but it's hardly the same as being able to pop downstairs for a drink at the bar. The 'wine-tasting' comprised a few bottles of cheap Banrock Station (Australian!) Chardonnay and a couple of bottles of Zinfadel - hardly the introduction to Californian wines I was expecting! After our night of disrupted sleep we stumbled down to reception to make our complaints, and to their credit they reimbursed us the extra $100 we\u2019d paid and moved us to the (excellent) Argonaut, a sister hotel and part of the Kimpton Group. This we highly recommend and was great for the kids. The Triton needs some serious investment to bring it up to scratch.

Music plays in the lobby, but it was inaudible in my 2 nd floor room.

Made the reservation with a very personable woman at the actual front desk of the Triton. Personally, I much prefer to make reservations with the actual property which I intend to stay, as opposed to the move by hotels recently to have to make reservations thru a central reservation service which is usually not at the property at all. [How I came across the Triton was because of the lock-out that several of the major hotel chains have imposed on their once-striking workers. After booking a suite at The St. Francis, I found out that it was involved in the lock-out. Given that I will not cross a picket line of workers who have been locked-out of their jobs because I agree with the workers, I had to find an alternate hotel which was not involved in it. Fortunately, thru internet research, I came to hear of the Triton.] Upon checking in, the same woman, Andrea, who had assisted me in booking our reservation, was at the front desk. She was quite helpful in describing the accommodations at the hotel as well as the surrounding area. When we arrived, there were fresh, hot cookies at the front desk. The hot cookies appear twice a day. Also, they host a nightly wine tasting in the lobby, along with Tarot card readings. Fun way to interact with some of the others staying there, if you so desire. We then went up in the funky/modern elevator to 'The Graham Nash Suite,' which was delightfully decorated using Mr. Nash's own personal memorabelia from his career with Crosby, Stills, Nash (and sometimes Young!) as well as being one of their eco-friendly rooms. Wonderful idea! There was a bottle of mint infused water on the desk at no charge. Glad I tried it! Pleasant change from the usual bottled waters! The only downside was that the suites that I am accustommed to staying in have two separate rooms...a bedroom and a living room. This suite was one large (compared to the regular sized rooms which we saw while passing the housekeeping staff when they were in cleaning them) room with a couch and chair, etc, along with the bed all in the same room. The Gates of Chinatown are directly across the street, so we had an incredible...and inexpensive...meal of dim sum that evening. We were so pleased with the quality of the ingredients that we ate at various restaurants there throughout our stay. I've never eaten so well for so little in any city before! We never ordered any room service, so can't comment on that aspect. The central location of the hotel was a plus. Union Square is right there one street over. Our trip to San Francisco was to check out different neighborhoods and apartments for my daughter, who is planning on moving there. When the staff heard that we were looking into where best for my daughter to live, they gave us their personal opinions concerning the city's various neighborhoods, etc. That was most helpful, as we were not familiar with the difference in the neighborhoods there. By the end of our stay, my daughter had found a lovely, albeit small, one-bedroom apartment in a secure building with a fabulous view. The room was just fine, the bed very comfy, the decor definitely one-of-a-kind, good shower pressure (an important point for those of us who frequently stay in hotels!), and the staff was the best! I reccommend the Triton for anyone who tires of the usual \"same ol' same ol\" hotels. The only down side was the lack of a view, as our 'suite' was not facing a street, but rather an alleyway. However, since we were gone most of our stay, it didn't matter much this time.

It looks great from the outside and the lobby. It is right at the entrance to Chinatown, and next to Cafe Presse and my favorite card shop, Advantcard. The decor is really fun, in a funky college student kind of way, and there are some nice touches like candybars in the minibar-like offers in a tray in the room. But: The room was terrible. It was one of the inner rooms facing a rather depressing courtyard deck. (I never saw the outside rooms so I don't know if they are any better but San Fran is usually cloudy so the more light the better I say). The room was very dark and extremely tiny. The window AC unit blocked a lot of the light coming in the small window. And the room was very small, so small the bed dominates most of the room. Even with the 2 of us standing with a weekender suitcase each, the room felt very, very crowded. The room (not including the bathroom) was literally the size of 2 office cubicles. I'm really not kidding here. There was absolutely no space to open a suitcase. There was a luggage rack but no place to unfold it, unless you blocked the door to the room or the door to the bathroom. The bathroom was also very tiny and a little worn looking also however they did try to dress it up a bit with some luxury anementies. But the thing that I didn't like the most about the Hotel Triton is, unfortunently, the service. They just didn't care. Our room had a connecting door to another room on one side and there was not any insulation between the rooms, these are just standard doors. There were a bunch of guys, and gathering from the conversation, from Iowa for a few days having a bachelor party for a guy named Steve marrying someone named Robin. We could every single word of there conversation through the door and across the courtyard since we shared the corner together. Even heard them break a glass and set another one down on a tabletop. Its not like we were even trying to hear it. We put the AC on, the TV on, and were lying in bed. It was very uncomfortable. All the other stuff, we thought we could live with but this was a bit much. We went down to request getting moved. And the desk person said that she wouldn't move us and that the Hotel Triton rules doesn't allow parties. We told here there was definately a party. After arguing with us about if this party actually exists, she told us she would tell them to clear out. We didn't want that, after all the guy was getting married, and again, we just asked to be moved. She called the manager, who said that they couldn't move us, wouldn't tell us why, just something about booking rooms in advance. Very puzzling. Anyway, we decided to live with it and stayed in the room and spent our San Fran trip avoiding going back to the room until late at night. That's fine, plenty to do in San Fran. One last suprise, on checking out, there were 2 phone calls on our bill! Considering that we both carry cellphones and knowing the cost of hotel phone service we honestly NEVER made one phone call from our room didn't even pick up the phone to call the front desk, just walked on down to the lobby. Weird. The girl at the counter argued with us about the phone charges! My husband and I kept insisting that we didn't call anyone in San Fran (my friends all live in the East Bay). She said well maybe you called a restaurant. But we didn't make any reservations either. Finally my husband says, we didn't make ANY calls, call the number and see, maybe it was the person before us. She, rather angrily calls the number and nobody answered. Finally they just take it off our bill. But the whole time the women looked very mad like we were trying to scam her. When the taxi came to pick us up, my husband says \"I tried to be a good sport about this hotel room but that was the last straw. Why would we want to scam her out of $4.00?\" A few other things: The doors used real keys, not electronic cards and don't keep changing the door locks so there is the security issue. The chocolate chip cookie in the lobby were very good. The location in hindsight isn't the great for real tourists, in my opinion. Fisherman's Wharf although garish, is probable the better choice, all the tourist activities seem to begin and end there and because its full od tourist its busier at night time. Our hotel's street was full of homeless people at night. Anyway, FYI, we are both 33 years old. We heard mixed reviews about the hotel before we went and I can see why. We found it to have a cool glamourized Youth Hotel vibe. Great for college students, I think but NOT great for more mature adults. I would have been ok staying there with a friend for a night but not with my husband. My parents would have hated it, not for the decor but for the cramped quarters and other issues, not worth the price. I suggest instead, staying at The Argonaut Hotel, which is another boutique hotel, in Fisherman's Wharf. Our friend's stayed there and it looked very nice. It's got a nautical theme, its newly renovated, the rooms are bigger and it seems to be cheerful and cleaner. Hope this helps everyone out there make an informed decision.

If you can afford the valet service for your car (a tad bit spendy, but hey, it's S.F.) you won't regret it. We had our baby with us and one staff dude got on the floor and handed her a gratis rubber ducky! How cool is that? We'll be back the next time we hit the city. Thanks, Triton.

It is a great place to stay if you want a lively boutique hotel with friendly service. The beds were very comfy. Complimentary wine is served from 5pm to 6pm every evening in the lobby where guests gather to talk, get a massage, or have their Tarot cards read! We met people from all over the world. There was also live music. At 3pm and 8pm the hotel serves warm, delicious cookies! The staff were extremely accommodating giving us a later check-out time and happily answering our questions. This hotel is located within a few minutes of Union Square and right at the Gate to China Town and a short walk to North Beach. We also took one of the SF Library free tours and the Java Walk tour with Elaine Sosa, a lively, energetic and fun tour guide who showed us some cool coffee houses in the area ($20) and educated us with some interesting facts about the city.", "Date": "July 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cTruly a fun experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2308911", "Content": "Spending a long weekend here was fantastic.

We stayed for 2 nights after 2 nights at the Vintage Court. The Triton was a huge improvement over the VC, and less expensive to boot! (okay, only $4/night less, but still!) We had an interior room with a comfortable queen bed. The only bad thing I will say is that the room was TINY. However, for 2 people it was fine - cozy in fact. The interior rooms don't offer anything in the way of a view, but it was extremely quiet. After 2 nights of looking over Bush St at the VC, we were happy to skip the view and get some rest! The wine/beer hour(s) were great fun - the one we attended had a tarot card reader and a complimentary 5 minute massage (or you could pay for more minutes) which was welcomed after walking up those hills all day. There are also two iJoy chairs in the lobby for an anytime revitalization stop! The location was great - right next to the chinatown gate and a quick walk to the cable car.

The Kimpton Group usually meets my standards when it came to Hotel Palomar or their restuarants. I decided that I would stay with the Hotel Triton because I saw all the great reviews coming from this site and when I checked their website I was impressed with their theme and their style. I was automatically greeted at the door. It was early morning and my eyes were focused on their breakfast set up (coffee, tea). No one was at the frontdesk. I waited for a couple of minutes so I got some coffee first. Once someone got there they were ready to get me out. Alright, I understand that it's fairly early and \"we\" have yet to wake up, but come on! The lady was too quick and I'm sure she wanted me out of there as fast as possible. I go up on one of their two elevators and go to the room. I had a great room with the most comfortable bed. The room was very simple with a splash of pizazz. I was satisfied with the rooms. Thoe housekeepers were very attentive and helpful with additional ammenities I requested. When I called downstairs for a wake-up call they didn't answer till I called the 3rd time. When I checked out a few days later in the morning I had the same young lady help me. She seemed to continue the same attitude as she did when I checked-in. A lot of blank stares and I felt as if I was pushed out. Throughout the day I the staff was perfect. If I decide to stay there again (not likely) I would come in the afternoon.
