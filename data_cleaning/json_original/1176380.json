It has a great design. The square plus room is spacious enough, the amenities are fine and cleanliness is average. The location of the hotel is just perfect for tourism and business. Metro, metrobus and public bus stops are around the hotel. You can reach even the most far areas of Istanbul using public transport, with a ticket fee around 2TL (and plus some transfer fees while changing the vehicles ~0.75TL). In spite of the good location and beautiful design of the hotel, many operations of the hotel are average if not terrible. The breakfast is very limited in terms of Turkish standards. A narrow variety of choice, with the same items everyday. Moreover, the hotel is eager to charge any additional item, without even mentioning that the item is extra beforehand. The staff is short, so you wait for everything in the breakfast, even for breads/bagels. Housekeeping is also another issue. There is a \"please change my sheets\" card to place on the bed. Even we have placed the card to change the bed sheets, we've found that sheets were not changed. So, in the middle of night we waited 30min. for the sheets be changed. Even though the hotel management is helpful for the problems, every time one problem is solved another one just popped up in our three-night stay. For me it was a very below-average hotel experience. That said, I would definitely recommend the hotel instead of over-crowded, tiny-room hotels in the Taksim area. The Marmara \u00c5\u017ei\u00c5\u0178li is would be a wiser choice over these ones. However, if you can afford, international chain hotels would definitely be more rewarding than The Marmara \u00c5\u017ei\u00c5\u0178li.
