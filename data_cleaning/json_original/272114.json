We arrived in Daytona beach on Aug 4, 2012, and wanted a place to spend the night before driving back to NC. I was a bit concerned when I saw the lobby, but I thought the rooms would at least be clean. We paid for an ocean front room, and they put us in a very dirty street side room at first, I called the desk to let them know this and they were supposed to call me back, after waiting for about 10 minutes and not receiving a call back, I called again, and was told to come down to the front desk and they would take care of it. They reluctantly changed our room and gave us an ocean front room. As soon as we walked in we could tell it was a smoking room, and it was very dirty looking, I went down to get our luggage, and came back up. My wife had found some nasty looking substance on the bedspread, I tried to call the front desk but the phone in the room did not work, I noticed something on the bed while I was trying to call the front desk, and realized it was a roach, I then found several more, and told my wife we were leaving, I went down to the desk with my wife and our luggage, and told them we could not stay with them. They refused to refund our money, so I had to call my bank to dispute the charge. After we left I realized I had flea bites all over my ankles from the room. The owner claims on this site that they are a 3 star Hotel, I would love to know who rated this place, as it is not even worthy of 1 star.

The website on this hotel was extremely deceiving, hence why I made a reservation. We were to stay 2 nights, but thinking everything was booked we suffered through 1 entire night at this \"rat hole\" (and I'm being nice). First we were given a smoking room after requesting a non-smoking room. The door to our room wouldn't shut. The public hallway carpet was dirty and smelled like mold. We stayed away from the room as much as possible, because of the smell. I wore shoes in the room so my feet would not touch the carpet. But the worst was yet to come...when we went to bed and pulled back the sheets, they smelled of mildew.The mattress was wrapped in plastic (which crinkled everytime you moved in the bed) and was hard as a rock. The headboard on the King bed fell forward away from the wall when we sat on the bed. All of our clothes, even in our suitcase reeked of the smell. Black stuff was falling out of the AC vent in the bathroom ceiling, Television had no remote and the carpet was filthy. After the discovery of the mildewed bed, my husband found availabilty elsewhere. After a sleepless night, I paid a visit to the hotel clerk. I told her we would be checking out and she replied, there is no refund, since we were required to pay for our 2 night reservation up front. I told here yes there would be a refund. The rate for one night with tax ended up costing me $224.00. I got a refund of $156.00, which is exactly with tax what we paid the next night at the Holiday Inn (next to the Desert Inn). Your circles should go into the negative for this dump, this place should be condemned. I don't want anybody else to go through what we went through, so here's my warning...if you decide to stay at this place after reading my review...then pack cleaning supplies (to clean your own room), clean sheets for your bed and have your family fitted for gas masks so you can breathe clean air, because you won't find any of that at this place. If people will STOP staying at this place, it will soon be known as the \"Deserted Inn\", a much more deserving name.

We decided to take the kids to Daytona Beach overnight the following evening. Since it was a last minute trip, most reasonable hotels were booked - so our options were pay 400.00 for one night or 89.00... we were hesitant, but her husband, a County Deputy - but a few counties over, thought he remembered staying there and thinking it was OK... (I will begin by saying he forgot to mention he stayed during his initial college years - not when he was a responsible family man....) We found the hotel and walked into the lobby. We should have turned around then. I agree that the smell was awful. It was a mixture of mildew, mold and chlorine. The inside of the place looked like we just stepped on The Love Boat. Very gold-lame , mirrored, disco 70's theme. We checked in and were given our room key. WHY we kept our reservations, I'll never know... We rode the rickety elevator to our floor, opened the door and I couldn't believe it! There was black mold on the ceiling (two of the children with us have terrible asthma) and several stains on the carpet and bed spreads. I turned on the bathroom light to see the floor was soaking wet - truly like a 1/4 inch of standing water all over the floor. After closer inspection, I noticed dead bugs and burn holes throughout the room. The kids were really excited to stay at the beach, and we moms were thoroughly disgusted with the place. I went back to the front desk to explain what was going on. Like others, I was told there wasn't any other available rooms. I asked that they put us somewhere else, and that was \"against their policy\". We never removed our shoes that entire trip (even while sleeping), except when we were out on the beach. I was terrified to look at the sheets (thankfully we'd brought our own blankets which we placed on top of the bed and wrapped ourselves in. Even the pool was filthy, with grit, grime and sand covering the floor. For some reason I found myself in the basement where the pretend workout room was. Truly it reminded me of some terrible scene from Criminal Minds - as in dark and creepy with the only light coming from a single dangling bulb. If there is anything (and man am I racking my brain) positive to say about the place is for one hour while the kids played poolside, the hotel had arranged to have a DJ there who had fun activities/contests that the kids could get into - like races and stuff.

It was Midnight and understandably the pool was closed,but we were on the deck sitting and enjoying ourselves, not disturbing any guests with loud and obnoxious behavior.Then came Don, supposedly the night security ,his first words were OK kids its time to go to your room.Just let me say that we were all well over 30 years of age.There was no reasoning with this guy. Evidently your vacation ends at Midnight, for in his words everything is closed at the Desert Inn. We were told to either go to a bar , go to the beach or go to our rooms,in other words we were not permitted to sit anywhere on their property after 12,this really puts a damper on your vacation.The next night was the same scenario,except this time this same gentleman was very rude with not just my party but other guests as well.We were all told it was not his job to -- babysit people after 12 and that he should not have to clean up our shoe prints off the lobby floor from us going to the elevator.To try and make a long story short,this man pretty much ended our good times at the Desert Inn.Upon checking out I asked to speak with the manager and was told they do not hear complaints.So in my opinion unless you plan on being in bed at Midnight or taking a chance on a DUI or a PI for having to leave the Desert Inn property at Midnight,you might want to find another place to enjoy your time at Daytona Beach!!", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay again, but not that awful.\u201d", "Author": "carp57", "ReviewID": "UR115101025", "Content": "I read the reviews before we stayed, and was very leary of staying here.

Let me add that the resort offers small pets are allowed and being a loving pet owner, this is a PLUS because if you check out other Hotels on the beach there are so many that will NOT allow you to bring your pets.......Let me add that the Parking is FREE......you need to check this out when making your reservations cause many Hotels charge you for parking, We had an amazing Ocean View room on the 7th floor in room 751, it was very beautiful we had two double beds, Table w/ chair and there was a couch that made into a single bed for sleeping which we did not use, but very nice, even tho it had a small tare on the bottom of the couch, who cares folks.......if they had to replace things like this every time something happens , that is when you are going to see big price increases and this will not allow for some people to be able to come and enjoy a vacation if you can't get a reasonable rate.....By the way there was NO trash and smell located any where on the premises during our stay and for you folks that complained about water n smell on the lower level decks for parking, that was NOT the case during our stay either, the parking deck was fine and I can see if there was a lot of rain and wind that may be a problem but USE common sense and just don't park under there and get your umbrella out and use them......and let me add to the people that left bad reviews and saying that the Resort has bed bugs, well first of all you probably brought them from your own home and there is a Website that you can go to the Bed Bug Registry and you can see for yourselves that this Resort does NOT have them and you would be surprised by the ones located in Daytona that does............so check that out and see for yourself.......Over all we had an amazing time @ the Desert Inn Resort w/ no complaints what so ever and this will continue to be our home away from home and plan on making our reservations again in the next few weeks can't wait to go BACK!

Read my review below **News story here(http://www.clickondetroit.com/consumer/26613357/detail.html) I stayed at the Desert Inn back in September and I must say I wish I had the common sense to look up reviews prior to my stay. I was reminded today of my terrible experience while watching the news and a piece on the 5 worst/dirtiest hotels in America and I wasn't the least bit surprised when I saw this hotel was rated the third worst hotel in the country!! I'm sure some of you might not think that this place is as bad as these reviews but I assure you it is, and the link to the news story proves it. I assure you I am not the competition down the street, I'm from Michigan...so you can imagine how upset I was when we went all the way to Florida for vacation only to have to stay in this dump(couldn't afford to re-book) This hotel was filthy. When my friends and I got to our room we couldn't help but feel ripped off. The room was not fit for human occupation. The floor was obviously not cleaned seeing as there were still peanut shells on the floor which any amount of vacuuming would have taken care of. The walls were peeling and we were not surprised to see that a picture that was hanging on the wall was covering a hole. The gold trim on the ceiling was chipped and missing in certain places. After seeing the news story I read other reviews and seen the \"management\" respond saying dadudu123456789's review was false because the hotel doesn't have gold trim on the ceilings. I can only assume the management is delusional from the diseases they probably caught from working there because it most certainly has chipped gold trim. This place is full of bugs, mainly roaches and ants and you can hear rodents in the walls at night. DO NOT bring children here, they will never want to go on vacation again because of the traumatizing effect this place will have on them. Stay away at all costs.

We immediately paid more money to get a room change, thinking that must have been the cheapest room they had...no improvement. I repeatedly examined the brochure which stated they had made all these renovations and kept looking back in the room and halls wondering where they were. We assumed that maybe the rooms facing the pool were the ones that were renovated, but judging from the other reviews on this site they were not. The hotel was literally falling apart. One day we walked down the hall and saw a piece of the hotel tile on the floor. It had fallen off the wall. In the room itself, it seemed as if the ceiling tiles were going to fall from the kitchen any minute. The hotel is quite old and has an odor throughout. Like others said, we too, saw a cockroach while there. There were random rooms which seemed like they were still being renovated, but there were no signs saying do not enter. My niece and I walked past one large room in the lobby area. It seemed as if it used the business center, but the ceiling had fallen through, so we decided not to enter. There was another small room in the basement area with a pile of broken chairs. We finally found the business center next to that room, but it was full of kids, on 2 or 3 computers, so we did not enter. I have to admit that the tub was probably the cleanest thing in the room. Hotel staff did clean each day and gave us plenty of new towels. However, there was mold in the bathroom on the wall behind the shower curtain.We were not comfortable there for the three days that we stayed, but dealt with it anyway. I would never go there again and would never recommend this hotel to families. This is clearly a party hotel considering that the majority of the people walking around enjoying themselves were either drunk or drinking. I would recommend this hotel to a bunch a partying college students that are just going to destroy a hotel anyway. I have to say, however, that when I was a college student and went to FL for spring break, we would have never stayed in a hotel like this. I find it interesting that hotel management (or whomever) is taking the time to respond to all of the bad reviews on this website. I find many of the responses from management to be funny because they simply are not true. I have been in agreement with all of the bad reviews I have seen except the comments about the hotel staff. They were quite friendly and helpful whenever we needed something, but their friendliness was overshadowed by the poor quality of the hotel. Just to give a hint of how honest the hotel website is, I have attached a picture. The hotel says that your room either has a view of the beach or a view of the river (we kept wondering what river). YAttached you can see our view of the river from our patio. It is located right behind the two orange spots in the background. I wish I had taken more pics of the hotel itself, but judging from the overall rating of the hotel, they are not needed. Oh and one more thing, I am a \"homebody,\" and when I go on vacation, I spend all of my time in the room relaxing and watching tv...not at this place.

My grandparents began staying when my father and his brother were teenagers. I am 25 years old and have been going with my family since I was 4 years old. This year my grandparents agreed that we will NEVER go back. The hotel has steadily decline over the past few decades. Now that I am old enough to see the terrible conditions of the motel I felt the need to tell others about it. This year we traveled with two small children (5 yrs and 7 months). Our room was WAY too small for the five adults and two children we had in our group (we have stayed in larger rooms before). We had so little space that we could not all sit in the living room together! With one sofa and one small chair someone always had to stand or sit in the bedroom or on the floor. The pull out bed was gross with a large dark colored stain across it. The bathroom door was so warped by moisture that it would not close. The bathroom floor flooded every time someone took a shower because the lip of the handicap shower did not prevent the water from running out of the stall (we wore flip flops everytime we went into the bathroom, like a college dorm!). Only one burner worked on the stove. While cooking one night the cabinets suddenly fell down. The fridge was not the usually size but had been replaced with one much smaller, we could not store food and drinks! One day at around 11am we hear a loud banging sound from next door. The 7 months old was napping at the time. The baby woke up screaming and his mother (my cousin) walked next store to complain. It turns out that maintenance was installing a vent that would empty out on our balcony! (But of course no one bothered to call and tell us so that we could plan accordingly) At least the maintenance guys were very nice once they realized that they had woken up the baby and they apologized several times. And finally, on the day of our checkout we called the front desk early to see if we could have an extension so that we could let the kids play out at the pool before their 14 hr car ride home. We were told that we could stay until 2 o'clock (regular checkout is 11am). At about noon we received a call from the front desk telling us that we had to be out ASAP and that the previous person we spoke to had made a mistake. My cousin Josh walked down to the front desk and advised that the kids were in the pool as the rest of us were packing and that the front desk had given us an extension. The man at the front desk acknowledged that it was indeed the Inn's fault and said that we could have an extension until 2pm. At 12:30 a women from the front desk called and ask why we were not out of our room yet. I explained that we were giving until 2pm and that we were currently loading the cars. The woman was very rude and said that 2pm was too late and that we had to be out by 1pm (do these people not confer with one another???). Thankfully the kids and my grandparents returned within a few minutes after that phone call. We finished loading the cars, cleaned up the kids and left...we will NEVER be back!!!", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cDON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "bosslady_atl", "ReviewID": "UR70340631", "Content": "OMG.............

The woman who answered the phone said, they have suites availalbe, it's clean, they are updating, and all this other stuff that makes them so great.

The basement of the hotel, where they tell you to park, had water leaking into it and seriously scared me! It was nasty looking, dim and very dingy. The walk way to the elevators was full of water, now it just rained, so I am sure the run off went right into the basement/parking area.

We paid over $200 per night for this place, and feel we were robbed, but again, since our other hotel messed up we basically had no options.

We started by taking a dip in the pool. there were tons of smashed beer cans, cigarette butts and baby diapers (full of dookie) next to the pool, the daiper was almost IN the pool, missed by inches.

Just out of curiosity I checked the Jacuzzi and guess what? Bugs. Then decided to lay down where there were bugs between the comforter and the sheets. Nice touch, huh? GENERAL SANITATION IS A SERIOUS CONCERN IN THIS HOTEL! There were neumerous stains and 'stuff 'smeared on the wall. The trim and decor looks like a five year olds coloring book. The painting and wall finish appeares to be done by Stevie Wonder. Around the door surrounds there are substantial mildew buildup. The furniture is cheap and delapitaded, used years beyond it use. The antique carpets were definately not vaccumed. There were bugs (again) smashed on the glass of the sliding glass door leading to the balcony. There were even working blacklights above the bed (why I can only imagine...) Let me just colse by saying this. As for as I can remember, I have never written a review for a hotel.

The website made it look nice and it was afordable, and seemed to be what we were looking for. We discovered the reviews on trip advisor after we had already put down the deposit, and considering just about every single review was negative we realized this hotel was not going to be what the website made it out to be, but since we already paid for one night we decided to look at the room before moving to a different hotel. Also, I had called the hotel prior to leaving asking if they were aware of the reviews which were posted online. Now obviously he isn't going to tell me the hotel is discusting or anything negative what so ever, but I just wanted to know what their response would be. The gentleman responded by telling me those reviews were due to the fact that they kick out kids on spring break and thats their way of getting back at the hotel and they can asure the room will be clean. We brought an air mattress and blankets so if it came down to it we could just sleep on that. When we got to the hotel it definately looked out dated and you could see from the outside one of the rooms had a light on but if wasn't just a normal light it was a black light, classy, but we still tried to have some hope of it being even in the \"okay\" category; however by this point knew it wasn't going to be. From the moment we walked in the door you could tell this was going to be a disaster. The man at the front desk was very unprofessional and couldn't find our reservations and honestly he didn't really seem too determined to do so; he seemed more concerned about finishing his cigarette, but we had brought the receipt with us so he figured it out from that. We asked to see the room before paying so he called a guy down the front desk wearing a dirty shirt that said security on the back. He took us down some random hallway off to the side past the pool which had a ton of stuff floating in it to our room. We booked a courtyard room. I wasn't aware that a courtyard was a big piece of cement with one plastic table and chairs on it, but I guess you learn something knew every day. Everything already smelled aweful and when he opened the door to the room everything got even worse. I really wish I could have gotten a picture of the room it was such a joke! There were two beds jammed in there so close to each other that I don't think I could have walked between them, piles of dirt were all over the floor, everything was old and dirty, and there was a stove shoved in the corner; the point to that I have no idea considering there wasn't even a fridge or any other form of appliance. We took one look at room looked at each other and said absolutely not! There was no way we could have even slept on the air mattress. As we walked out the guy behind the desk was now playing the guitar and the \"security guard\" never even said two words to us. We went the the Holiday Inn next door but it was full since it was race weekend. The man however did aplogize that we had booked at the Desert Inn and said they get people from there all the time. We ended up at the Sleep Inn which was actually in Ormond Beach, but it was great. We really enjoyed our stay there. The staff couldn't have been nicer and it was very clean.

The trip from February 29 to Saturday March 8, 2008 was booked by my friend Jack Shayer. We arrived at the hotel Friday, February 29, 2008 at approximately 11:30 pm. Once entering the lobby which is very nice we were given room 437. The room was anything but nice and clean. The condition of the room was deplorable, the room had two fold out couches that when opened revealed mattresses that were not fit for an animal to sleep on they were very seriously stained. The general condition of the room was unacceptable, the biggest problem it was not clean and the ceiling tiles were falling out etc. We decided to sleep on the floor which seemed to be the better choice than the couches. The next morning Jim Peterson one of the guys in our party went to the desk and informed the person about the conditions of the room. He left his phone number after being told if there was anything they could do they would call him. To make a long story short after a while we were assigned room 232.Going to the room I noticed the conditions of the hallways, dirt, broken tiles, and cigarette butts etc. The general condition of the room was just so so. There was mold in the bathroom and dust on the ceiling also there was a old half eaten egg and muffin under a chair that we had to move. We decided it was better than room 437. We then moved our belongings to this room. After resting for a little while we decided to take showers it was then we discovered there was very little water pressure. This water pressure problem was consistent through the rest of our stay. This was not what we expected for the price we were paying for a room ($2350.00). We then went to get our motorcycles and on my way going to the parking garage I then saw conditions that were very dangerous if not a serious health problem. The area in this walk way was very wet with water leaking out of the ceiling, a fan in the ping pong area was tied to the sprinkler system and there was a very serious mold problem everywhere, and wet electrical outlets plus many other serious problems, exit signs not lit or just broken etc (I took pictures of all this and will be sending them to the proper Health Department and Fire and Safety Officials and Building Inspector). In general the girl cleaning our room though very nice but did the very minimum no vacuuming, no cleaning she did not change the bed linens or cart linens no cleaning the bathroom just supplying new towels and fixing the beds and carts. I could go on and on but I won\u2019t. I will however give you my party\u2019s opinion of the staff and the hotel itself. The staff seems nice but there is a serious lack of supervision and leadership. (As all of us in the party said it seems there is no one in charge!!) The place is filthy and run down and the City or State should do a surprise Fire, Safety and Health inspection of the Hotel. I am sure they would find many serious violations. We as a group would never recommend the place to anyone. We will tell every one we talk to about our bad experience. I must say in my 51 years of traveling this is the worst place I have ever stayed in. Ps Your room card says Daytona\u2019s# 1 Oceanfront Resort Hotel, Lie!!!

I got here yesterday and here's my unbiased review. On arrival, my fiancee's first words were \"Oh my God it looks like Liberace threw up here\" after speaking with management it appears that Liberace actually DID stay here for real. Cons: On check in we were unimpressedwith the girl at the front desk who tried to charge us for our room we had already prepaid for, also noone is there to help with bags and their luggage carts are from the 1950's, so incidentally are the elevators. Also unimpressed with the used bandaid on the carpet of our room, and the gum stuck to the wall tiles, also the toilet did not flush and the sink did not drain, but the absolute worst concerns were to come later. I manage a 24 storey building in Toronto Canada so I know a few things here when I speak. I checked the fire extinguishers outside my room and found they had not been checked since October 2007, almost 5 months previous! Worse still, after my first night I was shocked and horrified to learn that my electronic room lock on my door did not work. YES, anyone who pushed on my door could walk in! Pros: This place is structually very pleasant, well that is before Liberace's decorator took over. Everywhere you look it seems as if someone with really really bad taste had way too much say in things. Put it this way, anyone who thinks bright pink and gold look good together in a hallway should be shot, urinated on, then shot again for good measure. But this is my pros section so I'll get to the good stuff. The pools are very well kept and as pictured. For my family we were looking to beat the cold of Ontario's winter and for that it worked very well. The staff (though minimal) seemed for the most part interested in resolving our concerns, ok, let's rephrase that, they seemed interested in hearing our concerns. Bottom line: Check your door locks, but aside from that it's no Holiday Inn, beach and pools are great, so is the location so do a thorough site check before accepting your room. In the end if you want the Holiday Inn, it's right next door.

My family and I planned a three night stay in Daytona Beach and choose this hotel based on the website. We reserved the two bedroom suite with two bathrooms, full kitchen and two queen size sleep sofas in the living area. Sounds great, but do not believe the pictures on the website. The living area on the website was about 4 times the size of the actual living space. We were very disappointmented from the moment we drove up to check-in, more disappointmented when we drove to the parking garage... Imagine if you will... walking from the parking garage to the hotel elevator. First you walk through a small door down a hall with water dripping from the ceiling on the the already very wet floor. Now turn right down another hall without water on the floor, but instantly you are hit in the face with heat from the washer and dryers to your right. Next you see the outdated computer center, game room that some drunk during Spring Break would enjoy, Last you enter the area with the 3 elevators, which only one works unless you find the magical button which operates the second elevator. Even though these were true signs of needed renovation work, I remembered the picture from the website and thought things would improve once I entered the room. My immediate reaction after dropping my bags was to run down stairs and inform the representative that we were given the incorrect room because the pictures on the website described the room differently and had pictures of larger rooms. I was informed that we had the largest room in the hotel. The representative would not entertain my comments about the pictures on the website. I thought no worries, just a long weekend. Events continued through the night, which forced me to move my family down the street to a different hotel, which charged a premium since it was a last minute reservation. I had to fight with the manager for a refund, which she eventually honored, but I had to pay for the first night plus an additional fee. Fine... I just wanted out. Now to further share my thoughts, I have stayed in hotels in Eastern Europe, West Africa, parts of South America and have never seen such a mess of a hotel. If you are young on a very tight budget and want to go to the beach, this might be the place for you.

I've been to many beaches in FL and NEVER had this problem. Couldn't even stand out on the broken balcony to get away from them. Yes I said broken balcony. The part where the bolt goes into the side for achoring, it was broken. The kids downstairs were smoking so much pot that we didn't spend much time on the balcony. Couldn't go to the beach for the fleas. The hotel was soooo dirty, I wouldn't even think about swimming in the pools. The staff in the hotel restaurant (if you want to call it that) were friendly but the food was horrible. We finally saw someone cleaning the hotel the last day we were there. The hotel staff was nice. The maids only 1/2 cleaned the rooms. Seems they only made the beds. No vacuum, no clean tubs, sinks, toilets, etc. Dresser had a bottom of the drawer missing, took 1.5 days to get another one. We were told it was because they had to wait for another guy to come in so that he could help carry the dresser, ok that was understandable, however turned out only one guy picked up and brought to our room. This place is not worth the low cost. Stay anywhere else in Daytona, if you must go to Daytona. If like us, it was our first visit to Daytona Beach and it will be our last visit.

We were highly upset with the looks of the lobby and other areas of the hotel. Our room was horrible. It didnt even feel clean. They claimed to have an internet cafe, which they had a small glass enclosed room with no A/C and 6 or so computers. Some of them didnt even have mice. I wouldnt call it a \"cafe\". Some of the computers didnt even work. They claimed to have a movie theater. There was a door and sign that said it was a theater, it was never open during the whole week we stayed there they never said why. The garage is dimly lit and its full of water all the time. Dripping and dingy. Scary too when you are a single mom with 2 sons walking through there. There is no way to get your luggage and luggage cart from the garage without lugging it around yourself from one cart up steps to the other cart. There is no way to get the carts down the stairs in the lobby to the front doors/entry way either. The pool was dirty, the pool deck was not nice. I didnt find anything at all that I liked about the hotel. Our room carpet never felt vacuumed. It was sandy. Ok, it was at the beach but on the 9th floor. The elevators are scary and dirty. They move slowly. I would definately not recommend this hotel (resort... ha ha) to anyone. We had a \"city view\" room because I couldnt afford much. Well you definately get what you pay for. I thought from the brochures and the pictures I found that it was a great place. NOT! Do not stay here for even a night. Its not worth it at all. It is a horrible place to stay.

Yes, the lobby was just as described, very nice. Our room was not ready by 3:00, but we endured the delay. The cleaning staff was wonderful during our entire stay. One should consider that most of the hotels on Daytona Beach are older, except for the time shares and places that have been torn down to make room for the new condo units. Our room was clean with everything as booked. We had the two bedroom suite with kitchen. There was a slight problem with the drains in the tubs, but I was able to patch them up so that they drained during our stay. Our cleaning person offered to have maintenance come and repair, but I had it remedied for the time we were there. Everyday I saw cleaning staff and maintenence people working. We did have a lot of road noice, but then our room did have two balconies overlooking the street as well as one that overlooked the ocean. Again, the older places don't have the soundproofing that the newer resorts have. The hotel had a DJ that came in every day to the pool at 12:00, doing fun things there with the kids and adults alike. We could hear the music on the beach, which we really enjoyed. The bar at the pool was quite nice as well. I was told by another guest that we could just take our cooler to the front desk and get it filled with ice rather than just getting a small bag. I never had a problem getting ice at any point during our stay. We were close enough to the Boardwalk to see the nightly fireworks. I went into this hotel with all the bad stuff in mind. I had checked with one person who put a good review on and this place is like she said....if you are used to staying at a 5 star hotel, it is not the place for you. If you are not a particularly picky person, you will have a comfortable stay. My complaint would be with the guests who come there to stay who throw trash down and don't pick up after themselves. Yes, we are on vacation, but I am sure that we all were taught right from wrong. Again, it is an older hotel, but if you keep this in mind and go to have a good time, you will. This place was cheaper than the resorts right at the Boardwalk, so also bear this in mind. It is as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.

Instead upon arrival, I was charged almost $200.00 more than the total I was given over the phone. We checked in to our room thinking we were still getting a good deal on a two bedroom suite with jaquizzi, full kitchen,and balcony view of the beach. However, we arrived in our first room we were given, my first opinion was \"oh my God!\" The room only held 4 occupants and was supposed to be able to sleep eight. The sliding glass door didn't open. Well, I take that back, It was already open by two inches. Then I discovered it didn't close any more or open anymore. The so called full kitchen was barely even big enough for one person to even turn around in. The jaquizzi, there wasn't one. I went to the front desk and asked them what was going on, b/c this is not the room i asked for. The gentleman at the front desk gave me several keys,and told my friends and I to pick the one we wanted. The first room we checked looked as if there was a party in it just hours before us. There was a full salad in the floor under the kitchen table, and the sheets were still off the bed. Anyways, we checked several more rooms,and they all looked just as bad if not worse. I went to the front desk this time with two of my friends that were with me. I was furious! They finally gave me the room I reserved, after trying to argue with me it wasn't. However, I had everything they had mailed me about my room and showed the girl at the desk. She gave us a key to this new room. We were still trying to keep our spirits up and we were all excited running to the room. When we opened the door, the room did look nice. Then it went to Hell, pardon my french. The bath room was dirty from head to floor. The jaquizzi, my friends cleaned, so i wouldn't get any more mad and go back to the desk. We walked out on the balcony, and the floor was risen every where. If you didn't take every step with caution, you would trip and kill yourself. We didn't say anything for a few hours, and we just went on to the beach trying to ignore everything that happened. We returned to the room later that night to go to sleep. Keeping this in mind that we ALL were at the beach, when we tried to go to sleep that night, we moved one of the chairs to pull out the sleeper sofa, which was too big for the room. We had to rearrange the whole room to get it out. We found a USED CONDOM! I was so upset. I ran to the desk to address the problem with the man who was there, and I would appreciate if some one would come get it. He told me to get a tissue and pick it up myself, and that we were just complaining over stupid stuff. I am sorry, but I would not even put my dog in that room. Another young gentleman did eventually come and remove the condom, and I told him to tell his manager I would be down first thing in the morning to discuss this matter. She brushed it off like it wasn't no problem. After nearly 15min. of fussing with her, she gave us our last room for the stay. We go inside, yes it was nicer than the rest, but still not up to health code. Once we started getting our clothes, food, and etc. in place, bugs started coming out everywhere. They were crawling, flying,and some even seemed to be attacking us. These are just the room problems we had. Well, and the problems we had with their rude staff. The maid came to our room and started offering drugs to some of the girls staying with us. WHAT! Then she proceeded to tell us that she even sold it out of her room at the hotel. They said that there was a basketball court and gym. If there was no one could find them. The basketball court was no where to be found, and the gym was never open. They say they have a DJ. He must have been invisble, too. This hotel is falsely advertised, the staff is probably the rudest I have ever encountered, and the rooms are disgusting! I would not recommmed this hotel to anyone, not even my worst enemy! Please think twice before booking a room here.

While passing by Daytona Beach on the way to Clearwater beach, my wife, 3 kids and I decided to stop for the night after driving all day. Our night went like this..... The desk clerk told me our room would be a suite with a separate bedroom, fridge and microwave. The price sounded good for all that. I gave the clerk my Visa and went out to park the car in the ramp. I ran over a pile of broken glass in the ramp (luckily I didn't get a flat). I parked the van and stepped out into some slimey goop that seemed to cover the entire paking surface. The place smelled like vomit. I figured it wasn't cleaned up from spring break yet. We headed into the hotel through the ramp enterence passing a flooded game room with busted up ping pong tables. What a mess. There was another room with computers for internetnet access. This room looked equally devistated with broken chairs and debris all over. I stilll gave the benefit of the doubt telling my wife that spring break was over a couple of weeks ago. They should have, however, got rid of the busted up stuff and straightened up a bit. We passed through the lobby and got on an elevator (which smelled as bad as the parking ramp) and headed up to the 6th floor to our room. We got to the room which was not a suite as the clerk described. They were nice enought to leave us an extra fold out bed so there would be room for the five of us. I was tired from a day of driving. I didn't want to be hassled with trying to get another room. We grabbed a bite to eat and went to bed. The room was warm and humid, so I turned on the AC. The AC made a looud banging noise. The kids couldn't sleep with it. I shut it off anf opened the balcony door. The street noise below was just as bad. We got throught the night and got out of there early.

We had to move to another hotel later in the week much farther away because this hotel was booked for the Daytona 500. My mother-in-law came on this vacation with us so we could go to the races and leave her with our 2 little ones. What was important to them was the indoor pool, (weather in Feb. here is iffy), the restaurant, and game room.

Each day they cleaned the sand off of the stairs and pool area that led to the beach, but it would get dirty again--that can't be helped. Don't get me wrong there was sand on the floor and in the rugs going to and from the lobby, elevator and rooms-But that can't be helped with all the traffic going in and out. I would see the workers mop and vacuum but the people were tracking it in. BUT we did have a nice stay and I am glad about that.

Before we left, we found this site and read the reviews about the Desert Inn. My sister-in-law has stayed there for the past few years and she said the reviews were wrong, and must have been intended fro another hotel. My wife, being very particular and almost a \"clean freak\" decided to get busy and also make a reservation at the Holiday Inn next door. She wanted to stay where her sisters were staying but wasn't gonna stay if the place was nasty. We could always cancel the Holiday Inn (their cancel policy is just by 6pm the day you are supposed to arrive and no cancel fee). ((By the way, the Desert Inn bills your credit card the day you make the reservation, and you lose your deposit if you cancel less than 30 days before your scheduled arrival.)) Please keep in mind, their website boasts a $10 million in NEW Renovations just completed... Read on.. When we arrived, 1st strike, there was a woman complaining to the desk clerk about her son getting 'bugs' in his hair from the bed. This should have been warning enough, right? Anyway, we said we wanted to see our room before we checked in. The clerk studied the computer screen for a while and went back in the office a couple of times. He finally came back and told us that our room was supposed to be on the same floor as her sisters' 2 rooms. ?ok? Then he gave us a key to a 2nd floor room and said we could go look at it. The stairway leading to the walkway and the walkway itself immediately outside the room looked nasty and smelled of urine. All along the walkways of this $10 million renovated facility there were pieces of tile missing and old severely cracked places in the paint. We opened the door to a musty, dirty room. The tile floor felt sandy under our shoes, a rusty air conditioner dripped water INTO the room where it wasn't mounted correctly. The kitchen was an indention in the wall, but the pictures on the website make it look like the kitchen is a totally separate room. I looked it over and wouldn't have eaten anything cooked on that stove, and I was afraid to look in the fridge. My wife went into the bathroom and found the \"clean\" toilet dirty and the corner shower was moldy and mildewed. Our 13yr old son was in the other room saying something about this isn't too bad, so my wife told him to come look in the bathroom. His reaction, \"Ok, I was wrong. I don't want to stay here.\" When we went back and told the desk clerk, he said he couldn't give us our money back, then, looking over his shoulder (I asume he was looking to see where the manager was), he leaned forward and said I should contest the charge on my credit card bill. \"A lot of people do\", he told me. I felt bad for this guy because I know it's his job, and he may not be able to find somethjing else. I sure would hate to work there. One more note, my wife's 2 sisters wound up staying there because they couldn't find other rooms, but even the one who had stayed there before said \"never again\". Oh Yeah, remember me saying the clerk told me we were all 3 supposed to be on the same floor and gave us a 2nd floor room key. Sister 1 was on the 5th floor, and Sister 2 was put on the 7th floor. We never did figure out what the renovations that cost $10 million were. We also checked and found out it is NOT AAA Rated. I wonder why??

My son had his own bed so we went back to the hotel and looked at the bed and there was brown bugs all over the linen and the matress, I rushed down stairs to speak to a manager while my husband went to the drug store for lice and crab medician and the lady was like whats the problem I told her and I demanded all my money back and showed her my sons head and she said I dont see anything \" OH MY I SAID\" they were all over his head and then she proceeded to go look at the bed where she again said I dont see anything.

I couldn't believe I had booked here for a week, drove over 600 miles, and dropped a $1000! We got to our room and it was old, dirty, and dilapidated. The door was propped open with a piece of wood. I felt like I was in a nightmare. The room was oceanfront, but the layout of the hotel made the beach seem like a mile away. The balcony overlooked a patio (I guess you could call it that), and two kids were throwing rocks at the cars below. When we started down to get our luggage, the door wouldn't completely close because the lock was falling apart (the key wouldn't lock the door either). I wasn't going to subject my family to this, so I went to the front desk. The people in front of me were requesting ice (the clerks distributed the ice in a zip lock freezer bag). When I told the clerk I wanted my money back he said there were no refunds and that he would get a maintenance man to fix the lock. I repeated that I wanted my money back. He finally agreed to refund all except the first night. We wouldn't have stayed even if it were free. After only about 30 minutes at this place, we just wanted out! We left immediately not knowing if we could even find a room. We ended up staying the night a few miles away from the beach at a Courtyard Marriott. We needed a suite which made it tougher to find a room spur of the moment. Fortunately, Palm Plaza in South Daytona had one opening up the next day for the rest of the week.

Our wake up call that we asked for never happened and our carpet never got vacuumed once!...please if you are thinking of the desert inn as a vacation spot...think again.. the pool may be nice but check out the pool's public bathroom and you'll reconsider the whole thing!", "Date": "March 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDo NOT stay here\u201d", "Author": "Flharleygirl1508", "ReviewID": "UR1719462", "Content": "After booking a 2 room suite for $375 per night, found ourselves in a 1 room filthy, sagging bed horror. Complained to management who, after initially being very rude, offerred to move us to a suite for $400 a night - a vastly discounted rate, I was told. Transferred into the \"Alladin Suite\" which was probably very nice - 20 years ago. Again, filthy, holes in the walls and the badly discolored ceiling, loose tiles in the bath floor, ancient saggy mattresses - I can't even describe how bad it was. Nieghbors partying and screaming until 4 AM and desperate calls (on old, busted up phones) to hotel \"security\" produced NOTHING. Paper thin walls - not peace for the 2 nights we were there. The big feature of the room was a big jacuzzi tub which we never touched and a big balcony which was so dirty you had to have shoes on to walk on it, dodging the cigar butts and beer bottles the people next door left on OUR balcony. The common halls of the place were no better - worn, filthy carpet, Huge bags of trash left in the hallways all night, broken glass on the floor in the elevator hall - we tried desperately to get another motel but it was bike week and everything was booked. Next time I will sleep on the beach before I ever go near this place again.", "Date": "March 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201c3rd time and never again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1713394", "Content": "We've been to the Desert Inn on 3 occassions, this by far was the worst, the only reason we went back was we saw on the website where they did many renovations. The only advantage to this property is its close enough to walk to places in Daytona for night life, but the hotel complex itself is a disaster with the exception of the pool. To start with our truck was broken into in the parking garage and items stolen the very first night there, and management could have cared less, and wouldnt even review the garage tapes to see if anything was visible or may have been recorded. They wouldnt call the police, we had to drive over to the Police Station to make the report. We had rented two oceanfront rooms both with kitchenettes, which the kitchens had missing ceiling tiles, drawers just hanging in the openings, and just generally dirty. Had this been during or right after bike week or spring break it'd be understandable, but this was the 1st week of August. The door handle on the slider to the balcony of our bedroom broke off in our hand, when we went to open the door, and when it rained, the carpet in front of the slider was soaked almost 2 feet into the room. We had two young ladies squat in front of our adjoining room and relieve themselves in the hall, and it ran under the door into the room, we called housekeeping to clean it up, but they never showed up. We ended up cleaning it up ourselves, we understand they cant control the guests but at least clean up after them in those type of circumstances. We ride bikes and not much bothers us, but this place for a hotel is much closer to a rally site campground than a hotel. It needs to be completely revamped totally, or torn down and completely redone, its lived beyond its prime...........but then again I'm not too sure Daytona Beach hasn't exceeded its prime also, time to find another vacation spot.
