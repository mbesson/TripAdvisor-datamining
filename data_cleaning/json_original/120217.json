The location is good,very near to all the theme parks and there are lots of good restaurants and some outlet malls nearby. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and there is a lovely pool area, but the main thing we liked were the staff, they were always extremely helpful and lovely. We moved rooms from the second floor to the fourth floor due to the Wi-Fi internet connection not being so good in our part of the hotel, which was then fine, and a member of staff even phoned us later to make sure all was ok for us :-) how nice :-) There is a free complimentary buffet breakfast which is basic but good; it is served on polystyrene plates and plastic cutlery, but it is free. The layout could be better, as it gets very busy and people bump into each other - especially from 9-9.30 which is when everyone seems to want to eat. Maybe the hotel could look at having the breakfast from 7-10 instead of 6.30-9.30 or have more of a flowing route around the breakfast collection area. Just one important thing to point out: if your stay is longer than 6 nights, the hotel will automatically charge the credit card you used on check in, unless you prepay with the final card you wish to charge you bill to with the full amount. So on checking out, we wished to pay with a US dollar card, but found out that the holding card had already been charged with one portion of the bill at 6 days and the rest on the morning of checkout even before we had arrived at the checkout desk, resulting in charges from both the bank and the hotel. They refunded the card at our request & did charge the dollar card instead (which couldn't be used as a holding card, otherwise we would have, thus avoiding the problem!), but due to the payment being taken and returned, it still cost us over \u00a350.00 in charges for the transactions to be taken and returned, due to exchange rates and bank charges, as well as taking over a week for the refund. Apart from this, we would like to say a big thank you to LARRY, AMINA & all the staff for being so nice & helpful.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "krbristol", "Title": "\u201cVery convenient location.\u201d", "Author": "krbristol", "ReviewID": "UR126512926", "Content": "Very handy for Disney shopping village and other attractions.

I will agree that it was a good value for the area. The suite room with a seperate bedroom versus sitting area was a great layout. The pool area was nice looking, not super big, but nice. Breakfast was OK with cereals, waffle maker, yogurt, sausage, some circular egg product, small muffins, etc. The area where the food was located was too small and not laid out well for the amount of people. It was like playing bumper cars with people to try and get to the food. The room as I said was roomy. The sitting area and bed area appeared to have been freshened up fairly recently. The bath area (part of the bedroom area) had not been updated recently and was kind of bland and basic. There was a fridge, stove top, and microwave in the room. The sitting bar doubled as an eating area and your desk as there was not a seperate table for a desk to work on computers. The furniture was basic and no frills but was usable. As I said, this was a value type place versus one trying to make a luxury impression. Would I stay here again? Maybe. It would depend upon the price versus the competition. I would not refuse to stay here as it was very good for the price paid. I did like the lower amount of traffic on Palm Parkway versus the Vineland Drive hotels on the other side of I-4.

Air conditioning works great but is on the noisy side. Not a problem for us. Breakfast is included and might get somewhat repetitive as days go by. You get boiled eggs, sausages, scrambled eggs cooked like a tortilla, pastries, a waffle machine, juice (not so good), cereals, coffe (we like it), milk, apples, oranges, etc. We usually buy something else we'd like to have for breakfast and get all the other stuff provided by the hotel to the room, or just have a quick bite in the car while going to the parks.

It is in a PERFECT location if you are going to parks/attractions and if you have a car! They do offer a shuttle service, although we did not use it (we are from Fla so had driven there) it would be a bit of a far walk to walk to any major attractions (ie Downtown Disney). Lots of restaurants near by, shops, outlets just up the road... Breakfast at the hotel can be a little misleading based on website...it's a plus because it's free, but it isn't a HOT breakfast buffet...they have 1 waffle maker, and you can get hard~fried egg or sausage...other than that there is cereal, bagels, danish, toast...enough to get you going, but not a \"filling\" meal.

Nice little pond with walking track for those early morning walks. Pool looked very inviting though we did not use it during our stay.

The gym area looked very nice but we did not use it. The only negative I found and this was very minor and probably not worth even mentioning was that the internet was very slow. We normally stay at Embassy Suites and actually stayed at an Embassy Suites the last night to be closer to the Sanford Airport but the Quality Inn was hands down a much nicer hotel and made the Embassy seem very outdated.

The free hot breakfast was good enough....especially when you consider that's more money that you can spend in the parks. The hotel offers free shuttle service to the four Disney Parks. It was a nice perk, until they ran out of room on the bus and other hotels who contract with the same shuttle service, had guest who cut in line to get a seat on the shuttle. The shuttle actually had people standing up, adults and children while driving to the various destinations. This could have presented a problem, but if free shuttle service is a must, please consider this before placing all your eggs in this basket.

First of all, the location is excellent (you'll need a car, though): minutes to downtown Disney, 15 minutes to the Disney Parks, 10 minutes to Sea World, 15 minutes to Universal! No need to take the I4, just follow Palm Parkway and Turkey Lake Rd to SW&Uni. There's also a - busy - Wallmart closeby for your groceries. Also compiments for the staff: they are VERY FRIENDLY! Even at the information desk they're very eager to help and will give you discount and/or priority voucher for nearby restaurants (Planet Hollywood etc.). I stayed in a 2Q suites (1K rooms were sold out), which of course was quite comfortable for just me. If you try to squeeze 4 or more people in this room, it will be very tight! Hotel was quiet, breakfast ok and not too crowded. As I traveled alone, I felt pretty safe in and around the hotel and in the area! There are a few cons: 1) airco (still) makes A LOT of noise .. you'll have to turn it off at night and leave the ceilingfan on, but it may get a bit sticky in your room. 2) No in-room safe to store laptop etc. 3) Found 1 cockroach in my room halfway during my stay - killed it - but I still felt a bit squeamish after that. I asume - because I stayed on the 4th floor - it came through the kitchensink-drain, which I plugged after the encounter. 4) This one is more serious: there was a fire-alarm one morning. It was so loud and noisy that you had to leave your room (that's a GOOD thing, you couldn't ignore it). So I left my room, using the stairs to get outside and found many people (some in pyama's and holding small children) waiting there. We waited a while, but NO ONE came out to tell us if it was for real or just a false alarm. Eventually I went inside to ask and the receptionist - who was very busy trying to solve the issue but seemed to be alone - finally told me that it was okay to enter the building again. Seconds later the firedept arrived and I think they checked the cause of the alarm. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN SUCH A SITUATION TO KEEP THE GUESTS INFORMED and they failed a bit on that account. All in all, if the price was right I would stay here again (or at the Extended Stay next door, but their 'free breakfast' is not even basic).

Very nice location and very convenient to stores, restaurants and Disney World. 5 min ride to Disney. Shuttle leaves once or twice in the morning to Disney and returns at night but we opted to drive so we could return on our own schedule. Kitchenette very convenient for family. Full size frig, 2 burners, dishwasher, counter, microwave, even silverware and dishes. Laundry room is convenient and clean. Small supply store in lobby. Good fitness room. Breakfast until 10am. GREAT outdoor pool. Relatively clean rooms. Separate bedroom and TV room. They are a \"Disney-friendly\" hotel which means Disney allows them to sell park tickets in the lobby - here's the catch - You have to sit through a one-on-one time share presentation. They claim it's 90 minutes but ended up being about 2 1/2 for us. We saved about $400 on tickets. After the woman gave us the comparison costs, that's when she hit us with the time share requirement. We went for it. We had built 2 extra days into our vacation so we had some extra time. We picked a morning we knew the weather would be bad and raining. They shuttled us over to the time share complex 10 minutes away (very nice) and we met with the sales guy. Typically like-able sales guy until he realized we weren't going to buy. Then he tried to turn the wife on me with a guilt trip. Kinda crappy but I don't care. Wife was on my side and we saved $400+ vs the online prices posted at the Disney site. If you don't typically give in to pressure easily and have extra time, go for it. I learned a lot about how time shares operate. Otherwise, get your tickets somewhere else. We payed $970 for 3 parks/5 people + one water park (Blizzard Beach) - 4 adults and 1 child (kids 10 and over are considered 'adults' for Disney tickets) 3 parks If you are on a budget and don't care for the Disney resort experience (just want time at the parks!) this is good cheap hotel!", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cQuality Suites = Quality Time\u201d", "Author": "Sc0ttishtravellers", "ReviewID": "UR116758402", "Content": "We (a family of four) have just come back from staying at quality suites LBV for a fortnight and have nothing but high praise to offer for this hotel.
