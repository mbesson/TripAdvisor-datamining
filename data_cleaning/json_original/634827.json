To start with, it's well well out of town. This is a real issue. If you are planning a Rome holiday, try and get a city center hotel. There are some good deals to be had, we had 6 nights for two at under 300 euros, but the travel was excruiating. Plus points: It's absolutely gorgeous. The gardens are idyllic, you could just sit out there and enjoy the scenery and occasional lizards scampering past. The drinks at the minibar are actually reasonably priced! You can use the minbar without getting hit by an insane bill. There's a nice shop across the road, handy for stocking up. Free parking Free wifi (but a little slow, and you may have to go to the lobby for a signal It's clean, and well cleaned every day. It's secure. Each room has barred windows and a safe. Minus points: It can get noisy, and the walls aren't thick. There's almost no control over the heat settings in the rooms. A teeny tiny bath for my less than slender western frame. There's only one plug in the room. If you unplug the TV you can also use that. Here's the biggy - Rome public transport is famously prone to wildcat strikes. Our last day we checked out, and no-one at the hotel thought to mention all the public transport was out for the day. Don't assume the staff will do something basically helpful like this of their own accord. If you stay here, have a plan for travel. The staff assume you've taken this into account and will have no sympathy for you if you complain about the hotel being inaccessible. If you are considering getting a car, note the standard of driving in Rome, and the number of cars with serious damage to them. If you're used to UK driving, don't assume driving in Rome is realistic. Consider where you will park if you're heading to the city center. The nearest Metro stations aren't situated in areas where it's safe to leave a car, or areas where you'll have any shot at finding a parking space. Consider that petrol is far more expensive (about 30% more than UK) and many roads are toll roads. Many toll roads can only be used by Italian residents. There aren't handy multistory car parks in Rome. Take a look at live feeds from Rome traffic cams and then see if you want to drive. If you are considering taxis, get the metered rate, and get them after 7am. It can be 25 euros to the nearest metro station, which is Batistini, 8.5Km away. Don't make our mistake of ordering a taxi for 7. They'll show up at five to, then set the meter running and charge you the higher rate for the whole journey. A taxi a day is insanely expensive. To the town center proper it's 40 each way. We went for public transport. A weekly ticket for all buses and metro trains was 16 euros. The 904 bus runs to the second nearest underground (metro) station, Cornelia. The advantage is that you can then hop on buses place to place in the town center between the sights. The bus stops are very intuitively laid out. The bus numbers have a list underneath of every street they drive down, in order, so you can easily follow the path on a map. The 904 goes from Via Selva Candida to Boccea, where the metro station is. The more out of the way bus stops like the one by the hotel don't have times, so there's a lot of waiting. At peak times, the bus is crammed. Get the 904 along Boccea several stops. If you go in the morning, you'll find everyone gets off at the metro. If you miss the stop, it's not a long way to the next, so it's not a big problem to walk back. You are supposed to validate your ticket (though no-one else seems to) by popping it into the machines, which read it, then return it. At Cordelia, get the Anagnina train on line A to the town center, or wherever you want to go. Change at termini for line B. If you do find there's a strike, a taxi may be your only option. You can flag them down on the street. Alternatively, places do day rentals of scooters.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "brossard, qc. canada", "Title": "\u201cJust as wonderful 3 years later\u201d", "Author": "lpansieri", "ReviewID": "UR123923081", "Content": "This is our second visit to this absolutely lovely hotel with wonderful bedrooms and beautiful grounds.

The hotel is very clean and tidy but we found our room rather small and it says sound proof rooms but they are not. Ours was right next to the lobby and we could hear guests arriving, leaving and any phone calls that came through, along with people snoring in the room next door. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the internet access and use of a laptop in reception was also handy. The location was too far out for us though. Although there is a bus stop over the road from the hotel, it takes 30 mins to get to Cornelia and then a metro ride to where ever your visiting, which when only staying for a short time eats into the day. We also found the road outside the hotel rather unsettling. It has no walk way so when walking back from a restaurant at night with no street lights and rather fast cars, buses and motorbikes whizzing past it is not great. The restaurants were nice though and no more expensive than in the centre. I wouldn't recommend for families with no car. If you have transport it is much better. The best thing about this hotel is the little cafe just up the road from the Hotel, although they speak very little english they are lovely. The cakes, food and drinks are cheaper than most places and the food is great! The breakfast at the hotel we found lovely, there is no hot food but there is plenty of other things. Fresh juice, fruit, bread, meats and cheese are plentiful. Our room also had no english speaking tv channels which although is not a major issue I would have liked to see the news at least.

But that's getting off track from this hotel review. The bus stop is very close, but may require a short walk down a highway with no sidewalks; however, we were told that Italians care too much about their automobiles to hit a pedestrian, who might only damage their vehicle!

It is a very good option if you plan to rent a car and see Rome. You can park your car in Cornelia & then could (or have to) commute by tube. It was safe to commute. Bus runs throughout the day & night but the tube service stops at 9 (from Sunday to Friday, except Line A) Bad: If you do not plan to rent a car, then you will be wasting at least one hour (30 minutes plus to Cornelia & then another 30 minutes to get to central Rome). Although the bus travel is convenient, the traffic is busy during peak hours & the bus is full. There is no footpath when you walk outside the hotel to the bust station & you literally walk along the road (which in itself is an experience, but can be dangerous if you are not careful) Advice: I know Franseco will definitely say that the bad things have got nothing to do with the hotel & I agree but it is important in the larger context! If you plan to rent a car or if your visiting for a day or two, then I will definitely recommend Selva Candida. If you plan to spend more time in Rome, then I suggest you look for more central locations as it saves time & you can stay quite late & see night life as well.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Fe, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cNice, clean, no frills\u201d", "Author": "dnjscheer", "ReviewID": "UR102062494", "Content": "We selected this hotel to be closer to Fiumicino for a morning flight. Knowing its location now, it was better than staying in Rome central, BUT, there are far closer hotels to FCO that would've been better. On a weekday morning the trip from the hotel to FCO was 40 minutes. The driver who was very nice took an alternate route to save time from traffic which helped a bit but was longer in the end. Then he claimed that dropping us at Terminal 3 was the right spot, but it wasn't our airline's location and we had to take another bus to Terminal 5. It seemed he wasn't quite as much in the mood to make the morning trip as he'd been much nicer the night before when he picked us up from Termini. It was great that the hotel offered this service. The rooms and baths are nice, no frills. Our tv did not work. Just one channel, did not change with the remote or on the tv. We didn't ask for service on this as we checked in late and went to bed. The morning breakfast is nice, good selection. For dinner, you do have to walk maybe 150 yards down the street. Crossing is a little dicey and there is no sidewalk for about 50 yards. It's not a huge problem. The restaurant was good but expensive for its location. Still, the only other choice is a bit further to walk. All in all, it was nice to have the option for the driver and the morning breakfast, but if your purpose is to get closer to FCO for a flight, you would probably be better off to stay in one of the actual airport hotels themselves.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cA Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Rubymint", "ReviewID": "UR97879160", "Content": "I recommend the Hotel Selva Candida.

The hotel property is well maintained with a lot of trees and grasses, making you feel like living in the countryside.

There is a grocery store right across the street where you can buy water and snacks. It's 50 euro to the airport. The bad part about this hotel is that it's far from any restaurants, the city center and the local subway stations (~10 minutes/ 15 euro taxi ride to the subway station, then 30 minutes subway to the Termini). Because there is no restaurant at the hotel (except for breakfast), we tried to walk to the closest restaurant (10 minutes away). It was challenging because the road is VERY narrow and people drive fast. There is a bus across the street from the hotel that runs every 25-30 minutes, but we could not figure out the schedule. We had trouble finding a taxi to come back to the hotel from the local subway station because there is no taxi stand. We ended up having dinner at a restaurant and asked the waitress to call for a taxi. We once wanted to book a tour to Napoli, but the tour bus would not pick us up at the hotel because it is too far.

The hotel is on the north western outskirt of Rome and my only advice for getting there is to pay the 50 euro fee for the hotel to bring you from the airport if you have a lot of baggage. The public transportation directions to the hotel are great and taking the train from the airport to the main Termini station in Rome to get the subway from there is not bad at all. Especially for someone use to using the New York subway system. The most interesting part was getting the bus from the Cornila station to the hotel. It took me about 15 min of walking around the enterance of the subway station to find the right bus stop. It is just north of the subway exit in a cluster of many bus stops about a block away. It may have just been the time of day but the bus was quickly packed as I kept bumping people with my luggage. Not knowing where the hotel was, I was a little concerned about where we were going as we got farther out of the city. I couldnt see any street signs but I was able to commicate with someone about where the hotel was. They pointed it out as we drove by and the bus stopped just short of the hotel.

So hopping to find it in the Hotel Selva Candida we booked a room. What we found at the arrival was by a long shot better then what we expected. It is well connected with the city center by a bus that stops right in front of the hotel and the warm welcome and service I ve found there was better than in all the other hotels I have been.The room we had was quiet and confortable and thanks to the wireless connection we could comunicate with our friends and family. I will personaly go back to the hotel Selva Candida in my future visits or Rome and with the greate value for money I would raccomand anybody to stay there.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cA perfect place!\u201d", "Author": "funmakers", "ReviewID": "UR66460653", "Content": "The hotel is lovely and an oasis from the suburban location, set amongst palm trees and serene landscaping.

Well, for us Rome is a little bit dirty and loud and not well-organized. BUT we liked this hotel very much - it is a Treasure Island in this town! We booked the transfer, so a taxi waited us at Fiumicino, which was useful regarding we arrived in the evening. As the restaurants were closed, we've been without dinner, but a \"young man\" at the hotel said he'll prepare something for us: so we got cheese, salami, etc-etc and red wine :) Next morning we were told by other guests that this young man was Francesco the hotel manager. Last day he personally took us to the airport! He informed us about all the restaurants we should try, and we were really satisfied with those: cul de sac (traditional restaurant, but there is usually a queue!!), saporo veri (fish restaurant not far from the hotel), monte carlo (pizza, pasta). FYI a first course is around 7-10 EURs at these restaurants (of course there are more expensive dishes), so it is possible to have a dinner for two in 30-40 EUR. Italian wines are surprisingly good. At home we tasted just expensive, but no so delicious wines, so it was a nice suprise. I think the hotel looks romantic, a mediterranean style building - not a boring block. Yes, as the other travellers said, it is a little far from the center, yes, there is no sidewalk, but it was nice to be outside of the town after so much noise in the city. We always find important to have a clean, nice bathroom in the hotel room, and at this value, you'll never find a same level bathroom in Roma - we checked around 20-30 hotels' pictures at Tripadvisor. One tip: we found useful the Roma Pass (for travelling and entering attractions), if you stay for 3 days as we did, it is worth to buy these I think. So thank you very much Francesco, we will tell all our friends that Hotel Selva Candida is a brilliant choice in Rome - and if we'll return to Rome, we'll stay at you for sure!", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic and highly recommended\u201d", "Author": "CM_London1", "ReviewID": "UR65172581", "Content": "I looked long and hard for a hotel that provided parking as Rome was the start of a 10 day road trip around Italy, that was not only affordable but also had easy access into the city .

The other reviews do not lie, this hotel offers some of the best service I have experienced before. Nothing was a problem for them! Our flight over was delayed and we didn't arrive until about 11pm. By the time we got settled and got the kids to bed it was almost midnight, and we hadn't had dinner! I asked the desk and was told nothing was open at that time, and the hotel doesn't have a restaurant. At most hotels I would have gone back to the room disappointed - instead, the desk clerk took me into the breakfast kitchen, sliced up fresh cheese and prosciutto for me, and made us a plate with toasts and fruit to take back to the room! (and without charge!) Although we were aware that it was a bit outside the city center, we decided to take the risk due to having small kids with us (ages 3.5 and 1 year). Experience has told us that being right in the center can be noisy and, for what we wanted (an apartment, or a separate sleeping room for the kids) also very expensive. Plus we were coming from the countryside and had a car, so wanted to be able to park. Selva Candida offered us free parking, decent grounds surrounding the property for the kids to play, and a good price. Plus, the convenience to the highway/ring road counterbalanced the bus and metro trip to get to the city center. (We drove to city center one day and it was a relatively easy 20 min drive - otherwise the bus stops right across the street) We stayed in room 401, their largest apartment, which has a separate bedroom and then a sleeper sofa in the main room where my husband and I slept. The baby crib/bed they provided was lovely with nice linens, unlike the pack n play type beds we have had at other hotels. It was relatively quiet and the beds were very nice. There is free wireless internet at the hotel. Unfortunately it did not reach to our apartment but was easy enough to sit in the lounge chairs or at tables in the lobby. My dad stayed in the main building and had internet in his room. At one point his computer was acting up and he brought it to the desk to see if it was because of the internet. It wasn't, but that didn't stop the desk clerk from taking 10 minutes to sit and fiddle with my dad's laptop until he fixed the issue for him. One disappointment we had initially is that there is no kitchenette in the room and no restaurant at the hotel (there is a bar though), so it was a challenge to heat bottles for the baby and take care of his dinner (he cannot wait to eat or even stay awake until 8pm or so when restaurants open in Italy). When I asked the owner of the hotel if they had a microwave or something that we could use, he brought in his own - from home!!! - for us to keep in our room the whole stay. It made such a difference, especially at 6am, and took away all the stress of having to worry about feeding the kids when everything is closed. In short, anything that could have been an issue at this hotel was solved instantly by their attentive staff, who was always willing to think outside the box to come up with a solution. We will definitely stay there again on future trips to Rome!", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sherbrooke, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommend\u201d", "Author": "GBarbeau", "ReviewID": "UR63203426", "Content": "Beautiful Italian country style villa hotel with gardens.

It was our first time in Europe so we did not know exactly how public transportation was like in every city, yet I trusted the reviews and chose this hotel. I love the whole experience overall. Here are some thoughts/tips after our stay: # Location: Hotel Selva Candida is not located right in the center of Rome. Besides that fact, it's a wonderful place to stay. Keep reading for tips on how to get to the hotel. # Transportation: When we arrived at the Roma Termini, we took the train (Linea A, Battistini side) to Cornelia. From Cornelia the bus 904 took us to very close to the hotel. We got to Rome in a very rainy evening, which means it was both wet and dark outside - so the commute took us more than an hour. The next day was much better - it took us half an hour to get from the hotel to Cornelia. If you get to Rome on a day with bad weather, I'd suggest you contact the hotel to see whether they could pick you up (at a cost of course) or ask them how much it should cost you to take a cab to the hotel. Note that there are many buses that go to Cornelia. You should ask the hotel for a list of these buses - there should be no difficulty to get back from the center of Rome to Cornelia. For instance, the next night we took Bus 916 from Piazza Venezia to Cornelia then Bus 904 back to the hotel. Also note that Via Selva Candida is a rather narrow street with no sidewalks on both sides. Once you get off the bus, try to walk as close to the side as possible. It's about a 2 or 3-minute walk from the bus stop to the hotel gate. One last tip on transportation: ask the hotel for suggestions on when/how you should go about taking public transportation vs. a cab vs. the hotel car to the airport or the train station. Francesco actually drove us to the Fiumicino airport (FCO) at a reasonable price. There is ample parking space at the hotel... if you're brave enough to drive around Rome. Traffic is quite crazy. #Amenities/Atmosphere: I know there are other things that are supposed to be more important, but the first thing I notice in a hotel room is the bathroom. The bathroom was well-organized, clean, and elegant. Same for the entire room. It might take you a little while to get used to the quietness if you're used to living in an apartment like mine which is always a little noisy no matter when. The hotel decor is very attractive with an overall warm yellow tone. You'll feel more at home here than in most other large-chain hotels. Breakfast is from 7:00 - 10:00 AM. We missed our first breakfast, yet Francesco, the hotel manager, made us some cappuccino and brought us some croissant and bakery items after the breakfast buffet was over. You don't see that often at other hotels. # Wifi: this is a biggie for me wherever I go. The hotel provides free wifi throughout - just ask for the username and password. For some reason the settings didn't work with my Firefox or Chrome or Safari, so I had to use Internet Explorer. If you use IE, do this before connecting to their wireless: Open up IE. Go to Tools | Internet Options | Connections | LAN Settings, then check \"Automatically detect settings\". If for some reason wifi doesn't work well in your room, just go to the lobby and it should run like a free horse. # Summary - what I liked best: the very helpful staff at the hotel (especially Francesco), the nice decor and organization of the room, the overall atmosphere in the hotel. Transportation could be a huge con to you, but like I said, once you get a hang of it it's not that bad. # Summary - what I liked least: the unusually bad weather in Rome for us which made the commute to the hotel more difficult than it should have been. Also, I wish the hotel were closer to the center of Rome. At the same time, there would've been no quietness if it were. And the price would've been much higher.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ulm, Germany", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel, but a little far from the city\u201d", "Author": "Andi_and_Thao", "ReviewID": "UR57497990", "Content": "As we're quite the adventurous couple, we always get to the hotels by ourselves, i.e. without taxis, escorts etc. But to reach this hotel was a nightmare, even for us.

Only thing is there was a mistake in the calculation so in theory we started off some 20km east of the airport. The busdrivers and ticket sellers are quite unhelpful and so we ended up with 4 hours from the airport to the hotel, but we made it and just with public transport.

It is only a couple miles to the subway and the hotel helped direct me to a good place to leave the car and it was free parking! Driving arounf Rome is crazy and parking is few and far between! But for a hotel that has a fair loactions - Plenty of Parking - a super nice staff / I would recommend for sure! If or when I return to visit Rome, I am sure I would retrun for another stay!

We will definitely recommend Hotel Selva Candida to anyone who mentions traveling to Rome. Thank you for an enjoyable stay.
