Kahana Falls is an older resort across from a beautiful beach and within walking distant to many stores and restaurants.. The pool area is beautiful. Coming to a smaller complex has its advantages....not too many people and an atmosphere of peace ..the fact that people are saying they are seeing ants and bugs.....well for goodness sake this is a tropical island ... There are insects! Let staff know the issues and they will addressed. I think we may have had one occasion where we dealt with some ants....really, no big deal! The past few years have seen refreshing and upgrades regarding the furniture and flooring. Tvs have improved and pretty much every year we come we notice something had been improved.

One thing you must do is enjoy the Iron Imu BBQ truck that comes on Tuesday evenings. Fantastic value and great food. Do not be tempted to eat at the Sands of Kahana restaurant across the road....food is terrible, service is terrible and the bill will be huge even particularly after they add the automatic service charge to your check. There is a small shopping centre about a block away which has a Whaler's store, good for snacks. The Maui Brewing Co. offers good food at a reasonable price and there is a MacDonalds.

We had another couple along with us who had never had a tropical holiday before, so we really wanted everything to be perfect on this one. Kahana Falls was easy to find, had plenty of parking space, and the grounds are beautiful. There are 2 hot tubs, both with sandy bottoms, which we used every night. They were easy to access, the temperature was very warm, and the sand is a great experience. One of the hot tubs has a waterfall flowing into it. The kitchen in the unit was very well stocked. One in our party is a gourmet cook and he was able to prepare all of the dishes that he planned for with the dishes and utensils supplied there. The fridge had an ice maker as well. The second bedroom had its own microwave, sink, coffee maker and dishes, as well as a small table and chairs, and there was free internet hookup there. This bedroom was a lock-off so it also had its own entrance door and full bathroom. The main bedroom had another full bathroom attached and a very large storage closet. It also had a keyed safe to store valuables in. The beds were very comfortable, although I found them to be small for 2 people. (Felt like a double to me, but were advertised as queens. We have a king size at home.) We even slept one night on the fold-out couch bed to see what it was like - the mattress was thin and lumpy - definitely not for two adults. However, afternoon snoozes on the couch (not pulled out into the bed) was very comfortable. There was a second free internet hookup in the living room and a set of washer/dryer. Our patio opened out onto a small stream that ran past and emptied into the swimming pool via a waterfall. Very nice ambiance! The sound of the stream was very relaxing and dulled any traffic noise. This outdoor water flow is turned off from late evening to early morning so no sleep interruption. Kahana Falls has a room that has books to exchange/borrow, beautiful chairs/couch to read in, a brand-new workout room, and a shared room that had a kitchenette with a fridge in it. We were able to store our perishable groceries in this fridge until our room was ready on our first day there. Towels for the beach are available at no charge from housekeeping in the basement of the main building. The pool is designed to look like a tropical lagoon but the water is bone-numbing cold - nice to look at though! :-) There are many convenience shops and a gas station and a mall just 3-4 blocks away. Housekeeping were very efficient and came daily to empty the garbage. The barbeques were extremely clean and a good place to meet other visitors. Our guests were so impressed with their holiday here, that they bought a one bedroom timeshare for themselves at Kahana Falls and can't wait to go back.

I called and tried to upgrade our room and we were put on a waiting list. I was a little frustrated, but we decided to just go with it and hope for the best. I am so glad that I didn't listen to the crotchety, high-maintenance opinions of other reviewers, and waste money on an upgrade! There was absolutley NOTHING wrong with our room! Yeah, it was \"small\" but it had everything that we needed! A bed, a dresser, a table, a sink, fridge, microwave, and a huge bathroom. I was on the lookout for bugs after all of the other reviewers were complaining, and i did not see a single bug the entire time we had our room. And i was on the lookout. But if you're any type of person that has common sense, you know that you will run into some type of bug or creature at least once on your trip to Hawaii, so get over it is all I can say to those complaints. The room itself was comfortable and cozy. No, it didn't have a balcony, which was a bit of a bummer, but I should thank them for giving us a room without one... it got us out of our room more, and that's exactly why we went to maui on vacation.. it gave us more of an excuse to get out and see and enjoy every bit of the island! The staff was also amazing and super friendly. I only have 3 complaints about this resort...first complaint is that the pool was really cold, but I can see how that would be enjoyable in the hot summer, so i didn't mind..(and it made me visit the sand bottom hot tub more, which was AMAZING!) second.. we shared a door and main entry way with the bigger room next to us, and they were a rather big and loud family that was up very early and back in very late, and we heard every single door click and conversation. But, we were on vacation, and so were they, so \"it's all good!\" .. My third and final complaint is the uppity people who would come to the front desk and loudly announce how HORRIBLY UNHAPPY THEY WERE WITH THEIR SMALL TINY DARK ROOM! HOW DARE YOU TREAT ME THIS WAY! (pretty sure they stole those lines from these past reviewers) ... all i can say to that is, thanks for runing my vacation with your disgusting attitude, and WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE! ... main point, you're on vacation, so enjoy every bit of it! stop comparing your hotel to the other high-end resorts on the island and you will have a fabulous time! you will have a complaint about one thing or another no matter where you stay, so get over it, and yourselves! kahana falls gives you an amazing stay for the price you pay, and i think the staff and \"private, quiet\" feel of the resort make up for any minor issues you may find!

There was no ocean view but we weren't bothered by that. There was public beach access across a small road so when we actually went to the beach at the hotel we just packed up a bag and snacks and walked over no big deal. The accomodations were fine. A little out dated and very island themed of course ;) wicker and bamboo furniture with island print pillows lol It was a good amount of space - full kitchen, bathroom with shower/tub, bedroom with queen bed and a large walk in closet. Kitchen was fully equipped so we made quite a few dinners and breakfasts ourselves. As two young adults we found the price AMAZING and were just happy to be there together, i have no idea what the prices are like not on a groupon so i can only say that the $400 price was all the way worth it ;) Also the laundry facilities were free (helpful if ur on a long trip) and they provide you with a box of powder if u forgot your own.

It is about a 40 minute drive from the airport as most roads only allow 35 mph. It is a few miles from a nice big market and close to many restaurants and small stores/coffee places.

The bathroom was large with a large closet the only problem I could see is it is quite a step to get into it if anyone had knee, back or balance problems. The lanai was quite large and overlooked the pools and BBQ area which are nice. Plenty of lounge chairs I never saw all of them full. It did not appear that too many people stayed and hung out during the day. There were small ants in the kitchen which I sprayed with Windex.....No vending machines.... I only had one interaction with the concierge which was initiated by me. I specifically wanted to go on the Wild Dolphin Encounter which she said does not exist. I told her I had seen it on many websites and in many magazines/brochures. She still insisted nobody takes anyone out to see dolphins that you may see them when you see whales if you are lucky...She did sign us up for a whale watching trip which was nice. We stayed with a female and two males for almost 2 hours, they spy hopped 12- 15 times, slapped their fins etc...that was the most awesome thing I have ever seen and it made my trip. We did find out the next day that indeed the Dolphin Encounter does exist, I could have bought a ticket from a number of people in Lahaina which makes me wonder if the resort gets commissions or some kind of incentive for selling certain tours. Not a way to do business if your guest specifically asks for something you should accomodate them or say I can't book that for you here is a number to call. **Warning** Most if not all of the people in Lahaina that have signs to book trips for you are timeshare salesman who do a very hard sale to get you a better deal on the trip if you do a 2 hour tour of their resort. They will not tell you this until you have already agreed which tour you want, picked a day and time and received a quote. It is a big waste of time if you are not interested in the presentation. Lahaina is about 10 minutes from Kahana and has a lot of touristy shops to buy t shirts etc...It also has many good restaraunts. We did not have a bad meal anywhere and found interesting that most places are open and birds fly in and jump around eating crumbs off the floor. The Banyan tree takes up an entire city block and is amazing as well as the harbor which boats take people out on tours from. We spend several days walking around. We took a road trip north which was a very very windy high road which was beautiful.

After a short while, you will feel that you are coming home every time you go back to your rooms. The rooms are comfortable, clean, have kitchens and functional furnitures, and the resort is in a very peaceful location. There is also a pool with a waterfall, and ample room to relax outside. Flat screen TVs have replaced the tubed models that were there the last few times I stayed at Kahana Falls. FYI, my wife considers this her home in Hawaii and tries to come hear annually. FYI, word is that the fitness center may be moved to a sunny location on the top floor of the main building. Go elsewhere if you want a large beachside resort with restaurants and constant activity. Kahana Falls is for people who are perhaps a bit more independent and do not depend upon a hotel to provide all their activities. Kahana Falls has an agreement with the beachside resort across the street, allowing guests to use the beach there. FYI, that second resort has a fun restaurant with daily happy hours. It's easy to look forward to lava flows and mai tais. There are several good restaurants nearby - and some are even within walking distance. A few minutes walk from the resort are RB's Steakhouse (with a pineapple brulee that is astounding), Roy's (topnotch seafood), and Dollie's pub.

The location is great, we were close to Lahaina and Kaanapali but far enough away that you didn't feel too crowded.

A short walk south on the beach will take you away from the hotels and the beach will feel like your own. This unit was perfect for our busy vacation where little time was spent at the hotel.

We thought it would be an issue getting a spot to sit at the pool, but due to overall emptiness of the resort & that the resort is not directly on the beach, pool was mostly empty all day. The deck area had plenty of sunny & shady spots through the day. The landscaping was lovely, and I enjoyed watching the koi in their ponds. There are also 2 hot tubs, the back one was usually not in use. The studio room we got was pretty spacious - full kitchen amenities, and having a washer/dryer in the room was great! Kitchen was outfitted pretty well for cooking, even some tupperware for the days we decided to pack lunches. We had free wired internet, wireless was down the entire time (they said it's maintained by a 3rd party, and not well). Our patio was on the corner overlooking the pool/waterfalls - definitely a lot of white noise while the doors were open, but I find that relaxing. Doors blocked the noise well for sleeping. The biggest complaint we had was that being a studio, the bed/couch was some weird mutant piece of furniture. It was I think a double bed, making for pretty \"cozy\" sleeping. Half of the bed was hidden under a cabinet type thing, and you had to pull it out each night for sleeping. Since the \"couch\" had bamboo arms, it made it really hard for one person to get in & out of bed - had to climb over the other person. There's some local coffee shops, a couple of restaurants, but not a huge amount within quick walking distance. Beach in the area was quite nice (we just walked through the Sands of Kahana to get to the beach... otherwise beach access is difficult). The hotel staff was nice - didn't seem shady at all.

There is a computer/printer in the front lobby to check your e-mail and print your boarding passes.

Also in the lower level, you can check out beach towels and they charge a nominal fee for use of a swim noodle, ice chest (handy for packing lunches on your outings) and a road to Hana CD which was helpful to know your stops to check out the views.

We booked prior to reading the reviews on this site, and since many of them portray the place as very small, or old and dirty, I was quite nervous that we had not made a good choice. We stayed in 303 and had both units A and B. Unit A was a nice bright clean south facing studio with a full galley kitchen, sitting room, eating area and full bathroom. The couch doubled as a pull out bed (which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep in.) The lanai was small and not particular scenic. Unit B is what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect to see in a hotel room. It had a queen size bed that was comfortable, a big bathroom with two sinks, a small jetted tub, bar fridge and microwave. There is absolutely no view and very little outside light at all in unit B. Since all we used this room was for sleeping in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no problem. The furniture in both units was the normal sort of stuff you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect to see in a three star hotel and was in decent shape. Since we had both A and B, there was plenty of room for just the two of us. I'd also say that there's plenty of room for a family of four. Kahana Falls itself is also nice. They have a daily pick up of trash and towel exchange, something rare with timeshares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but a great idea. There seemed to be a lot of staff and they were constantly cleaning. Maybe some of the older reviews were correct and there were problems with cleanliness, or bugs - something that certainly seems to be rectified now. Another nice feature was free internet. Again, many timeshares we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer this in every suite. Their pool is small, and having a couple of waterfalls flowing into it sure looks nice, but is loud. But then again, why sit by a pool when the Pacific Ocean is just across the street. (And yes, it was sandy when we were there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although weather can strip a beach of sand at times.) The review \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good little resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Mar 7, 2008) does a real good job of summarizing the various sizes of rooms, and the fact that the price of this place is not as expensive as many others.

Both RCI and resort's websites warned us that the room is very small, 276 sq ft. Since we don't intend to stay in the room for too long, we confirmed the request. We don't usually cook while on vacation. A hotel room with light kitchen is good enough for us. The first week we stay in room 105B. The room is smaller than average hotel room. The bathroom is quite large with 2 basins. There is a microwave, an under-counter fridge, a small bar sink, and utensils enough for 2 people. The dining table is very tiny about 3 feet in diameter with 2 small chairs. When we pull out a chair, it blocks the entrance door. The window is facing the hallway. So we had to close the shutter most of the time. The resort is in a very convenient location. There is a public beach (Kahana Beach) access path immediately across the street, next to Sands of Kahana. Pohaku Beach is about 2-3 minutes walk. The second week we were assigned to room 605B. The front desk told us to pack everything and leave in 105B. They will move the luggage to 605B when it was available. The setup of 605B is identical to 105B. This unit has a good view of the mountain. Once again, the window faces the hallway. All hotel room units have no sitting area. If we wanted to watch TV, we had to sit on bed. The furniture layout plan in Kahana Falls' website is not in proportion that gave us a false impression. Our neighbor occupied a studio unit. By combining the studio and the hotel room, they form a one bedroom unit. The studio is quite roomy because it contains a pull out bed. It also has a lanai and a good size of dining table with 4 chairs, a full kitchen and a dishwasher. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind to go back to Kahana Falls. If we have a choice, we would request a studio or a one bedroom unit.

The window was about 1.5 feet high, and 5 feet or so long, with shutters, but looked out onto the hallway by the parking lot. The bathroom was GREAT! Huge big jacuzzi tub, 2 sinks, and Lots of room!! All that being said, the grounds were beautiful, as stated by many others. Waterfalls cascading into the pools, and lots of lush gardens. Two Barbeques were available, and there were laundry facilities in a separate building. The concierge staff were very helpful - attended the welcome orientation meeting and booked a couple of activities. I called this \"room\" the Dungeon in Paradise.

We stayed here 4/13/06-4/20/06. We we in the 2 bedroom/2 bath on the bottom level (Aloha tower) that had a great pool view. We didn't spend much time in our room, but it was a great place to sleep, shower and relax. We loved the sand bottomed jacuzzi and the pool which was surrounded by waterfalls. Paradise!! We participated in the free Hula workout but missed the lei making, boohoo. Our hula teacher invited us to watch her free show at the Ka'Anapali beach resort, it was fun. You recieve a mid week cleaning, they do the dishes, change sheets, more towels, ect. We also had to vacate one day for a few hours, ug, for the bug lady. We did have p--- ants in the bathrooms. Still saw some after the bug spray, no biggie. We live in Florida and are used to those critters. Our only complaint was that during two of our daily towel exchanges the maids help themselves to my Pineapple Wine in the fridge (I noticed two long black hairs closed in the cork, and my mother and I both have light blond hair) and they tried on my lip gloss (They blotted on a tissue and left it on the counter, and I have never blotted my lipstick in my life) and they tried on my mothers lotion in her bathroom. We notified the front desk and they are going to investigate which maids cleaned our room on those days. So to detour them the rest of our vacation I locked up my toiletries and jewelery in the safe and went ahead and finished my wine. Kathleen the concerge was so helpful. They cut you a small discount and help out with dinner reservations and activities. Mom left her a Thank you card. Overall we really loved our resort and location.

The only reason why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this review is because before our trip to Maui I read reviews that scared me. I have read reviews stating that there are bugs in the rooms, I can tell you honestly that our 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, living room, dining room and kitchen were very very clean (NO BUGS, someone had to been very unlucky or dirty). We stayed on the second floor just above the waterfall, our balcony was overlooking the pool which was very nice and we could see a little bit of the ocean far away. Number one thing that is a must in maui is a car. Without a car you are stuck, there are not a lot of things to do in Kahana (Lahaina). If you had a car you could drive 15 minutes to a near by city (i don't remember the name sorry) there are lots of activities and shopping there. The resort is not very big but its CLEAN. The people who work there are nice. The workers who sit in the main lobby and are supposed to find the best deals on activities for you, in my suggestion don't find the best deals. If you look around i guarantee you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find better deals then what they are offering (We did, $150 cheaper for a helicopter ride by the same company). If you like to hike, I suggest you buy a guidebook. I bought a book called Maui Revealed, which talked about many hidden trails that lead to water blowholes, waterfalls, swinging bridges, to zip lining through the jungle that normally you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find. Ohh yeah grab a good pair of hiking shoes. We did everything from scuba diving to parasailing (Great Times!!!). We had a great time and would definitely go back! Check out the pictures i took of the resort. Enjoy your stay. I would be happy to answer any questions you might have via e-mail.

The rooms are acceptable in size, but to get a two bedroom, you get the one bedroom lock out studio along with the full one bedroom unit.

No view through small windows overlooking parking lot. Staff is very pleasant. On-site activity center was convienent, and offer discounts to most activites.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom condo and it was plenty spacious. There was a large living area with a hide-a-bed couch. There were one very nice sized bedroom (with bath) that would be the master. The smaller bedroom could be locked off and was what someone would have if they just had the \"hotel room.\" The pool is small but very pleasant. The sand bottom hot tubs (two of them) were very nice. I have found that you usually find the kind of people that you are looking for. I found the staff to be very helpful and very gracious. They seemed genuinely pleased that we were there and wanted to make our stay comfortable. To tell you the truth, I found it to have much more of a local feel than a resort feel.
