Kettle is provided but no iron is supplied. No slippers. Bed was ok, pillows were nice. Only one lift/elevator. No extra key was provided during our stay so had to leave the key at the reception every time we went out. Some guests came back very late and we could hear them talking on the corridor, loudly. But overall, rooms was clean and staffs were polite. The hotel is also within walking distance to Mustafa and Farrer Park MRT station (my colleague said MRT Lavender stop was further than the hotel compared to Farrer Park). Taxis are not familiar with this hotel even after I've mentioned that the hotel used to be known as Cityhub Hotel. You may need to mention Jalan Besar...near Kitchener Road... near Mustafa only then some of them got the idea of the location. The receptionists were efficient.

Paid S$140 which is overpriced for what you get, but Singapore is expensive and I found there is a huge difference in the 2 star hotel chains where you pay half the price and the 3+ star hotels so this hotel was okay. Pros: Clean room, comfortable bed, okay location near little India and Mustafa shopping mall. Cons: Poor service at reception which was looked like a combination of being understaffed (2 people during peak check out morning and had a wait a long time) and reception staff not wanting to be attentive. 10 minute walk to closest MRT (Lavender) and the breakfast was terrible (not worth paying extra for breakfast - go out and enjoy better food). It appears to be a busy hotel with lots of groups.

The room was not too small (though not spacious either), with cupboards and hanging space for clothes, a medium-sized flat screen TV and a comfy queen-sized bed. We were amazed by the facilities provided in the room, which included a mini fridge, hot plate with ventilation hood, microwave, saucepans, plates and cutlery, as well as the usual tea and coffee making equipment. There was even a washing machine in the bathroom, so we could arrive home without the usual pile of dirty clothes from our holiday. It felt like we had our own little apartment! The bathroom was small-ish but perfectly serviceable, with a powerful hot shower, toilet and washbasin, all nicely designed and very clean. The bedding and towels were also spotless, and we were given bottles of water every day. Our room was at the back of the hotel on the fourth floor and we had an interesting view of the nearby apartments and up the road to the sports stadium and swimming complex. The breakfast buffet was delicious: a mixture of foods with something for everyone. There was Indian food such as dosa with sambar and chutney, Malay such as fried rice or noodles, Western such as chicken nuggets, eggs, sausages, and always toast and jam. There was variation in the menu every day. We particularly enjoyed trying the foods that were new to us. Service at reception was polite and efficient, and despite arriving at around 1pm we were allowed to check in early. I had booked our room via Agoda and the check-in and check-out processes were fast and straightforward. Although the hotel website has been re-branded as Cultural Hotel (previously CityHub) the actual hotel still features the old name. We walked to the hotel from Lavender MRT, unintentionally went a long way round and actually walked past it the first time. If you are coming from Lavender, I recommend you walk along Horne Road and then turn left on to Jalan Besar. The hotel is a little way down the road on the left, about 10-15 minutes walk from Lavender MRT. There is also a bus stop right outside the hotel, which serves many buses. Little India is a short walk away. Just north and across the road from the hotel is a 24 hour supermarket, and in the streets around the hotel are many small shops. Walking north from the hotel and turning right are several food courts. We ate at one of these and very much enjoyed our meal.

We stayed here for 4 days and here's our honest rundown of the hotel's good, bad and ugly points: LOCATION. Cityhub Hotel is accessible via airport shuttle, bus and MRT. The bus stops directly in front of the hotel, and the two MRT stations (Lavender and Farrer Park) are each a good 10 to 15-minute walk. Many travel agencies and tour operators have tie-ups with this hotel, making tour pick-ups and transfers convenient. Jalan Besar Plaza, Mustafa Centre and City Square Mall (which connects directly to Farrer Park MRT) surround Cityhub. There are old houses, eateries and small shops all over. The neighborhood is a fine place to find an array of merchandise. For high-end wares, we recommend that you visit the Orchard or take Bus 857 that leads directly to Suntec Mall. SERVICE. Guests who expect to see Singapore\u2019s fabled reputation for cleanliness and great tourism are in for a major disappointment. We were appalled by the lack of hygiene and customer service in this hotel. The hotel lobby was almost non-existent as it was always cramped with luggage. It also reeked of body odor. Perhaps the deal breaker for us was the staff\u2019s \u201chospitality\u201d which bordered towards hostility. Hotel personnel should get a crash course on basic courtesy and respect if they expect to stay in business. There were no thank you\u2019s, no smiles and no attempts to even open doors for us from the staff. Instead of being welcomed, we were warned by the front desk of the penalties meted for lost items, misused facilities and sundry. There were a few occasions when we witnessed the staff arguing with the guests and ordering them around! The personnel from the restaurant even cleared away our plates and cups when we weren\u2019t even done yet with breakfast. ROOM. We were billeted in a standard room in the fourth floor. There was only one lift servicing all seven floors but it was impressively fast. The size of our room was nothing to rant about. It was small and the outside view was not the loveliest. What really bothered us was the lack of sanitation. The carpet was dirty, the shower stained and the tea cups unwashed. We could not muster to use the towels for they smelled too. The room and the facilities were shamefully shabby for the rates. In fairness, basic items were provided such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap and shampoo. Our standard room also had a bachelor\u2019s refrigerator, an electric kettle, a hair dryer and a safe (which we did not try using). In addition, the wired internet connection was complimentary (but make sure you ask for the internet cable, else the staff won\u2019t even hint that it\u2019s available). Water pressure was good. The air conditioner was quiet. The TV deserves a pass \u2013 not unless you\u2019re a fan of 1990s HBO movie re-runs. In our experience, the hotel provided little value for the nightly rate of 280 SG dollars! Even though the cost gets cut down to half when booking through online sites, the quality of our stay, the level of cleanliness and the kind of customer service (or disservice) we experienced were quite disappointing.

When we arrived from Thailand, after lunch time, we couldn't check in, so were told to go somewhere while they prepare a room. Fair enough. The room was spacious and so was the bathroom. We liked to have free internet, which at this day and age, surprisingly isn't offered more frequently at hotels worldwide. The hotel is very, very basic on what if offers. For breakfast, we walked next door to this restaurant that served mostly Indian style breakfast. Granted, this hotel is in Little India, but this is still Singapore. If you weren't so adventurous to try (and our small kids mostly weren't) you would end up with only bread and jam, since there was no fruit or anything else to suit other palates. What we didn't like was the cleaning service, the worst we encountered in the 4 months we were traveling through the area.The bathroom I think was never cleaned and sometimes they didn't even clean the room. On the first night, they didn't want to provide linens for our third child sleeping in a playpen, which they had provided themselves following our previous online communication. They somehow suggesting this room was only for 4 people and we brought one extra...Crazy! Next day the other person on that shift was very nice and quickly fixed the situation. After this, we received good service. They arranged a taxi van for us and made some suggestions on what to do in Singapore, although basic ones. After checking out, they locked all our luggage on the lobby for us, so that we could still go out and enjoy the day before our flight. They have chains and locks and it is a common thing they do for their customers. It was the only hotel that could accommodate 5 people in a room that I was able to find online, that is the sole reason that we picked it. We didn't have much choice.

Since we could not check in before the standard check-in time and needed a shirt ironed, they did it for us free of charge. We also ran a bit late for the checkout so I asked the reception whether it was ok to be 20 minutes late with our checkout - this was ok. However.... the room cost us 288 Singapore dollars (which was the most expensive room we had had so far there and the worst room as well) - so little value for money. The room stank! (however you got used to it). In the entrance area of the room, it smelled like urine (therefore the low rating of the cleanliness and rooms). The room looked clean, the sheets were clean, towels clean etc.... I think this hotel is targeted towards indian travellers as the breakfast was not western - it was indian style (but interesting) - curry and some white patties. - Hygiene wise I'm not sure I would eat there as the staff handled food directly with their hands after lifting other non food items.

This time I stayed at the new City Hub hotel for one night, and this was a great last minute choice. The best budget hotel I ever stayed in, beating the Ibis. Granted, I was given the biggest room in the hotel. It is for 4 people (although we were 2), and the bathroom is disabled-ready, which makes it very big. So, all in all, maybe I was just lucky - try and ask for room 901 if you stay there. The room is spotless, with a big LCD TV, and plenty of coffee, tea, and water. The bathroom, as I said, is large, and equipped for 4, so you get 4 towels, 4 sets of toiletry, etc. The hotel offers a buffet breakfast, but, to be honest, unless you enjoy indian food early in the morning, you will be stuck with bread and coffee. In terms of location: it is at the edge of Little India. If you don't know Singapore, this is perhaps not the best place to stay, simply because it is not central enough. But there are buses going every where in Jalan Besar, and the Lavender station is close by. In fact, since Lavender station is in east-west (green) line (the same as the airport), this is a good option for a short stopover. To get to the hotel from the station, do the following: 1. Take exit \"B\" on Lavender. Facing the street, walk to your left and make another left at Horne Road. 2. Keep walking on Horne Road for about 5 minutes, passing the Jalan Besar stadium. 3. Turn left on Jalan Besar, and the hotel is about 50 meters on your left. All in all, a 10 minutes walk at a slow pace. I personally think that Little India is a great place to star your Singapore exploration. The contrast with Orchard Road is amazing. You feel like you cross the world if you take the 65 bus from the hotel to Orchard station. Besides the shopping and food options in Little India, you find the cheapest Internet cafes, often charging SGD1/hour. I would definitely recomend the CityHub as the best budget option in Singapore. Even if you stay at a fancier hotel (as I do), the CityHub is still a good option for either a late arrival, or a early departure, when it would not make sense to pay the full price of a 4 or 5 stars hotel.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore", "Title": "\u201cHotel CityHub in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Vidyagmcs", "ReviewID": "UR58865829", "Content": "Hi, I have nothing great to say about this Hotel as we had gone with one of our friends advice.

On Syed Alwi rd , you also have Mustafa - the place for shopping. 3. Little India is again 7 mins walk. You have temples and more restaurants. 4. City hub is centrally located and hence commuting by taxi is very easy. Also you have a bus stop right in front of the hotel. 5. I read in some reviews that the hotel is noicy , but at least I dint hear any noice. Probably because I was on 4th floor. But yes , the reception is always crowded and filled with Indian tourists (the tour operators prefer this hotel) 6. Internet is free and pretty fast. 7. Mineral water provided throughout. 2 bottles a day. No issues with service. Cons: 1. No cupboard/storage to store your clothes.
