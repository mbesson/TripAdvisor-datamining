Hotel rooms and baths were clean and comfortable. Rooms were shielded from street noise by double doors to the balcony. The location is close to St. Peters, but also close to an excellent restaurant and a cafe. There is also a daily local street market which the Romans use about a block away. The staff was outstanding. A friend traveling with me became injured and was confined to the room for several days, ultimately going to the hospital there. They provided assistance in every way, cheerfully going far beyond expectations.

Hotel is very close to the Vatican City 5 minutes walking), Chaffour Express Super Market (Exiting to the left, just a couple feet walking), and is in front of the bus stop. They do not have an elevator, but a lady of the hotel brought our luggage to our room. The same happened when we left the hotel. We voluntary gave a tip. I did not like they changed the sheets when asked the first time. I guess they do it every four days and seemed did not change the blanket for the whole stay of 18 days. The bathroom floor seemed to be cleaned every third day. They did not leave enough shampoos and had to ask most of the time for shampoos for all of us (4). Rooms do not have fridges and they were nice and gave us ice when asked. Breakfast buffet is good, but exactly the same food every single day turned it to hate it. Staff very helpful and nice, two spoke English and one Spanish fluently. Bad experience when the receptionist S called an unauthorized taxi cab to take us to the airport. He didn\u2019t have a taxi meter and a permit, He overcharged us for taking us to the airport. When confronted over the phone, she was loud and not polite. I think hotels in Europe are much over paid compared to the U.S.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, Italy", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe they have air conditioning\u201d", "Author": "mforbes21", "ReviewID": "UR115242924", "Content": "I hate to admit, but I'm and AC snob. My husband booked this hotel for us and my requirement was AC and clean. This hotel claims to have AC. When we checked in the hotel was hot and stuffy. The person behind the counter was sweaty and fanning himself. He told us most of Europe, trys to conserve and turn on the AC in the afternoon for sleeping at night. If that's the case I don't understand why they have controls in each room because they don't work, not even at night. We were miserable trying to sleep. Our room was on a busy street and we tried to open the windows but there was a lot of noise. The shower was very small and the towels were more like curtains than actual towels. Bring your own if you can. The pluses of this hotel were that the staff were very friendly, it's clean, close to the bus line, Vatican City and many restuarants. Even though we parked on the street there's a parking garage close by. I would recommend visiting in the cooler months. If the price is below 100 Euro it's for a reason.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterford, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice clean hotel, friendly staff, good location\u201d", "Author": "Spartan68", "ReviewID": "UR36509322", "Content": "Nice 5 minute walk away from the Vatican. Hotel is initially hard to spot as its not at street level, its behind a large gate that you must be buzzed into. Look for a sign on the opposite side of the road that points right at it. Hotel itself is spotless, recently refurbished. Air conditioning works brilliantly. So nice to come back to a chilly room after a day in 30 degree heat. Beds are very comfortable. No ensuite rooms. Showers have powerful piping hot water. Breakfast area is basically the reception area of the hotel! No buffet. Only about 6 tables. If all guests arrive at the same time in the morning there is quite a crush. Breakfast consists of pastries, OJ, Tea/Coffee. Friendly man at the desk has just enough english to compensate for people with absolutely no Italian.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "jakarta", "Title": "\u201cRoomy\u201d", "Author": "jkt_traveller", "ReviewID": "UR28834708", "Content": "Me and my husband travel to Rome from Milan with our friend and her partner to celebrate New Year. Given the busy holiday season in Europe and considering we will be in Rome for New Year eve, finding this hotel is such a relief..we booked a quattro room which we found to be very small (maybe its the standard in europe) for 185 euro per nite, but then again Rome has the most expensive rate when it came to accomodation. Its a short walking distance to Vatican city, but there were really no clue or whatsoever on how to get to the Vatican from the hotel, as our free map didn't cover this area :') The hotel occupied only the 3rd floor of a building, maybe its common in Europe (?) the elevator so small it couldnt fit the four of us with a luggage, but later I found out that this is what they have in most apartment/flat in Italy. Overall, I would say this hotel would be good for people on pilgrimage to Vatican city but not for city explorer.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cwonderful staff, great rooms for an amazing price\u201d", "Author": "lilpwincess1", "ReviewID": "UR26132445", "Content": "Stayed at this Hotel for a school trip, for over 1 week.

We were two parties, one of two people, one of two adults and a child. The hotel has no on site parking-which is normal for Rome. I expected to be sent to a garage, but since we arrived on a Sunday, all of the local garages were closed for most of the day. I eventually found a place on the street nearby and spent two days worrying about it. But it turned out to be fine. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel and several places to buy tickets are nearby. But none are open on Sunday either. The triple room was large enough for the three of us with luggage, but the double was pretty tight. The rooms were clean and the plumbing was better than at other hotels I have stayed at in Rome. Breakfast was subpar for this price, but was not bad. The nearby restaurant was expensive and not very good. But others sitting there seemed to enjoy it so maybe that was just us. We ate there once and went elsewhere after that and enjoyed that far more. The air conditioning worked great and the rooms were quite. It is a 15 minute walk to the Vatican from here and you can catch a cab from the main street, but no cab in town had ever heard of this hotel so coming back from downtown was a problem every time we tried it. Get an address and mark it on the map before you leave the hotel, or have them drop you off at the Vatican and walk. The hotel would only accept payment in cash. There is an ATM around the corner, but we had limits on how much we could take out a day and this was a problem. Good thing we brought extra cash for emergencies. Rome is expensive. I know that and don't have high expectations of any hotel inside the city. For 160 Euros for a triple, we got straight up average rooms and average meals. I have no complaints and would not talk anyone out of going here, but neither would I be quick to send anyone here.", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel San Pietro", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d615787-Reviews-Hotel_San_Pietro-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$119 - $244*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Cardinal Cassetta, 9</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00165</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "615787", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/91/31/9131ff6cdf824b16bf489f47945f33b81large.jpg"}}
