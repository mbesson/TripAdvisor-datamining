I wish I had known that they have an indoor hot tub. It is not advertised and I didn't find out about it until it was too late to take a soak. The maid didn't pay the best attention to the room. The bathroom floor was sticky, and our clock was unplugged. We had to crawl under the bed to plug it in. I would think the maid should have noticed this. We also could not get our toilet to flush properly. After several tries it would clear enough to use again, but never completely flushed.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR325847241", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "HUSKERTRAVELER"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d239867-r10035961-Best_Western_Northwest_Inn-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "239867", "Price": "$94"}}
