But, the rooms are huge, and the bathroom was really nicely done-- reminded me of a bathhouse. All the rooms we saw were nonsmoking, but I think someone was smoking and it came through the vents as we could smell a bit of cigarette in our room. The staff was friendly and accommodating, and so was the night bartender. The breakfast was delicious with a great selection. The location is strange, but not inconvenient. It's not on the island part of Venice, but on the mainland with the airport. It feels like it is in the middle of nowhere but it's right by the bridge to Venice proper. It's a 5 minute walk (no sidewalks-- only one crosswalk that involves stairs) to the bus station and about 20 minutes by bus to the main station on the island. Invest in an all-in-one bus/water taxi pass, unless you feel like freeloading on the honor system. The area is quite desolate and quiet and night, which could be creepy if you are walking back by yourself. But, we thought this area was probably much easier to find/return to than to try to navigate the back roads of the island. Our only real dislike was that WiFi is only available in the lobby, and you must purchase 3 hours worth. We ended up scrounging for open wifi on the island because we were never around the hotel long enough to use 3 hours. Overall, this hotel is a great value for the money.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cI enjoyed my stay.\u201d", "Author": "lth1031NewYork", "ReviewID": "UR126393595", "Content": "I was in Venice in Mid-March of 2012. I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. I had a lovely spacious room on the 5th floor (room 505). First of all, it's not situated in the central area of Venice, where the grand canal passes through. In fact, when I took my train ride from Florence to Venice, this was the 2nd to last stop on the train. I got off at Venice-Meastre (I may have spelled this wrong) station. The hotel is located in the outskirts of central Venice. When I got out of the train station, I took the #9 bus to get to the hotel. Note, it may be a good idea to go to one of those Tachbacci shops to buy a bus ticket or bus card. The cards give you unlimited rides on the buses and the water buses in venice. I got the 72 hour card, and for an extra 3 euros more, it also covers transcport on the buses that go to the airport. Make sure to ask the clerk for details before buying the card; it appears different cards have different prices. The bus stop for the hotel is S. Orlanda (and then it's about another 10 min. walk to the hotel). The bus ride is about 15-20 minutes. Be careful because it is a highway you're walking through to get to the hotel. If you have large luggages, be extra cautious. After checking in, you can take bus #5 to Venice. Bus #5 also takes you to the airport. All rides are about 10-20 minutes, so nothing is too far. I liked the hotel. The beds were comfortable, and the room was clean. I had a flat screen TV with many TV channels. The bathroom was nice, with good water pressure. I had free breakfast in the morning. The hot food served were eggs, bacon, stuffed tomatoes, and sausages. There was also different cereals, yogurt, bread and sweet pastries, as well as fresh fruit. A pretty good selection of things. There was also coffee, tea and juice. Staff was friendly enough, but there was one guy who was really snotty. When I asked him questions, he answered in a very jerky way (made me want to smack him), but everyone else was ok. Also, when I left, there was additional tax that I had to pay that's separate from the fee for the room, and this was to be paid in cash. Location for hotel is inconvenient if you're looking to stay in city central. If you don't mind the 30 minute commute back to the hotel, I would recommend this place b/c it's inexpensive and nice.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cHorrible location\u201d", "Author": "sugarsmack11", "ReviewID": "UR121495908", "Content": "What a weird place!

The downside to my family's two night stay was when we had dinner at the hotel's La Fontanella restaurant. The food was okay. But the evening restaurant manager that time, a Mr. Raoul, and one of his waiters (tall, balding and bearded) were kind of arrogant. We felt that they were condescending and were not too happy serving us. Is it because we're foreigners / Asians?

I presume is free. I did not used a car during my stay, but I put parking as a plus - breakfast. I'm putting this as positive. not an exceptional one, but I saw much worst Negative: - no Internet in the room; if you want is extra cost (5 eur/2 hours) and the only access point is the hotel lobby; for me to stay in the lobby was not convenient, so it is a minus - I think this hotel is from 1970. except the LCD TV everything else starting with furniture,bathroom and ending with elevator I think are from 1970. I like history and museums, but only to visit not to live in :( - no pedestrian area to access the bus station. You have to walk 200 m on the right side of the highway to access the bus station; kind of risky in my opinion - it is classified as 4 stars, but I think 3 starts is the correct classification Now generalities about this hotel. Location: San Giuliano. This is a small village in mainland near the Venice. Taking in consideration the price of the hotels from the heart of Venice the option to be located on the mainland should be taking into consideration. Easy access with bus no.5 and no.19. It takes 15 min from Piaza Roma to the hotel's bus station which I may say is very reasonable as time Timetables for 5 and 19: http://www.actv.it/pdf/urbano/U-5.pdf http://www.actv.it/pdf/urbano/U-19.pdf No 5 is also the connection of the hotel to the airport The public transport Venice company is called ACTV. They are operating both land and water. Prices are here: http://www.actv.it/en/movinginvenice/movinginvenice I have bought on arrival in airport one 72h pass using the ACTV machine located there which accepted my credit card. From airport to hotel = 30 min About the buses.... They are not stopping to the bus station unless you wave your hand to them when approaching. Also if you are inside the bus they are not stopping to the next station unless you press the button which rings a bell to driver to aware him to stop So, to answer to the question:\"Would you recommend this hotel to a friend? \" I may say yes because I am a reasonable tourist.
