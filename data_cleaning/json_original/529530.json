We noticed a sign above the lift stating that the hotel was on the 4th floor. Using the dirty lift we travelled to the 4th floor arriving in a corrider. A sign on the wall advised that we should use the phone to advise of our arrival. In doing so we were told that our key was in the drawer of the table below the phone. We found our room and very quickly realised that this was not somewhere we could stay. I have sent better furniture to the charity shop - it was tatty and of very poor quality. In the corridor outside the bedroom the wall was covered with a bedsheet where the plaster was falling off the wall. It took us a few minutes to decide we were not going to stay, we found another hotel and left immidiately.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cGreat location of a typical Berliner Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ldansen", "ReviewID": "UR57778870", "Content": "Well first of all, great location about 2 minutes walk from Ku' Damm and U-bahn and bus-stations. This makes it very easy to travel around and see everything on short time. We were there for 5 days and saw allmost everything there is to see in Berlin. God points: We had a big room with our own bathroom and television, there were a doublebed, and 2 extra beds. We had a big balcony with a okay view, but we did not use it because the weather did not allow it. The Breakfast was fine, with the basic stuff and a bit extra but it was not overwhelming. Bad Points: Like in some of the other reviews we could not pay with our creditcards, so we had to pay cash. And that is to bad, exspecially when the have the Mastercard/Visa signs, and my bookingpaper said that i surely could pay with cards when i arrived, but that was not possible. And i would not recommend this hotel for a long stay in Berlin, it is to boring and not that fascinating. But I would recommend this hotel to a short stay (1-6 days) because of the great locations and it had what we needed. The room was \"cleaned\" everyday, and we sleept well in our doublebed. It was a typical Berliner hotel in a old building on the 4th floor. And it was OK :-D", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kelowna, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOdd Hotel\u201d", "Author": "sicamous", "ReviewID": "UR32211576", "Content": "My husband & I spent one night at this hotel as part of a group tour. It is a very odd hotel in that it occupies the fourth floor of an old apartment building. Yes, the lobby and rooms are on the 4th floor, accessed by a lift. While our room was clean and had an ensuite shower and sink, it lacked a toilet. (It was located across the small lobby area.) There may have been rooms with complete ensuites but it'd be a good idea to confirm at time of booking. We were glad that we had booked our extra nights in Berlin at a different hotel. It was worth the trouble to pack up and move. On the plus side, it is very well located - just blocks away from the Ku-damm and all modes of transport. The staff were friendly and the breakfast (5 Euros) was basic, but quite adequate. I believe you can get rates with breakfast included. Again, confirm at time of booking.", "Date": "June 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England, South Coast", "Title": "\u201cStrange but functional\u201d", "Author": "Hatestogo", "ReviewID": "UR7170808", "Content": "Clean and functional, but a bit wierd! Fine if you just need somewhere to sleep and shower. Location is excellent for Kurfurstendamm(?) main shopping street. The hotel has no ground floor lobby, entry is via the lift of a building which I think also has private appartments, then there was a locked door between the landing and reception. However, the receptionist/owner?/manager? was pleasant and helpful, and fortunately had some English, as I have no German. The room was, well, odd. My booking was for a single with wc and shower. The room was very large, with a really high ceiling, and very low furniture, which gave a rather odd feel to start with. The furniture was all really cheap, eg. the top drawer on the chest of drawers wouldn't close because the top of the chest was bending under the weight of the telly, second drawer fell appart as I opened it. There were three single beds in the room, two of them made up into a large flat, well, thing, and the third being made up as my bed, which was smallish, but, as it turned out, perfectly comfortable. The room was fairly quiet, and had a door which could be locked with a key from the inside, which always makes me feel more secure. The bathroom worked, and there was plenty of hot water and reasonable pressure for the shower. There was no desk or useable table in the room. Breakfast was a help yourself buffet and was plentiful and stress free. Otherwise there is a fridge at reception with some cold drinks, anything else you have to find outside the hotel. On balance, I would say overpriced for the quality of the room, but if Berlin is full (as it was the week I stayed), provides a fairly secure-feeling and adequate base for sleeping and leaving your clothes. Wouldn't want to spend any time having to hang out in the room though. I think there may be a more up-market set of rooms which would give a different experinece, as mine was called something like 'comfort economy', but was all that was on offerwhen I booked.", "Date": "March 16, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel-Pension Rheingold", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d529530-Reviews-Hotel_Pension_Rheingold-Berlin.html", "Price": "$55 - $126*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Xantenerstrasse 9</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10707</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "529530", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f1/48/f148c0775a7e1de7aec6317a99e758235large.jpg"}}
