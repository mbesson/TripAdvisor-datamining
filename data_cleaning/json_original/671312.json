The room was very adequate, spotlessly clean and I had plentiful clean towels! I never did manage to get the wi-fi to work however... Breakfast was basic but, for the 3 short days I was there, again, adequate. Tea, Coffee (additional cups = extra charge!), sliced bread, melba toast, croissant with jams and Nutella. The only major drawback was the dirty, scruffy slightly weird guy who we presumed to be the nightshift staff but might well have been the owner. Wore the same clothes three nights running. He 'greeted' us on arrival after midnight....His backside was hanging out of his \"trousers\". Greasy, unkempt hair. Dark glasses (dodgy!). Very poor English and almost impossible to make out because he mumbled. And overall fairly unhelpful chap! Which is a damn shame as the three ladies on duty during the day were LOVELY and very helpful. Location was good for Termini station but until 'Lurch' goes, I wouldn't rush back!", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot so bad\u201d", "Author": "Kinx282", "ReviewID": "UR115586086", "Content": "I think it's a good hotel, clean and confortable.

They advertise it as \"a few yards\" from Termini Station. Actually, it's about 4 blocks north and west. Don't trust Rome taxi drivers; they will lie to you and tell you it's far, far away, when it's actually not, and will try to rip you off. No hotel sign out front to orient you; you have to go by the street number (35). There IS a sign for Hotel Katty, on a higher floor, but nothing for Hotel Massimo. Elevator was tiny, an old-fashioned wire cage, big enough for 2 people + luggage, and not much more. The hotel was surprisingly clean! The female staff (Adriana, Romella) were VERY helpful and friendly. The owner is a grouchy old man who doesn't speak English, and who mumbles a lot. He kind of reminds me of The Godfather. The room was small but adequate, but no table or bench on which to position suitcases. The bed was firm but comfortable. No bed bugs or any other insects noted, ever. It was amazingly clean, from corner to corner. The bathroom was adequate, although the shower is one of those glass-encased European showers that you can't be too heavy or you'll never fit inside. (Fatties will never fit!) There was plenty of hot water, but you have to wait a couple of minutes for it to come up to the 3rd floor. The water is quite safe for drinking. If you want a computer, just ask at the desk and they'll provide you with a laptop that you can use in your room 24/7. Continental breakfast was adequate, but their \"Cafe Americain\" bore no resemblance to anything you'd find in an American restaurant. They also have fruit juice, Espresso and Cappucino. Fresh bread and rolls, plenty of butter and jams, honey, Nutella, fresh oranges, made for an unimaginative, but adequate breakfast. The neighborhood is quiet, and there are some really great restaurants nearby where we ate like kings. There's a well-stocked pharmacy 1/2 block down the street to your right., and a small grocery store around the corner from the pharmacy. Metro station is less than 2 blocks away, and you can easily get around Rome on the subways. Adriana gives you a free map and will help you find anything; trust her. She knows Rome and was very helpful. Both Adriana and Romella speak adequate English, also Italian and Romanian. If you need a taxi, tell Adriana and she can have one at the front door of the hotel in 2 minutes. Overall, a very pleasant and restful stay. I spent 7 days, and could have lived there semi-permanently. A great experience for the money. I'll definitely return there.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cAvoid this place\u201d", "Author": "w84smith", "ReviewID": "UR72013653", "Content": "This place was booked for me by a travel agent at the Roma Termini. Being frustrated by the lack of wireless Internet service in public places (open WiFi is prohibited in Italy), I specifically requested a hotel with Internet service. This hotel does not have working Internet service (despite its claims and detailed access instructions in the room). The hotel itself had no markings on the outside. It is formally known as Hotel Alex. The hotel is in a building shared with other hotels and businesses. It is in a nasty area of Rome full of grafitti and garbage. The night I arrived, a military vehicle and two heavily armed police or military were stationed at a street corner by the hotel. The building with the hotel felt abandoned. After finally locating the entrance (third floor or so), I found one person in the reception area who I initially mistook for a homeless person who had sought shelter. Unfortunately, this scary person was the receptionist. He did not speak English. He was unable to help with the internet connectivity problem. When other guests appeared in the reception area, they expressed concern that the receptionist was insane.

I have been to Roma for lengthly stays over a dozen times. The hotel is a complete disapointment, to say the least. From the rooms to the service it lacked all one looks for in a hotel. No air conditioning, and rude uncaring staff to solve any of the many issues I encountered are just starters especially Adrianna at th desk. She were particulary rude and treated us like beasts, she were more worried to talk with her boyfriend on the cell instead of taking care of customers. If you want to be misserable, treated rudely and nickled and dimed then this is the hotel.. Otherwise I would suggest you explore another one of the more reasonable venues that are widely available here in Rome. Mind, I am not a complainer as an easy going world traveler, but I really felt I should take the time to inform my fellow travelers. Simply don't go there and ruin your trip to beautiful Rome having to deal with this shabby hotel and it's greedy staff. Hope this helps.
