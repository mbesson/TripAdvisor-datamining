We had two couples that stayed for a weekend trip and we all loved this place. It's like a B & B with 30+ rooms. Although it's kind of between a neighborhood and vineyards, when you enter the property, it has all the character and charm you'd want in Wine Country. There is a historic home from the 1800's with large, comfortable rooms. They've also added shingled outbuildings that have larger suites with patios/balconies. Our room in the historic house was clean and comfortable with access to the front porch balcony. The bathroom was large with great water pressure and Molten Brown amenities. Our friends were in an outbuilding that was very private with their own patio with a pergola and great furniture. There is a hot tub and pool (we didn't use them) and it's all beautifully landscaped with comfortable furniture. There is no restaurant on site, but they have a very good continental breakfast in the morning and a wine and cheese offering in the evening. You can enjoy these on the relaxing and lovely deck. Right next to La Residence is Bistro Don Giovanni, SOOOOO good. We made reservations for 7pm, went to the wine and cheese event at the hotel and then hopped over to the restaurant for dinner - a perfect way to end the day! Some people have commented on the highway noise. It is right off the highway and yes, you can hear some noise. I am usually very sensitive to noise (we always sleep with a fan running!) but wasn't bothered by it at all. Our room was closest to the road, too. We were gone throughout the day and at night, the traffic dies down so we really did not have a problem. The property is so relaxing and comfortable, we just didn't notice it. Also, this is not a chain hotel. It's got some personality. Each room is a little different and unique, so if you are looking for the generic luxury hotel experience, this is probably not for your. If, however, you want a relaxing, beautiful, convenient, comfortable, clean and unique wine country experience, you'll LOVE La Residence.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat personalized service\u201d", "Author": "Kim B", "ReviewID": "UR129206822", "Content": "Our family stayed at La Residence for my mom's 70th birthday.

The manager, Graham, was very friendly and talked with us on the deck our first evening there. He provided great information and history on Napa and some of the establishments. But the crowning definition of great service came when we discovered upon our arrival home that my mother did not have one of her gifts. I called back that night and the lady who answered was most helpful. It had not been located in the room by housekeeping so one of the staff members went to search in the dumpster and lo and behold, it was found among the discarded gift wrapping. Now that is what i call going above and beyond great service and it was all done with a genuinely helpful and friendly attitude.

They serve Hall wine and have a really good selection of cheese - Although it was raining and we didn't use it, the hot tub looked amazing Here are some things that I think could use improvement: - I didn't think the staff were very friendly, particularly the woman at breakfast - The lighting on the property at night needs improvement. We nearly fell going both up and down the stairs in complete darkness, and the road was barely visible driving to/from the parking lot. - Breakfast was just ok.

The whole reason I chose La Residence was for the breakfast, and the only breakfast they had was something I could buy at 7-11 for $1.50. How can they charge the same price per night with no breakfast?? We expressed our disappointment, but they said the manager was out and offered us a free bottle of wine.

This place is truly unique with it's older buildings and beautiful landscaping and sits among some grape fields. Certainly not one of your cookie cutter chain hotels which is exactly why we chose it. The leaves were just beginning to change and the place was very pretty overall. While the grounds may be 4 star, unfortunately, the place overall is not. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, I just can't give it 4 stars based on the landscaping. The room itself was about a three. It was a large room but we had purchased a higher end room so that was to be expected. We had a semi private balcony that was pleasant in the afternoons. The bed and sheets were good quality, but the little things were a bit off. The nightstand, tables, and cabinets were pretty cheap overall and many of the drawers had good sized gaps where the bottoms did not completely fit the drawer -- making them mostly useless for their purpose. Furnishings were a bit sparse also given how large the room was. The bathroom bathtub was a unique mosaic tile tub unlike anything I'd experienced before, but it had cracks in the grout that needed work. Same thing on the crown molding ... cracks everywhere. I understand we're in California and with the earthquakes I don't expect it to be perfect, but there were just a lot of these little things. We did sample the DVD collection while there and it was a nice distraction to have. Don't expect a top tier selection though as most of the movies were pretty old, but they didn't charge anything to use them so you get what you pay for. The biggest negative overall was the physical location however. You are right along the highway that is the main drag north through town. Traffic noises wafted to your ear pretty much all day and night. They do have a couple of fountains that when running help create some white noise to minimize this, but it still wasn't quite enough. In addition, the fountains were turned off at night so when it should have been the most peaceful, the street noise was even worse.

I really cannot praise the staff of this inn enough. They kept the secret, helped me make last minute reservations for dinner after I proposed, had the champagne perfectly chilled for out return, and brought us a full plate of wine and cheese when we got back to the inn to bask in the big change in our relationship.

Lots of little gardens and sitting places to read a book or sip a glass of wine. - Location: Easy access on Rt. 29 with wineries and restaurants all within an easy drive. - There is a nice pool, but it wasn't heated and we found the water too cold when we would come back around 6pm and therefore didn't use it. If you took a day off from touring, this would be a nice respite. We did use the hot tob and this was great! We found the wine hour was a great time to use the hot tub. All the other guests were there and we got the tub to ourselves after a day of touring. - Nice evening wine reception with plenty of tasty treats. - Nice breakfasts with fruit salad, pastries and your choice of 2 main dishes. A nice way to start your day of touring. Although, each day we were there, both choices were a form of eggs. It would be nice to have another option. - All of the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Dislikes: - Our room was in the Mansion house. While it was quaint, comfortable and clean, I wouldn't say it was \"luxurious\" by any means. The decor, furnishings and linens were nothing special. At this price point, I expected a luxury spa and we got a country inn. I'm sure other rooms were nicer, but they came way over our budget. - Noise: Our room was on the first level and unfortunately both right within the main door and at the bottom of a staircase, making for some foot-traffic noise. There is also the noise from the highway out front. Furthermore, there were chairs on the front porch outside our windows and other guests would occassionally sit there and chat. No fault of the Inn, just oblivious tourists who can't think beyond themselves. We were only there 2 nights, but I would have requested a room change if staying longer. - The hot water took a while to heat up, but when it finally kicked in, it was scalding. We also didn't like that our room had the sink located in the bedroom area, outside of the bathroom. I would stay here again if I somehow got a special rate, but otherwise would save the money and spend it on a nice dinner or other aspects of the trip.

Very nice. Our adult son slept on the pull-out sofa and it was pretty darn uncomfortable. But everything else was wonderful. Big, poofy bed with nice linens. Very modern bath area.

We continue to love this B&B hotel. But we cannot give them 5 stars- here are some of our observations. 1) the rooms are too small for $259 / night before tax. A price of $210 would be already plenty. 2) The beds are designated as queen size, but to us they felt kind of tiny. 3) Pillows were stuffy, cheap and uncomfortable. 4) Mattresses were not firm enough; after 7 hours of sleep, I woke up with some back pain; guess I am used to an expensive orthopedic mattress at home, and your mattress wasn't like that. If my spouse moved during the night, I almost got ejected out of the bed. A spring mattress in 2008? Please replace, urgently! We went to a Hilton in SF immediately after La Residence, and we were amazed how much better their beds were, and the pillows were amazing compared to yours! The Hilton hotel in Chinatown was just a fraction of the price. 5) In 2007, your hotel offered a complementary set of firewood to guests. Additional set were available for a small charge. This year, there was no firewood... What do we do with an empty fireplace? Maybe due to the economy you're cutting costs, but for $259 per night before taxes, I'd say this was a great touch and we really missed it. On the positive side, we like the CD / radio player + flat screen TV with DVD player in the rooms, and your stylish bathrooms.

We were met at reception by Edric, who quickly carried out the required check-in formalities and arranged for us to be shown to our room. Our room was situated on the upper level of the main building, accessible via stairs to the side of the property. There are a number of seating areas scattered around the property, allowing you to take in the gardens and the small number of vines growing in the grounds of the hotel. Our room was pink. Now pink is not something we would normally find a pleasant environment, however it worked. The room was a good size, with an incredibly comfortable bed. The proportions of the bedroom and the bathroom were perfect. Not too big, and not too small.... Just right! During our two night stay, we had the breakfast included each morning, and I have to say it was excellent. Scrambled Egg with pesto shrimp was just what the doctor ordered, and the next morning was just as nice, although I am struggling to remember exactly what was served. We also took full advantage of the evening wine tasting. This hotel is owned by Hall Wines, and each evening a selection of their wines are available for tasting, accompanied with a selection of hor'dourves. This is a great time to meet some of your fellow travelers, and share experiences of wineries visited in the Napa Valley. Previous posts have mentioned the traffic noise.
