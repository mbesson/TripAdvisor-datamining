But living in it was disappointing. For starters, the wi-fi was realllly slow. Possibly because I was on an end unit, downstairs and too far from the central modem but it was late, I was tired, and didn't want to hassle with a move. The bed, supposedly a king, barely reached the level of my knee. It feels like sleeping on an airbed or futon - so watch out if you have bad knees. Despite 4 lamps in the room, it was too dark to read. These must all be 40 watt. I watched the old fashioned box tv for a couple of hours and went to sleep. Next morning, I went to make coffee in the little in-room sunbeam maker. No cups! I figured the hot coffee would melt those little plastic drinking cups so drank it out of the pot and of course that was awkward! But, had I known the shower had no setting beyone \"slightly warm\" I would have used that handy little coffeepot to boil hot water for a tub bath. Alas, didn't have time, and was already shivering naked in the shower when i thought of the idea. Other reviews of this motel are so positive, I am tempted to try it again and request a room closer to the modem (and the hot water tank). Location and cleanliness outweight the nusiances mentioned, so if you find yourself in need of a clean, simple room at a reasonable price, try HomeStay.

It allows easy access to all of the \"main Strip\" without having to drive down the entire length of the strip. There are several roads from Sheperd of the Hills that tie into the main strip that allow you to bypass most of the traffic. If you've ever been to Branson you know how bad the traffic on the strip is. The only way I would stay on the strip is if it was directly beside a road that leads to Sheperd of the Hills. The front desk staff were very helpful on answering any questions we had and check in and check out were quick.

It was our first visit to the Branson area, and were not familiar with the the area. After reading the reviews here on Trip Advisor, we decided to take a chance and booked our stay with a locally owned hotel operator, instead of one of the name brand large hotel chains. Eagle's Lodge was offering a stay two nights, the third night is free promotion. The staff, at check-in,was very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the area. Make no mistake this is an older hotel. It appeared that the room, including the bathroom, had been recently renovated. The room was freshly painted, and the carpets appeared to be relatively new, and most importantly clean. The rooms were large, with plenty of room to move around, and came equipped with a microwave, refrigerator, and a coffee maker. The only draw back to the room was that the furniture was very dated, and I found the mattress to be very soft. The wife liked the soft mattress. The air condition was VERY cold, a feature that is very hard to find these days! There also was a very limited selection available with the free continental breakfast. There were hot waffles, some pastries, and two types of cereal, and fruit available on the breakfast bar. There was also orange juice, milk, and coffee to choose from. There are two shows within EASY walking distance from the hotel, and the Silver Dollar City theme park is only about ten minutes away. Overall, the wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Eagle's Lodge, and we will stay here again the next time we return to Branson. The value, cleanliness, and the location of this establishment is hard to beat.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fulton, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cA Great Place To Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Kathisme", "ReviewID": "UR82996707", "Content": "We stayed at the Eagles Lodge from October 5-9 in 2010 and I think they now have a loyal return customer. Here's my thoughts on different aspects of the hotel. Manager: Paige is the new manager here and she sold me on the hotel. Her attitude is amazing and she really seems to enjoy the job and the people she meets. Front Desk: Wonderfully nice people at all times. I never once encountered a single person who didn't go out of their way to be helpful. The area there was decorated nice and clean. Room: When we walked in, it smelled clean and looked clean. Nothing was out of place. Tv was decent sized, fridge/microwave/coffee maker was part of the cost and worked well, plenty of storage room for clothes & suitcases. Wifi worked great for me and the parking was free. Bathroom: It was clean, towels were plenty, lots of hot water, good water pressure, soap & shampoos waiting for us and some of the towels were folded into neat little shapes. Beds: Our beds were COMFORTABLE queens! We stayed at the Ramada before we got to Branson and the beds there didn't even compare. They were hard and these were softer and had a little more bounce. I guess if you like a hard bed, these would have been miserable though . lol. Breakfast: Standard fare of waffles, milk, cereal, pastries, fruit, oatmeal and coffee. The breakfast room was nice and clean. Parking: Well... this is probably one downside to the place. It's built on a hill and the parking lot is at quite a slope. You can unload your luggage near the front door to make it a little easier with that, but at some point you may have to walk up the hill or climb some stairs. To most people this wouldn't be a problem, but if it is, just ask the hotel if they could place you in a room that suits your needs best. They are so accommodating and helped us immensly. They have special area for handicapped parking also and it's not on a hill. Pet Friendly: We didn't bring our dog, but wished we would have! Turns out they welcome pets and I think I heard her say at no additional charge. Pool: They have a nice sized pool with lots of deck chairs. We weren't able to use it though since it was October. Pricing: The rates are $64 a night, but they had a special deal at the time we booked... third night free. Location: Pierce Arrow was right next door, Shoji, Hamner Barber and Barbara Fairchild/Bob Nelson were across the street. We were able to walk to The Imax complex within 5 minutes (and we walk slow). Everything else was just a short drive away as they're located on Shepard of the Hills Expressway (red route). What we didn't like: The room didn't seem bright enough...with light. Would we stay again... most definitely!", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat Accommodations!\u201d", "Author": "fishing2", "ReviewID": "UR82526076", "Content": "We stayed in this motel for three nights.

On further investigation we found some silica beads in my daughters bed. We were out of there!
