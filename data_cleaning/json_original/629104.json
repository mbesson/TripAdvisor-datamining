Overall, we enjoyed our (brief) stay. The owner of the hotel was there and she seemed really helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is cute - it is definitely designed as a place to relax. The design of the rooms was great with a nice outdoor space. The view from the rooms was fantastic. The restaurant was great - nice variety.Others have commented that the hotel is up on the hill and not super close to the beach. We thought this was fine - the beach was still (easy) walking distance. Even more, the beaches in the area are not very good for walking on or laying on anyway. Hence, we were perfectly happy on the hill overlooking the ocean.", "Date": "Jul 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR977026984", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Plantriptoday"}, {"Content": "Paradise within Paradise We have stayed at this property three times now, as a family, with older relatives and also travelling with friends. Each time has been nothing short of excellent. Nothing is too much trouble, the hotel is quiet and peaceful and the food and drink freshly prepared and very tasty.I adore their French Toast breakfast!

We found this stylish boutique hotel to be very peaceful with beautiful sunrise and ocean views. We were the only guests for much of our stay, so our boys made full use of the lovely pool and luckily we weren't disturbing anyone.I loved the gardens, day beds and water features. Because we had two adjoining rooms we had a wonderful spacious outdoor loggia area to ourselves. The restaurant was nice and good value, so we ended up eating there more often than not.We took a lovely daytrip to Tirtagangga, the waterpalace, and enjoyed sunset drinks at Waeni's down the road from Anda Amed where our kids enjoyed making friends with the locals.", "Date": "Feb 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR210255411", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Mumdreamtraveller"}, {"Content": "A beautiul location and a nice little place to stay! For this area a very nice little hotel with reasonable prices. We had a nice private room and small garden overlooking the coast as all rooms did. Nice modern simple rooms and very clean. There is no tv reception here but all rooms have tvs and dvd players so you can at least watch movies (bring your own or rent at the hotel) The staff were local so not very professional but very hard working and friendly but don't expect 5* service and be prepared to wait for meals. A nice swimming pool and comfortable restaurant and bar. The food was generally good.

It looked like the best hotel in Amed. The rooms were beautiful, with views out to the ocean. The rooms are quite new.The restaurant served beautiful food, probably the best in Amed too.

The water was pretty murky when we dived cause it poured the day before.We got a fisherman to take us from Amed to Gili Trawangan in a fishing boat for $90 USD.

We stayed 3 nights at Anda Amed on our honeymoon - and it was fantastic! We paid around 50 $ a night. The best place ever. The room (house) was clean and romantic with a magnificient view. At six o' clock in the morning you could enjoy a breathtaking sunset. The food was simple but fresh and well prepared. I loved the breakfast, especially the french toasts! The staff was very friendly - and Kim, the owner, very funny. We were very fond of her many animals - especilly the nabours white dog, the cats and the white duck. And the pool was great.
