Like other hotels in Europe, the room and bathroom were smaller than US standards, but it was very functional. The room might have been crowded had I been taking a large bag. Instead, I had two smaller bags, which made it easy to organize in the room (and get around Paris, too). The room was older, but it was very clean and well maintained. The bed was bigger than a normal single, and it was comfortable, too. The water pressure in the shower was better than what I have in the US (a big pet peeve of mine!). The staff was very nice and helpful. They all spoke perfect English and they were all willing to help or accommodate in any way they could. The breakfast was simple but very good. The location is good for tourist sights and there were several convenience stores close by the hotel. The neighborhood was fairly quiet, though early on in the night, it could be a bit noisy from the street traffic if the window was open. When closed, I didn't hear a thing. The only negative had nothing to do with the hotel, but it had to do with the neighborhood. Not too far away was a very touristy area, and the restaurants there reflected this. If you wanted a close bite, you had the tourist trap restaurants. You needed to plan ahead to get away from these joints, which the staff of Hotel Diana will gladly help you find.

It was our second time their together, but he had been there before. Here are our thoughts: Location: Excellent location, just 3-4 blocks from Notre Dame, in the busy Latin Quarter district. As others have said, no, this isn't a super quiet street (we could see the Sorbonne from our balcony), but it's off the main drag and I didn't go to Paris to be shut away from the sights and sounds of one of the best cities in the world. Proximity to metro/RER is almost unbeatable- we left our rented car at CDG and returned to Paris by RER, I think about 1.5 blocks from the hotel. Room: We had a street-side room (the smallest they offer) and I was thrilled- big windows, plenty of natural light, quiet enough at night with the windows shut (double pane), comfy bed (although we were so tired at the end of each day of sightseeing that it could have just been that we were exhausted and passed out), a closet (!!), mini-fridge (!!), small desk, small flat screen tv, full-length mirror, and good size bathroom (with built-in hairdryer). I have no idea why anyone would call the bathrooms at Hotel Diana small-- compared to anywhere else in Paris (or France that matter--- I had to shower OVER a toilet in Lyon), this bathroom was modern, roomy, and pretty darn fancy. My husband has stayed in four-star hotels in Paris and said he thought our room was by far the best he had stayed in. And, yes, the room is definitely on the small side if you compare it to US motels/hotels, but not for Paris. It was perfect for the two of us and our stuff. Price: Very good for what we got (especially considering it was Paris and October is still considered high season). We did not partake in the breakfast so I don't know whether it was worth it. Service: There was always someone at the front desk. You have to drop your keys off/pick them up when you come back. (The only snag we had was one afternoon when we came back for a nap and housekeeping tried to get into our room twice while we were trying to sleep-- what is the point of collecting our keys from us, knowing that we are \"in,\" if you're going to wake us up in the afternoon? Oh well.) Very friendly service and each one could converse in English. Reservations: This was a little weird- as others have said, they do not hold a credit card, but you have to reconfirm by email a week in advance. I was concerned about this, but there was no problem. To make myself feel better, we called the day we were going to arrive to let them know we probably wouldn't be in until 10pm and they said no problem. Overall assessment: A great, comfortable place to stay in Paris. We loved being able to walk to some major sights very close (Pantheon, Sorbonne, Notre Dame, Jardin du Luxembourg), hop on the metro/RER very quickly, and have TONS of food options nearby.

Prior to booking we read the tripadvisor reviews and decided to book. We tried to book well in advance however we were advised the hotel did not accept bookings more than two months in advance. We booked exactly two months in advance and received an email from the hotel advising us a room had been allocated to us and that we were required to confirm our booking by email one week in advance. We did this and subesquently arrived at the Hotel Diana and the receptionist was expecting us. We were allocated a room on the third floor with a street view. There was a lift operating to the third floor. Our room contained a small cooler, a water boiler, a safe, double bed, desk, two chairs, a television, air conditioning, and a relatively new bathroom. The bedroom was basic and clean. The bedroom and bathroom were serviced daily. We made an effort to speak with the staff and we found them friendly and helpful. We took up the offer of the breakfast provided by the hotel at eight euro each and found the breakfast was good value when compared with the local restuarants. As new arrivals in Paris we arrived at the Guard de Nord and we caught the metro to Cluney Station. With the assistance of a map we found the Hotel Diana which was about a five minute walk from Cluney Station. Our opinion is that the Hotel Diana is ideally located to see Paris and is situated in what we considered to be a safe area and was in walking distance to many of the attractions. The hotel was close to two metro stations, Cluney, and St Michel. We found we could go out in the morning and easily return to the hotel for a rest before venturing out in the afternoon and evening. Although there was a water boiler provided in the room there were no cups or tea or coffee provided. We purchased two cups and coffee and were able to have a coffee in the room when we felt like one. There were no downsides to the hotel for us but do not expect five star accommodation. We also found that many of the other guests staying at the hotel were people of a similar age to us. The hotel had limited free internet in the reception area which was available to guests.

And it doesn't get much better than this. The hotel is located a short walk from the Saint Michel-Notre Dame RER/Metro station, from where most parts of Paris can be reached within minutes. It is also on a direct line from Charles de Gaulle airport, so transfer from the plane was very easy. It is even closer to Cluny La Sorbonne Metro station, but this has more limited access to the various Metro lines. It is situated far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the Cluny area to make for a peaceful night's sleep, but a 2-minute stroll takes you to the middle of more bars, restaurants and cafes than you can shake a (particularly large) stick at. In short, perfectly located. The reception area is relatively small, and we encountered three reception staff during our three-night stay. Although some of them showing a reasonable knowledge of English, do expect to have to revert to French from time to time (which, to be fair, is only reasonable - you are in Paris, after all!). As a previous review mentioned, the lift is small. Two people plus suitcase is just about its limit. We stayed in a twin room on the first floor. No view from the window. Room was pleasant enough. Flatscreen TV (with no English channels), and with air-con (that wasn't on, albeit it was a chilly February week). Beds were pushed very close together, with limited room to separate them (so perhaps best avoided unless you are closely acquainted). We had the unnerving feeling that the floor sloped down towards the bathroom. Although we were unable to prove it, I'd be amazed if the floor was wholly level. Anyway, the bathroom was clean, and the room generally was the size you'd expect from a central Parisian hotel (ie. small, without being cramped). Previous reviews seem to rave about the breakfast. I'm not so convinced. It was standard Parisian fare - croissants, brioche and bread with butter and preserves, a choice of muesli, yoghurts and fruit. No \"hot\" options and, bearing in mind the price of 8 euros each, we preferred to walk into Cluny for 2 minutes and find a cafe serving much more substantial food for a reasonable price. Would I recommend this hotel? Well, if you are used to 4-star luxury and can afford to pay Parisian hotel prices, then no. There are far better choices.

The close and central metro and RER access to and from the airport (CDG), Versailles, the proximity to Notre Dame, the nearby Monoprix Dept. store (for small take out meals and drinks), the excitement of the Sorbonne area, as well as the Batobus stop down the street for cruising the Seine, make it very central and accessible. Try our favorite place, the Baker's Dozen, at the Place de la Sorbonne for bakery and sandwiches to go, and then sit at the outdoor tables! And, when you want another quiet retreat, go to Luxemburg Garden's \"grotto\".

These were so rough that I had to use a sarong on top of them to sleep comfortably. The location is very central with many stores, restaurants and the metro just around the block so you cannot beat the convenience. There are many food options nearby so I did not bother with the hotel's breakfast. The staff was OK, except for the older lady who went on a rant one morning about not using the A/C when the temp is below 25C/77F. As soon as I could get a word in, I told her that I had not even turned it on, to which she just said \u201cOh, well now you know\u201d.

The upside was the cute flower box on the window and the fact that I was on one of the top floors over looking the rooftops of the city.

Good location, less than perfect rooms. i am very conflicted about this hotel and how to review it with \"Yes or No\" answers. i will start with the good stuff. Functional, quiet, central, safe, value. The price was good. There were no bugs. it seemed safe. most of the staff were friendly and helpful. it was Quiet, at least in room 51. there was a mini fridge in the room and the lift (elevator) worked. WiFi was free. it is also very close to Notre Damn, Luxembourg gardens, metro, food market, yada, yada. That was all good and allowed us to eat at a fair price and walk to sites. The free WiFi was great too, but it cut off my Skype calls on my iPhone, not happy about the filtering. Now the bad news. Based on the reviews i read on this site you would think this hotel is very good, especially for Paris. Maybe it is good far Paris, or maybe the rooms vary widely. To be fair the room was not really very dirty, but it was not especially clean. The things that made it seem worse were the very dated decor and the old towels and linens. It looked like it was from the 70's. It is also a very tiny room, but the bathroom was big for Europe. And no they don't have a shower curtain, so you have to sit in the tube to shower and not make a mess, what a pain. If this is a good hotel for Paris, then i have to warn everyone about going to Paris. i do see that most hotels are double or triple in price, but the rooms could have been decent with $150 in updates to linens, curtains (shower too) and decor, seriously. Also the desk takes up a hug amount of space and is just too big for a tiny room. Another annoyance was that the person who cleaned the room every day insisted on a full \"reset\". Despite asking to not have the sheets tucked in or the furniture moved it was done every day to the point that the stool and the chair tucked in under the desk were switched back to the \"original\" location every day even though i swapped them every day. Not moved around the room, but switched sides under the desk; how OCD is that? The bed was hard and the linens were clean, but basic. The sheet was right on top of the bed, no pad or 2nd sheet, a little yucky for me. All this matters to me because 2 other friends from work had just come back from Paris on separate trips. Having heard their stories in person i still choose this hotel based on the reviews; statistically valid based on the number of them. I can not say that the other reviews are wrong. I do think maybe the standards of the other reviewers is low OR they had differently styled rooms OR Paris has pretty poor private hotels. Did i mention you could touch the bathroom door from the bed if you laid down head to toe? (i snore so my wife likes that arrangement). So here is the deal, i suggest to the hotel that they spend the $150 and get the bed pad, curtain(s), new linens and new colors for God's sake. Dump the desk or get a smaller one. i know you don't spend much time in your room, but my wife was al but desperate to avoid going back to the hotel. if this does not bother you, the good comments are valid, enjoy your stay. Other comments; i travel for pleasure and for work. i have stayed at more than 100 hotels in the last decade. i spend more than 60 nights a year in hotels. it was my first time to Parisso i can not compare directly; my review stands by itself, but based on pricing, reviews and research and other information i believe it to be valid. i have been to Europe about 5 years ago for 3 weeks; this trip was 2 weeks. i have stayed in 5 other similarly independent Europe hotels.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo, Japan", "Title": "\u201cA little bit expensive but very good!\u201d", "Author": "proscola", "ReviewID": "UR30080516", "Content": "I stayed there for 3 nights in May/09.

The Hotel Diana is something special. Six members of my family went to Paris to celebrate ny 60th birthday. This was my treat to the family but there is a limit to my wealth! I selected the Hotel Diana from theTrip Advisor reviews and was not the slightest bit disappointed in the hotel. It's a small (20 rooms?) family-owned hotel and the rooms are certainly rather on the small side. But they were spotless and the bathroom looked as though it had been installed the previous day. The staff were incredibly helpful and all spoke good English. Breakfast could get a little crowded but the hot croissants and fresh fruit salad were worth the wait. The location could not be better. 10 minutes from Notre Dame, about the same from the RER station serving the airports, and close to cross-town bus routes. There is a bicycle-hire station across the road and as it is in the Sorbonne area there is an endless range of resturants. The hotel staff are very good at suggesting places to see in the area around the hotel. The only downsides were the lack of a shower curtain and one needed to hold the shower rather than clipping it to the wall. If you are looking for a hotel with a bar, restaurant and rooms to while away the afternoon then this is not for you. For a short-stay visit to Paris for business or pleasure I doubt it can be beaten, I;ll never stay anywhere else.

No problems with the reservation, even though they did not require a deposit to hold the room. Arrived early in the morning after the overnight flight from the US and they had a room ready so we could get in a short nap before heading out to see the city. We were shown a room in the front but we worried that it would be too noisy, and took a room in the back facing an inner courtyard. I wish we had been able to change after that first day because it was rather dark and the rooms in the front were quiet enough. The rooms are microscopic as previously described, a bed and 2 feet of room on the other three sides. The bathrooms are renovated, clean and shiny, nice for Paris, however a shower curtain would have kept our stuff from getting wet as others have pointed out. Sparkling clean room and fine beds. The hotel lobby is stark and not conducive to just sitting there and reading. No one ever hung out in the lobby. The elevator was not working for the duration of our 4 night stay and had it been we would have taken a higher floor facing the front. . All in all I'm not quite sure why the hotel is as popular as it is in the Tripadvisor listing, however it is a great find and bargain for Paris, and the location is great. Just dont expect anything more. There are many restaurants within a 3 block radius, some exceptionally good such as Le Petit Prince and Le Pre Vere, in addition to the touristy restaurants closer to St. Michelle. Taking the RER to and from CDG was easy with an entrance to the metro 2 blocks from the hotel.

The hotel is located right in front of La Sorbonne, its not even a 5 minute walk to le Pantheon, an 8 minute walk to les Jardins du Luxembourg, a very enjoyable 20 minute (at the maximum) walk to Jardin des Plantes and La Grande Mosquee de Paris. It was also a 5minute walk to le Cathedrale de Dame, la Sainte-Chapelle, and Palais de Justice. It takes 1 minute to geth to the Cluny museum of medieval art. Its a 1 minute walk to the metro station Cluny-La Sorbonne. The hotel has an incomparably excellent location with great reastaurants within a stone's throw with a wide range of restaurants whether one wants to eat at a Traditional French restaurant in the Rue Mouffettard area or at the inexpensive Monoprix for a sandwich to take back to the hotel for lunch. The hotel offers breakfast at (i think) 8 euros that offers: pomegranate, bananas, figs, prunes, grapes, 4 types of cheese, nutella, honey, butter, yogurt, croissant, bread, orange juice, coffe, tea, and other yummy fresh-out-of-the-oven pastries. Bakeries don't open until 10 am (at leats in august) whereas one can the hotel's breakfast is offered from 7am-10am. This hotel is family-run, having belonged to Mme Cheval's parents and now in her hands with the help of her daughter. There are 23 rooms, with unbelievably reasonable rates for the famously shockingly expensive Paris. The owner is extremely nice and helpful having explained to us how to use public transport, advised us on how to get to the airport for cheaper, always pleasant with and open to discussions about the culture. We booked stayed in room 33 with a double bed and did not find it small seeing as we were mentally prepared for the difference between North American and European standards. Europe and its large cities are just generally lacking in space. The bed was very comfortable and same with the pillows. The room comes equipped with a small desk with storage, a tv, a chair, a large closet with storage, air conditioning, and a blow dryer (though I personally prefferred a more modern one for my hair). The room was extremely clean, I couldnt not have been happier. The bathroom are decently sized with a pedestal sink and bathtub. The bathtub has a handheld showerhead but there is no shower curtain so one has to shower sitting but we found that that worked perfectly fine. Th elevator was small and could fit my daughter and I with one large suitcase comfortably. The view is beautiful onto the Rue Saint-Jacques and the 2 large windows successfully blocked out all possible noise from the street. It was thanks to the fabulous hotel Diana that we adored our stay in the city of lights and we intend to return a countless number of times at the hotel. It is located in the 5th arrondissement in the Latin Quarter of the left bank of the Seine river. We stayed from the 12th of august and left the morning of the 23rd. I really believe that this hotel is perfect for anyone, except maybe a younger person with the intention to do more late-night partying than sightseeing.
