From there, take a tram to the Surinameplein stop and the hotel is on one of the corners of the square. We only stayed at this hotel because it was the only decent one available on the first night we went. We had already decided to change hotels the next nights. Since it was a busy night, the hotel was 119 euros, which we felt was too expensive for this hotel. If we had to repeat, we would choose a better hotel in this price range. Around 70-80 euros would probably be a good value for this hotel.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "HARRY FROM HINCKLEY", "Title": "\u201cworst hotel so far\u201d", "Author": "HARRYTHEB", "ReviewID": "UR7217849", "Content": "this is the first time i have written a review but feel compelled. i visit amsterdam at least once a year and like to try different hotels. this is by far the worse,it has a poor and unattractive location. the room was tiny,you were just able to walk around the bed. the bed was so uncomfortable we struggled to get any sleep. it was clean. i cannot believe this is a three star hotel,how did this pass? we even tried to get another hotel for the second night even though we had already paid in full that's how bad this experience was!", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester ,england", "Title": "\u201cnice location\u201d", "Author": "villasis", "ReviewID": "UR6748964", "Content": "i just came back from my holiday commencing january 26 ,our first stop was amsterdam and we stayed in this hotel ,we booked triple bed,the location was excellent with tram,quite environment,nice foods for bed and breakfast,nice service,reception staff are approachable and helpful,the only problem was the room given to us 1 double deck bed and single bed and that room was in between the other rooms for groups,unfortunately for the first 2 nights the 2 other rooms was with lads (4 each rooms)they made our nights horrible due to banging of doors(unconsiderate)what a coincidence they come from england,drunk as usual going back to their rooms at 2-4 am,though its not the hotels fault,i will recommend this hotel to my friends in the future due mainly to location,to other people going to holiday be considerate to fellow guest.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFawlty Towers-eat ur heart out!!\u201d", "Author": "matildalou", "ReviewID": "UR6610555", "Content": "The title says it all.

My own bathroom toilet was blocked and when flushed the contents came up through the bath and sink. There was evidence of fire damage in my bathroom and the toilet seat was in two pieces. The shower leaked and when used the bathroom flooded to a considerable degree. The whole hotel was a joke from start to finish. There were massive holes in the corridor walls. There was no heating in my room and the double bed had two single duvets on it so myself and my companion were freezing during the night. It was a truly awful experience.

The number 1 is the more direct route. I found the hotel a little too far out of town for my liking, as I prefer to be more central. The walls were paper thin and if someone was watching TV until 4am (like our next door neighbour), this can be very annoying. The hotel is also on a very busy main road (Surneimaplein) and traffic and tram noise WILL awake you very early! The breakfast is very basic, with cheese some cold meats, bread, juice, coffee and tea. There is one breville toastie machine. For the price, this is a clean and pretty good value hotel.

We found it fine for a weekend in Amsterdam. There are very good tram connections to and from the city centre and it is also very easy to get to and from Schiphol airport. However, the trams stop running at around 12.30 at night so you must get a taxi back to the hotel if you have a night on the town. Taxis are relatively expensive but there seemed to be lots available- we had no trouble getting them anyway. The hotel does not look very inviting from the outside (being the bottom two floors of a high rise building)but on the inside is fine. It is decorated in 'ye olde Amsterdam' style and is basic but clean. Our room was a good sized triple and we had a good sized bathroom too. One quibble was that as we were on the ground floor we couldn't open any windows and it did get quite hot at night. Aside from that the room was fine. The staff are helpful and someone is available all of the time in reception. Breakfast was ok not anything special and there did not seem to be facilities for any other meals, although we did not enquire so I may be wrong on this point. The Belfort as we experienced it is a clean basic hotel which would suit anyone in Amsterdam for a short stay who will not be spending much time in the hotel.
