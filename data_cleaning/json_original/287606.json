Without a 2nd thought, when we bought tickets for a Bruins game, we booked a room at the Onyx exactly 1 year to the day from our first trip. When we found out last minute it was going to snow the morning we were originally supposed to arrive, we were easily accomodated with a 2nd night, and drove in a day early. Everything I mentioned in last year's (January 2011) review stands true, so I will not repeat. But I will touch on a couple of things. The service is amazing! Lauren the receptionist and LJ the bell boy were so welcoming and extremely friendly. They engaged us in conversation from everything about sports to pets. LJ even introduced himself and asked our permission before picking up our bags. He didn't want us to \"have some stranger touching our stuff.\" I would have to say I was a little disappointed in the Valet service this time. When we arrived, my husband (who is handicapped) had to sit in the car while I went in to ask for someone to valet. I don't know if they were short staffed, but I felt we should have been greeted by someone as soon as we pulled up, even if they were not taking the car right away. On the other hand, when we checked out, our car was retrieved very quickly (about 10 minutes). The only other downside was our room was directly across from the janitor's closet, so when they were cleaning in the middle of the night, because the doors are so heavy we could hear them opening and closing the door. Because of our not so great experience,and the number of restaurants in the area, we decided to pass on the hotel's restaurant. However we did try the room service one morning. The food was above fair, arrived a little cooler than I would have liked it, and the french toast was more like standand toast with some cinnamon, but it was not terrible. It is expensive in typical room service fashion. However, my husband enjoyed his eggs and I would be willing to try again. The coffee and wait service was AWESOME! The second morning we were there, we just walked 1 block over to Dunkin Donuts. In addition to a repeat visit to McGanns Irish Pub, we also went next door to Porters Bar and Grill for burgers and a beer after the game. I also highly recommend this restaurant. The food and atmosphere was great. There are soooooooo many hotels to choose from in Boston, but any time we return for a visit to the Garden, the Onyx is the only place we will stay.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff and Service\u201d", "Author": "MisterPickyEater", "ReviewID": "UR125554898", "Content": "Stayed here 3 nights in winter.

The walls are also pretty thin and we had a romantic couple on side and an \"excited/emotional\" child on the other. The work out room is in the basement and is very small and sparse.

The bathroom was a nice size and there was adequate room for 2 ladies to fit all their toiletries. The room was clean and the beds comfortable. From our room on the 3rd floor, there was no scenic view (we looked out what may have been the back of other buindings on the block behind us). But that was not what we were there for so it was not an issue for us. The only issue we ran into was when we returned from The Four's after celebrating the Rangers' OT win, our room keys did not work.

The hotel is very dog friendly - so much so that if your dog is staying there, they have a welcome sign with his/her name and a bowl of water and kibble in the lobby (ADORABLE). According to the hotel guide book, they also walk and babysit your dog for free. Totally awesome.

The people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. There was a small gym room in the basement with about five - seven machines with tv's in the consoles and headphones and a business center (one Mac computer). CONS: The location is both a blessing and a curse. There are 3 bars on the block and it is one block from TD Garden. There was a home game and you could clearly hear the fans honking their horns, shouting, talking and laughing on the street below, even though we were on the fifth floor! The walls, doors and windows are thin, so we could also hear some noise in the hallway. But once the crowds thinned and left, it was generally quiet.

It's clean, mostly quiet, and fun in the Kimpton way. There were well-behaved dogs in the lobby and the staff was always happy to do anything they could to make our one night stay pleasant. There were no problems, but I found room 1008 to be really small, I thought the HVAC system was noisy, and parking seemed expensive at $42/night. I liked the Marlowe (another nearby Kimpton property) more and if I could choose between the two, the Marlowe would win. Having said that, the Onyx is convenient to the North End and to the Faneuil Hall area, and it's easy to drive to and from this hotel, so it's a good bet for tourists. The neighborhood is noisy and not Boston's most impressive, but it's not bad either. If you're thinking of coming to Boston as a tourist for a few days, here's how to get the most out of the Onyx: First, join Kimpton's free InTouch program. You'll get email telling you when there's a sale and when there is, make reservations fast because rooms don't last long. And wi-fi is free if you're an InTouch member. Now see if there's anything happening at the nearby Fleet Center (aka TD Garden). You're staying nearby so check it out. If you like Italian food, make reservations for dinner in Boston's North End. We went to Marco and it was amazing. Stay 2 or 3 nights, and let the staff at the Onyx help you decide what to do. As long as you don't mind the small room, you'll love it. Okay, this should be a five-star review, right? If this was a regular hotel, I'd easily say yes. But this is a Kimpton and they've spoiled me over the last 15 years so I expect a lot. By Kimpton standards, the Onyx is actually sort of average.

The Onyx did not disappoint! We love a good 8-10 hour road trip but few hotels welcome dogs. A handful of chains do, but don't truly make for a dog-friendly experience. In such establishments, owners need to be present in the room with the dogs or have to crate them while out for dinner. Anyone reading this who has a dog will know that crating a dog for a couple of hours isn't ideal in an \"outside of the home\" environment. ALONG COMES KIMPTON! YAY! We learned about Kimpton's dog-friendly services online and researched them here on TripAdvisor and are so glad we did! Our experience at the hotel was amazing! We checked in with our dog and were welcomed with open arms. Based on Kimpton's email blitzes and website blurbs about dogs, I almost expected staff to make a bigger deal out of how cute our pooch was, but since there were apparently several other dogs in residence, ours was just another guest. Fair enough. LOL! The nice part of staying at a Kimpton hotel with a dog is that you're put on a floor with other dog owners and you can leave your dog in the room - uncrated - to go out for dinner/shop/etc. On top of that, if you plan on being out for more than a couple of hours, you can hire staff for a very fair rate to stay in the room/entertain Fido/walk the dog/Etc. Guests without dogs: Have no fear! As mentioned, the rooms for dog owners are confined to specific blocks/levels. Plus, they only allow a certain number of dogs on site per night. On to the room! We loved the decor and leopard robes. :) The room was not especially spacious for the price but it was chic and comfortable. We had plenty of space for our two suitcases and our dog bed so all was fine. I have paid more for less at other places. The room had all of the right amenities compactly tucked into space saving shelving. Again, the room's design was lots of fun and felt cozy and comfortable. The wine \"happy hour\" in the lobby was a nice perk. The lobby itself was quite small so we felt a little crowded. It wasn't like we could kick back and sip on a leisurely glass of vino. But it was fun anyway. I mean, really, there should be no complaining about free wine! :) The wine reception is a very smart concept because it gives Kimpton staff the opportunity to answer a bunch of guests' questions all at once. It probably takes pressure off the front desk/concierge later in the evening as they won't have to deal with constant calls asking about restaurant recommendations, directions, etc. As a guest, it's simply refreshing to speak with staff in person rather than on the phone. It felt more personal. Valet parking was efficient and the usual pricing applied. (I can't remember what we paid but it was at par with any US/Canadian metropolitan city.) The location makes for an excellent base exploring the city and is especially close to the Boston Garden, Quincy Market and North End. We started our evening off with some authentic clam chowder at a pub in the market followed by the best pizza I've ever had at the famous Regina Pizzeria in the North End. After a wee walk we were able to justify indulging in the outstanding dessert cannoli from Modern Pasty. We bought extra cannoli to enjoy on our drive the next day, but our dog found them when we weren't looking and gobbled them up! Lucky dog! LOL! Needless to say, you will find much to do in the area and the subway is nearby as well. You really won't need to drive in Beantown. Nor would you want to. I've driven all over North America but always get confused with all of the little one way streets in Boston! :) The only downfall was that we only had time on this particular trip to stay just one night! We would have loved to stay longer! We will definitely be back. I have always liked Boston and can't wait to return to The Onyx with our pooch and explore the city again. I need more time so I can go shopping and enjoy more of the amazing restaurants that have popped up over the past few years.

We didn't take advantage of the nightly wine tasting or eat anything at the bar restaurant. As others have mentioned, you should become a Kimpton loyalty program member before checking in, to get free wireless and a $10 credit for the mini bar. ($10 won't go very far, however, when it's $6 for a large bottle of water or $4 for a bag of chips that elsewhere costs less than $1: the price of convenience, I guess!). The lobby can get a bit cramped when many people are checking out around the same time, but that's not a huge issue. The front desk personnel were friendly and responsive. We were slightly peeved by noise late at night in the streets below, when the local bars close. On Friday and Saturday nights, we could hear drunken folks in the streets despite being on the 8th floor. Perhaps a room on the back side of the building would be quieter. None of the lots nearby allow overnight parking, so we went with the hotel valet service. Not cheap, but convenient. However, the person who took our car into the garage late Saturday night apparently forgot to turn off the lights, and the battery was dead the next morning. They didn't tell us this, and offered no explanation for why our car was an hour late being delivered in the morning despite our having called in a half hour in advance. But when we finally got the car, it was clear there had been an electrical interruption because the clock was blinking and the anti-theft lock on the audio system needed to be reprogrammed. Luckily it was all easily restored and a relatively minor inconvenience. But the hotel should have been upfront that a mistake had been made, instead of trying to cover it up. When we complained, we were graciously credited the two-day parking fee, yet then shortly afterwards, we were charged again for one day. Not very smooth, as we pointed out to them. They then re-credited the second day, but the damage had been done: we weren't upset about the money, we were disappointed with their lack of professionalism and transparency. One problem with the garage shouldn't prevent you from staying at the Onyx. The location was fantastic for walking throughout the city, even if its situation right by a bunch of sports bars may mean some late-night noise in the streets. You're less than 10 minutes' walk from the heart of the North End, 10 minutes to Beacon Hill, and just a bit further to the public gardens.

I also liked the shampoo and conditioner bottles that were mounted to the showerwall, far more environmentally friendly than all the small bottles you usually get. The only thing I can complain about in the bathroom is that it would have been good to have more shelfing space in it.

Check in was prompt and to our surprise they offered us 2 rooms for the price of 1! They had some open rooms for the weekend and since we brought our 2 Great Danes with us, they figured we could use the extra space. We were thrilled. The room we reserved was clean and comfortable. The bed was plush and we got a great sleep. Since I had put in my reservation that it was our anniversary, they left us a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates which was a nice treat! The second room, which we got complimentary, had a pull out sofa bed (no regular bed). The room was large, with a little seating area, a sink and bathroom.

It was still Gilchrist and Soames brand, which I love. They did provide travel size soap and body lotion, too. The bed was nice - firm, but not hard, and the sheets were lovely, as well. Our room was very clean, too. I don't know how full the hotel was or was not, but we didn't hear any noise from any of the other rooms - the only noise we heard at night was from the street. We were on the 6th floor, but I think the street noise in a city like Boston can't be helped. Our room, like another comment said, was directly across from an office building, so they can see right in - but closing the dark drapes solved that problem. If someone is coming to the TD Garden, you are only a block away from there - and just a few blocks from the North End - with all of the restaurants there to enjoy. Again, the front desk staff was very helpful in giving us accurate directions to walk there for dinner. Also only a block or two from two different T stops. Be aware of the fee for valet parking, and do call ahead before you need the car. There was a lot not far away, but don't know how safe that would be for overnight parking on your own. We enjoyed our stay, and would definitely choose the Onyx again when visiting Boston.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falmouth, Maine", "Title": "\u201cGood Boutique Hotel,Somewhat Odd Location, Small Adequate Rooms\u201d", "Author": "Arch53", "ReviewID": "UR95648484", "Content": "I completed a one night stay at the Onyx on January 12, 2011 to attend a business meeting. At first I was concerned about the location. It is near the Boston Garden so handy for sports events but somewhat out of the way for other purposes. As it turned out, the location was not a problem since the T at North Station is only 1 1/2 blocks away. Hotel is generally nice; boutique hotel of 112 rooms. Basically not much of a lobby and the rooms are certainly on the small side (think closer to NY size than Boston 4*size). It was a little odd that the bathroom was so small that the towel rack was inside the shower area of the tub (on back wall) but the room size was certainly adequate for my short visit; longer visits may make the room size an issue since there is not much of a lobby either. But the rooms are comfortable, bedding is of high quality and the staff is very helpful and upbeat. Many good restaurants nearby including Boston's North End relatively close by. You can purchase the continental breakfast available in the lobby for $16 or full breakfast for $20. I did not elect either option but it would be convenient for some. Coffee in lobby in morning is free. Valet parking is $42 but you can find nearby overnight garage parking on for $25. Free WiFi in rooms but I did not use it so I do not know how good the signal is.

Before I could explain to him that I wasn't comfortable just leaving my car on a side street of Boston he was gone. So I sat in my car in front waiting for SOMEONE to come and finally I saw a doorman so I got out and just dealt with him and eventually he took the keys. Check-in was smooth and the staff was great. The room was small but a typical big city room. The bed was VERY comfortable. We took advantage of the free \"wine hour\" which was a great feature. My girlfriend ordered a martini so there was a small bill. At 6:15 we were told if we weren't ordering food we'd have to leave our table - not great but understood. You could hear the drunks outside during the course of the night. Not fun but absent some thicker windows nothing anybody can do. The next morning the breakfast buffet was sufficient. They have a security guard at breakfast - weird. They automatically add gratuity to your bill which is weird considering the ONLY thing the staff did was clear your plate. They don't even do the coffee, it's ALL self serve. I had my credit card sticking out of the check for over 5 minutes and at one point held it up for the \"waiter\" to get it - he walked by, looked right at it and kept going. Checkout was smooth but DEFINITELY call ahead for your car from valet.

Because of the snow and the amount of cars on the street, it was a little confusing to find the valet at first, but after a second trip around the block we found it. It was $42 to valet but well worth it. Check in was very quick and the front desk attendants were extremely friendly. They treated not only my husband and I as welcomed guests, but also our 5 month old puppy. They even provided a dog walking service and took our puppy out for us while we were at the game. The room was a little smaller than I thought it would be, but was spotless and had everything you needed. We were pleasantly surprised a high quality, clean, dog bed and bowls for the puppy were provided. Our bed, pillows, and linens were amazingly soft and we slept great. Although there was no way to shut the room door quietly, you heard very little outside traffic or hallway noise. There were a couple of small downfalls. 1.) The \"doggie relief\" area is a couple of blocks away. 2.) Other than the mini bar in the room, there are no vending machines. However there is a 7 Eleven with everything you need a 3 minute walk down the street. 3.) Although the atmosphere and selection at the breakfast buffet in the Ruby Room was high, the taste of the food was average or below average. Definitely not worth the $16 per person. As I mentioned, it is perfectly located and there are many restaurants,and pubs within a short walking distance.

I had planned a surprise night out in Boston for my wife's birthday including a room at the Onyx. She works in Boston so I planned on checking in to the room and placing the dress and shoes I bought for her to wear out that night into the closet of the room, then going to pick her up and bring her back to the room to find her surprise there. Two days before our trip she informed me she was taking that day off from work and would not be in the city. This presented a problem for me since I wanted her gifts in the closet when she got to the room, but now she would be arriving at the hotel with me instead of after I had already been there. I called the front desk staff and explained the situation. They offered to take the dress, shoes, and purse from me days before our check in, store them for me, and arrange them in the closet of our room as I requested before we checked in. They not only handled the expensive items safely and arranged them carefully in the closet for my wife's surprise, they also placed a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice in our room, a platter of chocolate covered strawberries, and decorated the floor and bed of the room with red and white rose petals. The staff also helped me confirm I had chosen a good restaurant for our dinner reservation and offered to arrange a taxi be at the restaurant when we were done. The front desk staff also recognized us and called us by name even though we only stayed the one night, and they complimented my wife's new shoes and purse as she walked by to go out knowing they were brand new. The room itself was also very nice with funky animal print bathrobes in the closet, an extremely comfortable bed, and a nice view of some of the buildings in the city (we were on the 10th floor). If I have a need for a hotel room in Boston again, the Onyx will be the 1st hotel on my list. I very highly recommend this hotel.

My husband (first boyfriend, then fiance) and I have stayed at the Onyx three times and each time it only gets better. The most recent stay was last September, for our mini-moon--my husband was in an unfortunate accident and unable to fly until six months into recovery, so we switched to a mini moon week in Boston. The service is always fantastic--everyone always says hello and seems to know who you are the second you walk in. Rooms are comfortable and clean and the decor is fun and modern. The rooms are definitely not too small for a boutique hotel, but rather intimate and cozy. Small amenities like an umbrella in the closet in case of rain let you know that Kimpton really DOES care. The front desk is always able to recommend fantastic food or a great night out--we found Oishii (which is now our fave sushi anywhere) because of their recommendation. The Ruby Room is intimate, but lovely. Drinks are strong and the bartenders that work there are personable and get to know you. I've sampled some of the food and, true to Kimptom form, it's fantastic. I, personally, think the location is fantastic. Is the street a bit odd? Yes. But that's one of the charming things about Boston--you never know what fabulous thing you will stumble upon in it's \"back alleys.\" On this street, it's the Onyx. The North End (ie food lovers paradise) is a five minute walk and the Orange line is only two blocks away. In the other direction, Quincy Market is only five minutes away as well. For the reviewers who have also complained about no WiFi....do yourselves a favor and sign up for Kimpton In Touch. You earn great rewards AND get free wifi, amongst other things.

The answer to the question, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is this it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It's small, reminiscent of a London hotel conversion - but much brighter and cheerful. Four stars usually could mean that there is somebody waiting to help you with your luggage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that wasn't the case for me. Check-in was fine and I was invited to the wine reception to be held later. Thankfully, they didn't put me in the basement based on my Priceline booking and actually were quite friendly and helpful. My room was on the 8th floor and I had a view of the room across from me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think it was room 811 that I could see out my window. I really, really, liked the room. It was interesting, lots of details to take in and thankfully different from the typical cookie cutter Hyatt-Hilton-Marriott blandness. The rooms I had was small, but well organized. I would take this room over a large cookie cutter room any day. I felt like somebody actually made an effort to give the room a bit of soul. It was the striped wallpaper, the excellent draperies, black and white tiled carpet, great looking lamps, bright red accents, the tiger print bathrobes. Lots of details...except one: Where's the coffee maker? They had everything else, ironing board, iron (and there was actually an outlet to use it with without having to move the bed away from the wall like in other hotels) safe, and all those other four star things you would expect. The flat screen TV was a bit too big for the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I'm guessing there are some out there who think the TV can never be big enough. The wireless internet is free if you join their loyalty program. I think that is a very clever idea and more hotels should realize the benefit of doing this versus offering a ridiculously overpriced \u00e2\u20ac\u201c low performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c service that alienates their customers. I should also mention that the hairdryer was a treasure hunt reward \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hidden in a bag hanging inside the bathrobe in the bathroom. Finally finding it made me happy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c looking for it...well, let's say happy wasn't the word. Makes me wonder if I just didn't find that elusive coffee maker.... After dropping my stuff, I was on a mission to grab a meal at my Grandfather's old haunt, Durgin Park over in Faneuil Hall. Back down to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lobby\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - which is actually a wide-ish curving passageway from the elevator to the door, they had a little table set up with a few wine bottles. There were several people mingling around partaking. The space wasn't there for this very neat idea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they should have moved it into the Ruby Room, which actually is what takes up all the space of what could be the Lobby. I managed to make my way through the group after several pardon me's. Out the door \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I really didn't pay close enough attention \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to the left I started walking towards Government center following the road that passes under the parking garage there. I'm guessing about 10 minutes walk up the road and you see the Union Oyster House, another couple of minutes and you're at Quincy Market, Faneuil Hall. I had my meal and it was on the way back that I missed Portland street and ended up walking around like a true foreigner trying to figure out why my Hotel wasn't where I expected it to be. But you can't really stay lost for long in this section of Beantown. Unlike my stay at the Marriott Long Wharf last November, that had been taken over by drunken college kids, I slept very well at the Onyx. The bed was comfortable and I didn't hear a thing. When I got up in the morning I spent a few minutes trying to find the coffee maker \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which I never did find - and resigned myself to getting dressed and heading out to Dunkin Donuts over at Government center for my morning cup. 5:30 a.m. found me passing through the lobby. The lady working reception seemed to be having a very involved conversation (me thinks personal conversation) on the phone and didn't really seem to see or acknowledge me on my way out. But I'm like that early in the morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I'm not very visible. Back to the hotel after my 15 minute walk and she's still at it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but smiles at me this time without missing a beat on her phone call. Summary: Good hotel. Very nice room.

If you ever been to the garden for an event, you know how IMPOSSIBLE it can be to get a cab when SO MANY people are competing with you. We literally just had to walk across the street and we were in bed in our pj's within 10 minutes! Speaking of beds, they are very comfortable at this hotel and we are truly bed snobs! Also, this hotel is very close to the Italian district (I think they call it the \"East end\"??) where all the amazing restaurants are located. We also brought our dog, a 120lb Rottweiler, with us for our stay. If you are the type that likes to bring your pet along when you travel, then you know that hotels who claim they are \"pet friendly\" often really aren't. Some hotels charge crazy fees, have size and breed restrictions that are competely unreasonable, and they treat you almost as if they are doing you a favor by letting you bring your pet along. Now I acknowledge that our dog isn't exactly an average sized dog and can be intimidating if you don't know him, but nonetheless if a hotel calls themselves \"pet friendly,\" the dog's size and breed shouldn't matter (especially since our dog is a BIG BABY). This hotel was truly PET FRIENDLY. There was no pet fee, no size or breed restriction and the staff completely spoiled and indulged him. They even had the names of all the pets staying at the hotel on a sign above dog bowl full of water and doggy treats! It was really cool to see the manager of the hotel get down on his knees in his suit and tie to pet and hug our pup. The staff at this hotel is very attentive. Additionally, they are true professionals yet they are also able to make you feel at home by conversing freely and almost acting like friends instead of servants.

We read a ton of reviews on this hotel before we booked the room. We stayed in a standard King room. 1. Location--absolutely perfect location if you intend to visit the North End (Boston's version of Little Italy) and the bars/restaurants located in Center City/Boston Commons. The North End was a ten minute walk at most and Boston Commons was at most a fifteen walk. The block itself has two bars and two restaurants on it, a dunkin donuts and Au Bon Pan on it and a 7-Eleven on it. Also, Canal Street, which is all breweries, bars and pubs is located one block over, which is super convenient. Public transportation like the \"T\" is also two blocks away. It's so worth the money to book this hotel and save $200 as opposed to those located in center city. One important note, there was construction on the street in front of the hotel, so make sure you request a room in the BACK of the hotel, because it's loud in the morning!!!! 2. Staff--super friendly, young. Upon check-in, we were promptly given our room and our car was parked. They were upfront right away about the $40/night parking fee and that the valet would require a 30 minute lead time to get your car (you should walk everywhere anyways in Boston). They promptly brought up our bags to the room and even gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne and a card to welcome us for our honeymoon. Throughout the 4 days we stayed at the hotel, we called down several times for more bathroom items and various things and someone came to our room w/in 5 minutes and assisted us. People at front desk were very helpful and accomodating though. 3. Amenities--considering they tout themselves as a 4 star hotel, there could have been a lot more, this is my only complaint. No frills all the way. Only given a coffee maker on request, sheets and towels weren't super plush for this hotel, no fridge, no microwave in 4 star hotel, that's a shame!!! Probably my only complaint about this hotel. The wine reception (free wine from 5-6pm each night) is cool, but how much wine can you drink in an hour before dinner. Didn't use the fitness room or anything else, and no pool in this hotel, which sucked. Free wireless internet at least. 4. Room--the room had one of the best beds I've ever slept on and I liked the bathroom. The room was super clean when we checked in. That being said, the room is WAY SMALL!!! We didn't care, but the walls are kind of thin and there is definitely no view to be had based on the location of the hotel, you'll either look at the back of the building, an alley, or another building in the front. We stayed here for the location, not the view. One thing--the air conditioner is LOUD, omg is it loud. 5. Overall--the location of this hotel is wonderful, that's why we stayed there. It's not even close to a 4-star hotel, more like a 3 star. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The room was nice enough, but very small. No amenities at all left a lot to be desired, especially when you're paying $200+ a night. The $40/night parking sucked, but I've read everywhere that it's commonplace in Boston to pay through the nose for parking. If you're booking for location and a mostly quiet, tucked away place to stay, then this is your hotel. If you're looking for a 4-star, then stay elsewhere. This hotel is really tiny though, tiny rooms, tiny lobby, tiny lougue in lobby, tiny everything, so be ready for that.

We arrived at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s curbside check-in, unloaded our bags and searched for a valet driver, who apparently was on break. I walked into the lobby and was greeted by a friendly wine host who offered my sweetheart and me wine and crackers. Again, I searched for a valet to move my illegally parked car to no avail. As we checked in at the front desk, I watched as an individual drove down the one-way street in his Dodge pickup truck, pulled in front of my car, and reversed until the trailer hitch of his behemoth was thru the front bumper of my sedan. Now, this clearly was not the fault of the hotel but the incident was absolutely in part due to the inconvenient drop off location and poor valet service. My car should have either been moved immediately or a valet should have been available curbside to direct incoming guests where to park, as is common place at most valet locations. After reading some of the phenomenal reviews I must say I expected hotel management to compensate us in some way for the unfortunate incident. I understand that expecting anything more than the minimum from most hotels these days is a direct route to disappointment, but the highly touted Kimpton Management group seems to hold itself to a higher set of standards. I was reassured when my girlfriend told me that the front desk clerk had asked her what our room number was. I assumed that either our parking fees would be deducted from our bill or at the very least to be compensated with a bottle of wine, which they seem to give away so liberally. Needless to say, I felt a little bit slighted when we saw no such return. Again, I realize that this incident was unfortunate and accidental and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that this experience should deter anyone from staying at the Onyx. As far as the rest of my stay, here are my thoughts: Yes, the rooms are slightly smaller than usual, but make up for it with a cozy feel and nice setup. More importantly, the room was IMMACULATE, and I do mean immaculate. The bathroom was clean and stocked to perfection. Complementary high-speed internet is a rare find. I had correspondence with 3 hotel employees, the wine host, front desk clerk and Ruby Room bartender, all of whom were pleasant. Lastly, my request for a late checkout was granted and we were able to stay until noon the next morning, without a single pestering knock from housecleaning.

The Ruby Room was amazing, much smaller than what we pictured but I think it added to the comfort feeling. Food wasn't amazing...not bad but nothing great and a tad over priced. The rooms were very nice and for the most part very clean. There were some clothes left over in one of the drawers, clean, but not ours. Of course it's alittle expensive, but your in Boston so it's expected. Their Vallet price is $40. We didn't know it was $40 a day though. We only stayed for 2 nights, so it wasn't too bad.

We let him in and he behaved very nervously setting out the wine and glasses (which I didn't really think much of at the time). I called down to the front desk to ask if my wallet was left on the desk and it wasn't. I then requested them to review the security camera of the lobby (they stupidly don't have them on the individual floors) what they saw was me put my wallet back into my shorts pocket and even tap it to check it was safe before movign to the lift. I then remembered taking my wallet and map and putting it on my suitcase outside our room door as I took the room keys from the same pocket. I immediately complained to the concierge that within 2 minutes of being in the room the porter appeared and my wallet had gone. He had concerns and took my to the kitchen and checked the bins there as well as the private outside bins that only the staff have access too. He made a brief search but didn't find it and spoke to me in whispers as he was obviously afraid of being overheard by the staff that he also suspected the porter. Next I called the police (who only completed an incident report over the phone and never visited the hotel to see me or question the porter) and then the head of security got involved and said he'd quizzed the porter and thought he was suspicious. After all this, my wallet, with my credit card, $424 cash and drivers licence were never returned. I am really disgusted at the way it was handled - I feel that they should have searched the bins thoroughly and had the police come to question the porter (who was quick to ask me if I'd reported the credit card stolen the first time I went to the desk to complain).

Lobby of the hotel is very dark, you can almost run into other guests. The place is like a Batman movie set. They tried to provide some sort of 90s Euro-trash ambient not for 2008 Boston. I guess their clients are mostly \"wanna be\" types. Hotel is pet friendly, so you will be seeing K9s, but leashed.

The new room was equally small but with a larger window looking at another room room six feet away from the hotel next door. The room decor is very kirsch, (but very very kirsch). It is mostly black and red, remind me of red light districts of Amsterdam. More importantly, everything that you can touch is for sale, from bathrobes to umbrellas in the closet to tiger pattern boxers. You are not sure what to use or not, concern of the extra charge you may get when you checked out. It is not enough that they charge over two hundred dollars for this room, they also want to make few extra buck by selling novelty kirsch item of the hotel. I would personally be embarrassed to buy \"Fredrick's of Hollywood\"type of stuff from the room inventory. I guess there are such people in the World.

A complete mess. If they hadn't built a semi-circular sitting area in the front entrance way there would be more room for the check in/out process. We got to our room, to find we had a guest with a dog right next door to us. I have no problem with a hotel allowing pets but all the pets should be on the same floor all next to each other, so when the dogs bark they can bark continuously to each other, when they are left alone by their owners. We went to Boston for a romantic getaway we had to call the front desk twice regarding the dog barking next door. I needed a nap mid day and never got one. The room is small but we knew this from previous reviews. Four star bathroom it's not! The bathroom tub and shower needs a serious update. The hot water took forever to come on. The stopper in the shower didn't work so I had to pull it in and out with my nails and almost broke them to get it to work. The Aveda products do not make up for anything. The bed is very comfortable although I never got a full nights sleep because the entire hotel had to evacuate their rooms for a false fire alarm after midnight no less. So there we all stood outside or sat in the Ruby room in our pajamas, messy hair, and swollen eyes from no sleep. Children with their stuffed animals sleeping in their parents arms...for nothing. They couldn't even get the alarm turned off. I never got to sleep in this place. The valet service is brutal. For one thing it's $40/day. In Boston downtown with no parking you can expect to pay something. However you expect to get your car in a timely manner. Forget that make sure you call the front desk at least 20 minutes ahead of when you need it. However the Onyx is located in the center of everything, so you can walk minimum of 1 mile to everything. I exercise a lot so I didn't mind the hike to Faneuil Hall, shops, etc. Bring comfortable shoes, historic brick and stone roads everywhere. Do not eat at the Onyx. The Ruby room is nothing to write home about. I have been to many high class restaurants/clubs in Boston this does not even come close. There also is no business center, unacceptable for a 4 star rated hotel so if you don't bring your lap top you're out of luck. The computers they have only let you print your boarding passes. But when I went to print mine downstairs the printer was out of ink, so I was checked in but had no passes that I had to reprint at the airport anyhow. So as far as the Onyx goes be prepared to pay pay pay, be inconvenienced a lot and definitely leave exhausted if your room is next to someone whom brought their dog.

The rooms are not large but comfortable enough for 2 people. The mini bar was fully stocked with beverages and snacks. FYI, bring your own bottled water if you don't feel like paying $4-5 a bottle. They also provide AVEDA products shampoo, conditioner and lotion ( ladies will appreciate that) The Ruby Room restaurant/bar was a great place to unwind. Again not a huge place but suffiecient enough. We had the breakfast buffet there one morning. It was $13 p/p plus auto 18% gratuity. There were probably cheaper places for breakfast in the area, but it was snowing and we did not feel like venturing out that early. We also had the handcut russet potato chips with blue cheese (delicious) and some cocktails before dinner one night. They offer a complimentary beer/wine hour with cheese and crackers nightly.

The rooms are nice, quite spacious and well decorated, bathroom roomy and well fitted but the overall feeling in the hotel is that it's a converted office block (not least as it overlooks office buildings opposite). The reception area has a bar & restaurant (the Ruby room) which has a very low ceiling and they've tried to compensate for the squareness of the space by adding curves - which sound great but actually take away a lot of space and you feel like you're falling over people to get from the bar to a table. As with all Kimptons, it's a pet friendly hotel which is fine (and hasn't been an issue in any of the other Kimptons we've stayed in) but on Sat eve there were about 4 dogs and 3 cats in and out of the lifts and one man sat with his cats on his lap in both the reception and the bar. Would be a nightmare if you have pet allergies! The other disappointing thing was the breakfast - on Sat & Sun there's no room service until 8.30am which is late, and when we did order one hot breakfast and one cereal breakfast, we got one bowl between us (which had yoghurt in) and one set of cutlery. We managed, but it wasn't very sensible of them as they knew there were two of us in the room! I saw a previous review which said this was a good location - I wouldn't totally agree with that, it's a little out of the way (although it only takes 10 mins to get into the centre of things on foot) but is round the corner from the Bruins ice hockey stadium so gets very busy when there's a game on. A big positive for this hotel - as with a lot of Kimptons - is that the staff are very nice, and we found the Spanish receptionist (who I think was called Cecile) extremely helpful and accommodating. They also have a wine hour from 5pm which was a nice addition. All in all not bad, but not as good as we were hoping. One thing to watch for as a general point - we got ripped off by the taxi driver from the airport who took us the scenic route and charged us $35. On the way back, the hotel got a limo for us which arrived early, was very comfortable and we got to the airport in 10 mins in comparison with 30 mins on the earlier trip and it was only $25! The first taxi driver said he didn't know where the hotel was, put the address in his sat nav and then didn't ask it for the route - and we went via Fenway Park which is out of the way.

Since we were just passing through, we only rented a single room for the 4 of us (two double beds). The room was average-sized for a city hotel room (spacious by European standards). The beds were very comfortable - there was also a desk and sitting chair in the room, and a decent sized tv. We did not have wireless internet in the room. There was also a mini-bar/snack drawer. The room was perfectly clean. The closet was weird enough to bear mentioning. It had an ironing board mounted in it and at least once the ironing board attacked us as we opened the closet door. It was odd because between the ironing board and the safe, there was almost nowhere to hang your clothes. This did not matter to us but it would matter to a business traveler I suspect. The bathroom was quite spacious - a single room with commode, double sinks, and shower. There was no tub, just a walk-in shower. The shower had no door (just a curtain), its floor was just slightly slanted down and away from the bathroom floor so water drained naturally - but we still had a hard time keeping the water in the shower and so had a perpetual puddle on the tile outside the shower. Nothing a towel couldn't soak up. The main thing to note about the bathroom (besides the snappy leopard print chenille bathrobes, available for purchase) was that the floor was freezing. I mean c-o-l-d. Uncomfortably so. Bring slippers! We asked housekeeping for extra towels which she doled out generously so we had a little towel path running through the bathroom. We went to the Ruby Room for breakfast on the first morning. It was $12 for only a moderately decent buffet. Only my daughter indulged and her review is: \"meh\". I had a cup of tea for $3. Right across the street from the hotel is an Au Bon Pain so the rest of us got our breakfast goodies there - but beware, for some reason that Au Bon Pain is only open Monday-Friday so when we walked over the second morning (Saturday) we were SOL. There is a complimentary wine hour in the Ruby Room late afternoons but we did not partake. Apparently dinner is served in the evenings but we were never there to check it out. The hotel location is awesome. You are right down the street from the Garden (Fleet Center or whatever it is called these days) if you are there for a Celts or Bruins game you are in good shape. You are also easy walking distance to the North Station T stop. You can easily walk (4 blocks) to Fanueil Hall, Quincy Market - heck you're even closer to the North End where there is GREAT italian food (we ate at G'Vanni's and LOVED it). There had just been a snowstorm the day before we arrived and we're still calling these easy walks. There are lots of cool bars and restaurants within a block of the hotel. We had a few pints at a pub just two doors down from the hotel - I can't remember the name! - but it had a nice atmosphere and good beer on tap and very friendly bartenders. Also, around the corner is a bar called The Fours on Canal Street (greatest sports bar for Boston fans - [--]) where we had lots of fun, good beer, good service, and all those friendly fans. We also grabbed some good old fashioned Boston pizza at Half-Time (also around the corner from the hotel). All in all, we would definitely recommend the Onyx.

We had never been to Boston, and I booked this hotel because it looked like something different than your typical franchise hotels, I thought it would make our trip special, and memorable. We booked our room through the hotel, and we had a king bed room, their most simple room. We were planning on doing a lot of sightseeing, and thus not spending a lot of time in our room, so we didn't see a point in getting a fancier room. Before our trip we had some plans of what we wanted to do, but I still wanted to talk to someone to get an idea of the best tourist attractions to see in Boston. I decided to call the hotel concierge to get his opinions. I was so delighted to talk to him, he was very patient, gave us a lot of great tips, and spent about half an hour with me on the phone. He even informed me that we could book Boston Trolley Tour Tickets at the hotel, which we did. Upon arriving at the Onyx we were greeted by the valet, it costs $38 per night to park at the hotel, and it takes 25-30 mins to get our car out of the garage. The valet helped us with our luggage, and we were checked into our room in about 2 minutes. My first impressions were good, the hotel was clean, trendy looking, and had a nice vibe, however, the lobby is very small, so if we were to have checked in during a busy time we would have been quite cramped in the lobby. When we entered our room, it was reminiscent of the lobby. Decorated in red, black and white colors, and had a very trendy vibe. I liked the decor very much, it was very different. The room was very small, my husband was not happy about that, but I found the room to be very cosy. The minibar was great, and they had a lot of great items in there. We were also very easily able to log into the hotel internet, that was a big help for us, and we were very pleased to have it. The room was very clean, and the bed was super comfortable, although I did wish that we had an extra blanket. The TV worked well, and had all the typical channels. The bathroom was also very nice, and they had Aveda products in there. The shower was ok, the water pressure could have been better, and it wasn't very clean, that really bothered me. Otherwise there were plenty of towels and the fun robes were great! One other downside about the hotel was that we could hear a lot of noises within the hotel. Our room was near the elevators, and we could hear them open, we could hear people walking in the halls, and we could hear people in adjacent rooms. On the whole we liked staying at this hotel, we loved the location, its close to everything. In addition, the staff was wonderful, they will bend over backwards to makesure you're happy. The service is quick, and friendly. Actually, we wanted to go see the Blue Man Group, and the front desk clerk tried to help us get tickets, and I also got cold, one night, so I ordered another blanket, it was in our room in 10 minutes. A side tip, we ate breakfast in the Ruby Room, it was $13 per person, and they added 18% gratuity, and I thought that was a lot considering there wasn't really a waiter who waited on us, its a [--] buffet. We ended up spending over $30 for our breakfast, which I thought was a total rip off, they had the cheap run-of-the-mill scrabbled eggs, cold hash browns, and then everything else was continetal. I was not impressed. We did not eat there again. I would highly recommend eating at a diner, or even Burger King around the corner. Also, there were a few homeless people around, and that was good, and the hotel is a bit off the main roads.

If you like art deco style, you'll love this. The rooms and bathrooms were immaculately clean. The only drawback of this hotel is location. It is a good 20 minute walk to Downtown Crossing and the neighborhood at night is less than savoury, with alot of undesirables wandering the streets. There are very few places in the location to eat, with many of the local bars closed down. There is a 7/11 on the corner of Portland St., but again we avoided it at night.

This is a very limited option in the hotel. They have a smaill restaurant and bar and small gym and that is it. You really do get a cramped feeling here. My other pet peeve was the Front Desk was also where guests went to ask for directions, reservations, etc. The efficiency of the hotel would be greatly enhanced by moving the concierge position elsewhere. I waited in long lines to check out and check in when this could easily have been streamlined. The guest rooms are nice but again very smail.

The staff greeted us and was friendly. We took our own luggage to the room, and were not offered assistance. We stayed in room #402. Please beware; the room is nicely appointed, but very small with a view of the next wing of the hotel. The major issue was the noise. We had to listen to a constant, humming and chugging noise, all day and night, and also a rushing water sound. When we commented to the front desk, they acted surprised. I am sure we were given this noisy room because of the booking through Priceline. Please DO NOT use the concierge for any assistance with restaurants and bars. We asked her for an upscale bar, with 30-40 year olds, for a pre-dinner cocktail.

They also have a free computer with internet for your use in the basement next to the mini gym/workout room. This was perfect so I could login and print my boarding pass. They also have a free happy hour in the lounge downstairs. The location was fabulous literally across the street from the Fleet Center and walking distance to Fanueil Hall and Quincy Market.

Adorable little welcome bowls for em with bones and kibble...too cute. We also had an early check-in with no problem. Beautiful lounge/sm. restaurant in lobby, very stylish, very expensive.

I really still like the large hotel with a big lobby and even a pool which this hotel lacks. But we got an excellent price for a beautiful hotel. Everything was very luxurious and rich feeling. The mattress and pillows were heavenly and the fluffy down comforter made you want to stay in bed suggled up all morning. Everything was definately clean and I did not have any problems at all. The staff was very kind and helpful. Anything we wanted to know, they answered it quickly. The valet parking is a little expensive to me $32 a day...but that's the going rate in Boston. There is NOWHERE in that area to park at night so even if you are lucky like we were to get metered parking in the day you have to have your car off the street by 2 a.m. or you will be towed. So valet is your only choice. I would say it is convenient to have your car brought to you, but you really don't need it. It is more of a hassle to drive and find parking than to walk or take the T. But when we did ask for our car they got it immediately and brought it right to the front door. There is a free wine hour from 5-6 which is really nice. They have red and white wine. The Ruby Room is really pretty and a nice place to relax. We enjoyed the wine on our first night but forgot about it on our second night. It was one of the highlights in my opinion. As for location. Some people have commented that it is not in the best area. We did not feel this way. It feels very safe, even at midnight.

The hotel is in a pretty good location - only a few blocks to walk before you are on the freedom trail, about halfway along the route. The hotel itself doesn't look like much from the outside. When walking into the lobby, I had to do a double-take and wonder if we'd come in a back door or something. The hotel's bar is front and center and the check-in is off to the side. It was nice looking, but a bit odd. Not much of a lobby. I personally enjoy walking into a fancy lobby at a nice hotel, and felt that this was lacking. The check-in staff were so friendly I was amazed. I would have to say this is the most friendly and helpful I have ever experienced in a hotel. I was very impressed. The room itself was small, but very nicely decorated and very modern looking. It had a cozy feeling to it. The bathrooms were also very modern, and the shower had a curving shower rod, which kept the shower curtain from getting too close to you while showering. There was one patch of carpet in the entryway that was fraying, which gave the feeling that the hotel was getting a bit worn, but everything was definitely very clean. The hotel emailed me a survey, which I completed, and noted that my only disappointments were the frayed carpet and the lack of a nice lobby. The following day someone from the hotel had emailed me back to thank me for the feedback and said they were checking into the frayed carpet to have it replaced. That impressed me also - that they care about the comments they receive.

I generally stay in the Back Bay, but wanted to explore a different part of the city and the Onyx was a perfect place from which to do so. About the hotel-- Service--Excellent! Very attentive front desk staff (evening) who were more than willing to call the restaurant to let them know we were coming. Decor/Quality--The rooms were well appointed and the smallish size didn't bother me. However, the public areas of the hotel (lobby, bar, hallways, etc.) seemed cheap or \"faux luxury) and not up to Kimpton standards. The lobby has an awful drop-down foam tile ceiling and the bar area leaves much to be desired.

It is walking distance to North End and some of the best Italian food in the US. But they are in a neighborhood that is making a comeback so there are some rather scary looking people around.

The in room yoga is a nice idea but you would have to stand on the bed to do it since there is just enough room to walk around the bed in the room. The fitness room was great if minimal; treadmill eliptical and exer-bike. We both used it at different times and got the impression that very few people actually take advantage of it.

I nearly slipped and broke my bum on the shower and immediately asked for a shower mat (I am sure that somehow makes me an old biddy, but I continue) explaining to the front desk that I fell in the shower (one would think that would scream lawsuit and they would rush a mat right up).

Its a good thing we didn't miss our reservations. Just a heads up, when you order the Proud to Be In Love package (includes rose petals and champagne) for more than one night...the rose petals are a one time thing on your date of arrival. They charge the same rate for sure, but you don't get the petals on the following nights. I don't understand that, as a matter of fact, the front desk personnel didn't understand that either.

The meeting was at the Marriott Copley Square, and attendees were getting a very good rate and that is a central part of Boston. However I wanted to try a smaller hotel and had heard of Kimpton, and one of their ads says they try to cater to the woman business traveler (did not experience that at this hotel) I checked the Kimpton Web Site, Expedia as I always do, and noticed that if one wanted to join the Kimpton Frequent Guest club and earn points and free nights, that one could NOT get this if you went through what they termed a website such as Expedia, Priceline etc. So I paid rack rate, not the hotwire or priceline as some writers in this review have stated. If I had paid 150 or around that, I would have felt better perhaps at my experience at this hotel. Will agree with some of the other reviewers. Service: Great Bellman, and good car valets, but front desk was from fair to good to terrible. Front desk was Not CONSISTENT IN SERVICE and in many cases they had 2 to 3 people standing behind the tiny checkin that were not doing a thing, other then just standing there chatting. Agree after looking over the Continental Breakfast it just was so so and not worth the money. Agree that the area is still part gritty and there were derelicts around the place, which was a bit dicey, being a female traveler walking by herself. Also had the same experience, when on my one free night, asking for a dinner suggestion, that they suggested Legal Seafood and that was it. My only request from their reservation service was for a smoking room. The front desk person, even though there were 3 people, apparently did not notice what was on the reservation, and upon arriving in my room, noticed the non smoking signs. Out of courtesy to future guests, I will not smoke in a non smoking room. Since it was time for their wine hour, I went down to the lobby, had a glass and met a few other guests, and asked how they liked the hotel. One couple said, neighborhood a bit soso, cute room, liked the price they got on line ($100 a night less then me) So I went to the front desk, it was only 3 feet away and politely asked if I could be switched to a smoking room. Like one of your reviewers, I was told they were sold out. So I pointed out that I had paid full rack rate, unlike the couple I had spoken to, and since smoking is not allowed in any restaurants, meeting areas, bars, and the only place one could smoke would be one's guestroom, if they could not do this, I would be checking out, all of a sudden they found me a smoking room. I liked the new room, it was much bigger, since my first room was the smallest in the hotel, this was at the end of the hall and quiet. My shower did take 3 minutes to get hot water, and I tried 3 different times of the days I was there, and it always took a while to get hot water. Would I stay there again, not sure. Like the small hotel concept and I have stayed at other boutique hotels before and liked them better then this. Would like to try another Kimpton. Had really been looking forward to this, but paying full rate with such a small Kimpton (bar is also the restaurant) the spotty service and neighborhood as it is at the moment, would give this 3 stars instead of normally 4 or 5.\\", "Date": "October 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flushing, NY", "Title": "\u201cOnyx is a Mixed Bag\u201d", "Author": "Ruffian42", "ReviewID": "UR3898318", "Content": "Just returned from my first stay at the Onyx and my results were mixed.

Some examples: * upon check-in, I inquired about high-speed internet service and was told that an ethernet bridge was recommended for the connection I needed, and that one would be brought up to my room right away. I waited an hour and 15 minutes, and not another word about it. I then called and it became apparent that someone had forgotten, so I requested it a second time and I eventually did receive the ethernet bridge. * myroom came without (1) a room service menu, and (2) a \"do not disturb\" sign. After pointing this out when I attempted to order room service, I was told that they didn't have any more room service menus....which seems odd to me. I was told that they'd deliver a \"do not disturb\" sign.....which they did, finally, on the fourth day of my five-day stay and after multiple requests (a few times I had to deal with housekeeping bursting in the room while I was showering or getting dressed). *Voice mail in the room didn't work. On several occasions, colleages left me messages but the message light didn't go on until the next day, for some unknown reason. Some messages that were left by a co-worker in an adjoining room never came through at all. Thank goodness for cell phones, or else I would be unreachable. I reported this issue as well, but it was never fixed. Only the message light on one of the two phones in room worked at all. *several times, I had people call me to tell me that they had to make several attempts to reach me in the room (either they were transferred to the wrong room or a different department of the hotel). *on the day that I was to check out, I learned that I needed to stay an extra day for the meeting I was attending. I confirmed via the hotel's website on my laptop that rooms were available at the same rate that I was paying, so I called downstairs to ask to stay an extra day. The individual I was connected to told me rather brusquely that it wasn't possible to extend my stay as the hotel was \"fully booked.\" I then pointed out to him that I had actually just checked online, and there appeared to be rooms available, and if it was easier I would just book the room online He then quickly responded with, well, um, okay I just checked with my supervisor and we can accommodate you. I actually laughed out loud.....his response took about two seconds, and clearly he hadn't checked with his \"supervisor.\" All I can figure is that he told me the hotel was full because I was receiving a discounted rate.....in any event, it was really rude, and laughable, when he then tried to cover his you-know-what by pretending to ask a supervisor about availability. I would think that the hotel would be trying to accommodate its guests, not brushing them off. *during one of the nights of my stay, a weeknight, I was forced to deal with what sounded like a live band in a nearby bar, going on full blast until well after 1m. Not the sort of thing you want to deal with if you are traveling on business and you need to wake early. I don't fault the fact that there are bars nearby, but I was suprised that my room was SO poorly insulated that it truly sounded like there was a live band right inside my room. Ugh! . *upon checking out, I informed the front desk that a bunch of the calls charged to my phone lacked complete information, i.e., the entire phone number wasn't listed, for some reason. In some places, it just listed the area code, so I had no idea if they were business or personal (makes a difference when you get reiumbursed for one but not the other). I was told that some research would have to be done (?), and that someone would get back to me, so I left my phone number with them since it was clear that they wouldn't be able to figure it out before I left town. After that< i never heard back from them; I had to call them myself about 3-4 times over the course of several weeks just to get someone to clarify my bill. In the end, they weren't able to track down the phone numbers. *Like others have mentioned, I too experienced trying to get someone to help me at the front desk, and the front desk staff seemed to be more interested in talking with eachother than paying attention to whether guests needed help. *Not very knowledgable with respect to recommending restaurants and the like.....the best they could come up with was a chain restaurant (Legal Seafoods, which had its best years in the 80s and is overpriced and mostly geared toward tourists). *I wrote a letter to Kimpton describing some of these experiences, and other annoyances during my stay, and never got even an acknowledgment.

A new boutique hotel little more than a year old, it has all the charm and excellent service you would expect from a Kimpton Group hotel.

The only potential drawback -- the neighborhood surrounding the Onyx is a tad gritty. You are very close to the Fleet Center and the North Station terminal hub -- great for easy access to the T system and the Green Line. That said, this is a neighborhood still on the rise -- and you will not be in the middle of historic Boston. We had no problems, but just don't expect to be walking distance from Newbury Street or other shops/restaurants. That said, you are walking distance from the North End neighborhood.

The hotel was within walking distance of North End, Mass General and the train station. The rooms were small but comfortable. The large bed did not leave any space in the room but the plush bathrobe and the stylish furniture were worth giving up some space. The service was another matter. I had to wait about 15 minutes at the front desk when I checked in because the staff were too busy chatting with each other (frequent occurance). The front desk staff lost a fax that I received. I was disappointed that no one at the front desk could give me any suggestions for a place to go for breakfast other than to eat at the hotel. (Fortunately, the hotel driver was very helpful and gave me a lift to a pretty good diner.) Most disappointing was the staff''s response when I her that I got violently ill after eating an appetizer from the hotel restaurant. I got in late on my last night and was tired but hungry. I was told that I could order food from the restaurant and eat it in my room. I ordered the asparagus spring rolls which were highly recommended. I ate it and got really sick. I mentioned what happened to the person at the front desk at check out early next morning. Absolutely no apology. All I was told was \"that's weird, perhaps I should let the restaurant know.\" I asked to speak to the manager but was told that it was too early in the morning. On top of that, I was charged for the food that made me violently ill. I hope that the lack of experience of the staff will improve since this is the only decent hotel in this part of town. I probably will go back there again, but not for another few years to give the staff some time to learn how provide service on par with the quality of this property.", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodland Hills, CA", "Title": "\u201cLove the Onyx\u201d", "Author": "Balconylove", "ReviewID": "UR3690739", "Content": "My daughter who is studying with the Boston Ballet this summer and I decided to arrive a few days ahead of schedule to acclimate to the East Coast time.

The rooms are tiny, but the bed was huge, the furniture quirky and fun, the room was definitely big enough for sleeping but not much else.

Business travelers usually have to stay in large, impersonal hotels in Boston which are devoid of character and have small and worn rooms and so-so service at not so low prices. Sure enough, my company was going to put me up at the Sheraton Boston (corporate rate of $155). Based on TripAdvisor reviews I knew that my experience there would have been mediocre or, at best, fair. So I shopped around for a comparable rate at a better hotel. I had previously stayed at the Topaz in DC, another Kimpton hotel. That is a fantastic hotel. I figured that if the Onyx was half as good, it would still be a very good experience. I shopped around on the web and found the Onyx for $169 on a discounter's web site; called Kimpton and got a rate match. $169 is a very good value for a mid-week stay at this Boston hotel! I was not disappointed with the Onyx. It had a distinctly upscale feel to it. My room was relatively large by Boston Standards. The decor was bright, contemporary and tasteful. The beds plush and comfortable. CD player and large TV (and lots of satellite channels --but no HBO or Showtime). Gourmet coffee in-room. The room was spotlessly clean. The gleaming black marble bathroom was very stylish (the marble's pretty cold to walk on though!) No sign of wear and tear in the rooms at all (the hotel is very new). It was a treat to return to the room after a full day of work. There was not much else to the hotel...there is a small but very stylish lounge (I did not take advantage of the free happy hour). I'm sure it would be fun to have a drink there. There's not much to the lobby; although it is stylishly decorated, it is little more than a hallway! The front-desk service was impeccable and the staff eager to please. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Faneuil Hall. 2 minutes from the fleet center. 5 minute walk to the North station to catch the T. It's easy to get to all the interesting places in Boston from the Onyx. Tons of eating choices very close by. The cons: the only thing I can think of is that the street the Onyx is on and the nearby Fleet center area are somewhat run-down (vacant office buildings, trash on the street --probably thanks to the clientele of the numerous pubs and fast-food joints, lots of people standing around smoking outside the pubs, several panhandlers near the Fleet center). None of this would deter me at all from staying at the Onyx again though. I wish there was a 4.5 star option...that's what I would give to the Onyx. Stay here if you want a really nice place to stay with good service and well-maintained upscale rooms that have lots of character at not-so-high prices (for Boston).", "Date": "April 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City", "Title": "\u201cHip and Cool\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3303422", "Content": "I stayed at the Onyx during a week-long vacation to the Boston area.
