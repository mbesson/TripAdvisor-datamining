{"Reviews": [{"Content": "As above This is a case where we are all in agreement. Very basic, quite cheap. Staff comically unhelpful and unknowledgable.Good place for quick stop rather than lengthy stay. Bring mosquito repellant. We are not kidding.There is a dreadful underpass you have to walk through (because there is no bus nearby) HOWEVER rail station is very close and great for Florence, Lucca and all points.The tower and Campo de Miracoli are great though and make up for it.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR815092812", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Superfliers"}, {"Content": "Id have rather stayed at home Good facilities but must be the worst accomodation i have stayed in. The tin hut, sorry caravan style accomodation was awful. We could hear the neighbours snore the walls were so thin, the facilities in the accomodation were very very poor, on site they were great. We were greeted by a person who could neither speak Italian or English very well and had to traipse through puddles to get to our accomodation whilst dragging suitcases. It wasnt expensive but compared to room hire in Pisa or Lucca it is a million miles away in quality.I wouldnt stay if you gave me free accomodation!beware, unless you are a nosy sort and enjoy listening to people snore, wash, shower, no provacy at all.", "Date": "Apr 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR212968170", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "thepompeyman"}, {"Content": "Mosquito heaven!!       other bedroom", "Date": "Aug 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR164774225", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "traumatizer"}, {"Content": "camping Italia I stayed here with my son and partner for 5 nights. We rented a room for 3 which turned out to be a static caravan. The caravan was quite small but very clean and very well equipped and the attached outside kitchen was great and also well equipped  you get a decent sized fridge. The pool area was lovely and the restaurant good value.But I had two problems with this place1. There were signs everwhere saying dogs must be on leads which was well observed by everyone except for the campsites own 3 dogs which ran around unchecked in a pack attacking guests dogs, attacking each other and generally causing a nuisance. Staff didn't care one bit. 2. It was so hot and the caravan had no fan or aircond unit which made sleeping at night impossible and the mozzys were having a field day!despite all this i would recommend this place as good value as long as 1. your not afraid of dogs2. you don't go in the middle of the summer!", "Date": "Aug 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR738461038", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "claudinepersaud"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d239399-r16642151-Campeggio_Torre_Pendente-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "239399", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
