For the location, the price was great value. Overall, we did enjoy our stay. I wanted to give it a 3.5 or 4, but it was hard for the following reasons: Pros - Location, walking distance of the harbor, the village Seaport (shopping area and just walking and meandering) and other areas surrounding area (Balboa Park, Zoo and etc...) - Indoor swimming pool, gym and jacuzzi - Breakfast & evening snacks and basic cocktail drinks - Friendly staff - We paid $129/night + tax - for the location and the spaciousness of the room (corner room) Cons - Parking - The \"mandatory valet\" for $29.99 /day is steep and the wait was long (5-15 minutes). I don't mind being charged for parking ourselves, then we can control our own time - Even though our room has been \"remodeled\", the linens were old and the pillows are worn and flat, we had to ask for extra pillows - The sofa bed mattress definitely needs replacing - The bathroom floor didn't seem it was well cleaned and the fixtures were leaky, we had to really tighten to stop hearing the drops - Concierge help were mixed (AM folks were helpful but PM staff couldn't recommend a nice Asian restaurant to us)", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hollywood, CA", "Title": "\u201cHappy Kids, Happy Parents Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A E", "ReviewID": "UR127810992", "Content": "Beware business travelers...parents are in love with Embassy Suites! To all of you parents traveling with children, you must stay at Embassy Suites. It is the perfect hotel situation with little ones. The two room suites are invaluable at 8:00pm when your little ones have gone to bed, and who can beat free drinks at happy hour AND a free breakfast?! Not to mention the indoor pool which provided hours of fun, even at 8:00am when your toddler is ready to swim! Rooms are clean and well-maintained. Definitely spring for a bay view room and request a higher floor for spectacular views.

Our room faced downtown with a partial view of the bay (Midway, cruise ship dock and airport), was on the top floor (12) and had a balcony. The noise was unbelievable. The hotel is 3-4 blocks away from the train station and trains run constantly. You will hear the warning bells clanging all the time, the rush of commuter trains and the loud rumblings and incessant horns from the freight trains - EVEN AT NIGHT. Then add to that the noise of planes taking off and landing. Then add to that the severe echo of all the apartment and condo noise. I turned the fan on in the room and that helped take the edge off at night but I still was woken up several times by outside noise. The last night of our stay I had managed to *just* fall asleep when one of the hotel employees called at 9:50 p.m. (!!!!!) to ask if they could come and fix the lock on our door. I had two children asleep who were woken up by that call. It took me 2 hours to get back to sleep as well (freight train came through, planes were still flying in and out, etc.). I was thrilled to leave the next day and come home so I could finally get some rest. Everything else was standard Embassy Suites. The breakfast was fine (get there before 7:30 a.m.), the concierge was very helpful, there's a Starbucks connected from the lobby. The room was very nice and I did like having the second full sink and vanity in the bedroom, that really helps with bathroom congestion for a family of 4 getting ready.

The only options they have though are 2 double beds in a room and a pull out OR a king bed in a room and 1 pull out. They do not supply cots or mattresses. What a headache for a family such as ours since our boys will NOT sleep in the same bed and my husband is 6'2 and having us sleep on a pullout or a double bed would not work at all. We ended up taking the cushions off of the pull out bed and creating our own little bed for our 11 year old. We were a bit early for check in at 3pm. The lady at the desk told us she couldn't let us in early and to come back at 4. At that time we discussed with her the needs we had as a family. She was quite snotty and rude by indicating we could get a 2 bedroom suite that would accommodate us however the rooms start at $1200 if we were willing to pay that. No kidding this is what she said! So first of all, why is there a spread of $1000 for these rooms. Otherwise why is she suggesting that maybe we couldn't afford the other suite? My husband told her that perhaps we had chosen the wrong hotel and we may look elsewhere to which she replied that there is a cancellation policy with 72 hours notice. GREAT! We came back at 4pm as she told us to only to find a line up beyond belief. The systems were down and the place was chaos. I have to say that the manager was on the floor helping out which was great to see. He spoke with my husband and gave us the go ahead to check out early or if we wanted to find another hotel that he wouldn't hold us to the room booked with them. Reasonable, at least someone was attempting to help with a positive attitude and willing to compromise a solution for our family. Underground valet parking only $32/night. It took up to 60 min to get our vehicle at times and no phone in to the valet was permitted as they were so busy. Understandable, but just sucks when you and your family want to go somewhere and then you're stuck waiting around the lobby for an hour. Wifi fee of $12.95/night PER DEVICE! CRAZY! The manager did agree with my husband that if we added more devices they would comp back the fees. We never added any other devices as the wifi wasn't working anyway and ended up being a waste of money. The breakfast lines were nuts, sometimes taking up to 40 minutes to get to the buffet. The omelet line wasn't even an option for us because it was even longer. When the time came for the breakfast to be over, the stuff was cleaned away and even if you had waited 25 min to get through the line, you were outta luck. The pool is tiny and indoor and cold. Jacuzzi wasn't much better. Although the manager was fantastic in helping us finding solutions to the issues we faced, I still would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. Every time we walked in the place I felt upset and disheartened. I have always been a fan of the Hampton chains, although now, I have a different idea of what it is like to stay at Embassy. We ended up checking out a day early and heading to Arizona as planned for a day later. We were thrilled when we arrived in Scottsdale at The Hyatt House where for the same price per night we received a 2 bedroom suite with king beds and bathrooms in each and a kitchenette and living room with a pull out couch. AWESOME! Breakfast there was amazing with REAL eggs, endless choice of fruits and friendly helpful staff. Beautiful pool and jacuzzi. Boy were we glad we made the choice to leave San Diego Early!

The room was clean, so I think it was the ongoing renovations smell but it gagged me, but I am more sensative to smells then most people. Also,the rooms are not very well insultated so noise travels...not to mention our balcony door didn't close all the way so we heard all the outside noises too. Our bed was extremely uncomfortable and I would have been better off sleeping on the floor. I loved that the pool was indoor, but it would have been nice if they kept the towels stocked- even after several other guests called to get more towels they never brought any, we had to resort to using our room towels. I really dont like the fact that you didn't have a choice regarding Valet Parking or not. For us it was an additional expense we would have preferred not to have. The noise from the elevators was a little more audible then most other hotels as they are very slow moving and during high checkout times the volume in that area is loud to say the least- so I'd recommend a room not next to the elevators.

It was the worst experiences I have had at a hotel at any price level. I travel frequently all over the world for business. This time I was hosting a guest from out of the country and we chose to stay downtown San Diego for the experience for him, but I was very embarrassed by this hotel. This hotel is charging a premium rate and trying to put a premium window dressing on the experience but is completely incapable of executing the fundamentals. Here are the specifics: -- Valet parking is the only option for parking and it is $30. Everything in this area of town is expensive, but still for $30 you would expect good service. It is horrible. It took over 15 minutes to get the car. Furthermore all the cars arriving were stacked up and no one could get in because they were so slow to park them. -- Front desk staff is very rude and slow. We inquired about early check-in and without even checking the reception staff just said nothing was available. Ok fine, but this also meant we could not utilize the business center because although it is next to the front desk it requires a key to enter and we were not allowed to use it until we could be assigned a room. -- WiFi fee is $13/day and there is no free option in the lobby. -- The elevators are slow and it is a long wait for this busy hotel. I finally was checked in and I went to my room on 9th floor only to find my keys would not work. I made my way back to the lobby, waited in line again, they re-scanned my keys with NO apology, I went back up to my room, again the keys did not work. I went back down waited in line again -- 40 minutes wasted. This time they discover OOPS! they had given me the wrong room. They get this straightened out, hand me a key and I head to my room.

Positives - friendly checkin, no line for parking at 5pm on Xmas night. Corner king room with a bay view as booked was great. We booked a Getaway Rate which included free parking, 15% off room service charges and on-demand movie each night. Large bathroom with bathtub (plus when traveling with toddler kiddo). NOTE: All parking is valet and off-site. Valet staff are friendly and very professional. We always felt very safe walking anytime day or night. Starbucks is connected to the hotel.The days we did eat breakfast in the hotel, it was good, hot and great selection. Managers happy hour was good and never overly crowded; na drinks, beer - Michelob Amber Bock and Rolling Rock plus chips, trail mix and veggies for snacks. Negatives - Hotel is in the middle of a re-model or room upgrades. Free full breakfast was a nightmare wait as the hotel was maxed at capacity with number of people per room and rooms taken, due to 2 conferences and the TX/Cal college bowl game that week. Line was wrapped throughout the atrium each morning for breakfast unless you went 7am. This also lead to ridiculous waits for the elevators - there are 4 but it didnt help as one was unavailable due to installation of new flat screens being transported for 2 days we were there. We ended up at the Hyatt one morning and at Busters in Seaport Village (good place) a 2nd morning for breakfast due to craziness. Valet parking was crazy busy since everyone has to valet it can make for long waits between post-breakfast at 930am - Noon checkout time. Negatives -Room service - limited menu due to remodel in progress. Basically, you get your room service food from the restaurant/bar downstairs. Many times the restaurant is so packed at night, they would not answer the phone so I went down and place my orders in person to-go. Overheard the bartender and wait staff talking that they do not answer the phone the last 30 minutes before room service closes. Great location to everything - USS Midway, Seaport Village, Bay dinner cruises and Star of India. TIPS - go across the street to the Grand Hyatt and have a drink or catch the view at the Top of the Hyatt Bar. Top of The Fish Market (upstairs fine dining) or downstairs Fish Market are good places for dinner but its crazy busy downstairs.

The hotel has a very standard, uninteresting breakfast selection, and the manager's reception is basically chips and pretzels. Both were very crowded and had lines.

I live in San Diego, but often take \"staycations\" at local hotels. Upon valet parking the car (it's $29 and there are no other options at the hotel), my significant other and I informed the attendant that it was imperative no one roll down the driver side window, as it was broken. We were assured it would not happen. We arrived at 4 pm (check-in time) and were informed the room was not ready. We were given a free appetizer coupon for the PFC restaurant in the hotel so we could go and wait. I left my cell number with the front desk to call when the room was ready. After over an hour of waiting with no phone call, I sent my S.O. to the front desk to check. After several minutes, he returned visibly angry because the front desk clerk (who was not the one that initially talked to us) had been extremely rude to him because the reservation was not in his name. I finally went to the front desk myself and was checked in by another very sweet girl. It seems strange to me that they would ask for my phone number, and then never call! As per my paid upgrade, we received an 11th floor room with balcony and bay view. It was a wonderful view. But the room was obviously old and in need of updating. Furniture was scratched, I could see pins sticking out of the curtains near the ceiling, the TV remote buttons stuck, and the shower lost water pressure in the middle of a shower. When we left to go out for dinner (it was a surprise birthday dinner for my S.O. so I had privately arranged a taxi with the front desk earlier), the parking attendant recognized and approached us to say that the window on our car had been rolled down and was now stuck half-way down. At this point, we were becoming slightly irate at the continued sub-par treatment we were receiving. After seeing how irritated we were getting, he finally offered to comp us the parking fee. Embassy Suites had pre-arranged a fee for our taxi at $35 to get to Coronado. On our return trip, we discovered the actual meter cost was less than $20. Thanks for the rip-off, Embassy Suites. We could not enjoy the managers reception because 30 people were lined up to get their free drinks, we could not enjoy the complimentary breakfast because the line was wrapped around the corner, and we could not enjoy the pool or jacuzzi because both of them were packed. When we checked out in the morning, the parking fee had not been waived and we had to have a final battle with the front desk about getting the charges removed!

Also across from the hotel is the Aircraft Carrier Museum USS Midway and it's a walking distance to the Gaslamp Quarter.

On most occasions when traveling as a couple we make the Embassy Suites our base. Again on this trip we were not disappointed. Super convenient to the airport and an easy walk to Petco Field, the Convention Center, the harbor attractions, and gas lamp district restaurants. The trolley (and Amtrak) is close at hand. A short drive reaches Point Loma, Balboa Park, SeaWorld, Old Town, and pretty much any other district you would want to visit within the area. True, it's a typical Embassy Suites with families crowding into rooms and reunions and conferences keeping things hopping. But the manager's reception is wonderful, the breakfast is up to ES standards and there's even a Starbucks on the property. Besides, with the double rooms, you can always insolate yourself from the sounds of the atrium activity. One ding, perhaps is the crowded lobby. Some of the somewhat brusque demeanor that staff can exhibit at times probably comes simply from trying to keep people from tripping over each other -- or themselves. We, however, found everyone truly helpful, including the concierge for dinner reservations, and the valet parking attendants who almost always kept, literally, on the run. One special note. When we left for the airport at 4:45 AM, the valet attendant was nowhere in sight. A custodial staff quickly noted the problem and although speaking very little English made clear to us that he would find the attendant for us and within 90 seconds this janitor had the valet located and on the run to assist us. That kind of thorough going service mind set throughout an organization is what makes the difference between a hotel we want to come back to -- or one that we scratch off our lists. Another compliment. There was new furniture in our room since our last visit. Everything seemed well maintained and furnished. One hint. We think it's worth the extra cost to guarantee a bay view suite. The views are incredible and there is no end to the hours that can be spent just watching ships (including aircraft carriers) and boats (the smallest sailboats) plying the harbor approaches. We even think it's worth the premium to ensure a balcony. Be warned, these aren't lounging style balconies with furniture. But they are wonderful standing verandas that you can step out onto in order to enjoy the sea breeze or just to get a better look at a passing ships.

Cozy, warm and inviting and the location is definitely what gives it 5 stars over 4. It's your usual Embassy Suites - which we've grown to love and be comfortable with. The lobby was nicely done with a lovely koi pond (please remove the coins from the water, however, they're poisionous for the fish). :) The rooms are fairly large - 2 room suites (as with most of these hotels) and was nicely set up and quite clean. We did have issues with the bathroom - the faucet to the sink was loose and the shower leaked continuosly - but once we mentioned this to the front desk while checking out, the front desk clerk was clearly horrified and I'm sure it was correctly quickly. (though I wonder why the maid never said anything prior to us to the management or front desk). Anyway, the bed and pillows were very comfortable and the room overall was quite nice. Also, we requested a room with a view and got a nice view of the bay. Note: the hotel is located on a fairly busy street so we also had that view - but the bay made us for it. The smell of the free morning breakfasts was a nice wake up call to me (though my husband thought it was a bit much as it wafted into the room each morning). And the breakfasts were consistantly high quality, fresh and delicious. What a wonderful way to start each morning. Also, the atmosphere of eating in the atrium was lovely - and the staff cleaned up and kept everything spotless. The conceirge was very nice and helpful as well and helped us decide to go to Old Town - HIGHLY recommended!!! It was a great day and a wonderful experience. Another plus of the hotel was the little internet room which housed 3 computers. And, the absolute best pro of this hotel was its proximity to Seaport Village! Located about a block away, this village was amazing and my husband and I went every night. There were tons of cute shops and restaurants and it was truly a great place to walk around and great some fresh air and enjoy the sights of the bay and a fireworks show (on Friday night.) Cons of the hotel were minimal and we'd definitely stay here again. Cons include the $29 a night valet parking (but - it's a city and all hotels have this) -- at least these valets were incredibly quick and quite nice too. The other con was the mild smell in the hotel of old dampness. This likely came from the pool downstairs or the fact that the bay is a block away. Again, it is mild and would not turn us off from returning. Thanks again Embassy Suites for a great vacation! PS - on a side note - we also stayed at the Hyatt in Mission Bay (to get a sense of another part of the city as well as try a more upscale hotel.)

Our room was upgraded to a 2 room suite which was very spacious. The largest part of the room was the dining/wet bar area. It would have been better for our family to have that area be smaller and have a larger living area. With only one chair, we had to make up the sofa bed each day in order to have seating for all 4 of us. Even if we would have tried to bring in the dining chairs, they would not have fit in the small space where we watched TV. A sink and vanity area is located outside of the bathroom in addition to the one in the bathroom. That was especially nice when my son got sick and we were able to designate his area to try and keep the rest of us well. The hotel was clean and smelled wonderfully fresh as you entered the lobby. It smelled a lot like mildew near one of our sinks, but housekeeping opens the windows each day and that helps. Our room was vacuumed at least one of our 5 days there. I still cannot understand why hotel rooms with 4 occupants only get 2 or 3 washcloths, however! We asked for more and they were quickly provided for. The hotel is located next to Seaport Village which has several shops and restaurants. Most of the restaurants are counter type with outdoor eating space only. So, most of the tables weren't very clean and you have to contend with the pigeons. The setting is gorgeous however with several sidewalk vendors from henna tattoos to balloon twisting. A trolley stop is only a 1/2 block away, but we did not use it. Cindy, the concierge in the hotel lobby, gave us the name of a driver who provided round-trip transportation for us to the zoo one day and Sea World the next. We had 7 in our party and the rate was only $20-$25. The breakfast was delicious with several things to choose from. Even our \"no-breakfast eating teenager\" was able to find something he liked. The manager's reception was nice as well. Lots of variety at the bar area. The pool and spa area was your typical hotel fare. There were plenty of towels and seating. I was disappointed that it was an indoor pool, but considering the temps are always so mild and pleasant, outdoors would have been too cold!

I did not expect anything spectacular and anything bad, just a good reasonable comfortable stay with free breakfast. All of my expectations were met. I was able to check in early (before noon) and was given a balcony room by a nice front desk clerk. Only bad thing about the balcony room is that your next door neigbor also have a balcony and can see directly into your bed so you may have to use the privacy curtain. But I will take a balcony room anyday over the standard room. The room overall was typical of Embassy Suites with comfortable bed, roomy seating area with fridge and microwave. Room was pretty clean except the doors to the balcony were little dirty with a lot of fingerprints. I went down to eat breakfast at 7AM (thanks to still on the Eastern time zone). On the menu: Omelettes, scrambled eggs, home fries, bacon, pancakes, yogurt, apple, banana, pastries, cereals, coffee, milk and juices. The qaulity is okay and more than satisfactory for a \"complimentary\" breakfast. The dining area staff were always pleasant except the omelette station cooks who are pokerfaced, probably due to the pressure to move the lines quickly. Talking about the lines, between 7 - 8:30AM appears to be the best time. After that, I noticed the lines got really long for both the omelette and the hot food stations. The manager's reception also brought a long line to the bar. I only grabbed popcorn which was good. I didn't see any hot food items like chicken wings. Location was great as a tourist. You are a few blocks away from the trolley lines and the Seaport Village which I enjoyed for food (except for the price of a Hagaan Daaz milk shake, $8!!). I debated staying more towards downtown (Westin) but I much prefer this location as unless you are right on Gaslamp Quarters area, the other downtown locations are pretty dead and don't really have things to do or character based on my observations. Gaslamp area is very busy with a lot of restaurants/bars, if that is your style. I didn't check out the pool so no comment on that. This area seemed safe with some upscale looking residential condos in the area. I would definately stay here again. Things to note: The commuter train noise some of the reviewers are complaining is overrated. Unless you are really sensitive to noise, it won't bother you. I hate to pay for parking. I rented a car the last day of my stay and found a street parking couple of blocks away for overnight. I just had to feed the meeter at 8am (I think it has a 3 hour limit). I didn't really see restaurants around this area except in the Seaport Village which is nearby. Taxi from airport is about $12 - $13. I enjoyed San Diego Zoo, Balboa Park, Coronado beach.

One piece of advice if you stay here or other Hilton properties is to check to see if they are running a Hilton Honors Points special. I was able to get quadruple points for my four-night stay.

This was my 2nd stay there. We investigated many hotels in San Diego before booking the ES mainly because on my previous visit, I was unable to get up to the Gaslamp District. (I was traveling with my 70 year old Dad for a Marine Corps reunion) After checking many reviews in the District, I happily booked a balcony suite at ES. First, the location of this ES cannot be beat. You can walk everywhere and we only used our car to go to the zoo. Second, the Staff could not be better. We prefer Embassy Suites when we travel because of the room space and hotel amenities. ES - San Diego does not fail in these categories! The breakfast was awesome and the breakfast team friendly. Parking is expensive but that seems to be standard for San Diego. We didn't consider onstreet parking. And we definitely recommend going to Ralph's grocery store a couple of blocks away and if you want a friendly cocktail and \"locals\" bar fun, go to Joe's Crab Shack behind the Convention Center. Both are within walking distance and you won't be disappointed. Concerning the Gaslamp District, we went on a Friday night and found most of the bars to be friendly but unless you really want to pay a cover charge - WALK AWAY and find another bar. We were led to believe this was the norm by the doorman at the place with the mechanical bull and found out that wasn't true. I refuse to pay cover charge unless there's entertainment. Some of the best drinks we found were at the TGI Friday's! Fun staff and great food/drinks. One downside to be aware of and this IS NOT the fault of the Embassy Suites. When walking downtown please be aware there seems to be a large number of homeless in the area. While we were never hassled, the number was surprising. It's a shame but that's the reality of our current economy. Not enough help for everyone. Again - this is no reflection of the ES and we always felt safe walking in the area. Others mentioned old furniture and TV issues. Our furniture in 1105, while not being brand new, was nice and not showing any damage. We had 2 large flat screen TVs that were great. We would like to see a safe added to the room for any valuables. And if you have the opportunity, book a balcony room. Shop around and get the best price possible. The view is incredible and well worth the difference in price. We look forward to returning to San Diego and the Embassy Suites soon. Many THANKS to the Staff for another great stay!

Try the calamari and spicy wings. Sabrina is very helpful. Bring back Turtle Town! Okay, silly complaint, but really had a special spot in our hearts for Turtle Town. This Embassy has nice atrium area with waterways. Used to have a cute area named Turtle Town. Kids always looked forward to feeding the fish and seeing the turtles. Last year due to some salmonella scare they booted out the turtles and fish. Some smaller fish are back this year. Not the same. Don't like the $29 forced valet parking. In the beginning, was able to choose between \"self park\" and valet options. Now have to use VALET. Goes up every year. Also, wish they didn't allow pets in the rooms.

I'm a large-size person and even *I* can walk it easily, schlepping my luggage or not. Not sure why someone would expect a valet parker or doorman to drive them, it's not their job.

At first everything seemed fine - nice rooms, decent location, etc. On the day of our wedding rehearsal, my 86 year old father had not shown up yet to the hotel to check in. He was driving from central California and does not have a cell phone. So, I left a message with the staff at the front desk asking them to contact me when he arrived. Well, hours passed and I never received a call. I called back several times to the front desk to make sure he had not arrived. I was given the room number he was supposed to be in and I called his room several times. No answer. Before we left for the rehearsal to be held at 4:30 p.m., I again went to the front desk, gave them my phone number, and yet again asked them to contact me when he arrived. Our wedding party went to the rehearsal and then on to the rehearsal dinner - still no dad. We called several more times to the front desk to find out if he had arrived. At one point, I was crying on the phone with them because I was so worried about my father possibly being lost or having been hurt somehow since being late is NOT like him. Each time we called, we were told he had not checked in yet. My wedding party began calling the California Highway Patrol, AAA, relatives, friends, etc. to find out what had happened to my father. Needless to say, I was a wreck. When we finally got back to the hotel after the rehearsal dinner, one of my best friends actually got into her car and began driving in the direction my dad would have been coming from. By the way, ten hours had passed since my father had left from home at 11:00 a.m. (for a four to five hour drive). I decided to call his room again. By this time, it is about 9:00 p.m. My father answered the phone!! He had been at the hotel for hours but had been told by staff when he checked in at 4:15ish that I had left already. No call was made to me. No phone number was given to him to call. Each time our party called the front desk to find out if he had checked in, we were told he had not. If any of you out there have gotten married or been part of a wedding recently, you know the stress of just planning this event, let alone having to deal with the emotional turmoil of something like this. When management was contacted, they essentially took no responsibility for this and even suggested my 86 year old father somehow snuck into a room on his own without getting any keys. How he was suppossed to have done this is beyond me, but that is what the night manager, Ms. Willes, suggested. She also claimed my father actually arrived at 2:15 p.m. (impossible even though she claims it is true) and therefore it was the a.m. team's fault and not hers. She had the gall to argue with me on the phone about this on the night before my wedding. The general manager for San Diego, John Smith, actually decided to call me ON my wedding day to essentially confirm what Ms. Willes stated. Thankfully my bridesmaids handled these calls for me since there was no way I wanted my wedding day to be ruined by such lies. Basically, this is what it comes down to: if you actually want decent customer service, don't go to this hotel. They claim to be a full service, upscale hotel, but they can't even relay simple messages. Because of their incompetence and even simple lack of compassion for another human being, my 86 year old father missed his only child's wedding rehearsal and rehearsal dinner. My mother is dead so this was a very big deal to me as well, not to mention I thought that something terrible had happened to my father. The day was RUINED. I can't recommend this hotel to anyone.

The 29 dollar parking fee is not the problem, but the lack of access to the car is. When we commented to the front desk about not having access to the car, we were told it is for security reasons. At 29 dollars a car times 11 stories of guest rooms, the nightly revenue would more than adequately pay for round the clock security for the parking garage.

I was told yes, your reservation is fine. I informed the front desk I was driving down from L.A. and would be there by 10. We arrived at 9:30pm.Our Bay View, Balcony room had been sold by the time we arrived. In less than 3 hours our room had been sold. We were given a room instead with no balcony, a broken TV, and a refrigerator that wheezed like a chain smoker. The next night we were moved to a Bay View, Balcony View right outside the elevators. Starting at 6am on Sunday morning parents in this hotel let their kids run wild. Like to wake up to ringing elevator buttons? Yea, we didn\u2019t either. NOTE: THIS HOTEL HAS ONE OF THE NOISEST INTERIORS DUE TO KIDS RUNNING WILD TO THE ELEVATORS IN THE MORNING, SCREAMING. It is a very loud, very difficult place to feel comfortable in. The rooms have a dated feel to them and our second room had stains for who-knows-what spilled on them \u2013 looked like a major party had gone down in the room. Granted, the hotel did give me a discount of my two nights, a token if you will for completely screwing up my first night\u2019s reservation. Yet the service was still bad, the rooms still looking like they had been through at least five or more fraternity parties and the food so-so. Yes, you save on food with a family yet the lines for omelettes are on average 15 \u2013 20 minutes in the morning. And here is the final straw and why I decided to write this review: Valet parking, $29 \u2013 and for that I get my car delivered on Sunday morning that when I turned on the engine a hard rock station, turned up full blast, blared into our ears.

Everything was what we expected: A clean and spacious two room suite with a re- frigerator, a microwave and two TVs, a friendly and helpful hotel staff, a partial view of the bay and the USS Midway, and lots of kids. After a quick check in and a little freshening up, we walked around Seaport Village, a nice picturesque tourist spot by the bay with shops and restaurants right across from the hotel. Then we went to Manager's reception at 5:30 to relax before we headed to Sea World. My wife had a glass of wine (you can have as many drinks as you can handle). My son and I had sodas and tortilla chips. The last time I visited Sea World was in the 70's, when they still had the water ski show. We saw the sea lion show that night and would see the rest of the shows on our 2nd day. For dinner we had barbe- cue combo (chicken, pork and beef). it was very good and reasonably priced. We bought the 2 day ticket for $52 per person at AAA before our trip. So for the price of admission and what they have to offer, Sea World is better value than Disneyland. The next morning we particularly enjoyed the complementary cooked-to-order breakfast. The hot items included omelet, bacon, sausage, hash browns and pan- cakes. The cold item included cereals, donuts, muffins and assorted fruits, plus tea, coffee, cappuccino, hot chocalate and juice. Most of the guests had their breakfast in the atruiums.

We waited 20 minutes before I approached the front desk and was told that an announcement would be made shortly. Another 10 minutes passed before I approached the desk again.

Very poorly run.\u201d", "Author": "tboneps", "ReviewID": "UR17618915", "Content": "I'll start with the good: Location: Although some on here have complained about the location, it all depends upon what you are doing in the city. The hotel is walking distance to the marina, the seaport and all of its restaurants and shops, Horton Plaza, and the Midway. Yes, you will hear Amtrak. You will hear Amtrak from every downtown location, though. Views: Excellent. Our balcony overlooked the Coronado Bridge and the bay. It was beautiful, and we were able to watch the Fourth of July fireworks from there while the babies slept. It was terrific. Next, the 'mixed bag': Breakfast/Manager's Reception: The included breakfast and reception each evening adds a great deal of value to your stay. On Saturday, we couldn't enjoy either. The lines were wrapped all the way around the atrium, and there were no tables. Lines like that are no places for two year old twins. On Sunday, we knew better and went down to breakfast at 7AM. The lines were smaller, but still substantial. We did get a table and high chairs, though. The food is good, and there are healthy choices. The manager's reception on Sunday was not busy at all. We went down for sodas and some chips. A warning, though, chips and pretzels and drinks are all that is free during the reception. Some very bad pizza was $2 a slice (a decent price), but really inedible. And, the awful: I booked what is called the \"Suite Shopping Package\" after much review of all of the available rates. For our purposes, this provided the best value for our dollar. it was to include: 1. a 'Special Welcome Gift' at check in; 2. a $25 gift card per night to Westfield Horton Plaza; 3. a Starbucks Coffee Mug with a free Starbucks drink, and 4. complementary valet parking with full in and out privileges. The problem began at check-in when they had no idea what the \"Suite Shopping Package\" package was. I find this hard to believe, since it was customized for that particular hotel. If they had no idea, it is very poor planning and training. The person checking me in told me I would be charged an additional 28.99 per day for valet parking. I told her that it was included in the pkg. (and fortunately I had printed off the package details to take with me). She said, OK, I'll take care of that. I told her the other items could just be delivered to the room, but that we planned on using the Westfield gift cards for dinner that evening, so please don't delay it too long. About an hour before we planned to go to dinner, I called down to inquire. Oh, we'll send everything right up. They sent up a Starbucks mug and some coupons for discounts at various Westfield merchants. At this point, I decided to go down to the front desk. It took the gentleman 30 minutes and THREE different trips to 'talk to my manager' to get the gift cards. (Why on earth didn't the manager ever come out and deal with this directly?) Anyhow, I got the gift cards and told the agent that when they determined what the welcome gift is, just send it up. We're travelling with our infant twins, and this was really taking up too much time. The worst part of all of this is that I was made to feel like I was being petty or demanding. I was simply asking for (and I shouldn't have had to do that) what my rate promised me. I really did put a lot of research into the rates, and with the gift cards for dinner, the free coffee, and the free valet parking, this rate was less expensive than even the discount Internet rate. The welcome gift never materialized, and the valet charges - of course - were on the folio. I decided not to pursue the welcome gift, as it was just pointless and very annoying by this time. The valet charges were removed, but - again \u2013 it was yet another trip to the front desk. I would have phoned down to have the charges removed, but the phones in our room did not work on Sunday morning. I reported this from the house phone, but it was never fixed. This hotel has potential, but it is very poorly run. One final item: The swimming pool is on the first floor and just outside the four elevators. The floor in the elevator waiting area was always soaked with water from dripping swimsuits, and so were the floors of the elevators. During my lengthy time at the front desk, I heard two complaints to the front desk about this - including one from an elderly woman whose husband had fallen earlier in one of the elevators. She was told they hear this complaint often but there is nothing they can do. They will put up a 'wet floor' sign, though. Good grief, people. This is California.

We decided that our next visit will be either the Sheraton or Marriott which is in the same area this stay was soooooo disappointing. Too bad I liked embassy suites too, cause of the money we saved on breakfast but after our stay here I rather spend the money. I hope this helps you. For $300 a night and paying for valet parking at 28.00 a pop this should have been a better hotel!", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cGoing downhill\u201d", "Author": "travelgal0808", "ReviewID": "UR15559113", "Content": "I have stayed at this property several times over the last few years and have always liked it, which is why I kept going back. This past trip was a disaster! There was hair on the sheets of both beds when I checked in so I had to have the sheets changed because I knew they weren't mine. Then, I experienced the construction noise first hand. Management should really block rooms that are affected by the construction because it is very loud. I had to pack up all my stuff and have my room moved to another floor. Internet access was choppy at best. A few days later, I had a bad leak in the shower, which they couldn't fix. I intended to just deal with it but not only was the shower leaking bad but when you tried to turn it on, there was no pressure, so I had to move yet again. The third room I occupied had a broken alarm clock and problems with the tv. My keys de-activated, the clothes dryer wasn't functioning properly (took me three hours to dry one load of laundry) and I also had issues with the business center as well. Everyone apologized but at some point, words just didn't seem to help so I involved the manager, who gave me a gift certificate for a future stay. I got the feeling that the staff was so used to apologizing for problems, they really didn't try to address the issues and make the guest feel better about a bad situation. I was so frustrated that I could hold my tongue no longer. I told the manager that if I returned and had a similar experience that I'd rather just not come back at all, but he assured me that my experience was not the norm. I'd like to believe him. It's a shame that it had to get to that point though. I did have pleasant stays the last few times so I may give it another chance after the construction is complete but this past stay was just terrible. In good conscience, I just couldn't recommend this hotel at this time, which is a shame because it's a nice property in a good location.

Plus wanted to add to what I had read at this site prior to traveling to San Diego. Agree...this is probably one of the best hotels I've stayed in while not paying $$$$ for it. I would rate above average to excellent. We really enjoyed our stay. We requested a bayview room...we were given a corner room on the 7th floor with great views of the Seaport Village and Harbor. For the most part...I thought our room was very quiet and private. Our room was clean, spacious, had a bar sink, microwave and small fridge in the galley area. It had a working desk or table in the livingroom for your laptop or if you wanted take-out one night. What I liked about our room was the big huge sink area in the bath AND one outside the bathroom. This way, my husband had one area, I had on area for our \"stuff.\" Yes, there is some very minor evidence that the Embassy is currently renovating their rooms. But I do not think you would notice this unless you are on the upper floors and you are deciding to take an afternoon nap at between 1-3 p.m. We did this one day..there was only a very faint tapping to be heard. The only other way we knew there was some construction going on at this hotel was reading about this on this website and a small discreet sign in the elevator. I have read here and agree...the beds are VERY comfortable and LOTS of really good fluffy pillows. I see complaints were written about the noise of the a/c or heat. I did not notice the noise of the fan more than any other hotel I have been in. Comments on the free breakfast buffet and a happy hour (snacks and drinks). The breakfust buffet is a real value-add considering that eating an equivalent breakfast out might run you about $15pp. Also the Embassy breakfast is probably better than you can get at any Hampton Inn or similar type of hotel that includes a continental breakfast. You can have an omelet made to order...which is more than I have seen offered elsewhere. Now...here's the catch. Get there early if you are aggravated by crowds or people who think that the food will all of a sudden dissappear or that the Embassy will shut down the breakfast area without notice and they will be out of luck. I think you know what I mean. You still get A LOT of people who think that because it's \"free,\" means they can behave as though it is a \"free-for-all.\" The Embassy must have about 7-8 people , possibly more, working the lounge/breakfast area , keeping it clean, clearing tables, and keeping it \"fresh.\" We went about 7:30 daily and it was a bit hectic and somewhat aggravating for us. Once seated and away from the hordes, you can somewhat relax but it is always difficult for my husband and I to relax while watching people act like it is their last meal. We went earlier on our last day and it was pleasant. None of the craziness. I cannot say enough about how polite and courteous the staff and breakfast crew is. Now about the manager's reception: no biggie. We went downstairs to check it out and decided to pass. Well liquor and nachos and some \"freezer\" pizza. Save your calories and don't risk any headaches with the well-liquor. Granted it's a nice idea...but not for my husband and I. There is a charge for WiFi [$9.95 per day]. If you can get by without your own laptop in your room, you can use the business center, internet is free. Okay..so you think that the WiFi charge is a bit much? Well...the Embassy makes it up with the free breakfast. [Go outside and order an omelet and see how much that will cost you! ] I did not experience the connectivity issues that others had commented about. The WiFi worked flawlessly. The pool and jacuzzi is average to small size, but the their gym is a treat with treadmills, elipticals and dumbell weights. One of the nicer hotel gyms I have seen for this class hotel. This hotel is 15 min walk from Gaslamp, 1/2 block from their trolley, 10 min walk to the harbor excursions and Seaport Village. Starbucks is attached to hotel downstairs. Some comments on the hotel's Pacific Fish Company restaurant. The PFC will mostly seat people in the bar area, which is noisy and cold. For some reason the air conditioning is cranked in there. The sushi is mediocre at best. My husband had sushi there one night and it didn't look so hot...kind of amateurish (we eat A LOT of sushi). That made me reluctant to try any of the fish. They have a smoked beef salad which is to die for. The Martha's Vineyard Salad is also very good. The food is overall very good tavern/bar food. Again, service is excellent and waitstaff professional. There are so many places to eat in San Diego that I would say there is no need to add this restaurant to your list as \"must dine here.\" I will say that the restaurant is convenient if you come back in late from a day of touring or whatever and you are too tired to venture out much further. You can get a decent meal. A comment..this restaurant also serves the hotel room service. The prices for room service are at least $1.00 more per item, there is a $3.00 room service fee and they add 19% gratuity to the bill. There is clearly stated on the room service menu. Parking is $28 a day without any in/out fee. Now stop acting like this is a big deal. Guess what ? You are in the city. Parking is expensive ANYWHERE and most of the hotels are charging $25 to $30 a day. [I did all this research before I went.] One note, we are not 100% sure but we think one of the valets possibly scratched our rental. We did notice until the vehicle was at Avis and they pointed it out. That can happen with any valet service, just be aware. One review commented on crazy/rude busboys and valets who were falling over themselves to get tips. We did NOT see this. Again, the valets were all very pleasant and extremely polite...as were the rest of the staff. My last few comments. The train!! When reading the reviews about the Hampton Inn and Holiday Inn Bayside...I got a bit freaked out because people were commenting the fact that you can hear the train all night long. Guess what? We heard the train as well in our hotel. Talking to some locals, they indicated EVERYONE who lives or stays downtown can hear the the train at night. Someone even commented that it is some age old agenda by Amtrak with the City of San Diego. We didn't hear the train Sunday night, but did hear it through the week. We got used to it. So be prepared! I chose this hotel because it was slightly less expensive than the Manchester Grand Hyatt and I wanted a suite style room. I walked over to the the Manchester to check it out. It is A LOT more plush and caters to business people and older traveling couples. You will pay for this though. Also, parking is $30 per day there. But looking at the Manchester Grand Hyatt and relation to the train tracks...I am sure they hear the train at night as well. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at The Embassy Suites...will be returning here. ONE MORE THING: Go to the Fish Market Restaurant (near the USS Midway Museum) and eat at The Top of the Market.

The suite feature is nice, but the sitting area only has a window overlooking the elevator bank in our room (404). The bedroom overlooked the bay and was worth the $314 that we paid for the room (AAA rate). Everything was clean and well maintained in our room (except the air return for the AC made noice). The microwave and fridge are good features, as were the pull out sofa and desk in the sitting area. I loved sitting on the balcony overlooking the bay and Coronoda Bridge. We had a perfect view of Seaport Village from our 4th floor rooms. Housekeeping button on the phone doesn't work. Wonder why they don't forward those calls to the operator?? We enjoyed the free manager's happy hour each evening. Free drinks (mixed drinkis, beer, wine, and sodas). Also free chips and cheese dip. Don't pay $2 for the pizza slices - my son wouldn't touch them either time I bought him a slice (and he loves pizza). A hot breakfast buffet is included in the rate. Pretty decent food. The omelets were not as good as I hoped, but the fried eggs and bacon were very satisfying. Good variety of cereals, pasteries, eggs, meats, and fruits are put out. The coffee was only OK, so I went to the Starbucks attached to the hotel each morning for my fix of caffeine. Don't order from the hotel restaurant - Pacific Fish Company. We ordered dinner at 8:15 pm on a Sunday night (Easter Sunday). It took them 45 minutes to delivery our cold, overcooked dinner. They were out of cheese cake, so we got carrot cake and creme brulee. The carrot cake was \"factory made\" and the creme brulee was overcooked. The crab cakes were made from dry, stringy crab that got stuck in my teeth and weren't worth finishing. The corn salsa was very good. My son wouldn't touch his mac and cheese, saying they were terrible. The ice cream had melted a lot before it got here. And the best part - 20 hours after we put the trays outside of our room they were still there.

The bathroom was extremely dated and pretty dirty. The floor length mirror had mold up and down it and my 5 yr. old son was bouncing off the walls so I was stressed the whole time that he would touch the molding mirror. I shouldn't have to be stressed about something like that.

The trolley runs past the door, so easy access to everything. Evening manager drinks were well managed and nice to finish off the day.

This hotel is at a great location. It's about 8 min walk to Seaport Village where there are lots of restaurants and shopping. It's about a 15 min drive to the zoo and Seaworld. There's a grocery store, Ralph's, that's about 10 min drive from the hotel. The room has a mini fridge and microwave so we bought some milk, juice, and snacks. Also if you're there over the 4th of July or New Year's, ask for the rooms with a balcony facing the Navy ship. There aren't many with a balcony. If you get one (we stayed in room 921), you can see the fireworks from your balcony. The complimentary hot breakfast was very convenient with children. The extra living room was helpful too as we put our toddler in the bedroom with us and our infant in a crib in the living room. That way if one woke up in the middle of the night, he didn't wake the other up. Also one child can nap in the bedroom during the day while the rest of the family can be in the living room. Downside of staying downtown is that parking is only valet for $24/day. That's not including tip, if you desire. Since we were there over the holiday, many times it took the valet service 20 min to pull up our car. You can call ahead from your room most of the time. Sometimes if they were too busy, they wouldn't pick up the phone so it would be a pretty long wait downstairs with children.

We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. This included the men that picked us up (and dropped us off) at the airport in the free shuttle, the man who delivered room service, the consierge, the front desk staff, and the woman that helped me carry my tray at breakfast while my toddler tugged at my body. The breakfast has a wide variety of items and you are able to have eggs prepared to your liking. There is also a free manager's reception in the evening. Our suite was on the large size. It was a corner unit and I believe these may be bigger than the other rooms. It had a king size bed in one room and in the other room our son slept on the pull-out sleeper sofa. There is not much to the kitchenette area. The room itself could use a little updating (some wallpaper was hanging off the wall and the style was slightly dated.) Overall, it was very clean just a little boring decor. The room definitely had the feel of a business hotel. Besides recommending the room to someone visiting San Diego on business, I would recommend it to a variety of other people as well. There certainly were plenty of families visiting the weekend we were there. The location is very good for exploring downtown. Across the road is the village area with shops and restaurants, marina and aircraft carrier. The convention center is close by. It took us about 15 minutes to walk to Petco Park and it was pretty much a straight line. The dowtown train is easy to catch and makes exploring other areas like Old Town really easy. You can also walk to get the amtrak and coaster trains to North County. Since the trains pass nearby all of these downtown hotels you may want to keep your windows closed at night. The location of the hotel was really good if you don't have a car. I believe it is $25. a day to park your car. The indoor pool appeared nice but small and I did not see anyone using it.

As we reloaded our suitcases back on the cart, another bellboy appeared. He just stood there claiming the cart until we were done. It was quite uncomfortable for us. A hotel customer should have a choice as to whether they need assistance with their luggage. The carts should be available with the room just like the pool, fitness center and other amenities. We wondered if they had a shortage of carts and that's why the bellboys were so aggressive, but as we ate our breakfast sitting across from the gift shop, we watched the bellboys wheel the carts in and out of a locked room filled with carts. The bellboys just want to make those tips whether it makes the guest uncomfortable or not. The hotel itself has a beautiful view, nice breakfast & manager's reception, but small pool.

I decided to stay at the Embassy Suites Downtown after extensive research, and I based my decision on location, price, and amenities. The location was good, across the street from Seaport Village, the U.S.S. Midway, and about six blocks from the Gaslamp District. The walk to the Gaslamp District seems safe (which was important to me, since I was a 25-year-old woman traveling alone), although I only walked it before sunset. There are fewer pedestrians the closer you get to the hotel, but the area seems safe and frequented by locals taking their dogs to the dog park I passed. Technically you could walk to the zoo and Balboa park (apparently it takes about 45 minutes), but since my ankles were giving me problems I took a cab, as recommended by the hotel\u2019s concierge. It was convenient, but expensive. It was about $12 each way. This might be more worthwhile if you aren\u2019t the only one in the cab like I was. The price for my room (I paid about $230 per night, including tax) is expensive for one person, but would be a great deal for a family, especially with the complimentary breakfast. I had good experiences both days I ate breakfast in the lobby. The lobby is pleasant to sit in, decorated in foliage and goldfish ponds. The size of the breakfast area is the biggest I\u2019ve seen in a hotel that serves a free breakfast; usually I have to fight for the toaster and squeeze around other bodies standing around trying to get their food. Not so here. And the selection was very good with hot items like pancakes and eggs, donuts, cereal, toast, bagels, hot chocolate, juice, and fresh fruit. Not being a coffee drinker, I especially liked the hot chocolate that is machine brewed and comes out frothy, plus they provide cinnamon, vanilla, and creamer to add to it (maybe it was meant for the coffee, but oh well). Lastly, I was so surprised by the good service of the employees manning the breakfast! Both days someone asked me if I had everything I needed. On the second day I asked the lady for another box of cereal and milk, and she brought it right out so I could continue reading the paper. The room is large, and for one person felt luxuriously spacious. I liked being able to lounge on the couch or in bed to watch TV, and I\u2019m glad the window opened to let in fresh air. There\u2019s a vanity with sink outside the bathroom in addition to the sink and counter space in the bathroom. Overall I felt safe staying here. I was never impressed by the service or friendliness of the front desk employees, but everyone else I encountered were more professional (like the housekeepers and the bellboy). The biggest annoyance I encountered is that they\u2019re remodeling the fitness room to make it bigger, and the noise of the construction (which they start around 10 and continue until about 4 or 5) was super loud! My room was on the same side of the hotel as the construction\u2014but six floors up! And I could hear the construction as if it were just one floor below me. One afternoon I returned to the hotel for a nap after a busy morning, but I found the noise was so bad that I asked the front desk if I could move rooms or something so I could get some rest. As I said before, none of the front desk employees impressed me much at all, but I do give the girl a tiny bit of credit for finally offering me earplugs, which I accepted. On the bright side, a larger exercise room will be good for future guests, since it was inadequately small before\u2026but I wish I could have used it myself and that it wasn\u2019t so noisy through the day.", "Date": "May 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cSatisfied in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "elasticgirl", "ReviewID": "UR7407717", "Content": "My husband, myself and our two kids ( 2 & 6) stayed her April 6-14.

The bar area had a sink, microwave, refrigerator and a large table. The windows opened enough to let some fresh air in. When traveling with children a complimentary breakfast is a must have amenity. The variety and quick and efficient service was much appreciated. The earlier you go the less crowded it is, but even then you don\u2019t have to wait too long. The eating area was clean and offered two points of interest to the kids. First are the well fed fish in the ponds and then the turtle house where you can see the occupants taking a sun bath before diving in to join the fish. We ordered room service several times and while it wasn\u2019t outstanding my kids ate the chicken tenders and mac and cheese like it was their first time. The sushi and sandwiches are good choices. I do agree the front desk staff is not very friendly or helpful but the concierge and the valet parking attendants are great. One valet even ran back to my car (which he just parked) to get my cell phone and delivered it to my room. Very nice. Two complaints: there are only two washers and dryers in the entire hotel; two are on the 11th floor and two on the 12th floor. There are no change machines and often the soap dispenser (only one on 11?) is empty which means a trip to the lobby. This also meant NUMEROUS trips between floors checking for availability. The pool area often lacked dry towels and the chlorine was an eye killer. Very strong, but I guess that\u2019s a good thing in a hotel pool. The location was fantastic, right across the street from Seaport Village( try the carousel), a couple blocks from the USS Midway and Maritime Museum( five kinds of sailing vessels you can tour, not crowded and kid pleasing). We had friends staying at the Marriott who were awakened every hour by passing trains. We slept like babies.

The bathroom cabinet and the furniture had huge dents and nicks which where so obviously painted over. In addition to this, it took 2 calls to maintenance before they finally came and repaired the handle on the bathroom door which was about to fall off. The beds where small (full size) and no attempt was made to make them even look inviting.

I was still somewhat unsure of my decision but told myself to wait and see and keep an open mind. I was pleasantly surprised and the hotel was great. The hotel itself was nice and open and the front desk and bell staff were very friendly and accomodating. Our room was not ready upon arrival so they gladly secured our luggage so we could walk around the area. We arrived back after a few hours and rested in the lobby area before deciding where to go next as we did not expect our room to be ready yet. Just before I was about to ask the front desk how much longer until our room was ready, one of the bell man came up to me with our room keys in hand and told us we were all checked in and our room was ready. That was very nice and unexpected. The room was large and very clean. You could tell that this room had been recently updated with new carpets, new furniture, flat-screen TVs and bedding. We traveled with 2 teenagers and it was nice for them to have their own space in the living area with the fold out couch, which was comfortable enough. Our room with a king size bed was nice, the bed was comfortable and the bay view balcony was wonderful. If you get a room with a bay view, you don't hear the train noise very much. It was nice to have the refrigerator to be able to stock it with drinks and the microwave for bringing leftovers back to your room. The location was great for shopping and hanging out downtown, walking distance to the Horton mall and Seaport Village. It is also a nice walk to/from the Gaslamp area. A few times we took a $4 taxi ride to dinner downtown to save some time but otherwise walking the 15 minutes isn't so bad. The location is ideal for taking the trolley. There is a trolley stop one block away and the Plaza train station is a close walk also. We took the trolley one day to Tijuana and that was very easy, the trolley is also a fun way to get around even for a few blocks down to the ball park or convention center.

Overall, it did not wow us - it was just okay and a decent value for the money. We liked the space that having a suite provided, but the room and bathroom were really in serious need of updating. We had a bay view and during two nights of our stay, we saw a huge fireworks display from a barge right outside our window - a nice surprise. The breakfast was great, but the cocktail hour was pretty weak. Bargain brand choices for drinks and potato chips as the snack. The valet parking worked out fine; our car was always waiting for us after we called ahead. Our toilet broke twice and both times maintenance responded quickly. We asked advice from two different concierges and got bad advice from both. One gave us a terrible restaurant recommendation (Harbor House in Seaporte Village) and the other consierge was very negative on two occasions about some of the things we wanted to do (all tourist destinations). We decided to ignore him and had a great time doing what we wanted to do. One of the biggest downfalls of this hotel is no outdoor pool area. That is hard to believe in a city with such perfect weather. We had a fabulous dinner at The Top of the Market at the Fish Market. It is about a 10 minute walk across the street, next to the USS Midway. The location is convenient to everything, but next time, we will likely try someplace that is updated with more amenities and an outdoor pool.", "Date": "September 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cNever again\u201d", "Author": "SOMA_nomad", "ReviewID": "UR5689274", "Content": "I rarely say never, but I will NEVER STAY AT THIS EMBASSY SUITES EVER AGAIN!

The loud and drunk female visitor (not even a hotel guest) finally left @ 6AM. The previous guest (June '06) was right about the trains. We were on the 10th floor and our balcony faced the Grand Hyatt and Seaport Village, but the LOUD train came by late at night and early in the morning during our entire three nights stay. We were also charged for a movie that we never watched. The desk clerk indicated that we watched 28 minutes of the movie and she could not take the charge off of our bill. Upon check-in, the desk clerk told us that, as hotel guest, we would receive a 10% discount at the onsite restaurant. We ate there twice, and charged it to our room, but the discount was not applied to our final hotel bill. My wife called and the desk clerk said that she could not amend the discount to our bill, but would offset it by removing one of the daily valet charges.

When we travel with the kids, we usually opt to stay at an Embassy Suites because they are typically set up to comfortably accomodate families, from the layout of their suites to the complimentary breakfasts. The Embassy Suites in Downtown San Diego was no exception. We enjoyed our stay here. The staff were all friendly and professional; the concierge, in particular, was very helpful in giving us ideas for restaurants and places to visit. The way the the hotel is laid out is also a big plus: all the rooms open up to the atrium - you don't have to go thru any dark hallways to get to your room. The only drawback for us was that there weren't very many decent restaurants within short walking distance (we weren't impressed with any at the Seaport Village across the street); both Horton Plaza and the Gaslight district are about a 15-20 min walk from the hotel, but having 2 kids, it's not a journey that I'd like to make at night. The onsite restaurant, the Pacific Fish Company was a disappointment. There are 2 separate parts of the restaurant, housed across the hall from each other - one side is the casual sushi/sports bar and the other is a full-service restaurant. We ate at the full-service one. I think we would've been better off eating in the more casual sports bar (I believe that the menus are slightly different). We weren't impressed with any of the dishes that we ordered -they were bland, not to mention overpriced for what you get. The wait staff, although earnest, got a couple of our orders wrong. Truth be told, we enjoyed the food at the complimentary breakfast buffet better. Despite the restaurant misses, if we make another trip to San Diego, we will more than likely stay at the Embassy Suites again.", "Date": "July 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cNot as great as 3 yrs ago- train whistles by at 2AM!!!\u201d", "Author": "78traveler", "ReviewID": "UR5370932", "Content": "I just got back from 3 nights at the Embassy Suites at the San Diego- Downtown. I stayed at this hotel 3 yrs ago for a conference at the convention center and I loved it! So when I went back to San Diego for vacation this year I figured I might as well stay where I knew I had a good room. The room was nice, although it wasn't as nice as remember last time, the bathroom lighting wasn't that great, infact I found the bathroom to be pretty dark. The bed was very comfortable, however it was hard to get a good nights sleep when a freight train whistled by at 2AM the first night!! Then 11PM the two following nights. Our city view room was one of the few with a balcony so I am sure that made the sound even more intense since we had sliding glass doors. When I complained to the front desk they told me that I shouldn't hear the train because I was on the 9th floor!!! YEA RIGHT!! I felt like the train was next to me, I could even see it from my room when I looked out at the train tracks and since it crosses over a lot of streets when it come through downtown it whistled a lot! All in all the room was a good deal because you get a suite and a full breakfast. The $22 to valet the car (the only choice) wasn't as pricey as other downtown hotels. And the ability to walk to the marina and the shops was really nice. With the full breakfast we were able to fill up in the morning and then just get a late lunch- early dinner, so that was nice. If you are going to stay at the Embassy Suites ask for a marina view room, that way you probably won't hear the train.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clinton, MS", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience...lots of extras\u201d", "Author": "msucheer", "ReviewID": "UR5148934", "Content": "I just got back from a week long stay at the Embassy Suites downtown and I couldn't have picked a better place to stay for the value.

We had our own \"reservations\" about this ploy but were glad we made them because when we checked in, the hotel was fully booked. Three days before our visit, the hotel concierge telephoned not only to confirm our reservation but to inquire whether there was anything she might do. Being a Hilton Honors member paid off here! In addition, our room was ready when we checked in at 2:30 (normal check-in is at 4:00). Although there is a $22 parking fee, the in and out privileges and the promptness/courtesy iof the valet staff more than compensated. In fact, when we first arrived, Albert promptly escorted us and our bags to the front desk and within minutes we were looking at the bay and Coronado Bridge. Wonderful! Drinks at 5:30--7:30 with accompanying niblets. The Greek Taverna, enthusiastically recommended by our Concierge turned out to be OK--tentative service but good drinks and wines available. Mopussaka was so-so (bland) but the lamb was excellent. Enough to bring back to the hotel to warm up for lunch! Breakfast was quite good. True, the orange juice must be poured into styrofoam containers and the coffee mugs are plastic, but this prevents broken glass and theft. An outstanding addition to the breakfast scene was the cappuccino machine with latte, hot chocolate, and of course cappuccino. The area was well maintained with pleasant staff constantly cleaning and replacing food. New flat screen TVs were welcome although a CD system would have been nice. A final note: driving in downtown San Diego is a breeze compared to anywhere in the North Bay. Also, our concierge meticulously mapped out directions for negotiating exits and locations.
