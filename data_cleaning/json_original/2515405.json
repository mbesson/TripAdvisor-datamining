The hotel itself is not really a SeaTac property; rather, it's located near a large mall ringed by other hotels that is in the vicinity of the old Longacres race track (Renton). This particular hotel has an atrium configuration (rooms face into a large open area), with a large seating/dining area at the base. Overall, the public areas (reception, atrium, pool & exercise room) of the hotel were modern and well maintained; there is an on-site restaurant, but we never used it. As for the rooms, they are large and include a \"living room\" area (w/couch, chairs, table, bureau), a wet-bar area (w/fridge, sink, microwave, coffee maker), an average bathroom and a separate bedroom w/door (we had two queen beds, large closet, iron & board); flatscreen TVs were located in both the bedroom and living room areas. The room was clean and in a pretty decent shape; there were a few minor things indicating that the room needed minor maintenance (a mirror w/some loose trim, a caster from a rolling bench that was broken, scratches on the bathroom cabinets), but nothing that would prevent me from returning to this property. A few quirks (both positive and negative) to note: 1) Parking is ~$10/night. As this is not really SeaTac (nor downtown) and there is a huge parking lot adjacent to the hotel, this seems a bit tic-tacky for a mandatory \"fee.\" However... 2) The free breakfast is worth ~$10 and is significantly better than the usual \"free Continental\" sort of deal you typically get. They offer what I would describe as a \"Denny's type\" breakfast (eggs, omelets, bacon, sausage, pancakes) in addition to breads, fruits, yogurts, cereals and various drinks...all of it included and as much as you want to bust a gut with. We found ourselves eating large breakfasts and then skipping lunch...so the breakfast outweighed the parking penalty in our case. And finally... 3) Free drinks at 5:30! Actually, this is a \"Manager's Welcome\" sort of deal...whereby you can go to the little bar in the atrium and have a couple of mixed drinks, beer or wine and popcorn or chips & salsa. The first night there, we watched as people just kept going to the bar...I don't think they ever cut anyone off (though the bartender advised us that it was a two-drink limit per guest). Mind you, the social environment remained friendly and not like a frat-house or anything; it was very pleasant. And the booze itself wasn't bad; not top-shelf stuff, but okay...and they offered a passingly decent beer (Sam Adams) on tap. So, what did we learn here? Well...if you get this property at a bidding discount, don't mind the drive downtown for the tourist traps, can justify in your head the parking $$$ tradeoff w/the better-than-average breakfast and free drinks, and don't mind the mall-ambiance of the surrounding area, then this might just be the hotel for you and your family. We feel like we did pretty well on this one... BTW: I reviewed an Indian restaurant in the vicinity that was AWESOME; as Dr. Steve Brule would say, \"Check it out!\"", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cNice place, great location!\u201d", "Author": "Jeslaf", "ReviewID": "UR127286292", "Content": "Been here several times on the way in/out of Seattle.

We were assigned a room on the third floor, king bed, non smoking. Our room was great. There is a living room with couch, desk, and TV that is separated from the bedroom and bathroom. There is a little sink area outside of the bathroom with mini fridge and microwave. The bedroom was a little small. The bed took up most of the space, but it was fine. The bathroom was average in size and came with crabtree & evelyn shampoo/conditioner/soap/body wash. Do keep in mind that there is a train nearby in the area and you will hear it periodically throughout your stay. You will also hear noise in the atrium if you are in the living room area. We couldn't hear the atrium from the bedroom. This seems to be the hotel of choice for high school and college teams. There were a bunch of teenagers gathering in the lobby and atrium area at night talking and having fun. Breakfast during the weekdays is from 6-9am. I don't know why breakfast ends so early on the weekdays. On the weekends, breakfast is served from 7-10am. We had breakfast on one day and it was really good. There was a line for the hot food, where they take your omelet order. You also get to choose from pancakes, hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon. There is also the usual stuff like muffins, yogurt, and fresh fruit. It's a really decent breakfast with good selection. There seemed to be enough seating for everyone. If you miss breakfast, there is a bunch of fast food restaurants down the road. I think I saw a Jack in the Box and Taco Bell and a 7-11 store. The hotel is also close to Southcenter Shopping mall, a Target, and Costco. The hotel is right off the 405. We found the hotel's location to be very convenient.

When I traveled to Seattle for business, I decided to try out this property because my experience across at a hotel across the street had not been so good two weeks prior. It happened to be the Sunday night of Labor Day Weekend when I checked in so the hotel was extra crowded. The front desk staff were well trained and went above and beyond the call of duty for two guests in front of me and also for me. Because I did my homework and read the Trip Advisor review by another guest, I brought earplugs so that when the train rumbled in the \"backyard\", I couldn't hear it. The building vibrated every time a train went by but it was like having a free magic fingers bed. Speaking of the bed, it was incredibly comfortable; the room had all the accoutrements that you'd expect at an Embassy Suites property. The only two areas in which the hotel could improve are listed below: 1. More luggage carts. I had to print off several pages of legal documents so I took my printer with me on this trip. It was convenient to have the luggage cart on Sunday night. On Monday morning at 9:30, there were none to be found. I was told there were only five. I had to make three trips to my car. While I didn't mind the exercise, it made me late for my next appointment even though I allowed plenty of time. 2. Have extra staff work breakfast on a holiday morning. I went down for breakfast at 8:00 a.m. and there was still two hours of breakfast service remaining--until 10 a.m. There were no plates, no utensils, no trays, no coffee--regular or decaf, no juice (but the Coke dispenser was working). They had run out of food in the regular tray line. There were so many people looking for all of the above that one could hardly move. I don't think I've ever been to any hotel where there were more people in the breakfast area. I was really disappointed and it took me an hour to get my food. The line was 30 minutes long to get a made-to-order breakfast. One guest asked the kitchen employee if there was any more coffee and she yelled at her and said that she was too busy this morning. Apparently, she was stressed out and needed some help in the kitchen. My guess is that when the vacancy rate is higher, this would be a calmer environment on a normal morning. I would stay here again despite those two concerns because I had one of the best sleeps ever and that's the reason, after all, that one stays in a motel: to get a good night's rest.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGood place/value\u201d", "Author": "klk101", "ReviewID": "UR118119883", "Content": "Stayed at the Embassy suites for 4 days, it was slightly dated, but overall good.

We have a small child, so we like to have a suite, and have stayed in Embassy Suites around Seattle, but this was the first time in the SeaTac Embassy Suites. The good: Our room was very spacious, and seemed reasonably clean. There was a small kitchenette in the room with a microwave and a tiny sink that we could use to wash & sterilize bottles. The bad: Extra charges everywhere. Yes, at all Embassy Suites the wifi is extra (which is lame in this day and age, but not unexpected for a hotel in the Hilton chain). But here, the parking is $8/day, despite having to park yourself in a huge lot that's never full. They wanted $15/day extra for each extra person, including the baby. When I asked why, since this isn't the case at any other Embassy Suites I've ever visited, I was informed that it's to cover their \"complimentary\" breakfast. Uh, at most Embassy Suites the complimentary breakfast is covered in the cost of the room, not extra -- and I can find breakfast for a lot less than $15/person in Seattle (and especially in Southcenter). And the baby eats my milk and sleeps in my Pack & Play on my sheet -- so why should I have to pay $15/day extra for her? Other bad things: No hot water in the kitchenette sink. In the end I had to move hot water to that sink using glasses and the bathroom sink (no one wants to wash bottles in a bathroom, or cold water). The TV doesn't get all the local channels -- if you want to watch, say, the Mariners game on that night, you can't, because the hotel doesn't get FSN. Also, be warned: SeaTac (more accurately for this hotel, Southcenter) is a sketchy area. There have been shootings at the mall, etc. You get a VERY mixed crowd at this hotel -- airport travellers who didn't realize this hotel was nowhere near the airport mixed with heavily tattooed construction workers.

Also the room was non-smoking, but had a strong cigarette smoke smell when I arrived which cleared up after a day. So I think the previous guest was smoking in the bathroom. Finally, when will hotels learn that it's time to stop delivering useless USA Today newspapers, and start giving customers free Wireless Internet instead? People are getting their news and email from their iPhones, iPads, Laptops etc. It's time to make this a feature, instead of an expensive $14.99 item.
