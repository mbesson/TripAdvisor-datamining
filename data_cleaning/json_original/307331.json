{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent Hotel Just writing another review on another great hotel. We are from Ireland on a trip around the world and our first stop was Tokyo. We had no clue of anything about it but thought we may as well give it a go and are so glad we did. The hotel is wonderful. The staff are all English speaking, very helpful (they do not accept tips), and they show that they respect their customers unlike most hotels I've stayed in. It was a brilliant experience. The room was smallish but what a view. Rooms start on the 23rd floor and you can look out over most of Tokyo.The food for breakfast is mostly Irish/English menu as well as Japanese. There is an Irish bar in the hotel building called the Roundstone which they staff were very helpful with.Tokyo itself. Well let me give you a few bits of advice. To get to the hotel get the limo bus service. To get around the city there are about 50 different rail services. Ok well i exaggeratted there but there are a few e.g. The Toei, Tokyo Monorail, JR Lines, Tokyo Subway and some are in the same building which confuses the hell of you. To get to the city you use the Monorail rail to Hamamatsucho them walk down the stairs and out of the building beside the World Trade Centre to get to the subway station and link up to the main parts from there. The main parts to visit are Ueno (Gardens, Temples and a brilliant Zoo), Ginza (Shopping), Shibuya (Main Shopping and busies crossroad in the world), Roppongi (Night life), Akihabara (Electric City - All electrical goods), Shinjuku (Shopping), Tokyo Centre (Temple) and a few others to name a few. Was an excellent experience. Ask for menus in English as they don't provide them upfront. Another note about the metro/subway etc lines is to remember what number you entrance in was e.g. it could be 'B4' so when you go back you follow the signs. It's probably much harder then NY, Paris, London and DC, all of which I'd no trouble with at all but Tokyo was the hardest as most is provided in broken English.N.B.

Very nice hotel. Good rail service to all the hot spots of Tokyo. Staff were exceptionally nice - and spoke good English. I asked at reception where the nearest Starbucks was and they walked me there - a 5 minute walk - right up to the door. Now that's service!!There's also a nice path along the river where you can have an early morning stroll along. Would stay here again next time in Tokyo.", "Date": "Oct 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR263070914", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Dregish_WI"}, {"Content": "Very handy location, and great service. We looked at getting a Disney hotel (or nearby, anyway) for a two day stay in Tokyo, and this appeared to be quite handy. As it turned out it cost about 1/3 the price of the resort hotels, and travel to  from Disneyland was no great problem from here. Caught the Kensei line, and after 4 stops we were at the front gate to the Disney Park. We could then see why the resort hotels could charge what they did, as the place was packed..school holidays in Japan are from 25th July to 31st August, so the close hotels are all full to the brim. We had no dramas getting around, either to the park (30 minutes) or into Tokyo proper (30 minutes) using the trains, which always run on time. The Dai-Ichi Hotel itself is in a fair location on the waterfront, with good views from the guest rooms (levels 23 - 26). Plenty of shops in the Seafort building to which the hotel is attached, and a great little Irish pub (the Roundstone), which is well worth a visit for some reasonably priced nosh and a few coldies (given it was summer when we were there..it was compulsory to get a few into us each day)Can't fault the hotel, and for the price, is excellent value.", "Date": "Aug 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR729947683", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RickPorgera"}, {"Content": "Out of the city but perfect base for city break.

I don,t usually write reviews, but felt that we had had such a wonderful time that I should pass our experience on to others. We went to Japan for the Sakura (Bloosoms) in April.We stayed at this Hotel for 3 nights twice on our trip and found that we were made to feel very welcome. I must add that I do speak enough Japanese to get buy (well speaking, but not the reply part) which was enormously appreciated. We bought a JLR pass for 2 weeks as well in which this covers you for all transport on 99% of the trains. Have to pay separately for underground  Tokyo Monorail. JLR pass covers you for the Nartia Express from the airport. If you arrive at Narita. Get the Narita Express to Shinagawa and it is about a 15 minute walk to the Hotel. This may seem a bit out of the way, but once you get your bearings it is a 4 minute monorail from Tennosz Isle to Hamamatsucho on the Tokyo Monorail at 190 Yen a single. This is a short walk to Daimon which is on the Asakusa line which will help you get anywhere or the Green Yamamote line if you have the JLR will take you to some destinations. We purchased a Passnet card at 3000 Yen (\u62e215) and this lasted us all 6 nights as we had the JLR pass as well.We ordered a double roomWe would strongly encourage anyone to stay at this hotel as our room was large, clean and we had no problems.", "Date": "Apr 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR174887683", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mcmullins5"}, {"Content": "Great hotel - great staff - great facilities This hotel is right on the Tokyo monorail providing easy access to explore Tokyo.
