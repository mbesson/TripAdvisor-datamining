Once I arrived at the hotel I kind of understood why some people really hated it and others absolutely loved it. The location is first class, steps away from the main shopping street Kudamm I believe that people who usually stay in anonymous Sheraton-Hilton type of hotels with vast (mediocre quality) buffets and personnel treating them as sub-gods will find it difficult here. The friendly staff is young and easy going with a cool attitude. People had complained about that in their reviews. I found it quite refreshing and hip! Yes, the rooms are on the small side. But very clean and kind of sexy! The shower is very comfortable yet fully exposed! The toilet is in a separate room, creating a quite spot. I thought it to be the ideal room for couples! The bed with its awkward wooden frame is only accessible from one side. It is kind of hard to get in. Not my favorite design, I must admit. But once I managed to get it I had a very comfortable and relaxing sleep. Our standard room faced the street Knesebeck and was really very quiet! The doors are somehow noise proof. You barely hear anything. There are red lights everywhere, adding to the quirkiness and kitsch. I really loved it!

You can walk to the Zoologischer Garten in about 10-15 minutes. The road is quiet but it's only a very short walk from the nearby bustling streets. Exterior: There are no obvious signs outside the hotel to tell you that you have arrived although there is a large Q motif on the door. If you have the address, you won't have any problems. However, if you haven't and think it will be easy to find, you might struggle. Reception: The reception is small and can be cramped with more than a few people in it. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We were a bit apprehensive having seen some of the comments but, honestly, we felt the staff couldn't have been nicer. There aren't any safes in individual rooms but there are safes available at reception, free of charge. Also, when you check in, you'll be given a code for the wifi, which is free. Corridors: Yes-they are red but it's not oppressive. The room numbers are on the vertical lights outside the rooms. The numbers are small and located about a third of the way up. Rooms: We loved our room which was a standard one (i.e. without the bath tub). They are a little on the small size but storage space is adequate. The bed is quirky. It's large enough and comfortable. However, it can be a bit difficult to get on and off. Don't forget to check out the ceiling when lying on the bed. The shower in the room is strange but when you are used to it, it kind of works. However, you need to be comfortable with your travelling companion. The sink in the room wasn't a problem. Spa: The spa was lovely. It's fairly small and would be crowded with more than about 15 people in it. It has a sauna and a steam room and a lounging area with 4 beds which isn't many. Be aware that the spa is only open between 1800-2200. Finishing Touches: Shortly after arrival, we were given a small bottle of sparkling wine and a cocktail and on our morning of departure found a small bag of sweets on our bedroom door. General: We absolutely loved this hotel. We can understand that it isn't for everyone but we wanted something a bit different and got it. At the right price, we'd stay here again.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cInteresting place, friendly staff and great location\u201d", "Author": "kim_night", "ReviewID": "UR121594812", "Content": "When we entered we were greeted warmly with staff that spoke great english.

That narrows the list of potential establishments in Berlin maybe to a list of 10-15 to choose from (which is absolutly outstanding). But moving beyond this level of (pre-)selection, it all comes down to sex appeal! It's like going to a party: You can have a cool location, great food, the perfect sound system ... but in the end, all that counts is the style of the host and the sexiness of the party crowd!!!!! Q hotel has the sexiest staff (both male and female) in Berlin ... and even more ... they are extremely friendly too. Based on that they attract a really interesting, hip and sexy crowd in both their bar and hotel. So even in my business armor returning from boring business missions I always feel a bit like \"Sonny Crockett\" when I \"dive\" back into the Q-crowd. If you're not a member of Soho House (or it's fully booked once again!) this is the only place in Berlin that makes you feel that way! PS: And it alyways makes you wonder who are those good looking people that can afford to party all night at the Q-bar, stretch out on the little Q-beach in the basement with their MacBookAirs and still manage to pay their bills all the time.

The best thing about the Q is their unique design touches. I loved the bathtub adjacent to the bed. Loved it. It's not the most practical, but hotels like this are never about being practical. And downstairs next to the spa is their signature fake beach room with loungers in warm sand, of course the whole thing bathed in red light and some strange red blobs being projected on the walls. Psycho-zen. Another good thing about the Q was the food. I had both room service and the breakfast and both were fantastic. It was one of the only times I have actually decided to go ahead and pay some outrageous amount to have breakfast at the hotel and it was actually almost worth it. The atmosphere is chic even in the day time when they can't shine red lights on everything. It's all just very well done.

The bathroom is fun, there a perfectly adequate shower and then a bath next to the bed with a slide down into the bed (well, it's probably not meant to be a slide). A lot of fun.

I thought it was supposed to be modern and trendy. The hotel itself is quite modern though, the reception and even elevators are quite modern feeling, but it all stops at the door of the room.

I booked one of the 'studio' rooms - which is just like the room pictured on the website. It had the bath attached to the bed, big walk in shower, double sinks, seating area, moveable plasma screen...etc. Checking in was a quick and painless, very friendly staff who speak excellent english. Our room was on the top floor (7th) and looked out to the front of the building, I wasn't dissapointed. There were 2 floor length windows which were a nice touch too. We did a quick unpack, at which point I wondered where the drawers were, I had to stand on the very big brotheresque chair to put some clothes on the shelves above the hanging space. I opened another cuboard and found there to be a safe - which you set your own combination, and the mini bar, which was scant - I had read the reviews so I was prepared for the horror of only 3 minitures, 2 beers, 4 waters and several juices and mixers, there were also some curious items above the minibar, which I can't remember what they were but one I presume was some sort of caffeine product as it was called 'snoozes for loosers' or something?! The tv had me slightly flumoxed, the room guide advised that there was a BBC but alas I couldn't find it so we were stuck with CNN international and MTV. Even though we arrived quite late we decided to go to the bar - as expected this is slightly expensive, so we had 2 drinks and retired for the evening. The bed was very comfortable, and for those like myself who find themselves in a nightly battle for duvet space - you get one each!! YAY! I also slept really well in that bed. I made use of the aveda products but I have to say, I'm not sure whether it was the products or the Berlin water but my hair felt strange here, I washed it each day, and spent longer rinsing it each time, but it still felt like there was a residue or something left in it. We decided that we would not stay in the hotel for breakfast \u20ac18 each is just ridiculous, and there was nothing speacial on the menu anyway. The hotel is abot 40 meters from the Ku'damm so we went round to the coffee shop round the corner 'Carras' and got coffees and croissants instead. They also do these tubs of yogurt with raspberries and oats in it which sounds a bit odd but it was really good and really substantial, will keep you going for hours. The restaurant next door to Carras - Petrocelli (Italian)is a must, the atmosphere on a Tuesday night was quite unbelievable, and the waiters, well they really made the place, our waiter in particular made it his mission to make us feel welcome and try new food. I half expected the waiters to leap onto the tables and start some sort of caberet, they were all so camp! Decided that we would give the hotel restaurant a miss -going by the breakfast and drinks prices and besides we wanted to get out of the hotel and try other places. As our flight home wasn't until 8.30 in the evening we checked if we could leave our luggage at the hotel for the day - which was no problem. The closest S-Bahn station to the hotel is Savigny Platz (probably spelt wrong) and about 45 mins from Shoenfeld - direct train, hurrah.

I recently stayed at Hotel Q with my wife. We were there for three nights over new years. We are both in our twenties and I was looking forward to going to Berlin as I lived there as a child and wanted it to be a bit special by staying somewhere that wasn\u2019t just your average hotel. And Hotel Q seemed to fit the bill. The website really does make it look stunning, if you like that sort of thing. I had read reviews by people who\u2019d stayed there and tried to take a balanced view, as they are personal opinions. So, once we got to the hotel from S Bahnhof Savigny Platz and walked into reception, everything looked fine. I knew that the hotel was small, so the reception area being quite small too, didn\u2019t disappoint me. Check in was a piece of cake, with friendly staff that spoke good English. I liked the red carpet in the lift and the red-lit corridor. Unusual, so I liked it. Our room was on the first floor, directly above the reception and overlooking the street. Finding the correct room was a little tricky as the room number wasn\u2019t on the door. (I knew the hotel was trying to be different, but I wasn\u2019t expecting that\u2026) Anyhow, the number is on the side of the light by the door, so look out for that. As we entered the room everything looked clean and tidy. I did notice straight away that there was no bath next to the bed thing though. Never mind, there was a nice shower\u2026. I think it would be good if their website showed some of the standard rooms instead of all those sinks. The room was clean and after a few minutes checking it out I was happy enough. The design was different and I didn\u2019t mind the wooden floors. All this was expected. And I began wonder about some of the negative reviews by other guests. People saying they couldn\u2019t find the hairdryer or lock the door or work the heating system. None of that was exactly difficult to figure out and there was always the option to ring the front desk. However, there were a few negatives during our stay. For instance, the toilet paper. I don\u2019t know about you, but I like toilet paper to be well stocked. There was one spare roll and one that was half used, but was folded in the way they do, to make it look nice. I thought that would be ok, as the maid would top them up the next morning. That didn\u2019t happen, so I had to ring reception to ask for some more, which was quite embarrassing. They did send someone up immediately. The thing is, they only brought one roll! In the end, we ended up hiding the roll we had, so that the maid would see that we had none left and would be forced to stock up. Anyhow, enough of the toilet rolls fiasco! The other thing, which I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t think would be annoying when they installed them, was the air con switch. I noticed someone else writing about this. There is a little green LED light on it that flashed. Fine during they day, but during the night it casts some huge green halo across the opposite wall that looks like they are trying to call batman. In the end, I had to cover it up with a plaster. We went to the bar one evening to try out the cocktails. (Don\u2019t have the Q Cocktail. It\u2019s horrible.) Service was great, no problem there. It was a bit pricey mind and smoky. (I know, it\u2019s a bar, but be prepared for that in Berlin. We couldn\u2019t find a single place to eat where people weren\u2019t smoking.) Nice looking place too, although, it did look a bit \u2018MDF\u2019 overload. (They had a private party new years eve, so hotel guests not allowed in!) All pretty small things you may think, and you may be right. However, the most annoying thing was the noise. As we were on the first floor and directly above the reception and the bar, we could hear the music from downstairs. Not loud enough to keep you awake though. But it was very bad on New Years Eve. I was prepared for that as the whole city was partying. However, whoever was singing needed some lessons and that time it was loud enough to keep you awake and it felt like he was in the room with us. I had to ring reception to ask how long he would be going on till and they said until 3AM. So not much sleep there then. Perhaps they should have put in better soundproofing. So I suggest you book a room that\u2019s at least on the second floor, if not higher. So all in all, I have no complaints about the staff, but more about the hotel in general. If you don\u2019t mind some noise when you\u2019re trying to sleep and trendy decor then go for it, if not, then I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Ps.

Certainly it is well fitted and quirky. Our room had a bed and washing bowl in one fitting and an excellent shower opening out on to the room. The design is stark with a red and white theme in the public areas, white and dark wood in the rooms. The pictures on the hotel\u2019s website are not of the standard rooms so don\u2019t expect a bath next to the bed unless you are paying top dollar. The bed was large and comfortable with two separate duvets. There were small containers of Avenda products and a poorly stocked mini bar. Other room features included a complicated air conditioning/heating system the controls of which glowed green and needed covering up during the night. The public areas consist of a small lobby, not much more than a corridor, and a private members bar which is also open to residents. However, as other reviews have noted, access to hotel guests is sporadic and on arrival we were informed that we were not welcome on New Year\u2019s eve. However, when allowed in, the Bar is fantastic if expensive and well worth passing a few hours over a Cosmopolitan or Daiquiri. The bar also doubles up as the restaurant although our room rate did not include breakfast which at 18 Euros is rather steep. The lack of a hotel breakfast is no great loss as the nearby Savignyplatz is home to some excellent Caf\u00e9s \u2013 the Caf\u00e9 Savigny does a wonderful fresh breakfast for around 10 Euros. However where this hotel really lets itself down is in pretending to be more than a interestingly designed three star hotel. The concierge service was the reception staff and they were usually busy with booking in guests to be really helpful; there is no business centre - although Wi-Fi access is available; and there was very little information in the room about the hotels services other than those sold through the hotel\u2019s spa. Little things demonstrate this weakness. When we asked to borrow an iron the request came as surprise to the reception staff who explained that they did not normally lend them, but graciously they would make an exception for ten minutes. Not what you would expect from a hotel that is billed as four and half stars. To be fair to the hotel we only paid a three star price, 100 euros a night for the New Year period. Good value \u2013 for the comfortable room and location alone. But don\u2019t come here for an exceptional experience \u2013 that is reserved for the website design.", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended!\u201d", "Author": "Jan69_10", "ReviewID": "UR4236809", "Content": "I was having doubts about this hotel after reading of the experiences of the travellers who had booked their break through Expedia like we had, and was expecting the worst!

While the hotel is a bit pricey for what you get, overall the location and service prevail. The rooms are a bit funky (watch out for the sloping edge of the bed . . . slight tripping hazard!). We arrived at 10am, well before check-in and only expected to drop our luggage off before heading out. Michael and the other staff members were extremely apologetic, and offered to ring us on our mobile when the room became ready . . . which was a mere 30 minutes later! Another staff member showed us to our room, fully explaining the unique key entry, location of the hair dryer, and the other quirky aspects of the room. Michael suggested a fantastic restaurant (thank you again!), and also suggested Sachs, great restaurant, great atmosphere on the same street as the hotel, 40 meters opposite from Ku'Damm. The hotel member-guest bar is not particularly notable (would have been nice to have had the fireplace working), but is decent place for a nightcap (although again on the pricey side). The location is exceptional, very close to beautiful shops, good restaurants, and relatively close to Tegel airport (approx. 20 euros). The hotel is difficult to locate, however, and we were lucky our taxi driver knew it -- look for the dark grey building between 2 white buildings, with the address on the front in silver numbers.

I have travelled a lot and I have stayed in several boutique hotels all around the world, but the Q does not deserve at all this title.I stayed with my husband for three nights at the end of November 2005 in this hotel and our stay was from the first till the last moment a disappointment. We closed the hotel through expedia (so no breakfast included) and that was already a reason enough to be treated badly at the check-in. Not smiling, not welcoming but only explaining coldly that we will have to pay 18 euros per person if we want to have breakfast there. We took our luggage to our room and there we understood that the rooms have *nothing* to do with the picture on the website. If one has the slightest idea about architecture understands that the rooms were not according to the minimilastic style the hotel is proud of, but they are simply cheaply made. Of course there was no bathtub, just a dirty shower full of chalk. The Aveda products were there but don't fool yourself. There is just a little soap, shampoo and body cream-no conditioner. The hair-dryer was so well hidden, that I had to call the reception to unvail me the secret place where it was. Mini bar was awful-and half full. Probably they forgot to fill it after the last customer left. The first day the air-conditioning did not work so we had to sleep in the cold (outside the temperature was -5 Celcius). The rest of the room was tastelessly done, just white and plain metallic windows; nothing special. Due to the fact that there was an additional trick in order to close the door from inside when we were sleeping, which we were never informed about, next morning we had to face the invasion of the cleaning person at 8:45am! Unacceptable! The corridors were lit with a red light which I never understood. Only positive of the hotel, it's fantastic location. Just off Ku'damm and near Bleibtreustrasse and Savignyplatz with all its nice restaurants, caf\u00e9s and little shops. For 18 euros per person we of course did not even dare to try the breakfast and the restaurant/bar was always empty when we were coming in or leaving the hotel, so we didn't feel like trying either. And a last thing, we got a price through expedia of 105euros for the room per night but then expedia charged us with extra 30 euros for service! In the end the offer they had was not really an offer (let alone the fact that I had to pre-pay everything at the beginning of August to get this special rate).

We arrived down to the bar from our room for a drink and dinner on the first night of our stay(Saturday)only to be told that there was a private party in the hotel that night. Fair enough - it happens, but we wouldn't have stayed there if we had known this in advance. But we were very embarrassed to be treated like gatecrashers at the hotels bar/restaurant in front of 'invited' party guests. In addition to this, no room service was available to us either as all staff were allocated to the private party. No food, no drinks....in a hotel?? totally unacceptable. This issue was never addressed all weekend by hotel management eventhough we called and even left notes at reception. Obviously we were not happy paying full whack for 'room only' facilities but no manager was available all weekend to sort this out.
