I did read some reviews before booking this hotel and I saw that some people had trouble checking in when they arrived late. The hotel actually emailed me asking me what time I would be getting in. I think that was responsible and considerate because they don't have 24hr service so I suspect they wanted to make sure we were okay. We were greeted by the front desk once we arrived. She was very friendly. She gave us a map and showed us where all the sights and good restaurants are. She walked us to our room. There is NO elevator. You will get 3 keys. One for the very front door which I think probably closes around 7 or 8pm? We got back at 10:30pm that night and everything was locked up already. We stayed on the 1st floor and there is a door you need to unlock before you get to a corridor of rooms which will require your third key. Everything is very basic. You do get a hair dryer and a fridge but there isn't anything else. You also get FREE wifi which is great because it's really rare in Europe. The room has really high ceilings, we got two beds that made up a queen size bed. The room is a decent size and you get a big window. If you're just looking for a clean place to stay, this may be for you. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to walk to the TV tower which was the meeting place for our tour group. The isn't air conditioning so be prepared to have to open your window to sleep at night which is a little noisy with cars and people talking.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Crash Pad in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "KHill81", "ReviewID": "UR89415830", "Content": "Looking at the previous review I was concerned about having booked the Hotel Novalis. I am delighted to say that the Hotel was much better than expected. We had a large, clean, spacious room. Breakfast was available at 6 euros, but as we were only in Berlin for 3 days we ate on our travels. The owner is very welcoming, and was more than happy to look after our cases after check out until 6pm as we had a late flight back to the UK. For anyone travelling to Berlin for a couple of days sightseeing I would recommend this hotel. It is in a great location and a short walking distance to 2 underground stations. OK, so there is no wifi or english speaking channels on the TV, but with so much to see and do, and great restaurants to eat at nearby, we didn't spend much time at the hotel anyhow. We will certainly be staying here again on our next trip to Berlin", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "milano", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing at least\u201d", "Author": "cicciapiccola", "ReviewID": "UR37227931", "Content": "The hotel is highly disappointing, as none of the previous reviews were describing the current reality of the hotel: no breakfast in the hotel, no reception, no luggage facility, no english spoken, no credit card accepted, only cash. I was capable to see the lady only at my arrival: despite the fact I asked by mail when reserving if breakfast was included in the price, I did not got any answer, only to discovered at my arrival that breakfast was simply not served, but there were several bakery in the proximity! On the day of the departure we have been asked to leave the room at 10:00 - when I asked to leave the luggage somewhere the answer has been to go to the train station.

The rooms are a good size, they're clean and the beds are comfy. Beyond that, they're a bit uninspiring and short on any extras (no toiletries or hairdryer, access to mini-bar is extra, and the hotel itself has no real public areas). The hotel is 'pension style' in an apartment block with the rooms one floor up from the reception which is only staffed during the day (though the staff are very friendly). The breakfast is fairly good - breads, meats, cheeses, yoghurts etc. In sum, basic but comfortable, a great location and fairly good value.", "Date": "May 11, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Novalis Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d573295-Reviews-Novalis_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$71 - $104*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Novalisstrasse 5</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">12103</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "573295", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/42/8e/428eb466bf6b8329f1379c3455ad41ee1large.jpg"}}
