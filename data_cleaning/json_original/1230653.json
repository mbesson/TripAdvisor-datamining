We opted for a room with 2 beds (one for the child) The bathroom was clean and the shower hot and powerful The bed had seen better days and the pillows well they need not have bothered as they had seen better days too but as soon as I closed my eyes I was out until the wake up call from reception. I didnt hear an once of noise. The fire alarms started after we woke and there was no broadcast or call to say it was a false alarm but a quick call to reception confirmed we werent going to die (just as well too as an escape could have proven difficult - no windows to jump from)", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chester United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201creally dirty\u201d", "Author": "annuk", "ReviewID": "UR60435340", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel en-route from Bali to Manchester.The room was very grubby , the bathroom horrid - very dirty -dirt around the tiles, sink etc. The rooms need a total revamp- or a bucket of bleach to start with- .I felt really unclean after sleeping on the bed too.

After inspecting the room and hearing neither particular bothering noise nor experiencing specific disturbances I eventually checked in and had a peaceful rest. I must admit that T2 rooms are somewhat worn due to intense turn over but not as dirty as I thought. Bathroom compartment -less than 2 sqm- is tiny and the shower hose extremely short thus not easy to use unless you are a dwarf! I guess it has been designed that way to save water. Both check-in and check-out were expedited thanks to three reception attendants available at each time. Overall a just satisfactory stay for around SGD75.

Clean and more upscale baths were right down the hall. There are western style toilets in the shower rooms although that's not what you get when you follow the Toilet sign. I heard none of the promised construction noise. The wake up call came right on time. The staff were friendly and efficient at check in and check out.
