Hotel is definately too good a description, it really was more like a hostel.

There was no lift either and the stairs were really steep and narrow and there was no amentities (for example bar/restaurant). There was no breakfast service. Lugging heavy suitcase up those stairs was great exercise! However, the staff were extremely helpful. In fact they were so helpful that after a day I had pretty much forgotten my initial disappointment, they really were very nice and on our last day they even minded our bags for us after we checked out so we could enjoy the last day of our holiday without lugging heavy suitcases with us. Also the location was unbeatable. It really is in the very centre of Amsterdam and within walking distance of everything. Anything not within walking distance is easily accessible on the hop on/hop on city bus tour. Only thing I would say is the windows were quite big and if opened would be very easy to fall out of (a lot of people go to coffee shops in Amsterdam and might lean out the window to get some air etc and could easily fall) There was only a small bar across the window", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCheap, free insect bites with each stay!\u201d", "Author": "Lukeo88", "ReviewID": "UR125254561", "Content": "I stayed with three other people, it was my idea to go down the cheap road and pay \u00c2\u00a320 each to stay at this hotel.

If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in Amsterdam for this then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hugely disappointed. Externally the hotel looks very commercial and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry to say this cheap so it does fit into the red light district area. The reception area is simple with just the desk, Red Bull drink machines, a pamphlet stand and a few chairs. The resident cat that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always milling around the reception must be the owners and adds an element of quirkiness you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get from other hotels in such a built up area. Rooms are accessible over several floors from the main steep stairs you get in many traditional narrow Amsterdam properties (if you cannot climb many steep stairs this hotel is not for you). Smaller corridors lead off from the main stairs to rooms. The rooms at Hotel Ben are without a doubt the most basic of rooms I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in (almost prison cell like); they are small, narrow but long and feature cheap beds (thin mattresses), blankets (no duvets!), plain d\u00c3\u00a9cor, an open wardrobe (well it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a box really), 14\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd box colour television, small round table, stools and an en-suite with very hot water. The floors are uneven and in the middle of summer very very very hot and sweaty (no air conditioning), after the first night we had to buy fans to cool ourselves off, even then it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do the trick. The location of the hotel right in the heart of the red light district (and I mean right in the heart with bars and sex shops outside the bedroom window bellow) this means that between 6pm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3am sound levels of drunken people outside on the street bellow resonate throughout the hotel and unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re drunk or very tired, it does take a while to get some sleep. In general the hotel caters especially for the budget traveller and people on a red light district trip. It is not suitable for any other age or type of guest, especially children based upon its location. The location is right in the middle of the centre so at no distance to bars, clubs, restaurants and museums, whilst guests are required to hand their key in exchange for a card saying they are staying at the hotel when you leave for the day (so guests don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose keys).

Moreover, the walls are thin so be prepared to hear people go about there business late, late at night. The stairs are perhaps the worst I have ever encountered. I have been to amsterdam a few times and understand that the hotels are small. However, this was out of hand. Please see my photos! If you have heart problems or are not physically fit, do not stay at this hotel. The stairs will kill you. LOL Overall, I would stay here again but for a brief (2day visit). IF you want class, you gotta hit another hotel. Do not get me wrong. It is like staying a Motel 6 without a TV. BTW, they have a cat and parrot in the lobby that are hilarious to kick it with. :)", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cok for the money\u201d", "Author": "dickie_blue_eyes", "ReviewID": "UR6161698", "Content": "Only needed somewhere to sleep for 1 night, in fact we only spent 6 hours in the room. For the money we paid the hotel was fine, we knew what to expect and got just that. No frills hotel, friendly staff, room was small but it had en suite shower and toilet but there were only small hand towels available so take your own bath towels. Be warned the stairs are very VERY steep, we were on the top floor and it was hard work especially at 3am! The location of the place was perfect, very short walk from central station and RLD and plenty or bars. Overall, this place is fine for lads (or girls) who just want somewhere cheap to stay while they're on a weekend away, just dont expect too much from it remeber you get what you pay for", "Date": "November 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irl", "Title": "\u201cSomewhere to put your head for the night\u201d", "Author": "karen__209", "ReviewID": "UR5885124", "Content": "We arrived in Amsterdam with nowhere booked and as the whole City was booked out because of some Chinese conference, we were glad to get anywhere at all.. And anywhere is better than the street, especially in Amsterdam! This place is not too bad.. front desk staff are friendly... and a little too friendly maintenance man... strange to say the least (i.e poking his head in the bedroom door at 9am when im half naked and still in bed ,strange!!.. he also followed us to a bar one night!) The first room we had was a quad room; 4 matresses on wooden slats and some itchy wooly cover blankets.. bed sheets laundry style clean and some free toiletries.. but if you dont like to wash your hair in Wash Up Liquid then i dont recommend using these!! The beds were tiny, only about 4.5 foot long and just wide enough to squeeze myself into... We were given a double room for the further 4 nights there, which consisted of one double bed, again on a wooden slat... The bathroom was up a small stairway within the room (you dont want to be climbing this when drunk) ... In general the room was very dark and had one window which overlooked .. well nothing really, directly infront of us was another window to another room (Friendly neighbours though!!) There was a family of Pigeons living outside the window also,and they made almost as much noise as our rowdy British Male neighbours... Not for the faint hearted or those expecting any kind of luxury or frill..or those with breathing difficulties!! The stairs are a killer.. almost vertical! All in all its a tiny step up from a hostel.. we paid 250 euro each for 5 nights...so not tremendously cheap but i think they took advantage of the very busy weekend in Amsterdam.. Despite the lodgings, Amsterdam is a great place.. Ive been a few times.. Ive stayed in a Citymundo Apartment before and had a very pleasant time..(also stayed in Victoria Hotel..nice but not fantastic) If you are broke or stuck, pick Hotel Ben for somewhere relatively safe to sleep(in the Red Light Area) and at least there are 4 walls around you and a locked door to keep the Maintenance Man out!!!!! When I got home, I had some strange looking red marks all down one side of my body.. If i was pushed to try to explain what they were, I wouldnt be too far wrong to suggest flea bites.......", "Date": "September 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Ben", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d611474-Reviews-Hotel_Ben-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$92 - $231*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Beursstraat 21</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1012 JT</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "611474", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/bd/ac/bdace19fea2561b45f6b16cf3e6ac9285large.jpg"}}
