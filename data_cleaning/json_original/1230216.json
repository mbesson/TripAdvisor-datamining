The hotel doesn\u2019 t give you the impression of a 4 star hotel from the outside but rooms are quite big and most of all modern with new furniture. Our room looked over the internal courtyard and so there was no street noises at all but still it had steel shutters at the windows. Beds are big and comfortable and wardrobes have plenty of shelving to put your things neatly. The central heating is wonderful in that cold weather, the room was warm and comfortable at all times. The bathroom is new and perfectly clean but still didn\u2019 t like a couple of things about it. First of all it was designed on german standards which doesn\u2019 t necessarily suit everyone. The bath is considerably high to get into causing a problem to my mother who is in her seventies. The same happened with the toilet that is a hanging model and was put too high off the ground and considering that I am of normal height I still had to sit with only my tip toes touching the ground. Apart from this fresh towels were changed everday and the room was cleaned thoroughly too. The cleaning service is good but a bit slow. I\u2019ve never been in a 4 star hotel which took so long to tidy the rooms. Once we returned to our rooms after 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon and the room was still undone. Obviously we tidied the room ourselves that day cause the maid came around about an hour later and it was not worth it to let her in and wait outside in the corridor! The breakfast is a must and the best thing of our stay. It\u2019 s an extensive buffet which should suit all likings. There was a selection of meats as chicken wings or nuggets, meat balls, different types of sausages, another selection of eggs, salads, breads and cheese, pancakes, croissants, cakes and fruit. Hot beverages are served by the staff directly on your table but there are also juices available at the buffet tables. Be a bit patient because the staff knows very little english. Another must of the hotel is the location which is very good. The metro is just 2 to 3 minutes round the corner and it\u2019 s a very good shopping area too. The fact that it was christmas time helped a lot because the area is full of people all the time and streeta are very nicely decorated. By the way, even the hotel is decorated in a very nice way and with a huge christmas tree in the courtyard too. There is also a very close Christmas market in the same street, just 5 minutes walk away. The metro stop close to the hotel is connected with quite a couple of lines and so it\u2019s easy to do some sightseeing too.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradford West Gwillimbury, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value, clean, friendly staff and trendy decor\u201d", "Author": "MikeNAnna", "ReviewID": "UR122003771", "Content": "This is a nice hotel.

I realize I can't expect much at its price point (We paid about $60 one night, and $80 the other), but I would have gladly paid more to stay in a better place. The room was by far the smallest room I have ever seen. There were two twin beds that may as well have been on top of each other - and we specifically requested a queen when we booked months ahead of time. The shower was impossibly tiny and the room was so small it felt like you were using the restroom and showering practically in the middle of the room. It was very awkward, and I'm not shy. My dorm room wasn't this small. Upon arrival we asked the front desk where was an area nearby that we could go for dinner. He showed us a map and directed us to a place several underground stops away. On our second night we discovered that Gendarmarket right down the road had beautiful restaurants and a stunning atmosphere. It seems incredible that the staff would not have informed us of this. Further, on another night we asked where we could find a pub to watch the English Premier League - they did not know of any pubs nearby and directed us to a swanky bar, not a sports bar at all.
