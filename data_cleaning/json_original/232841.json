Hotel Ranieri was very hospitable before the visit in arranging a taxi from the airport to the hotel for me and my friend which we thought was expensive at \u20ac55 but probably worth it due to the time we were arriving which was already quite late in the day. We weren\u2019t wrong as we had to wait over an hour for our luggage at Rome airport so if you can go with hand luggage only I\u2019d certainly advise it. The hotel staff spoke very good English thankfully and were extremely friendly and generous with their assistance. They have an amazingly small old fashioned lift which added to the charm of the place. Disappointingly though, the room itself was not big enough to swing a kitten let alone a cat (we had requested a twin and the single beds couldn\u2019t actually separate due to lack of room either side, so it felt like a double anyway). You could just about turn around in the bathroom but it was clean and had everything one would want from a room except space. The walls were quite thin between the rooms as well and we were frequently woken up with corridor noise. The continental breakfast was basic but there was plenty of it. The only thing it really lacked was fresh fruit but it filled the description of a continental breakfast with pastries and cooked meat and eggs as well as cereal and yoghurt each day. The location was good in that the Termini was only a 5 minute walk but we were far enough away from the noise of the main areas at night. I would however, stay slightly more west if I were to visit again so as to make travelling time to the main attractions less. There are not many restaurants or bars around Hotel Ranieri either and although what we did find were some fabulous Italian eateries, I would have preferred to stay somewhere slightly more lively and to have had more choice of restaurants. Getting back to the airport was a doddle from Termini and I would recommend the train which was effortless and easy to buy tickets for at the machines (which both here and on the tube had English translations). We did witness a pick pocketer on the tube though so be vigilant and protective of your belongings. Rome itself seemed to be mostly full of tourists (but we were going to the touristy sites) but with every main site being within walking distance it makes for a great city break. The history and culture was incredibly inspiring. Enjoy your trip!", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoke-on-Trent", "Title": "\u201cA very friendly Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Torzo", "ReviewID": "UR128000320", "Content": "A clean pleasent hotel with exceptionally friendly helpful staff. For example when we wanted to book a restaurant a little out of town, Mr.Ranieri himself booked us the table and the taxi so as to make the experience stress free. The hotel is a SHORT walk from the Railway and Bus Station, approximately 10 minutes, where a number of the open top tour buses can be boarded. These are in my opinion the best way to tour Rome allowing the passenger to Hop on and off at all the major attractions thus keeping walking down to whatever suits you. As for restaurants local to the Hotel in the streets directly behind the Hotel there are at least 6 that we found in under 15 minutes. We tried 2 of them and found them to be excellent. The breakfast was fine with enough variety to suit everyone although my only observation would be some sort of toast making facility but that just maybe me. In closing I would say that I wouldn't hesitate to use the Hotel Ranieri again.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff!\u201d", "Author": "S L", "ReviewID": "UR127918534", "Content": "My family and I just got back from Rome last week.

I stayed in a standard single room which was quite and was good size compared to other hotels. I was in room 212 and I found the room to be very clean and quite. The bathroom was a decent size and modern and clean. The hotel is situated in a lovely building with a lovely old style lift and spiral staiir case. I. found the breakfast to be very nice with a good choice of continental style food, good selection of nice pastries and also a choice of a hot breakfast. The breakfast room was located in the basement area of the hotel but it is a extremely pleasent room decorated iN lovely lemon colour with some lovely antique ceramic vases. The hotel is located in a nice safe area with some nice resturants near by to go to. The Republic Metro station is about a 8 to 10 minute walk away and it is only a few stops away from some of the main sights like the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and about five stops away from Saint Peters and the Vatican museums. Also there is a very extensive bus system in Rome and you can catch buses to most of the main sightseeing areas right across the road from the hotel. You can buy a all day ticket to use on the buses and the two metro lines for 4 Euros which you can buy from the Metro station or at the tabaconists just near to the hotel. Termini station is also only about 10mis away. This is a great hotel if you don't want to be right in the centre of all the action of Rome but close enough that you can chill out after all that wonderful and amazing sightseeing of the city. Staff at the hotel were also very friendly and helpful and the mini bar in the room was very reasonable priced. There is also a little lounge bar where you can get drinks from 24hrs a day. Travelling as a female by myself I felt very safe staying in this hotel and would definetley return again to this hotel when I next have the chance to visit this beautiful city. All in all great find and very reasonably priced.

Having scanned numerous hotels on various websites it was decided to use Hotel Ranieri, Via XX Septtembre 43, Via Veneto 00187. As is my practice, I spoke personally to the the hotel before booking and was warmly received. My questions were answered and assurance given as to quality of rooms etc. I booked the reservation on line direct wih the hotel. It was a seamless operation and the reservation was quickly confirmed. Amongst the detailed information sent to me from the hotel was the option to use a private car service to bring us from the airport direct to the hotel. In the past we had made the journey by train and foot. As there were six in the party, it worked out more cost effective to use the service.A six seater vehicle cost 75 Euros for the journey (one way). Having arrived at Fiumicino airport, the driver was waiting for us in the arrivals hall and the journey to the hotel was again a seamless operation. The hotel is typical of hotels in that area, in that the entrance lobby is contained within a small space on the ground floor. We were welcomed to the hotel and dealt with very quickly and efficiently by the reception staff . Despite having arrived way before the alloted booking in time, it was quickly established that our rooms were in fact ready for us and we were able to deposit our bags and start out on our exploration of the city. This hotel is located a little way out from what could be described as the centre of the city, but all the usual visitors sights were within walking distance, such as Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps etc. The rooms are adequate in size and very well appointed. There was air conditioning that worked. The bathroom area was modern and also well appointed. The standard of cleanliness was excellent. The beds were sooo comfortable, and were well received after a long day on the feet! Breakfast is served in a dining room in the basement area . The room was spacious and light and well decorated. There was adequate seating and there was no cause to queue despite the fact that hotel was obviously somewhere near to full. The selection of food was excellent with both hot and continental style available. The staff at reception were exceptionally friendly and never seemed to be worried about all the questions and queries being asked. When it camr for us to return to the airport, the reception staff very efficiently organised the same car service to make the return journey. We were dropped off right outside the terminal we needed which was a godsend as the airport is somewhat large and a little spread out. We had three wonderful days in this magnificent city , with superb weather .

I am an American engineer and I have been traveling on business throughout the US for 25 years - staying in good quality Hilton, Marriott, and Holiday Inn type hotels. Visited Rome with my wife, but, had a budget to protect. The Ranieri was very clean. Housekeeping cleaned the room immaculately daily, new bed linens daily. Bathroom modern, clean and comfortable w/ 120 VAC 60 Hz available. Nice little bar area to have a glass of wine at a good price, or to get a cappuccino or expresso. Breakfast daily, eggs, bacon, fresh danishes, cereals, and with an assortment of cold cuts and fresh bread or rolls to make a sandwich to pack for lunch while roming the city. the Metro (subway) is approximately 5 blocks away - a nice, easy walk. The Metro is convenient for going to the Vatican and Saint Peters Bascilica/Sisteen Chaple. Youcan even take the Metro to the Spanish Steps area. Otherwise, my wife and I preferred to walk most everywhere and we loved it. So that you may compare yor ability to do the same, we are in our late fourties, approaching 50 yrs age. We are fit, but i wouldnt say we are athletes. This is definately do-able for the average middle-aged couple. And, it is safe to walk from the Ranieri to all locations. People say a 4 Star European Hotel is comparable to a 3 star in the USA, but, the Hotel Ranieri is quaint, and every bit as clean and comfy as a 4 star hotel in the states. Granted, the rooms are a little small, but, so are most of the rooms in Rome from what i understand, and, they are still totally manageable. We did a lot a research on hotels before booking - it was a bit stressful. Originally, we tried to stay close to the Spanish Steps. We easily saved $500 for the week by staying just a little further away at the Ranieri, and, we didnt miss a click by doing so, and, perhaps we even enjoyed ourselves more.

The area outside the station is very busy. There are plenty of restaurants and shops in the termini area and surrounding streets. Lots to do and see all within walking distance of the hotel. Breakfast provided English and continental, tea and coffee, juice and cereals available. Unfortunately no tea and coffee provided in rooms, and no kettle either. We read the reviews and took our own. There is a large SIR supermarket a couple of streets away where we bought water, snacks and drinks much cheaper than using the mini bar. The hotel has wireless iternet which is great and the hotel staff are friendly and helpful. Restaurants in Rome are mainly pizzarias or pasta restaurants and the hotel has no evening restaurant. There are lots of McDonalds in Rome and also a Burger King. Transport from Fumincino Airport, which is the main Rome airport was either by the Leonardo Express directly to Termini Station euros 14 one way or by bus which is stationed just outside the airport return fare euros 15 which is a lot cheaper and takes about 1hr 10 mins. Leave enough time to get to the airport as the traffic is very busy, and the airport is vast. Beware as there is another bus which goes to Roma Centro which is not near the termini station - costs only euro 6 but you will have to get the metro to the termini station only euro 1 by metro but inconvenient. Bus touts will sell you a ticket telling you its central but will not get you where you want to go. Hotel is within walking distance of all major attractions would say the hotel is in a good location, we had a large room, although was very dark courtyard facing, very quiet which was good, and very clean. The hotel has a lounge /bar and computer facility, a room to store your bags when you leave which was free, very good if you have a later flight as we did. Roads in Rome were extremely busy and you have to use the crossings with confidence as they will not stop unless you walk accross, some do not have traffic lights. Sight seeing buses hop on hop off round the city, sometimes quicker to walk though due to traffic, also so much to see round every corner.

We were very happy with this place, it was a perfect little boutique hotel for our time in Rome. It had charm and character, and good value for the money. Service - Everyone at the front desk, specifically Adriano and Antonio, were extremely helpful and friendly. They were always waiting with a friendly \"Ciao\" or \"Bonjourno\"! They arranged car service for us to and from the airport, they helped my husband with taxis to work every day, and they even recommended restaurants in the area and called to make reservations for us. There is no restaurant at the hotel, but there is a cute little hotel bar in the back that you can always get a drink at. And they do serve you breakfast every day. It is a small continental-type selection, but everything was good and always tied us over until lunch. Try the red orange juice - it's yum! Room - The room is not huge, but it was perfectly fine. Everything is impeccably clean, and they clean your room and give you new towels every day. The bed is a bit on the hard side, but we thought it was very comfortable and slept great every night. We didn't spend much time in the room, but when we did we felt very comfortable in there. There is free wi-fi in the room. Location - The hotel is in a perfectly good location, unless you don't want to walk at all. But Rome is a walking city anyway - that is what you are supposed to do! Everywhere is so beautiful, we loved walking to and from attractions and restaurants every day and night. Hotel Ranieri is approximately 15-20 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain/Pantheon/Piazza Navona. The Colesseum and Trastevere were a bit further, maybe 30 minute walk or so. But everything from the Trevi Fountain was easy to get to, all easily walkable, or jump in a cab if you don't want to walk. The only thing that is a bit further and may require transportation other than walking was the Vatican. There really isn't anything to see right near the hotel, but again, it is an easy walk to many attractions and sites. The area around the hotel isn't too exciting, but we always felt very safe in the area, even me when I was walking by myself. There is a good little pizza place that we got pre-dinner pizza at a few times on the way into the city center, and that is a stone's throw away from the hotel.

So mood was not good when entering the room, which was facing the inner courtyard on the first floor with hardly any daylight (a bit like an inside cabin on a cruise ship which we would never book!). However, we ventured out to the city after a quick freshen up - and found ourselves hitting the main government building almost immediately down the road with obvious VIPs visiting. Rome really is an amazing city but you need good walking sandals/trainers to feel comfortable for the many many miles you need to walk! Word of warning - you need tickets for all travel prior to hopping on buses & trains that you can obtain at the local Termini newsagent for 4 euros giving all day travel. Best value was the open air bus tours where you can hop on and off to see all the attractions for around 16 euros each, over 24 hours - and provides a good rest! Back to the dark room in the evening to freshen up again (good bathroom but wobbly shower) before dinner, and visited the restaurant around the corner (opposite the Medici) for an average meal. Best restaurant of the 4 days was the rooftop at the Hotel Forum (recommended before we went) where we hit on a special evening promoting Soave wine by the vineyard owner - excellent food and wine! Breakfast next morning was as we expected - a very fair continental help yourself type, but plenty! The British don't like them because they do tend to be aimed for the sweet tastes, but cheese and ham was available. Friendly and efficient service available if required. Returned home to watch Roman Holiday DVD with Gregory Peck & Audrey Hepburn to relive our memories of the wonderful sites we saw - not quite so busy in those days though!

The television worked fine with a wide selection of channels (only CNN in english). There was a safe in the wardrobe which was free to use.

We spent the first two nights at another hotel in Rome which had been highly recommended (Hotel Modigliani, which we loved) and then moved to the Ranieri for our remaining nights in Rome. We were somewhat disappointed by our experience at the hotel. True, the hotel was a good value (250 Euros for a quad room), the staff was nice and helpful, breakfast was decent, and my daughters liked the free Internet service. However, our quad room was the smallest of all the hotel rooms we experienced in Italy. My major complaint about the hotel is the location. It really is \"off the beaten path\" as other reviewers have commented, and is not easily accessible to Rome's major locations by foot. We ended up taking cabs at Euro 6-10 for the four of us to reach a major destination or subway station. By contrast, we were able to walk nearly everywhere from our first hotel.

It is a bit of a walking dist. to most of the sights, not bad if you don't mind walking, but if you do-take a cab or bus. Not far from the train station.
