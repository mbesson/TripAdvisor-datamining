It all boils down to what you want out of your hotel room.

The hotel doesn't have all sorts of amenities, but it's a nice little place to be when you're not on the beach. When we were there, Ocean City set off fireworks which were directly in front of the hotel, so we could watch them from the balcony and not have to fight the crowds of people there to watch them.

It was reasonably priced and at a prime location. Let me start with the Pros: - As mentioned, the location can\u2019t be beat. We were located in the midst of all the action at the boardwalk. Also had an ocean front room. Loved sitting on the balcony in the morning and watching the waves and then again in the afternoon watching the crowd - The customer service was very good. Before, on arrival and when checking out they were helpful and courteous. - The pool looked nice. We didn\u2019t go in, but it looked clean and wasn\u2019t crowded. Now for the cons - I was concerned about security. They still use keys. Wouldn\u2019t have been a huge issue but there wasn\u2019t a safe either. We kept the DND sign on the door for our stay. Not that we didn\u2019t trust the employees, but with no card swipe logs we wanted to keep the entry to the room at a minimum. - We spend most of our day on the beach so we really just need a place to sleep. However, the bed was TERRIBLE! I could feel every spring when I laid down. Every morning I woke up feeling achy. The overall room and hotel was worn down. But I expected that. In comparison to other hotels in OC it was priced low.

I read some reviews about bad parking, but as of this date, every room has a reserved spot in the parking lot right by the pool. No issue at all.

The first year, before even getting to our room, we had to pass dried up puke in the hallways, which made the whole hall smell awful. This was not cleaned the whole time we were there. The second year we stayed there, our AC unit stopped working. The maintenance man had to replace it but had to wait until the following day. They gave us a small temporary room to stay in that had air conditioning. This room was filthy and dark. The third year we stayed, (Don't ask why we even came back let alone even a second time) They put a loud restaurant right under about 3 of the second story rooms. This place stayed open until about midnight or maybe even all night, i had to play music to muffle the horrible screaming and yelling that was occurring. So basically, this motel is dirty, more like filthy, not so greatly maintained, no elevator, poor utilities, lots of noise until very late hours, smells horrible, and just not worth it. For a few extra dollars you can stay at the Howard Johnson's on 24th street, with a much nicer hotel.
