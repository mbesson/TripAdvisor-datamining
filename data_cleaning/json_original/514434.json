Staff was nice and helpful. The restaurant was good but expensive. Breakfast was provided free each morning and there was a good variety. To actually get into the center of Rome is a bit of a trek. The nearest train station is Tiburtina. When looking at a map it seemed like it wasn't too far of a walk but as two young women we really didn't feel safe the moment we stepped out of our hotel onto the street. We opted for taking the bus to Tiburtina as the bus station was right across (a pretty busy and hard to cross) street. The bus was packed full but it was an okay way to get there. If you want to feel a bit safer and closer to the action I don't recommend staying here.

Rome was by far the hardest to get around in. We had a rental car and given that I do not like public transportation, this was the best way to get around in Rome since it is way cheaper and Rome is known for it's insane traffic. We were stuck in the bus on the way back from the Colosseum for about 2 hours, in very tricky traffic had we driven. This HOTEL was perfect, the bus stop is right across the street to go out and two steps away on the way back. The hotel is in a non busy street. I love the layout and location. The staff was nice and ensured we had a map that we understood and also gave us directions to using the subways and how to come back and such. They speak almost every language which is awesome, we would try spanish and french aside from english, they knew it all. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are very cosy.

I've never been to Italy before and it was a very nice experience. He speak fluent Italian and I don't at all except si,no and ciao so that part was irritating a little bit to not understand but the language of friendliness and great customer service is universal! We were there on a family/business trip so there was no need to pay for a high end hotel/resort if we where going to be so busy. At the end of each or beginning of the morning we came across the sweetest and most helpful staff. Antonio at the front desk was exceptionally helpful. We told him that he is not allowed to have another day off or weekend off until we leave....haha. The moment we arrived he gave us a map and told us how to get around. We also had questions about some addresses we needed to go to and he ran a couple of searches us and offered to call if we needed him to. That made us feel welcomed and at home. There was another guy that was there whose name we can't remember but you will know exactly who he is because he is everywhere doing everything. From serving coffee at the bar to helping in the breakfast area to being a waiter in the restaurant. We called him \"Mr. Cafe\" because every time he saw my husband he asked him if he wanted an expresso. Even if he saw him 12 times for the day. It was not pressuring but i think he know that it was hilarious as we would always laugh but sometimes take him up on his offer...hahaha. The other staff members were awesome too but these too made it exceptional. The location of the hotel is Ideal. It is about 4 blocks from the Metro station and the bus terminal (which meet up at the same spot) so we could hop on to a bus across the street from the hotel (as there is a bus stop right there) and the bus takes you to the bus terminal/metro station. After that, it's where ever you want to go. At the end of the day, we took the blue line metro to Tiburtina station then waited at the bus terminal (which was right there) and took the 409 which stops right in front of the hotel as there is a bus stop right at the entrance of the hotel. It was perfect so we didn't have to rent a car or anything. We were lucky to find this hotel and when we go back to Rome next year and there after we will never be going anywhere else.

The rooms are larger than most you would find in Italy and they include a patio. The hotel is off the beaten path of the tourist locations, but it is very nice to stay in a neighborhood and get a feel for the Roman people outside the tourist locations. The bus stop is close by, taking you to the train station and a short ride for any sight seeing. You can get to the Vatican, Trevi or where every you want in 15 minutes.

But the REAL gripe was when we asked the night before, to have a taxi quite early at 5am to get to Tiburtina (bus doesn't run that early on Sunday) as we had an early flight. The receptionist said point-blank, no, that he would get in trouble for ordering a taxi to Tiburtina because it is such a short distance, a 5 minute walk (actually it is a 20 minute walk). He basically laughed and said we can walk it. It was really unbelievable. So we had to walk at 4:30am, in the dark, along the side of the road (pavement stops and starts) with luggage. Nice. Lucky it wasn't raining and that there were two of us, I would not have liked to walk to Tiburtina on my own during in the dark.

This was not a problem as we had big windows that opened wide - a welcome feature as the weather was unexpectedly hot during our stay. The hotel was very clean - in fact our room was cleaned every morning while we were at breakfast! The front counter staff were very helpful on our arrival and talked us through the area. We caught the train straight from the airport to Turbertina for 5,50 euro's - a bargin for the hour's journey. We also got a three day metro pass for 11 euro's to cover our transport into the city. We also spent some time exploring the local area - a five minute walk right out of the hotel takes you to a typical italian piazza in a local area - we were the only tourists there and did not in the least feel unwelcome or uncomfortable - which is unusual when three women are travelling alone. We ate like kings (lots of pizza) for 4 euro's each - a real bargin. Also try the ice-creams from the shopping centre nearby - heavenly! The one thing that we did notice at the hotel on the first night was how quiet it was - apart from ourselves, there appeared to be only 2 other guest staying - until the next morning when we looked out the window and saw 12 police riot vans parked outside! This concerned us slightly until we were told that 50 police officers were staying at the hotel for a nearby conference!! Needless to say we felt very very safe as they spent the next 3 days milling around (with other guests who had by that point turned up). We can honestly say we picked the safest hotel in Rome what with the police presence!! Rome was beautiful also we walked for miles to cover everything - and not as busy as I had expected Easter to be. Make sure you eat at the hotel resturant - a bit pricey but good food. One word of warning - we had not encountered any form of hassling from the italian men that everyone had told us (three women) we would experience. Even our very blonde friend just had interested men smiling at her until our last day. When walking through Turbuntina station to get the metro into the city a man spat at two of us for no apparent reason - maybe it was because we were tourists, maybe it was because we were women, we do not know.

The decor was nothing special, but the bathroom was huge (with a tub! So nice when you've been trekking all over the city!), and the room itself was a lot larger than I expected from a European hotel room. Another great feature was the room had a tile floor, not some icky, mildewy carpet that you find in a lot of hotels. We also stayed on the 1st floor (2nd floor to Americans), and had a really fabulous wrap-around porch attached to the room. It was really nice to step outside and watch the city waking up in the morning. The biggest negative about the room was the bed, as it was not the most comfortable. I managed just fine, but it bothered my husband a bit. There's also a bit of noise coming from the hallways sometimes, but nothing too terrible. The doors to the porch kept the street noise out surprisingly well. In the room there's a small TV, but only Italian channels and they're very limited. We'd hoped to have at least the BBC, since it was right after the election and I wanted to stay caught up, but mostly we ended up watching bad 80's cartoons in Italian (Anyone remember Sheera?). There's also a mini-fridge loaded with the typical stuff-- Coke, water, beer, etc. All for a ridiculous price, but it's there if you want it. The hotel breakfast was decent, though nothing terribly special, and overpriced. It's convenient though, since there's little else around that area for food. The restaurant is okay, but again, nothing special. Blu Hotel is kinda far from the metro, so if you're planning on using it as your main means of transportation, be prepared for a 10-15 minute walk crossing a few busy roads. It wasn't that big of an issue for us, but Rome in general requires a lot of walking unless you do one of those bus tours, so having to hike back to the hotel at night isn't so fun. Rome is VERY pedestrian-friendly, so the walk itself isn't terrible. I was also very happy to be able to burn so many calories-- I ate whatever I wanted because we walked so much! The closest station is Tiburtina, on the B line. The hotel staff was a mixed experience. They all spoke English very well, which was a relief since my Italian sucks. The male receptionists were very helpful and knowledgeable, giving us directions to places all over the city. My only complaint was that one of the female receptionists was somewhat rude and seemed to be annoyed whenever we asked a question. Overall, I think Blu is a great place for those on a budget that have plenty of time to see the city. We had a great time. Pros: Clean (thanks to the most fantastic housekeeping staff!), mostly quiet, inexpensive and overall a pleasant experience. Cons: not the most comfortable bed, somewhat far from the metro (but still very do-able to most) General tips: If you're going to be using the metro a lot, buy a pass from one of the tobacco shops in the station. We used a machine once, and it ate 30 Euros worth of bills. Not so fun. Save yourself the hassle. Also, Termini station is great for stopping for a quick bite to eat. There's a grocery store on the metro level, and we bought take-away meals and brought them back to the hotel for dinner. Saved us a lot of money-- 3.50 Euros for lasagna! There's also a bunch of fast food places (both ground level and metro level) and a Boulangerie (bakery) that has really great pizza (ground level, on the far end opening up to the street). The best food of the city is to be found at small, take-away shops, so skip the sit-down restaurants and go to the tiny, busy local haunts. You'll be happy you did.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cFor the money this is the best hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Buckeye96", "ReviewID": "UR19902554", "Content": "My wife and I were pleasantly surprised upon arriving at the Blu Hotel Roma.

This hotel is located a little bit away from downtown Rome but getting back and forth on public transportation was a piece of cake. A bus stop is located just outside the hotel and it is only a 5 minute bus ride to the metro station. On the down side, the hotel does not have room service. On a couple of occassions, I walked to a local pizzeria to buy some food for takeout (it was hot out and our room had great air-conditioning). The reception told me that customers were not allowed to eat in the rooms - period. I told her that I had never stayed in a hotel before that didn't allow food to be eaten in the room. Unbelievable! The cable TV service included only 1 English channel (BBC) which is about as much fun as watching paint dry. No FOX news! Oh well...Rome is not a place to spend your time inside watching TV. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and will return the next time we visit Rome.

Basically we used this room for 2 nights just as a place to sleep. We would leave after breakfast and spend most of the day sightseeing returning to the hotel to get ready for dinner and sleep. It is a good walk to the train station. I can see it being a bit much for some people especially if you made several trips a day. The negatives: Some of the staff were very pleasant and others not so much. The electricity did go out while we were there, but the staff was very quick to fix the problem and it was only out for about 20 minutes. The internet was not working during our stay which was disappointing as my husband needed it for his work.

Our surprise when we arrived to the hotel was that for accessing internet, they would give us some kind of ticket with a login and password valid for one hour. In our case, as it was unlimited, we would as for 24 tickets a day and no problem, but internet access would be interrupted every 60 minutes and then you had to login and password again, and again and again. This is absolutely not what we call \"unlimited internet access\" (and to think we paid 40.00 Euro extra PER NIGHT!). They have told us that we would have \"free newspaper\", but is not as in the USA when you have the newspaper at the door of room every morning, there was a pile with two local newspaper at the entrance and you could take them, but that was all. On their website and depliants it says \"satellite TV\". There were only around 10 channles, 8 of which were local italian channels, BBK News and a News channel in Arab. That's it for \"satellite TV\". Also on their website it says that the hotel is at 400 mts. distance from the nearest local subway station which may be true is you draw a straight line on a map. But going up and down through those narrow streets took us around 25-30 minutes walking briskly. On the brighter side we were very plesed with the breakfast served (ham, fresh bread, eggs, etc. ) and the nice ladies who work there and brought nice fresh capuccino to our table.:-) Overall the hotel is clean and new but not cheap, and adding what we paid for extra services that weren't worth, we feel kind of ripped off.

The hotel is clean very new, good service, mini bar in room, balcony rooms, great breadfast, consisting of the usuall, eggs, cheese, danish, yougurt, rolls, ceral, juices, coffee, tea, ect. Staff speaks english and very help ful. The only problem I had was with getting messages from the front desk, always said I did not have any messages but in fact I did. My room was room 232, from April 21-May1. If you are arriving from FCO airport the taxi fare should be only betw E55 to E60's, but you can take the train from the airport to the Hotel, the F1 is about 5 euros and get off at the Turbini station, and take the 409 bus or the 595 bus to the hotel its like 5 to 6 minutes, the stop is right front of the hotel, The hotel is face inside a paking area so you really have to pay attention at 1st for you do see the Blu sign and its gated in. The metro fare is 1 Euro for 75minutes once you validate your card at the turnstyle. Their are a few clubs in walking distance, and a pub/bar. Also in the hotel lobby is a bar. From the hotel you can walk 5 to 8 minutes to the Turbini station, and take the train again 4 stops to Termini and from their follow your guide. This hotel is affordable and very clean. But again not centre but can get to the Centre. BUT BUT BUT PLEASE PLEASE WATCH YOUR POCKETS, THEY PICK POCKET HERE LIKE ITS GOING OUT OF STYLE. It did not happend to me they tried but I am from NY so I refuse to let that happedn to me. But watch out for this. It is very easy to get from city to city, the information booth is in each station, if you are going over to the next city its better to find out the schudule for the train the day before. You can take the IC train which is the local, like 11/2 hours later arrival than the EuroStar. The IC is cheaper than the Eurostar but go to the same places. from Rome to Naples is 3 hours on the IC, and from Florence to Veneice is 31/2hours Eurostar. from Rome to Pomeii is 21/2 or 3 hours I forgot but not long nice ride very interesting and historical in the Old Pomeii. Where comfortable shoe please for the entire trip. We had beautiful wheather the whole time. Well I hope this helps I know its long, but I am trying to give whatever I learned to others.
