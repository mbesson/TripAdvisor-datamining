We have decided for this hotel, because we are familiar with Etap standards and it offers free parking. We were certainly satisfied. Accommodation was smooth - reservation number input in the verification machine. When we passed by reception, very friendly staff accepted our payment and suggested us to take tourist 3-day tube ticket. It is valid for the tube (U-Bahn), Berlin light-rail (S-Bahn), trams, and buses. It also comes with loads of discounts. Be prepared to use all your German and limbs. ;) After all, it is Germany. The parking is around the corner, but is is an extremely close-by corner. ;) No problem there. Access to the light-rail is great - 10 minutes walk. We actually almost didn't use the tube, S-Bahn was fast and brought us close enough to places we wanted to visit. WiFi in the rooms free of charge (silly registration with email address needed). The rest was of high German-Etap standards. This hotel is especially recommended to all who want to come to Berlin by car and take it from there my mass transportation.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "didowollongong", "ReviewID": "UR114124789", "Content": "Location for a day trip into Berlin is good. About a 10 minute walk to the railway station, there's a tram close to the hotel which you can catch to get to the train station if you wish. The first night we couldn't sleep at all due to the constant running of the very noisy trams right next to the hotel. It was too hot with the window shut and too noisy with it open. When requesting another room the next morning there was no problem at all and we were moved to the other side which was so much better, quieter and cooler. The staff were helpful with directions.

Given that Berlin's \"city centre\" is pretty spread out, even staying in \"central\" hotels tends to mean some travelling to get to the sights, so the extra travelling isn't so much of a hassle. The Etap Berlin Marzahn can be found on the eastern edge of Berlin, in a commercial district about 5-10 minutes walk from Springpfuhl S-bahn station. Trams M8 and 17 stop outside, and also stop on the station bridge so if you don't feel like walking you can hop on the tram - your S-bahn ticket also allows travel on the trams... Springpfuhl is served by S-bahn lines S7 and S75, which together run every 5 minutes or so to central Berlin, and the S7 continues to Potsdam so you can easily get your palace fix... Allow about 25 minutes for the journey from Springpfuhl to the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof by S-bahn; The hotel entrance is at the rear of the building, and reception is on the first floor rather than the ground floor; just hop in the lift unless you feel like climbing the stairs. As in usual in Etap hotels, reception is only open certain hours, and the rest of the time you check in using a terminal at the hotel entrance. When the reception is closed, the main entrance door is locked and your room keycode unlocks the door. Each floor also has a door unlocked with your room keycode, but I only ever saw the door on my floor closed once. I arrived during staffed hours, and was rapidly checked in. However, I was unable to get into my room, but that was quickly resolved by the reception clerk who came up to my room and discovered that I was simply operating the keypad too quickly for the system to handle! All good fun. ;-) The previous reviewer has posted a photo of the room, so I need not describe it; if all you need from a hotel room is a bed and a shower, then an Etap room is perfectly adequate. If you want frills, then why are you in a budget hotel? As there's little for me to review about the hotel, here's some hopefully useful information about the immediate area: People who worry about such things should be aware that there is a sex shop at the front of the building. Sex shops are very much part of German society, and can be found in most shopping malls; this one is no different to any of the others and, quite frankly, if you have a problem with it being there then it's you who has a problem rather than the country you're in! There's also a drugstore at the side of the building. Between the hotel and the S-bahn station are a McDonalds for those desperate to get a fill of junk-food, and there are both Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets near the station which will come in handy for useful things like bottles of water at drastically less than tourist-trap-rip-off prices. Anyone arriving late (after 20:00) and needing to get supplies from a supermarket should jump on the S-bahn one stop towards central Berlin as there's a Kaiser's supermarket adjacent Friedrichsfelde Ost station which is open until midnight (very rare in Germany, in my experience!)", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Jose dos Campos", "Title": "\u201cA good value for the price you pay for.\u201d", "Author": "ccipola", "ReviewID": "UR19055270", "Content": "This is a typical ETAP Hotel and I liked a lot.
