We stayed in a double room, which was quite small and a bit dated. The room had an en-suite bathroom which again was very small, and the room was a bit cold as only one of the radiators worked. There was also a buzzing sound coming from somewhere in the room, only faint but was quite annoying after a while. There was breakfast in the morning which I cant comment on as I had to leave early for work so didnt get to try it. The bloke on reception was friendly enough and was working throughout the night. The reason I chose this hotel was for its location and price, it is in central London, walking distance from Euston Railway station and I only payed \u00a349 for the night with en-suite bathroom and breakfast in the morning. For that reason I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a cheap overnight stay in central london.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay with these liars - Major construction work is taking place for weeks\u201d", "Author": "Julie_AnneLondon", "ReviewID": "UR124289961", "Content": "I arrived at 10am after flying all night from Cuba.

I made the mistake of booking a basement-floor room -- all that was left so I was happy to get it -- but the closeness of Euston station means that you can hear trains/tube running underneath the ground (this would be the case for any of the hotels in this area I presume). I couldn't hear any outside noise so I'd guess other rooms in the hotel would be quieter. The decor, carpet, bathroom etc. was dated but scrupulously clean.

As others have said, it's fine for a (relatively) cheap London hotel, with a good location in Bloomsbury, friendly staff and a reasonable (not brilliant) breakfast included in the price. Our room was clean and neat, but far too hot - we had to switch the radiators off and leave the windows open for a couple of hours to get it down to a sensible temparature. But at least we had the option of doing that, unlike the many chain hotels where you can't control heating or ventilation. The main problem was that we were woken constantly through the night by the noise - both from the resident in the room above stumbling in (and tripping over the bedside table from the sound of it), and of the person in the next room who kept coming and going in the small hours, each time banging the fire door on the landing loudly. There is a big sign saying \"please don't bang this door\" but it obviously isn't doing the trick. I'd recommend they invest a few quid in some mechanical means to stop it slamming closed, because as it is I wouldn't want to risk staying there again.

I went to the Avonmore with a my mate Dave, we needed somewhere to put our heads down in between getting drunk and watching Blur in Hyde Park - and that was it. For 50 quid a night in the centre of London i really didnt expect much so i thought the Avonmore was fine. The staff are flippin lovely, the slightly camp fella on reception always had a smile on his face and a genuinely interesting line of chat for us. The foreign lady who ran the breakfast room was smart, alert and fairly efficient. She could do with a pen and pad though as she kept forgetting our order - but then again we were speaking English and it's obviously not her strongest point. They all felt genuine that was the main thing, like they actually gave a damn about the place. Most chain/franchise style cheap hotel's staff look like they're paid to grin inanely and make crap small talk nowadays. The hotel itself? Hmmm.... well..... You cant polish a turd but you can keep it clean and tidy. The decor was tired and mismatched, the furniture even more so - apart form the beds actually which were very comfy! The ensuite was bloody awful (but clean!), the shower curtain was minging and it was hard to sit on the loo without banging your knees on the opposite wall. Plus the fan didnt work so a bog the size of an understairs cupboard gets very hot, very quickly! We thought all the furniture was crooked till we realised the floor was actually sloping in from the edges as all the joists are obviously bowing with the age of the place. I've got a bigger screen on my mobile than the telly in the room too, plus the wardrobe only had 3 (mismatched - natch) coat hangers in it. The room was in fact tiny - especially since it was supposed to be a triple! The view was bloody awful too - but then again it is central London. So in summary? It's a dump. But it's a CLEAN dump, with lovely staff, comfy beds, and a great cooked breakfast all for 50 quid a night. If you're after a romantic break or even a family friendly base - avoid.
