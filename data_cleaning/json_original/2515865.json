We had to groups that were flying at differnt times in our party and had asked for adjoining rooms. When we arrived we were told that the adjoining rooms were not available and they would have to split us up. This was a real let down as we were travelng with infants. Also, when I checked in, I told them I wished to put both rooms on my credit card which I though meant that both rooms had been checked-in. However, with the second part of our party arriving around midnight we were surpised when we received a call around 9pm telling us that they had given our room away and that they would have to move that part of the party to another hotel but comp that room for the night. Since our ride was picking us up at this hotel the next morning it put a real kink in our travel plans, but it was eventually overcome. My only other complaint was that we had specifically requested a pack-in play be in the room when we arrived and had to wait a long time fime after we checked in for to arrive. Not fun with a cranky tired infant. Other than those things the hotel was fine. Besides their mess-ups the front desk staff went out of their way to be accomidating. They even provided us some free milk for our infant from the kitchen. You could definately tell they were overwhelmed by some competition going on at the airport convention center. The free airport shuttle was nice, but it services a few other hotels in the area so you may have to wait to be dropped off. The room itself was quite large. Like most springhills it is a Studio suite vs. a one bedroom like an embassy. The room was very clean and they provided a lot of extra linens. The beds were very comfy and you didn't hear much noise from the near by aiport or approaching aircraft. Like one of the previous posters said, the free internet was very slow. The large LCD tv had a good selection of programming but was lacking much programming for kids (it is Orlando afterall). Breakfast was nice. They had a nice assortment of warm and cold items. it isn't the embassy suites made to order breakfast, but enough to fill you up. Was glad they had milk here for our babies as the small shop did not carry it. The pool was nice, but small. Enjoyed swimming here with my son. It looks like they have done some recent concrete work to its apron. There was a nice selection of restruants within walking distances: Tony Romas, Chili's and a BBQ place too.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clifton Park NY", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Surprise\u201d", "Author": "jyoung3381", "ReviewID": "UR128328636", "Content": "We are Marriott Platinum Elites and usually stay at Marriotts and Courtyards.

It was nice that there is a wall between the living room and bedroom sections, although it is not closed off completely. We stayed for about a week and the breakfast never varies, so after a while, it gets tiresome as the food is just standard fare. The hotel was full while we were there, but there was always room in the dining room. I noticed that quite a few people just grabbed food and brought it upstairs to eat in their rooms. If the weather was warmer, it would have been nice to eat outside as they had some tables set up, but it was too cold in the mornings. For a business traveler, the location near the airport is very convenient but be aware that Route 536 is full of tolls in all both directions and heading to the Kennedy Space Center, we could see that they were in the process of adding yet another toll plaza! The hotel's wireless internet in the rooms is pretty slow. It takes a very long time to load pages, and if you use the hotel's computer, its browser is so ancient that it prevented us from ordering online tickets. Because of their computer's limitations, printing docs is a real pain. Their network needs a major upgrade. Having a laundry room is very handy for business travelers who have to stay longer than expected. You can just walk down the hall instead of hauling everything to a laundromat.

I hold no ill feelings towards SpringHill Suites or Mariott Hotels. This will just be for informational purposes for others. We spent two nights here on our honeymoon. The first and the last night in particular. We did this to try and maximize our time on Disney property. The first night we called the hotel from the airport to get a shuttle. I don't think you actually HAVE to call them. They tell you one will be there in around 15 minutes. If you do call though you will be guaranteed a spot. Don't quote me on this, just seems that way. Everything with check-in went fine, the room was nicely cooled when we got in there. Shortly after we went to Tony Roma's for dinner. In my opinion it wasn't as good as I was expecting. We shared a meal though and got a free appy because we were staying at SpringHill. If it weren't for that we probably would have gone somewhere else. Back at the hotel the room was a nice size and the bed was comfortable enough, but after being on a plane for 7+ hours and a 1.5 hour layover with another 45 minutes waiting on the taxiway we could have slept on a few bales of hay to be honest. The next morning we stuck around long enough to have some of the free breakfast. I must say the selection was nice, from muffins and fruit to cereal, to hot items like sausages and bacon. They even had waffle irons to make your own waffles. If you want hot chocolate just ask one of the staff and they can get it for you. We got a ride shortly after back to the airport to catch the shuttle to Disney. The last night of our trip we stayed again. It cost a little bit more this time, but not a big deal. Oh I should mention, they never checked my ID for the AAA/CAA discount. Just thought I would mention that. Upon check-in the guy working the front desk asked us if we would be ok with an accesible room because there were no regular king rooms left. We were fine with that. I was actually curious to see the difference. All I can say is that the room seems a lot bigger. The walking areas are much wider for obvious reasons. The bathroom has a walk-in shower with a bench in the back. Other than that, nothing to complain about with it being accesible. One complaint we had though was the complete lack of a garbage can. I'm sure this was just an oversight and I pointed it out to the manager. After cheking in we had booked a time for the shuttle back to the airport for 5:30 am as we had a flight back to Vancouver at 8:30am. After we got to the room my wife decided to call the front desk and set a wake-up call for 4:30 am. The night was a little rough as the AC wasn't on when we got there so we turned that on for a little bit, but it was too loud to leave on all night. Suffice to say we both got a little warm and sleep became more restless. Well I got woken up by my frantic wife at 6 am going...WHAT TIME IS IT?!?! Clearly the wake-up call we had requested never came. We jumped out of bed and got dressed, missed out on the breakfast we had bought ahead of time as we wouldn't have time for the hotel's. As we were getting ready the room's phone rings and the girl at the front desk wants to know if we want on the 6 am shuttle as we had missed our 5:30 am shuttle. I was just like you notice THAT, but not our wake-up call??? Anyways, she apologized and when we finally got downstairs I reiterated my anger about not getting a wake-up call. The girl was like \"Do you have any questions about your bill?\" All I could say was \"Yeah, why do I have to pay it when you can't even wake me up on time?\" The end of the story is a happy one though, we made it on our flight although we smelt and felt gross and the stress was not a great way to start the day nor end our trip. All in all if I ever had to stay near MCO again I think I would stay here again. Only the next time I'll be sure to set my own alarm.

Not having seen the hotel rooms here I can't compare the quality, but if your star rating system means anything, they put me in a lower standard place, and did not offer me any financial compensation for a price difference. Of course, this is extremely difficult to pin them down on, as the prices change day by day!

For the price, this is better than the Marriott down the street.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "northern va", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel Near Airport\u201d", "Author": "traveller006_8", "ReviewID": "UR53374462", "Content": "Our family stayed here for one night after a Disney Trip over Thanksgiving weekend. It was conveiently located near the airport. We dropped off our rental car and called the hotel and the shuttle came to pick us up. It is within walking distance to a few restaurants and they gave us coupons for these as well. The hotel is very well-maintained and clean. Free breakfast in the morning was nice as was the complimentary shuttle service to the airport.

Nice hotel in a good location near the airport and most of the car rental places in the area*. Room was large and friendly. The beds were large and very comfortable. The morning breakfast was good. The hotel is not too far off the main road of the area, meaning it is easy to find someplace nearby to eat. We had little interaction with the staff, but those we did talk to were helpful. Check-in and out were painless. *Note that there is a gas station in the area (right across the street from the Hertz lot) that charges over $4.50/gallon (twice the going rate) for gas - trying to gouge people returning their cars. They obviously know what they're doing since they don't have their price posted like most normal gas stations do. There's a 7-11 a mile or so up the road, as well as a few other stations nearby, selling for reasonable prices.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, FL", "Title": "\u201cThis Hotel Rocks - we will be back!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Minimom56", "ReviewID": "UR46536120", "Content": "This hotel was fantastic - from the moment we checked in until we left, we were very impressed!!!

I've stayed in Marriott's for 30 years and never had this happen before. Evidently the maid was only cleaning rooms that were unoccupied because guests had checked out. Strange!

My daughter and son-in-law arrived first - before 11:30 and asked if an early check in was possible. They allowed them to go ahead and check in. We had reserved a Queen Suite. It was a little small for 5 people but doable. Our refrigerator didn't work and when we called about it, a maintenance guy was at our door within 5 minutes. He replaced the refrigerator and we had no additional problems with it. We had breakfast every morning - it was a very nice continental breakfast. The usual offerings of cereal, yogurt, toast/bagels plus homemade waffles (YUMMY) along with sausage patties, egg rounds. Also fresh fruit (apples and bananas) Housekeeping did a great job - leaving extra towels for us. We were on the 3rd floor - no noise problems at all. The pool was small but felt wonderful after a hot day at local attractions!! Plenty of towels outside at the pool. The hotel was VERY clean and everyone who worked there that we dealt with were WONDERFUL and very accommodating. Mini safe in one of the closets. Bag of bed linens in closet for the sofa bed. I would stay here again and again and again! Just a note - if you plan to bring your xbox/wii for the kids in the evening, you are not able to connect via the internet - they have that blocked. There is no restaurant at the hotel but every food choice imaginable is available within 10 miles. One thing I would recommend if you are going to be coming and going a lot - buy a sun pass for all the tolls they have!! If you get the express pass, the money never expires so even if you don't visit often, you still have it.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "SpringHill Suites Orlando Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d878544-Reviews-SpringHill_Suites_Orlando_Airport-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$112 - $173*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5828 Hazeltine National Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32822</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515865", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9e/d7/9ed7268a3e4a95a4282bd4d3fcb269876large.jpg"}}
