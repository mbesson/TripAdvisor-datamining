We intended to use the hide away bed for the kids but once we pulled it out and realized how disgusting and uncomfortable it looked, chose to let the kids sleep with us. The next day as I reviewed my bank account I realized that not only had priceline charged my card for our stay but the hotel double charged it as well! The staff assured me it would be corrected right away. Finally, yesterday (Tuesday) it was put back in my account. This morning, I found that they had placed yet ANOTHER charge to my card. I called and was tranferred to the accounting department where I left a message. Hopefully, they can correct it for good this time. What I do find interesting however, is the fact that even after all of this inconvenience, not once have they offered anything to compensate my troubles.

Third-party prices fill otherwise unsold rooms, and provide the hotel with opportunities to sell services and win future business. My advice to Priceline customers: pay attention to reviews, articulate your needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet and you bought from Priceline, tell Priceline in writing; use snail mail to the company\u2019s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u2019ve found them very responsive. Talk to local management directly, pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational.] If you are buying on Priceline an airport-area hotel of 3-stars, this will generally be what you get for $45-$55 depending on season. COMMENDABLE: The E-W Light Rail fronts the hotel, right out the front door; it\u2019s accessed by crossing at a close intersection with traffic signals. Clean basic rooms, airport shuttle, pleasant employees, functional computer for boarding passes in lobby; free functional wireless in rooms [many CPs charge for this}. The employee who handled my baggage to the room showed me controls and went to get ice. Excellent and reasonably-priced breakfast buffet with made-to-order egg options; the only bad thing was coffee, watered-down and old. Front desk employees helpful in recommending places to eat near Arizona Center. I went on rail, ate at Restaurant 1130, able there to find quiet and had a great server, Tino, and a lovely, perfect salad meal and the best housemade key lime pie ever. The hotel doesn\u2019t charge for 1-800 calls. Quiet despite airport proximity. Temp controls on the unit, difficult to make comfortable. NEED FIXING: One person covers front desk at 5 AM, can\u2019t do everything; the phone is slow to answer; I stood for 15 minutes waiting to check out and leave a package for Fedex. Employees shouldn\u2019t ever be put in this position. Security finally roused the clerk. Bathroom break? Someone else can be cross-trained to cover for that break.

Easily the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. All of the following happened on our first day. Our first room (#703) had an air conditioner that wasn't working and after maintenance examined it, was inoperable. No big deal, so our second room (#707) seemed fine, but when it was time to get ready for dinner, we discovered that there was no hot water. Maintenance came up again and alas, was unable to remedy the situation. After having moved twice already, we made sure to check everything in our third room (#708) across the hall. Things seemed to be looking up but when I opened the dresser drawer beneath the TV, I discovered a bottle of urine in a water bottle! Being in the lodging industry myself, I understand that certain maintenance issues arise, especially in an aging infrastructure. The urine was the last straw though. Because the general manager was gone for the weekend we were referred to two different managers on duty. We were given tickets for breakfast and some drink coupons to use at the hotel bar. It didn't make up for our horrible experience, but it was a nice gesture. Needless to say, all of this put a big damper on our weekend. The worst part about all of this was not receiving a reply from the general manager, Daron Brotherton, after writing him a letter explaining the ordeal.

It is a good hotel to stay at for business travel. The inside had some updating done to the common areas and looked quite nice with bright Arizona colors. The rooms were not bad and we slept really well as the beds and pillows were quite comfortable. Our first stay of this trip was on the 3rd floor. Our second stay was on the 8th floor and seemed to have more updating done to those rooms. We faced East and had the morning sun, but not a hot room to come back to at the end of the day. We were really impressed with the food. We were expecting average food, but apparently they have a chef or two, that really knows how to cook. This was our experience for breakfast, lunch and dinner meals. We love consistency! The dinner salads are great. So is the build a burger plate. The last night I had the salmon dinner. That was awesome! We really enjoyed Kristin in the lounge. She's a sweetie and took really good care of us. The drinks were good and there were a couple of flat panel tv's to enjoy as well. Eric in the restaurant is really great too. Kind of feels like your younger brother! We also met Sheila in the restaurant. She is the restaurant manager I believe. She is really nice too. The pool area was very comfortable. Each day we would go outside with our laptop and books (free wireless internet was great), while wearing our swimsuits. What a lifestyle! We would swim and work. Sometimes we had the whole pool area to ourselves. But usually there were only a few people around during the day. They have a couple of large umbrella tables for shade and a mixture of shade and sun areas for the lounge chairs. We had pool service each day, and would have our large dinner salads out at the pool, with our refreshing iced teas with lemon. I wish I was there right now, but unfortunately I am looking out my window on a cloudy / rainy day in the pacific northwest. :-( When we first arrived, we had an issue in the room that needed attention from the maid. We called Daron, the front desk manager, and he Immediately took care of it. He put Ann Marie, the Executive Housekeeper on the case, and she was amazing. She made sure we had everything we needed and more. We noticed the management is very attentive to your needs. You just need to let them know. We also noticed they have a free shuttle for the airport. And the light-rail stops across the street which is very convenient. As far as the area, it is an o.k. area of town. I wouldn't want to travel there with my kids. I think this hotel is best suited for adults and business travel. I am a big walker but found that I wasn't that comfortable walking in the neighborhood, so I stuck to swimming laps at the pool and working out at the hotel's fitness club, which was more than adequate for my exercise needs. All in all, we really had a great time, and will definitely be back.

The room was pretty nice, very clean and comfortable. There were plenty of towels and basic toiletries in the room. The bed was very comfortable. Housekeeping did what they were supposed to, putting in clean towels, making the bed. The television had basic free channels, but everything else you have to pay for. I tried the free Internet access in my room and it worked fine. If you didn't bring your laptop and you need to print boarding passes or whatever, there are some computers hooked up to the Internet in the lobby. My room overlooked the parking garage as well as one of the runways for the airport. This meant listening to airplanes taking off from time to time. A little annoying, but the air conditioner will mask that noise if you have it running. For breakfast, they offer a buffet from 6 AM to 10 AM which has an egg station, cereals, French toast, bagels, fresh fruit, bacon, and even a waffle maker. The staff was very nice as well. In addition to having issues with check-in, other cons include: the hotel elevators need their carpet replaced desperately and they should try to vacuum the hallways more often. It smelled like mold or something as I was walking down the hall to my room. Even adding perhaps a scented plug-in or something would've helped. The parking garage elevator was off-line one day for painting so everybody had to use the stairs which probably haven't been cleaned in years. It may make sense to sweep the stairs every now and then. I tried the room service one night. My food was delivered within 15 minutes literally. The quality of the food was okay, although the french fries I ordered were pretty bland.

A limo driver told me their shuttle was completely unreliable and that I should just take a cab - so I called back and was told it was close.

Although the hotel was renovated at some point, as evidenced by the lobby and some updates to the room decor, this hotel is not one that I would recommend. Upon reaching the airport, it took over 20 minutes for the shuttle to show up after I called the hotel. Since I arrived at night, I thought this was a little long considering a key selling point of this hotel is that it is an \"airport\" hotel. I had emailed the hotel my requests related to my room, as I am a light sleeper and need quiet to sleep through the night. I am also a member of the hotel chain's loyalty program. No one responded to my email, which was sent through the property's website at least one week prior to my arrival. After discussing my preferences with the front desk person upon arrival at the property, I was given a room on the \"quiet\" floor. In the first two minutes in the room, I heard train whistles blaring. OK, let's try another room... The next room features the delightful sounds of aircraft engines. I have stayed at other airport properties (including one at LHR) before and have not heard this much noise. I don't think this property is familiar with the concept of sound-proof or double-glazed windows. I suppose that I should just be grateful for the earplugs and the \"Sleep Advantage\" CD in the room. The room is too dark. The lamps do not provide enough light. The lighting in the bathroom is also too dark. The light fixture in the bathroom has a broken covering, too. Now here's the gross part. I always request two beds, even when I travel solo because the beds are not always up to my standards. I figure with two beds if something is wrong with one, I still have another. Well, in my room at the Crowne Plaza, the first bed has someone else's hair on it. I am not talking about one random strand that may have fallen off the housekeeper as she was making the bed. I am talking about several hairs of different lengths and textures. There is no way that someone could have made that bed and not seen all of that hair on the white sheet -- especially since the hair was jet black!!! The other bed did not show any obvious filth, and given the late hour of my check in tonight (and being on my second room in this hotel), I chose to use the second bed and plan to address the housekeeping issue with management in the morning.

She told me that I would need to provide my own transportation to the race start. After a couple of questions, I finally asked to see the manager. While I was waiting for the manager to arrive, one of the other gals gave me a snotty smile, and stated, \"Sorry for the misinformation\" and walked away. After 15 minutes, the Front Desk manager arrived and told me that the shuttle was included in a special marathon rate and that it had been sold out for 3 months. I informed him that was not what was listed on the website, or I would have booked accordingly. He said, \" I know the information was wrong, but there is no shuttle.\" I asked him how we could solve this, and he only replied, \"You'll have to take a taxi.\" There were other guests in the lobby who also booked for that hotel on the pretense that there was a race day shuttle, who were now without transportation. The manager was unwilling to help remedy the situation, and only took the position that I booked the wrong rate. The next morning, after being dropped off by alternate transportation, I was informed that the Crown Plaza shuttle was stuck in traffic miles back and that the race participants would not make the start time. My previous experiences with Crown Plaza hotels, and the ICP chain in general is that they have great customer service and are willing to help. The attitude of the entire front desk to a barrage of employees was unacceptable. This was a big event, and due to misadvertising, it was spoiled for many. I would not recommend this hotel. Their management is not concerned about guest satisfaction.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cWe felt like we hit the jackpot...for what we paid!!!!

I really liked the change from the usual hotel furnishings that one would find. I stayed in a king non-smoking room on the second floor, and my bed was absolute heaven. Crowne Plaza makes sure you get a good nights sleep with comfortable beds and down comforters as well as free earplugs and eye mask. In addition, they also give you a sleep CD which you can put into the CD alarm clock radio they have next to the bed for a good nights rest. On the CD you will find several tracks of relaxation exercizes to help you get a good nights rest. One word to the wise, the HOT water in this hotel is SCALDING hot. Enough that they could be opening themselves up to a lawsuit, it's practically boiling hot temperature, so if you have kids traveling with you, be cautious of the hot water!! I did not use the pool or jacuzzi, but they are both outdoors and open 24 hours, which is a nice change from the usual \"closed at 10\" attitude that most hotels have. The work out room, which I did use, is also open 24 hours, and has 2 treadmills, 2 bikes, and 1 eliptical machine. The cardio equipment seemed nice, but the weight equipment was limited and a bit dated. Checkin was fast and easy, I didn't have to wait long, and was given my request for a room on a lower floor. This is a mid-rise hotel, and the parking garage is DEATCHED from the hotel so you have to take the elevator down to the ground floor and then walk a few short steps into the hotel lobby. This could be an inconvenience for those traveling with pets, although I can't say what the hotel's policy is for pets, there is no easy access from parking to your hotel room, it all flows through the lobby. There is a huge light rail construction going on out in front of the hotel property. This makes access to the hotel a bit of a pain, as well as having to deal with some construction noise during the day time. For those who don't like construction, I would stay elsewhere, or call ahead and ask the hotel if the construction is complete, but I don't think it will be finished until mid-2008. In addition, this hotel is close to the airport, so you will hear planes taking off from your room. If this is a problem, stay elsewhere. I was so tired, and the bed so comfortable, i was able to fall asleep and tune out the airport noises.
