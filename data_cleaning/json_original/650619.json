The staff was reliable and friendly and available and willing to help at all times. They gave me very good information about the city and also had a helpfull tourist map that they gave to me. The price level is very good, definitely competitive, with a good sized breakfast included. Compared to the price level in Rome, I actually found it quite reasonable. The central location in Rome makes it a very good starting point to wherever you want to go. There is a supermarket only about 100 meters from the hotel. The hotel is also located away from any high-traffic streets, making it a relaxed, peaceful place to stay. The hotel offered everything I needed for an enjoyable city trip to Rome and I would certainly recommend it to anyone else.
