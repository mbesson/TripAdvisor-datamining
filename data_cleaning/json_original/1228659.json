There is an argentian steakhouse only 8 min walk away at Kurt Schmacher square. Great food and unbelievably good prices. Just one to be aware off. Please note the hotel is underneath the approach path to the airport. No flights after midnight but until then you will hear the planes coming in even with the window closed.

Yes planes are noticeable - use ear plugs if it bothers you. It's more like a truck going past than a plane. Room 421 has a good desk but no desk light and the room lights throw so little light onto it that typing at night is a penance (put your suitcase on the bed and your laptop on it and move a chair over and aim the bed head light at the laptop). You also need a good ten foot cord to plug your laptop in if using the desk in daylight. I liked the bed. However skimpy pillows and no spares supplied. No shuttle service to airport. If you have a lot of baggage you will have to use a taxi which will moan a lot about the Dorint being too close to make a taxi ride worthwhile. No minibar. Room safe does not work.

The station and area felt totally safe, even late at night. Its also just a couple of stops on the airport bus from Tegel. There are lots of snack kiosks (currywurst), ethnic restaurants (Turkish, Indian, Chinese) and fast food joints (Burger King) outside the station for dining. The hotel itself may be on the flight path to Tegel but I never heard the planes from my room, which although basic, was clean. Staff were wonderfully friendly.

To be more precise, the hotel is about .25 miles from the end of the runway. While this would normally not be an issue with hotels that had adequate soundproofing, this hotel does not. The noise of the jets screaming directly overhead from 6:00am to late into the night makes it difficult to relax, get work done, or even get some rest during those hours. If you do stay here, remember to bring ear plugs! When it comes to the room, it was pretty disgusting. The bedding appeared clean and fresh, but the sofa was so stained and dirty, I was afraid to go near it. It looked like something from a crime scene. I've attached pictures so one doesn't think I'm exaggerating a bit. The room size was OK, but it has a rather weird layout. The bed wasn't parallel to the walls, but angled between the two. Look at the pictures to see what I am describing. To make matters worse, the desk area had no power outlets, which made using a laptop there a bit of an annoyance. The internet was very pricey at 24.95 Euro per 24 hours. Finally the neighborhood appeared to be mostly an industrial type area. At night it was very dark and didn't seem like a place you would want to be wandering around. The hotel rate was 90 Euro, which is a decent rate for Berlin.
