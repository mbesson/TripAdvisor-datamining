On this occasion, I have really been let down by TripAdvisor, as I believe this hotel to offer poor value for money. I know it's Sydney etc. so accommodation tends to be expensive, but the room was musty and dank, with furniture and carpets that were probably last changed decades ago. It was almost depressing, definitely not a cool room. Doors and doorknobs were grimy, and we had an ant invasion-all in the space of one night spent there. The so-called 'balcony' is just a verandah running alongside the room, so everyone who passes by is afforded a view of what you're doing. The whole place looks ramshackle and poorly maintained. I would never consider staying again, nor would I recommend the place.

But the homey look and feel is nice too, and you feel \"connected\" with the place and the management as a result. I like it. The hotel is linked with nearby restaurants that can charge back to your room. I have always been in the rear section - large room, fabulous king size bed, but the en-suite is a little pokey and in my last stay was a bit musty - really due for a renovation I think.

McLaren Hotel was one of the only hotels close to Sydney CBD which would allow us to stay for one night. The Hotel is in a beautiful National Trust listed building just up from North Sydney CBD. The rooms themselves are a little dated, but they are perfectly comfortable and clean. We booked a large family room and brought our own port a cot. The room was huge, with an ensuite bathroom, and fridge in the room. It was more than big enough for the four of us. Breakfast was available for (I think) $7, in a lovely looking conservatory on the ground floor. We didn't have it as we were meeting family for breakfast elsewhere but next time we would definitely take this option up. The staff were delightful and extremely helpful, from booking, right through to our check in and check out. They were very welcoming to the children and very professional. It was also great that there was a car park under the hotel as the local streets have a lot of parking restrictions. Apart from the staff, the best thing about the hotel was its location. 1 minute walk from a bus stop with express buses to the city (about 10 minutes); 5 minute walk to North Sydney station; and 10 minute walk to Crows Nest, with its multitude of cafes and restaurants.

You can get a discounted rate from the hotel if you are booked in to have Lasik Surgery and because of it's close proximity to the clinic it was a good choice on this occasion. However, it is in the commercial district of North Sydney so there is not much around in terms of restaurants, shopping or night life. There are a couple of restaurants within walking distance up the road and about a 10 minute walk to central North Sydney where there are a few shops and more choice for eating in the day but forget about it at night. Although the price is quite reasonable (I paid $150 a night) the hotel is quite old and run down and not my cup of tea. The rooms were large enough and comfortable but the first room I stayed in with a crappy fat back TV which was too snowy to watch so they moved me to another room which had a small 20\" LCD which is a bit silly in this day and age and given the price of TV's now. The bathroom is very average with no real space to put things so it's a little akward but one thing I did like was the old fashined shower head which had good water pressure (just like home). The rooms have a poorly stocked mini bar but it's nice to have a fridge in the room to use. Wireless internet is available for the usual exuberant amount that hotels charge. The staff were nice enough and there is no restaurant on premises but they offer a cheap continental breakfast which is very average and not recommended.
