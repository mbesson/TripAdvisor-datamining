I booked a 5 day stay here for a quiet spring break and it was everything I could have hoped for. It's a very short walk to the beach and the shops, bars and restaurants of 5th Avenue, but is isolated enough that you don't hear the sounds of late night partying. The hotel staff is very helpful and speaks excellent English (if that's a concern for you). The condo itself came with every amenity we needed. The kitchen was fully stocked with appliances and cookware, and it was a five to ten minute walk to the nearest grocery store. Our 2 bedroom condo had the perfect layout for a group, with a large open living room and separate en suite bathrooms. The furniture was a little on the bland side and one of the beds did not appear all that comfortable, but was by no means poor quality. The pool was also wonderful for relaxing if the beach was too windy. The beach club, like all beaches in Mexico, is open to the public, so you will have to deal with folks walking back and forth. However, the wait staff is good and the view superb. Overall, this was the perfect location.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Property\u201d", "Author": "samratami", "ReviewID": "UR126490866", "Content": "We were very pleased with our stay at Porto Playa.

Also the pictures of the condos were very nice. I was afraid i would get disapointed because of my high expectation. It was all the opposite. We had the best of both world : independance of the condos and all the services from an hotel (daily maid, pool, gym etc.) . I highly recommend this concept in playa del carmen because there is so many good restaurant and a lot of action on the 5th avenue . We personnaly ate breakfast at the beach club, had lunch in the condos (bought couple things at nearby grocery MEGA store) and dinner on the 5th avenue. CONDO and ammenities The condo are even nicer in person : spacious , clean, nice deco and art, fully furnished ( we didnt miss anything ). The most impressive feature was the sliding patio door witch open VERY large . It was as if we were outside. The doors were open all the time...no mosquito or noise from other rooms...only the nice waterfall sound (from the pool). The garden is also very impressive with mature trees . It was almost like we were in a tropical forest. The pool and jacuzzi are nicely situated so we can have maximum sun all day. There a very big and complete gym next door (complementary) . We didnt really planned to work out , but we did , with a nice gym like that! LOCATION Best location ,not on the beach but very close . Id rather walk couple step to get to the beach than paying double to be on the beach INDIGO BEACH CLUB (complementary) It was the nicest beach club on the beach. Confortable beach chair and bed. Very good service. The only bad point is that the beach in front is like a port...couple boat are parked there so you have to walk a little farter to go in the water. BREAKFAST Very good and complete . There's a nice buffet . Plus, the eggs (your way) plate and coffee are served to you at you table. Some table are on the beach. STAFF Very friendly and present.

The bed was wonderful, I'm a very picky \"sleeper\", and every morning I would wake up very well rested with no aches. On the negative side, if you're planning on sleeping late, don't count on it. At this unit all of the windows were covered by very sheer shades, letting almost all of the light in. One complaint was that one bedroom didn't have a t.v., and this can be annoying for the parents of a small child clamoring for cartoons in the morning. Loved the kitchen, we stocked up at the MEGA, which is a large, well stocked supermarket, and had at least one meal in per day. Another plus was the breakfast included at the beach club a couple of blocks away. Although the selection is not very large, the chilaquiles verdes are great!! As is the fresh fruit at the \"mini\" buffet. All in all, I would definitely go back, especially when travelling with a large group or family with small kids for a very relaxed, laid back vacation. I am not particularly fond of Playa del Carmen, I prefer Cancun, but if PdC is of your liking, I think you will love this hotel.

We stayed at Porto Playa for 4 days in room 211. We have been to Playa many times and its one of our favorite places. We personally like to stay close to 5th avenue and the beach. We were not interested in an all inclusive because we enjoy the many restuarants, beach clubs and bars playa has to offer. This was the PERFECT location for us. It was one block to the beach and one block to 5th avenue. We rented a 2bd 2ba penthouse. It was very spacious, clean and a great value. However, I had several issues with the room. It wouldn't stop me from coming back but I might would look into other options before booking here if any of these things would bother you. There was no bathtub in either bathroom. The bathroom sink vanities were very small. They had vessel sinks which took up most of the space and the lighting was so dim. It was very difficult to get ready for dinner after the sun went down. The room also had a very funky smell. Not sure what it was, kind of like old wet towels. The biggest annoyance of the stay was the outside shade that was supposed to cover the master bedroom window. The patio door to get to the window shade was locked and we couldnt open it. The sun was so bright it woke us up very early the first morning. So we asked if someone could please unlock it and pull it down so that this wouldnt happen again. They said they couldnt get a key until the following day. So again the 2nd day there we were blinded by the light at 6 something am. The third morning was the only morning we were able to sleep in because the next morning we had to check out and catch our flight. Aggravating! Also, the 2nd bedroom had twin beds. We didnt use this room except to nap on occassion because it was darker. I can't imagine a couple being able to use these beds and push them together comfortably. Perfect for kids or friends but not a second couple. So if you are traveling and need two real queen or kings Id make sure and verify that they are legitimately just that and not twin beds that you can push together. We also thought that we would use the roof top portion of our penthouse. We didnt, not once. It was very nice and I could imagine going up there with a large group of people for a barbeque or something. It had a hottub, which wasn't working. Not sure why. But we really didnt care enough to bother with it. It had a shower, lounge chairs, fridge and bbq pit. Plenty of space. It was not connected through the inside of the unit though. You had to walk outside and up stairs to get to it. Minor annoyance. And when they say it has a partial ocean view...theyre not kidding. Barely any, like a sliver. And the view from room 211 was construction. I know it may seem that Im complaining a lot but really Im not. These are more tips for future travelers and things to think about. The only complaint I really have is about the taj beach club. Its free and we tried it the first day. There are a bunch of boats right in front of it so you have to walk a ways down to actually be able to swim. not a great view either. We also ate at this beach club for our first meal and it was just ok. They made my sandwich with mayonaisse after I told them not to and they charged us to make another one. I found this completely unaccepatable and I can say that has never happened to me in my life. I would not recommend this beach club to anyone. We went down to Mosquito beach and laid on their comfortable beach beds the following days. Its only 20 pesos a day. It was by far the best money we spent. All in all, Id come back and stay again. It really was a nice clean place, with beautiful grounds, awesome location and great value. I think couples, families, friends and just about any type of traveler would enjoy this place. Except for maybe someone that wanted to be right on the beach.

Typically we rent a private home in either Playa del Carmen or nearby Puerto Aventuras, but wanted to try the whole condo/hotel experience. We loved it. We stayed in 206. There ARE some nearby construction sites that put a damper on the view from the master bedroom, but I wasn't really there to stare out the window. Not even 24 hours into our trip I stupidly fell down the stairs walking out of the unit. The stairs were damp since it was raining and I had the most stupid flip flops on that had no tread and I totally hydroplaned. Utterly an accident and I find in no way should Porto Playa be responsible. However, I did break my elbow and needed medical attention. Within minutes staff was in my room and offering to have a doctor attend to me there in the room. We decided I should probably go to a clinic since I was bleeding and needed x-ray. Roberto was very helpful with suggesting a clinic where I was x-rayed and nearly ended up in a cast. He even rode with us to the clinic. Since it was my elbow, and it was a non-displaced fracture, I was left without a cast and was able to go diving and get in the pool etc. YES!!! After all, the ENTIRE reason we were in Playa was to get dive certified!!! Roberto made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable..bunches of extra pillows, ice and even a curtain to help with the light so I could rest my arm for a day. Roberto also recommened Phantom Divers, after another local dive shop seemingly lost our reservation. Phantom divers is right down the block and they were great!! They accomodated my bum arm and I am now a certified diver. We did partake in lounging at El Taj and the food there was great too. I can't wait to return to Porto Playa with my husband and children. The location is perfect and very quiet even though it is close to 5th avenue. Also, I wish I would have pulled back the fitted sheet and checked the namebrand of mattresses, but ALL of the beds in 206 were supremely comfortable.

The compound had a cute setup, with tropical palm trees and nice trimmings, but all Porto guests were allowed access and were given towel to Taj's condo hotels, which is even more amazing with its beachfront location. I suppose the main downfall to this hotel is the construction adjacent to the place. That said, we were never there so it wasn't a major issue, at least for me. It did, however, block the view. Other than that all in all this was a great place to congregate and the price made it even better.

The property is lovely, the room was fantastic, and the location was great. Here are our thoughts after staying for almost two weeks... Why we'd book again - Tremendous Value: Great property, nice rooms, well located, very reasonable rates (May is off-season, and we were able to get an additional 50% off, as we booked only about four weeks out). - Great Pool: The pool was reported to be the best in the city and we loved it. The lower pool initially looked too small to be functional, but it turned out to be a perfect option for our young son who was just learning to swim. - It's Quiet: Although we were in the city and close to some nightclubs, the property was extremely quite and tranquil. It was a beautiful oasis in the heart of the city. We were in bed early every night yet never heard a thing. - Excellent Service: The housekeeper came by daily and did a meticulous job cleaning the room. The staff was friendly and was relatively quick to respond to any requests. Why we'd consider something else - Beach Proximity: We were under the impression that the property was just a half block from the beach. It's actually a full block (think between two New York City Avenues). You can't hear the Ocean and can only see if from a few rooms on the top floor. It's a short walk to the beach, but if you want to be right on the Ocean, you'd choose something else (though you'd likely need to pay more). - Property Layout: Our room had a \"private\" roof-top deck, but you had to exit the room to access it (it was off a central stair case). We had visions of enjoying an evening cocktail after putting our son to bed, but didn't feel comfortable being so far from him. Similarly, although there is a gym \"in the building\" you have to exit the property to get there and must enter from the street. - Security: We never had any issues and the property felt very safe. Still, the guard at the front gate was not always at his post and there is was no internal lock to our main door (chain, bolt or other). - Playa del Carmen: This came up in another post, but 5th Avenue is now a bit of a turn off. Tons of wonderful restaurants and shops, but there is also now a very commercial element that is a bit negative (\"Hey lovely family, come check out my restaurant, car service, bracelet collection, pet monkey, etc.). Other tips - The affiliated beach club is excellent, but if you'd like to try something different, we also enjoyed Kool, which is about eight blocks North. - Only the three-bedroom units have washer / dryers and the laundry service through the hotel is expensive. We found a place about five blocks North on 1st called Valentino's that was super-cheap and offered delivery (I don't believe they speak English, however). Overall, Porto Playa is a wonderful property and if we return to Playa Del Carmen, we'd likely stay here again, though we'd probably pay a bit more and go for a three-bedroom (much bigger, nicer layout, better views, etc.). We'd also consider the sister property, El Taj, to be closer to the beach, but we liked the pool much better at Porto Playa. Hope this is helpful to you.

It is an ideal setting for us and we would definitely return. The hotel is very well located, a 4 minute walk from the beach and less than a block from Avenida Quinta, Playa's principal shopping and restaurant zone. I actually prefer this location to being right on the water because it is very quiet and restful, with no chance of being woken up by late night music and revelry. The rental includes the use of a super nice beach club (towels, various types of beach furniture, restaurant, etc) and afterwards you can head back to a quiet, oasis like setting. The common areas of the hotel are beautiful, clean and very well maintained. There is a very attractive central garden and a large swimming pool. The pool is especially nice in the late afternoon sun. While the hotel was well occupied during our stay, it has a very secluded feel and at times we felt like we were staying there by ourselves. The staff is very professional and courteous. It stays in the background but was there to help immediately on the couple occasions when we needed something. The room cleaning service is thorough. There is a very nice health club in the base of the building that offers a variety of exercise equipment as well as yoga and other fitness classes. The hotel also has an arrangement with a day spa in a nearby building, under the same management as this hotel. We didn't use the spa but I believe this arrangement allows guests to put massages etc on their hotel tabs. Unit 219 is well decorated, well appointed and very comfortable. It has a large master bedroom with a king bed and large bath, a second, smaller bedroom with twin beds with bath, a large living/dining/kitchen area and a furnished patio. The kitchen was well enough equipped for the moderate amount of cooking we did during our trip. The value proposition lies in the fact that the cost of this unit is substantially less than we would have paid to stay on the beach, a location I probably would have liked less.

It's very close to the beach, the condos are clean and well-appointed, there is a nice pool and it's great if you are traveling with a family or another couple. That said, while we enjoyed the convenience and savings of renting a condo where we could stay with our friends, there were a number of things we didn't like about it. The primary thing we didn't like about it, frankly, was that it's in Playa del Carmen. Again, Playa del Carmen is great for a lot of people, it just wasn't our speed. It's incredibly touristy. There are more Italian restaurants than Mexican ones. The food is incredibly over-priced. There are tons of cheesy souvenir shops. There's not much authentic about it anymore, especially compared with Tulum, where we spent the first half of our trip. As for the hotel itself, here are the things we didn't love about it: -The staff was helpful on the surface, but when there was actually a problem that needed to be addressed they weren't that competent. Our hot tub was not working for the entire time we were there and since we booked a room with a rooftop deck expressly to have such amenities, this was frustrating. They kept coming by and alleging they had fixed the problem, but they never fixed it. When I complained about it at checkout, the manager was quite rude to me, though they did give us a discount. -A similar issue occurred with the bed in the second bedroom. We requested 2 king-sized beds, but, as is common, the non-master bed was actually 2 doubles pushed together and fitted with a king mattress. Problem was, the bed was on wheels and at night the 2 beds would separate. Needles to say, not comfortable for our friends. When we complained, the front desk said they would tie the legs together, but they never did. -They have a system where you need to check in and out towels every time you use them for the pool or beach and it gets quite annoying because you always have to make sure you have these towel tickets on you. If you are someone who tends to lose little pieces of paper, this will make you crazy and probably cost you money as a lost ticket costs $25. They had a similar system for their free breakfast. -Our room was allegedly a partial beach view, but when they said partial, they weren't kidding. You could barely see the beach and only if you stood right at the edge of the balcony. If you were seated, in the hot tub for example, vegetation that was planted on the balcony in the most ill-conceived way, would block your view.

We really enjoyed staying here in Unit 212. First off, it was great for family because it has two pools, so my son practically swam in them the whole time. The kitchen and the bedrooms made it ideal for a family as well. The hotel is right by the main area of attraction, so we were able to eat out anytime and enjoyed the restaurants. However, they weren't as cheap as you would think they might be if you wanted to go to the nice restaurants, so we loved having the kitchen in the condo to make our own food (we shopped at the local Big M) and ate on the patio table listening to the sounds of the fountain. The patio looks out at the lush courtyard and one of the pools/hottub (which never had more than one or two people in it). There were two bedrooms and two bathrooms, so that was perfect as my husband and I were actually on a sort of honeymoon and we liked being able to have our own time ;-). We were one block from the beach, so we walked down there frequently (they give you beach towels to use). My son played in the sand, but it didn't end up in the room because it was a block away. I ran on the beach a few mornings, but also worked out in a nice gym which they allow you to use, which is attached to the building. There is a lot of nightlife near the hotel, but we tended to be to bed early and woke early so missed most of it. However, we never heard any activity at night from our room. The inside of the condo was beautiful, modern and the floors were stone (I am not a lover of carpet). The kitchen had appliances and there was a tV and DVD player. The cleaning people and concierge were outstanding and kind (they found someone to sew a torn hem on my pants). We rented a car for two days in Playa del Carmen (rather than the airport) and took it to Tulum, Rio Secreto and Punta Laguna nature reserve. And of course, we went to Chi Chen Itza. I think renting one in town and riding a shuttle to the airport is the way to go costwise. The shuttles were fairly cheap but the airport car rentals were really expensive. We are going again in the future but will bring mother-in-law with us and feel like this will be the perfect place to stay because of the fair amount of space. We will definitely ask for the same room again, because we like that it was in the courtyard (no stairs), yet very private with all the foliage.

Several reviews state that the rooftop decks with palapas and BBQs are open to all guests and I'd like to make it clear to all potential guests that this is NOT true! Altho the staircases that serve all units do end up at roof level, each roof deck (and its amenities) belongs only to the respective condo unit below it, whose renters paid quite a bit extra for it. On our last trip (unit #214 with deck) we were twice surprised to go up to our \"private\" deck to see it had already been used by others (food leftovers, cig butts etc). The other thing worth mentioning is that most ocean views are non-existent from the decks since another big condo unit (ugliest in Playa too) went up in front. Don't stay here if an ocean view is a priority! But the pool is very nice (the best of all their properties) and views over it and the gardens are still very pleasant. On our first stay we were in unit 215 at ground level. It's nice to have a leafy patio out front and the unit was quite nice. However, be aware that a compressor outside the window of the 2nd bedroom was so loud that our friend ended up sleeping on the couch every night instead. That's one reason why the following year we moved up 2 floors to unit 214. Very nice also, but had trouble keeping other guests out of our private deck. I've noticed some reviews describe unit 210 but mean 201 (or vice versa). 201 is the biggest unit (3 bedrooms, 3 floors + deck) and the most expensive. It's over the parking garage and has it's own entry to the pool. The rooftop deck reportedly had the best views in town until the building went up in front. 210 is a regular 2-bedroom unit on the 2nd floor. 2nd floor units do not have the nice patios out front like units on the ground floor. Nor do they have rooftop decks like units on the 3rd floor. But they do have nice views over the pool. Porto Playa is basically a wide U-shaped property with gardens and pools in the center. The open end of the U faces the street. The condos are spread out across the back of the U: Big 2-story condo 221 on the far left (over the restaurant and along the sidestreet) with big 3-story condo #201 on the right (over the garage). Between the two, spread out in back, are the other units on 3 levels (plus rooftop decks for those on 3rd level). Overall a great place to stay. Beautiful grounds, fantastic location, very friendly management. Only the 3-bedroom units have washers and dryers, and there are no elevators. The parking garage is a huge plus if you have a car. Freestanding ATM right around the corner. Walking down the beach to find a restaurant in the morning is a delight. Walking Avenida 5 at night also. The 2 highpoints of our last trip: Xplor (\"adventure park\" with ziplines), and tour through Rio Secreto. Both right outside Playa.

The Porto Playa Condo itself was the perfect accommodation for our leisure trip. With two full baths, kitchen, two twins and a king size bed you can have all the conveniences of home while being able to step outside into lush tropical gardens surrounding a luxury pool with waterfall and all. Not to mention that everyday was sunny with clear blue skies. Although we really enjoyed our time spent at the condo and at the beach, we got the urge to do a couple excursions. Based on the helpful recommendations of the owner we had a private guide named Fernando and transportation to and from the nearby Mayan ruins at Tulum, the \"cenotes\" or underwater freshwater caves, and secluded beaches that we never would've discovered on our own.

We had debated about whether we wanted to go for an all inclusive or do the in-town thing, and opted to do the second to give our wedding more character. The majority of our guests stayed at the Porto Playa Condos and people were amazed at the quality and beauty of this resort. It was great to wake up each morning and look out over the pool and see your friends and family on other balconies stretching and waving at you. The setting was intimate and we felt that staying at a smaller resort gave our guests an opportunity to really get to know each other. We rented a bunch of their rooftop penthouses and also Condo #201, where myself and my husband stayed. This unit was simply spectacular. Meticulously cleaned daily by the maid staff, I have never seen anything like this place, and I have traveled quite a bit - I almost tripped over myself in excitement when I saw it because it was better than I had imagined it. It's better than the pictures, that's for sure. The staff all speak perfect English, which is wonderful, and overall we would say we had an amazing experience here. I had no complaints of noise level or anything really other than water pressure. The water takes quite some time to heat up, there's no shampoo provided (??!!), and they are a bit stingy with the towels (but you can ask for more at no cost- which for some reason I didn't think about until halfway through the trip) . There were some minor problems as well at this resort that prevent me from rating it 5 stars - one was the lack of consistent internet available because they had switched service providers and it seemed everyone was having problems with it. To their credit they did not charge the full amount for the week. Another problem was drivers that were hired through the resort to take various guests back to the cancun airport attempted more than once to collect fares from guests who had already paid through the resort. We also booked two vans for our trip back to the cancun airport that never showed up, probably due to a staff member leaving who had been handling all the details with us. Nevertheless, these issues were handled poorly when I called back to complain and put me out a few hours on the phone with staff playing the blame game until I finally spoke with a manager who sorted everything out for me. This last glitch really ended the experience on sour note, but I would still recommend this place to guests because on the whole they were quite professional and eager to please, with just a warning that if you are traveling in a big group to double check any services you request from the hotel.

The biggest of them, and I have to say that it is really a shame, is that the technical maintenance is not that of a five star condo. I repported that one of our showers was broken the second day of our 10-day stay, and it was never fixed. The toilet broke also but that one was fixed right away though. Also lamps not working here and there and small issues like that. Second biggest was the screaming under our window every night. People obviously go to and from bars and walked the street just outside out condo. Woke up to it almost every night. The third one is all the buildingsites in the area, from our rooftop terrace one saw the beautiful Carribean Sea and then two buildingsites.. So after taking the negatives first I have to do the bragging also. It surely is a very beautiful and wellplanned building, seemed like every thing has been taken in consideration when planning Porto Playa. We stayed in the three bedroom condo number 221, it was huge and it was for sale; the price was seven times higher than our house back home! : ) We had our two boys with us and has to say this is not the best place for children though as the condo was made up of two different floors and on top of them the rooftop terrace. Lot of stairs and the rails are not childrensafe at all. The rooftop terrace was a great thing to have anyhow, we used the grill and the jacuzzi very active! The main pool was also just a step away from our door and almost always not a single person there so we had it almost privately also! great! Playa del Carmen is a great little town, but it has grown a lot in three years since we last visited.

We discovered two pools - one winding itself around the gardens at ground level and a second on a mezzanine with snapshots of the carribean ocean. Just at street level we found 'The Gym' which isn't cheap but a superb facility where Porto Playa guests get a 20% discount on casual visits (we paid 12 US per person per day) There are also roof top spas and bbqs which are accessible to all guests. The panoramic views are incredible. All condos have greaqt cooking facilities and are so well equipped that they are perfect for a stay of a week or two. The rooms are very spacious with beautiful marble bathrooms. Walmart and Mega Supermarkets are about a 15 minute walk from the Condos and have everything you need when you're not dining at the myriad of great restauants in Playa. The only issue we had, was some construction going on adjacent to our room on the perimeter of the property, however as soon as we mentioned the noise the staff found us another room right away.
