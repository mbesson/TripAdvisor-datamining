True it is not the best area in Rome, but it is not dangerous by any means as some other reviewers assumed (it is Rome's informal Chinatown so it is really glamourous but not bad). - Had an argument with the night keeper about taking the key out. While I understand they don't want guests to take them out (just to avoid duplications or losses), I don't like leaving the key on the hotel since I have rented that room for 1 day.

It's about a 10-minute walk to the main train station, which was the reason we found it in the first place. The staff at the hotel are all wonderful, smiling, friendly people. This is very appreciated. Most of the staff spoke English and even asked us to help them with some of their vocabulary, which was fun. Our room was in the basement portion of the building but still had high ceilings so I did not feel claustrophobic. The rooms are very, very small and the bathrooms are even smaller. There was, however, self-controlled AC (much appreciated), a large refrigerator, shelves in the bathroom, and a massive wardrobe for unpacking. The bathroom is teeny. If you're a normal-sized person, be prepared to change the temperature of your shower every time you turn around. Two people attempting to pack at the same time will bump into each other a lot. I think we could have gotten this place for less than 80 Euros a night if we had booked in advance. The breakfast was typical Italian fare, but good, the coffee was strong and the service out on the patio was pleasant. The staff were very helpful in recommending tour companies, places to eat, etc. There is a large supermarket about 5 minutes' walk away and we bought snacks there and kept them in the fridge, which was very convenient. You can walk to the Coliseum in about 20 minutes and we did not feel unsafe at all.

The check in was fine, the concierge was really nice, but the night concierge has no personality. Once we got to the room, which was located in the dungeon. I was fortunate to get the room in the basement. I open the door and it smelled good at first, i noticed the plug in air freshner, which isnt a good sign. i then proceeded to the bathroom located at the back of the room, once i opened the door, i relaized why the air freshener was there. The smell of wasnt the nicest, the bathroom had spots of mold, the shower area was about 4'x4' so if your a medium built person by all means good luck taking a shower. i asked to change rooms and my request was denied.

All in all though it was good, not for a romantic stay in a room, but as a reasonable base to see Rome and not spend loads (59 Euros a night).

First, the price was very good for the hotel with breakfast included. On our last night the hotel made a car reservation for the airport for us and the guy was there exactly on time. That was 50 euros well spent. The hotel is 15 minutes from the train station. When exiting the station make a left and keep walking for about 12 minutes or so and then the street the hotel is on will be on your right and you should be able to see the sign from the main street. Location is so and so, not the best, not the worst. The minibar is only half way full, so you can store a few things of your own in the fridge. Also, the minibar prices are cheap. We kept getting stuff out of it every day. When we left for Capri we paid for the 3 days plus mini bar stuff and she didn't have the right change and did not charged us for a few items. The breakfast was OK, the only thing I did not like is that they were charging extra for cappuccino than for coffee, and since the breakfast is free, it should have just been free also. The guy at the reception during the day was fantastic. Every time you would ask for directions of any sort he would get out a map and mark the places and give you the maps. I wished I would have known that before. I bought a map of the city at the station for 5 euros. His were better (they were marked) and I still have them. The night clerk, a black guy was OK, a little bored all the time. Over all, for the price, more then OK and Rome is just as fantastic every time. A true joy.

Other than that my stay had a lot of problems. I got room 107, possibly the smallest hotel room I have ever been in which only fit a single bed a closet and a table. Not even enough room for a chair. The window was blocked by the cabinet and it was very claustrophobic. I was unhappy at the thought of staying in that room for the four nights I had booked. At night the area is not so great. Street lighting is not good and there are many men out drinking on doorsteps. To get to the (only) closest restaurant is a five minute walk and the subway is beyond that. Otherwise there is no other street activity. I was followed home by a an Italian man who was a little too friendly. Since I was unhappy I checked out early. This was not much of a problem and I was treated with respect, but unfortunatley when I got home I found that they had charged my card over 800 eu (by mistake ?!) in addition to the room charge. I am still clearing this up with my credit card company. I wish I could have given this place a better review since the people who worked there were very nice and accomodating, but it just didn't work out and I would not recommend it to any single person for fear they would get room 107 and definitely not for single women.
