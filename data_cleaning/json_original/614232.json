My friend and I had an enjoyable 4 nights stay in Puri Dewa Bhrata.At first,the reason we booked this hotel was because its rate was the cheapest among others.After we arrived the hotel,we were so glad to realise that we had made the right choice.1) Room: The room we booked was superior room.It was wide,very clean and tastefully furnished.Two bottles of mineral water were given free of charge for us.We even got tv,mini fridge,big wardrobe and nice bathtub in it. :-)2) Service: The service the staff offered was professional and prompt.During our breakfast,a friendly waiter chatted with us and gave us plenty of good advice on our trip in Bali.We were offered airport transfer for free and the driver was even willing to send us to airport around 5am early in the morning~! On the day we left,we were asked by the front desk staff to write down our comments which I think they care about clients opinions.3) Breakfast: The range of breakfast offered was limited.There were not many choices.Most of it is Asian style - rice,noodles,veggie...with a few western choices like potatoes,bread,sausage......omellet is offered with extra charge.4) Location: It is in Seminyak area,a little bit far from city area but we didn't mind as we could get taxi easily and the fare was cheap.We enjoyed our stay there and will definately stay there again.Overall,we are pleased with our stay there.", "Date": "May 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR223609751", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Balimoon08"}, {"Content": "\u9351\u6052\u4eb1\u9287\u6219\u5020\u9287\ue0a0\u4f05\u9479\ue218\u4e9c\u936b\u5b58\u588d\u9287\u0441\u4eda   showReview(19167058, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR902728594", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d614232-r18100656-Puri_Dewa_Bharata-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "614232", "Price": "$39"}}
