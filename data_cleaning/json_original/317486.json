On the plus side, the pool though small is quite attractive and the rooms have nice Balinese designs, also the internet works and you can get to the beach and the street easily. The staff were friendly although a few of the guys working there try to push you towards getting taxis, having massages, renting motorbikes no doubt for a commision. This is fine but not when they become persistent. The room was simple, a little dark, the bed was quite comfortable but the bathroom had seen better days. A little too basic for $45 a night in Bali. Also the towels were threadbare on more than one occassion. Up to there it's three stars out of five but what made me put it one lower is the restaurant. Dimly lit with bare white light, in the evening no one ate there. I sat at the bar for a beer once, a grim place indeed. The breakfast was just awful. Flies buzzed over cold toast, cold hard pancakes, cold sausages and cold noodles with spinach. That was it! We thought it was all that was left when we ate at 9.30 but the next day we ate at 8am and it was just as bad. In this price range there are much better options.Pete 29, UK.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR177361730", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Pete79"}, {"Content": "Very nice hotel for a great price My wife and I spent a night at Stana, and it is a great place if you are looking for good value. It is quiet and is about 5 minutes walk from the beach. We paid USD35 for a very decent room and hearty breakfast. Our experience with the staff was very pleasant, although sometimes inconsistent. 1 of the staff went all the way to help us in our bookings for our itinerary, which we appreciated very much because we were on a free and easy trip. Overall, it is a nice place if you just want to relax and enjoy some peace (away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta).
