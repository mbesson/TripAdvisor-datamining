There were some aspects that may be down to personal prefence, but I really like to keep myself to myself when I'm staying at a hotel. Instead, on return on my first evening, I was asked why I'd left so early that morning, why I'd not had breakfast and what time I was planning on returning that evening. I'm sure they were just trying to be friendly but it felt fairly obtrusive. The decor felt very dated and you really are paying for location, as the amenities are well below standard for the cost. The bed was so soft it was really uncomfortable and the shower was so weak I couldn't wash my hair. The sash windows were also incredibly difficult to open/close so on the first evening, I had to sleep with the window open and the constant traffic outside kept me awake. On the second day, I returned to my room to find my used towels really dirty and left in my room along with the contents of my bin. It looked as though the towels had been used to clean the bathroom and then left behind. All in all, not the best of experiences and there are definitely much better hotels available in London for the same nightly rate.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cRude, Rude, Rude!\u201d", "Author": "carole1961England", "ReviewID": "UR115321410", "Content": "Where do I start? My son booked a surprise short vacation to London for me and did all the arrangements himself. He booked us in at the Ormonde House Hotel for three nights. My son printed out directions from where our coach dropped us of etc. We arrived in London at 2:15 and according to ur directions would be at the hotel in 10 minutes via walking. Well it was pouring and the directions got soaked and unreadable so we asked someone where the street was where the hotel was located. Should have known they gave us the wrong directions. This happened time and time again So I eventually called the hotel to say that no one seems to know where Eaton Gate is. It did not help that I could not hear the woman properly on the phone due to the street noise and her heavy accent did not make things easier. After searching for over an hour on foot we finally took a taxi that took us to the hotel in minute. We were grateful that we had finally arrived because we had been up since the early morning and at \u00a3140 a night we wanted to get our money's worth. We rang the doorbell. This man in a butler suit answered and said, 'I see you are here'. Then he proceeded to berate us for not taking a taxi , and how we got everyone involved which was so unnecessary, etc. Plus he asked us if this was the first time we travelled anywhere and that he was not used to dealing with people like us!! He was so rude it was unbelievable! Needless to say, I was so angry and upset that we decided not to stay at this hotel for any price. Which caused us further hassle as every hotel seemed to be booked due to all sorts of events going on in London over the weekend. But that is another story. Stay at this place if you want to be insulted and treated like crap.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLovely public areas but rooms let it down very badly\u201d", "Author": "Cliff247", "ReviewID": "UR114917354", "Content": "I wish I could reccommend this hotel, but I just can't, and it is a shame. The public areas and lift are lovely, I thought I may have found a gem at \u00a3125/night, and the proximity to Sloane Square is a big plus. Indeed I was quite excited in the lift that I may have found a new regular place for my semiregular London trips, but no. I stayed in a double, top-floor room overlooking the main road. Not noisy though. It had polystyrene \"fire trap\" tiles on the ceiling, I can't believe it can even be possible to get a license if the fire chief saw those. They're the kind everyone removed 30 yrs back with reason - one small flame and they will drip burning plastic all over the room. And the flame would probably climb up the bed valance(?) thingy, which was cheesy and dusty. Bathroom was a corner bitten out of an otherwise reasonably sized room by London standards. General repair was poor, peeling paper, etc., with high windows into the main room. It has sliding doors, a bath, sticky-backed plastic shelves, an electric shower (with not much water pressure of course) and a toiletries cabinet I elected not to use. It did contain a dozen or so mini soaps, though. But those weren't the last soaps i'd find - 43 in all, in various drawers in cheap, dying furniture. Soaps I don't really mind so much. The drawer full of old carrier bags was odd, but could be seen as useful maybe. The old hair roller (with hair!) was less what I was hoping to find in my bedside drawer. Plenty of mirrors, though. 9, if I remember correctly, which is certainly enough for anyone. Free bottle of water in the room is a nice idea, but it was a plastic bottle refilled from the tap. Not a problem in itself, tap water is certainly ecologically a good plan, but then why not use a bottle designed for refilling, not a used Volvic one which can breed nasties. Breakfast was simple but enjoyable at the shared mirrored table downstairs, back in opulence after grottiness. And the pop-up dumb waiter was a great reminder of what this hotel could and should be right through. But it isn't, and it's a crying shame. Instead, I am back to staying in a tiny room in a spotlessly clean hotel in Holborn for \u00a345 less per night with a great breakfast, at \u00a380 instead of \u00a3125 I paid for this place. Maybe I got the dud room and the rest are lovely or something, but if so, it has been dud since the 1980's, so there is no rush to improve it. I don't want an identikit chain hotel, I will forgive a LOT for character, but used hair rollers and fire-hazard ceiling coverings are a step too far. Ideosyncracities are fine, dirty lazy housekeeping and maintenance is another altogether. Get a real cleaner, spend \u00a3500 on sorting out the room, and this could be something so special.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ely, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c1920's Glamour in Belgravia\u201d", "Author": "G134Smith", "ReviewID": "UR71032474", "Content": "I stayed at the Ormonde with a friend as we were attending a party in central London.

The hotel is a beautiful building just off Sloane Square in Belgravia and has been lovingly dedicated to the 1920's, with chandeliers and beautiful furniture. Our room was on the 4th floor, reached through a period lift or a lot of stairs, and was full of antiques with a chandelier light. Despite the room overlooking the road, there was not much noise and our only complaint was how hot the room was - I suspect this would have been true of every property in central london during this last weekend.

The lady working at the hotel was very pleasant and helpful and the building itself and the room where the business of paying took place gave me high expectations for the actual room. Unfortunately I was left feeling a little deflated when I saw the room. The room was spacious and comfortable but the decor looked a little tacky and the pattern on the bedspread was so busy and cheap looking. The bathroom was a nice size and I liked the layout of the room but I couldn't help thinking that I could have done a better job of the cleaning and the bed linen didn't feel particularly good quality. The location was superb, staff were excellent and I had a very good sleep the night I stayed there but for the price I expected better quality furnishings and a more classical decor.

I am glad to say for us it turned out to be the latter. One review states not all rooms are en-suite. Perhaps that was the case in the past but now all 12 rooms are en-suite. I confirmed this with the hotel after reading the review... We had booked 1 night in a double room and had a lovely time. Upon ringing the doorbell we were immediately greeted by a smart and very welcoming young man who checked us in and took our luggage up to our room whilst we were filling in the usual paperwork. The hotel proprietor also welcomed us and had a friendly little chat. We had a big room (no. 6) with an enormous and very comfortable bed. There was a walk-in closet and a huge, brandnew bathroom. Everything was spotless clean. There were no tea/coffee making facilities but a bottle of water and 2 polished glasses. There were no fancy toiletries but there was a bar of Dove soap and also soap to wash your hands. If you want to wash your hair, bring your own shampoo (there is a hairdryer). After asking for the quickest way to get a taxi, the same young man who had checked us in took the trouble to dash outside (in the rain) and hail a black cab for us. I call this great service. Continental breakfast which consisted of toast, butter, jam, marmelade, tea & coffee was included in our stay. The tea was some of the best I ever had in a hotel (normally tastes of dishwater but this one was exceptionally good). In addition we were offered eggs & bacon which we declined. The hotel is filled with old furniture (some antique, some not), books, paintings and decorative objects. I love the old wood panelled lift which has room for a maximum of 3 people and a little bench to sit down. Or the dumb waiter in the breakfast room that suddenly disappears into the floor (down to the kitchen of course...). This hotel is full of character, slightly eccentric and should not be compared to any of the chain hotels which all look the same. The decor was not all to my taste but certainly not boring and I do not expect hotel owners to furnish their business to my specifications. I enjoyed my stay and if coming to London again I will stay at Ormonde House. I have to correct one of the previous reviewers who states there is a large picture of Blondie in the room where guests are checked in. Blondie is the band, the picture is of Debbie Harry who is the singer of the band. And anyone who has a picture of Debbie Harry on their wall, especially amidst classical landscape scenes and paintings of pretty flowers, gets my vote anytime.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Limavady, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNOT recomending!\u201d", "Author": "Flyin_5", "ReviewID": "UR49750763", "Content": "I am afraid I am going to disagree, on many points, with the last 2 reviews. First of all I would like to point out this is a Georgian Town House not a Victorian Town House as previously stated. THE NEGITIVE POINTS: - My main complaints are about our room. Our bedroom [room 9 on the 4th floor] had to be the most depressing room I have ever had the misfortune of paying \u00c2\u00a3120.00 a night for! The wallpaper was hanging off the walls and the ceiling was adorned with, once white, polystyrene tiles; I wonder if Mr Alam knows how big a fire hazard these things are? And speaking of fire hazards, the isolator cord switch for the shower was wired back to front. My husband, who is an electrician, only discovered this by accident! The bedroom door only locked with the key, which was so loose that it kept falling out of the keyhole every time you went to turn it: I would hate to think what could happen if there was a fire! There were mirrors everywhere; probably to compensate for the fact that this double room measured approx 10ft x 16ft and that included the en-suite! All the furniture in the room was really cheap and tacky and had seen better days. I could not find any tea/coffee making facilities; on there web site it states these are available in every room. The enamel bath had large chips in it. The blue and white shower curtain, which I think hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been replaced since the room was decorated in the 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, was a disgusting yellow colour at the bottom. [see pic]. The sliding door to the en-suite didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slide [until my husband fixed it]. Another couple staying on the same floor as us were so appalled by their room they did not stay another night, leaving 1st thing in the morning to seek alternative accommodation! The room where you register was the only room that I saw decorated with any sort of authenticity, with it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beautifully wood panelled walls\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..but then, there was that poster sized, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflee market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, print of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBlondie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the middle of the wall! On the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web site they state that the hotel d\u00c3\u00a9cor is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Heavily influenced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the \"golden twenties\" I did not see any evidence of this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. Did they have sticky-baked-plastic in the Georgian period or indeed the \"golden twenties\"? [see pic]. If I had friends coming to stay with me and this was the state of my guestroom I would be embarrassed. Breakfast was included in the price. This consisted of a glass of fresh orange juice, 1 and only 1 rasher of bacon and some scrambled egg, 2 slices of toast with the choice of either marmalade or jam and coffer or tea. THE POSITIVE POINTS - there are only a couple, but nonetheless important: - The bed was very comfortable, sheets were good quality cotton and laundry was spotless. The staff were friendly and polite [though some a little more exocentric than others; but what the heck, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in England!].", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cLike Staying in a Victorian House\u201d", "Author": "Appreciate_Quality", "ReviewID": "UR8392066", "Content": "As the first reviewer for this small hotel in London, I am going to take time to discuss it at some length. My wife and I found Ormonde House on a trip to London in 1984, when our hotel was overbooked and referred us to Ormonde House. At that time, we were on a tight budget, and had a great experience at Ormonde House. We recently returned to London for four nights with our 4 daughters, ages 9-16, and decided to try and recapture the past by staying at Ormonde House. It is an interesting hotel, and I partially believe that they don't want to be found. The guests are often people who have a past connection with the hotel, or referrals from nearby foreign embassies. I only saw 1 other guest during our recent stay. They do have a website, but the email address shown on the website is incorrect (the correct one is [--]). I booked by phone. I am giving the hotel an Excellent rating, but this is in the context of value, since our quad room cost 160 pounds, and our triple room cost 140 pounds, including breakfast, which are great rates for large rooms in London. Ormonde House does not pretend to be a 5-star hotel. There is no air conditioning, no internet terminals, no shampoos and bath gels, no slippers by the bed, etc. The experience here is that of living in a fashionable, residential neighborhood, which has not changed significantly in decades. Their own mission statement says \"We jealously preserve its Victorian character\", and that is truly the case. The room keys are even in 1800's-shape and work fine. There are few other hotels in this location of London, just SW of Eaton Square and an easy walk from the Sloane Square Underground station. Our family likes walking, and had no trouble making the 1-mile walk to Harrods or the slightly shorter walk to Buckingham Palace. We even walked all the way from Westminster Abbey to the hotel, which was over 2 miles. The Underground station is on the Circle and District lines which are good for reaching most of the major sightseeing places with no more than 1 connection. The rooms at Ormonde House differ significantly from each other, so you need to be very clear in asking about the bedroom and bathroom sizes when exploring a booking. In 1984, my wife and I had a small but plush, rear-facing bedroom with a canopy bed and large bathroom, which worked great for us as a young couple. This time we got a \"quad\" room for the kids with 4 twin beds; it was a very large room with a ton of closet space and a large bathroom. The room that my wife and I got was a large, street-facing room, but the bathroom was a converted closet which could not have measured more than 5' by 6' in size; we got by with the bathroom, but should have chosen that room more wisely. There are a few rooms at Ormonde House which require using a hallway bathroom so, again, book carefully. The beds and pillows (feather pillows, I believe) were comfortable. Breakfast is served in a gorgeous Victorian dining room at a single large table, which seats 8-10 people, and hot food is delivered via a dumb waiter which rises out of the floor. The breakfast is continental, but bacon and eggs are available by request. The table is beautifully set with china and silver. As we remembered from 23 years ago, the coffee and tea served was perfect in taste and temperature every morning and made us wonder if we could go back to Starbucks. There is only a small staff at Ormonde House. When we were there in 1984, the proprietor was an elderly French woman, who passed away shortly after our stay there, and there was only one assistant. The current proprietor, Mr. Alam, was away during our recent stay, so we did not meet him. The house was run in his absence by a young Polish woman named Monika, who was extremely attentive to our needs and a pleasure to speak with. I hope that others review this hotel, as I am very curious to see their opinions. We often stay at 5-star hotels while on vacation and enjoy the pampering while paying a high price. That's not what Ormonde House is about, but it is definitely worth considering if you want to achieve the feel of living in Victorian surroundings for a while.", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ormonde House Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d503123-Reviews-Ormonde_House_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$166 - $174*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8 Eaton Gate</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Near Eaton Square</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW1W 9BJ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "503123", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f0/0b/f00bfa56367c5ac58a03e5aa493676673large.jpg"}}
