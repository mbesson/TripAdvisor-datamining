I had my doubts and was sceptic about the place. Woah! to my pleasant surprise, the hotel was easily approachable by tube and bus. Excellent front office staff who understood and spoke English(I didnt know any French). They made feel at home. There were whole lots of restuarants to my liking and it was accesible to the main tourist destinations easily. Very calm place with perfect ambience. I have decided that if one is a budget traveller and want to be in a safe place -- THIS IS IT. keept it up !!!", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA good two-star\u201d", "Author": "GraysonDublin", "ReviewID": "UR120877282", "Content": "A good two-star hotel with helpful staff.

This place is about a 7 minute walk to the Metro station and about 5-7 metro stops to the tourist areas. With that being said, the hotel is very well priced for Paris and is very clean and comfortable. We opted not to have the breakfast package there as we never woke up earlier than 10am and it's Paris... there are cafes at every corner! I highly recommend learning the Metro system as it truly is the easiest and most affordable way to get around Paris. Get the day passes and you're set.

Concierze services were amazing: professional, fluent english, nice, friendly, and very-very helpful. The only trick was a breakfast, which is not included in your price. So, make sure you are aware of 9.50euro per a person. Also, for those who travels from States....remember you are in Europe, real state is expensive, lol. Thus, rooms are smaller then you can expect.

The hotel is between two metro stops, Gaite (4 blocks north) and Alesia (4 blocks south), with Denfert-Rochereau around the corner (3-4 blocks east). Booked through Hotelclub, our reservation was immediately found and acknowledged. The staff was very polite and accomodating; they even lent us a cork screw one evening! The rooms are adequately furnished and very clean, with a window on major street (quiet at night), and adjustable heating. Very similar to staying in a city club sleeping room. We had a group of 4 women, staying in single rooms, and everyone was delighted with their room. Bathrooms were small, but NEW - the size you'd find in a single room in a hospital (and just as clean!). Great water pressure and towels changed every day, too. Breakfast available 6AM-10AM, with plenty of cafes in the immediate area. Traditional french breakfast, with ham/yougurts, etc. on self-service buffet. Cute restaurant just south. We had the reception desk call a cab one evening, and it arrived in less than 5 minutes! There is an automated system to call cabs from the desk.
