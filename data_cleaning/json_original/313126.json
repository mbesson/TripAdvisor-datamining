The hotel is located in one of the the most beautiful districts in Istanbul: Ortak\u00c3\u00b6y. Its location alone is a big plus for the hotel. But if you would like to visit the historical city center, which is Sultanahmet and its surroundings (Topkap\u00c4\u00b1 Palace, Basilica Sistern, St. Sophia, Grand Bazaar, etc.) this hotel is a little far from them.

Needless to say we stormed out of this pathetic Property paid them for one night of a horrible experince and checked ourself into the Ceylan Intercon where both my kids are finally getting some peaceful sleep with proper aircon and facilities.

The only staff who tried to make some conversation was the barmen... the rest were polite but made no effort to be anything more.

You get to see the full size of the road bridge. I am afraid to say that despite being slightly cheaper that its main rivals I wont be staying here again.
