I had originally gone to London and had pre-booked a stay in Notting Hill at a dreadful property called the Blue Bell Hotel. (Read my review on that hotel if you want the details. It was as scary as a horror movie.) I checked out of the Blue Bell and spent my last two nights in London at the Lennox Hotel. The room was gorgeous and HUGE! It had a flat screen TV, a BOSE stereo, a teddy bear on the bead and high-end linens. Most of all, it had air conditioning and the Summer of 2006 was a scorcher and I was there during the heat wave. The bathroom was exquisite and there were bathrobes as well. When I changed my plans from the Bates Motel to this place, because it was about three ties as much as the Blue Bell (which looked like a prison cell), I said, \"Okay, you can afford this, but no shoes or shows on this trip.\" I don't miss the shoes or shows, but I certainly remember this hotel and how happy it made me. Here's an excerpt from my travel journal on that day: \"I was met by Vince, the registration clerk and concierge. He had helped me earlier that week in actually getting the room. (He let me preview the room, so I was assured that I wasn't trading one bad hotel for another, though it truly was obvious withou even previewing a room that this hotel was way better than the Blue Bell. \"Vince said my room wasn't ready yet, but said I could leave my bags with him and maybe in an hour it would be ready. After about an hour I ventured back to the Lennox. Voila! My room was ready and they had already taken my bags upstairs. Vince gave me my key, which was one of those old-fashioned ones that look like a key to the city and I climbed the beautiful stairs up to my room, which was quaintly called, 'The Courtyard.' \"I threw myself onto the bed and lay there on my back. I could have spent the whole day just lying there, enjoying the quiet of the room.\" Oh, and one more thing. Breakfast was included. This hotel will never know how it rescued me.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service in Notting Hill\u201d", "Author": "ShakaWahine", "ReviewID": "UR8237885", "Content": "While the appearance of the hotel may not match the expectations I had from the brochure, the service is what sets this hotel apart. I was traveling with my nearly 2-year-old daughter, and I needed a lot of assistance. Mansur was my \"husband away from home,\" carrying things upstairs, getting me what I needed, and always helping us up the front stairs with the stroller. I later stayed at the Hilton, which physically was clean, spacious, etc., however the Hilton hotel has no soul, which the Lennox has plenty! The breakfast was amazing - three kinds of fresh berries, yogurt, croissants (can you tell I'm hungry?), breads, cereals, cheese and prosciutto.

An old, tired, and grimy bathroom? or the offer of a smaller alternative room in the basement? or silence and another shrug when you explain calmly that you are not entirely happy with your stay? If your answers are \"yes\" to the above, then I can heartily recommend the Lennox. What galls me most about so called \u201cboutique\u201d hotels like the Lennox is that so much is spent on furnishing the rooms \u201ctastefully\u201d to please the website voyeurs and so little is spent on providing clean and comfortable facilities for \u201cover\u201d- paying guests. If you need to be close to Portobello then I suggest saving yourself 80 quid and shopping around for one of the many B&Bs and budget hotels in the area.

The windows of the room looked out toward Portobello road in Notting Hill. This was our first trip to London and based upon our research, I think this is an excellent choice of a place to stay in London. It is quiet and still in a great location with easy access to transportation to any part of London. The Notting Hill Gate tube is just a short walk away as well as bus stops that take you anywhere in London. The famous market in Notting Hill was on Saturday is just out your back door steps, a short walk away and is lots of fun.

The staff would do anything for you and were kind, informative and always available. The hotel looks impressive from the outside but when I entered the door it just wasn't what I was expecting for \u00c2\u00a3185 a night. Now I do realise that this hotel has recently been taken over but to me, the public areas just screamed B&B. There was a smell of stale smoke and the reception area is a hatch to the side of the hallway. This hotel has very limited public space. There is a small breakfast/bar room to the rear of the hotel but the 'reception area' is the size of your average hallway with nowhere to sit. The stairway and landings to the rooms do have some nice decretive touches but the large unattractive B&B style fire doors do nothing for the interior. When I entered our room, I have to say I was impressed. The room was large, beautifully furnished with a gigantic bed and a huge plasma TV. The en-suite was larger than your standard hotel bathroom and this size of room in London is rare. But the negatives on the room and the hotel in general were annoying. This hotel has been 'glossed'. Apparently, the hotel has only been The Lennox for six months and it looks like the refurb was done in a huge hurry. There is an awful lot of chipped wood work throughout the hotel. The gloss work to windows and doors is just tired. The bath fixtures and fittings don't appear to have been refitted so our bathroom had a lot of black grime in the tiles also, our bath tap was broken with the broken piece sitting next to the bath waiting on a repair. The dust in the bathroom was shocking and the first white towel I grabbed had a faded make-up stain across it. Also I should point out that if you have seen the film Notting Hill, this isn't in one of those quaint streets. The hotel actually looks over a large block of flats. Enough said. I guess this review has more to do with the \u00c2\u00a3185 a night we paid and the glossiness of their website which isn't as glossy in real life. I just didn't quiet get this hotel although the people were fabulous. Next time we will stay at our favourite, The Mandeville, just off Oxford Street, which is half the price and lives up to its website (and it is terribly glossy!).", "Date": "June 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLovely and Friendly\u201d", "Author": "PFossil", "ReviewID": "UR5293308", "Content": "The Lennox is a lovely, immaculate hotel on a serene street just down the block from the busy intersection Notting Hill Gate.

I was travelling with my adult daughter and we were very comfortable sharing a twin/king sized bed, with much room to spare. Breakfast served in our room was promptly delivered and (though no bargain) it was full of healthy selections and lovely fresh fruit. The cleaning staff was efficient and thorough.

The Main House over on Colville Road recommended and referred us to the Lennox and we enjoyed the Lennox tremendously! The hotel has about 20 rooms, and we had one in the back on the main floor. Dubbed \"the Windsor\", it was large, with a spacious bathroom and all the comforts of home--flat screen plasma TV, CD player (with Vivaldi loaded), double paned windows that opened and huge bath sheets. Despite the hopping location, and street level room, the hotel and our room was wonderfully quiet. There is a breakfast that I never got up for, and a real honor bar/salon area. The internet access computer is in the hallway. That was only a problem when I was Skype-ing to the US one evening and my voice reverberated down the hall. Wireless was available in the salon so I moved there with my laptop. From the moment we arrived we liked the Lennox and the people working there. We checked it very late (about 2am) and Robert greeted us, got us all the potato chips we could eat and made us drinks. It had been a really long day. We all chatted for another hour before my partner and I, now revived, collapsed. Day staff helpfully stored bags, found us take away recommendations, phone help--all the things a large hotel would do without the largeness. We thought it a good value at about 175 pounds/night for the Exec. sized room.

We were then escorted to the lift and taken up to our room - the rooms are named which adds a little luxury! We were shown into our room which was on the 3rd floor and had a vertigo-free view of the street outside. It was very spacious and had a flat screen TV with a mini-bar, spring water and lovely complimentary toiletries. It was beautifully decorated with heavy floral curtains, a soft beige carpet, a comfortable sofa (which looked like it converted into a pull-out bed) and dark wood furniture such as a lovely old writing bureau with a drop-down writing desk. The bathroom was gleaming with a lovely deep bath, an old fashioned brass shower system with a big shower head and little touches such as cotton wool balls in glass containers. The lighting was good and it included a free-standing shaving mirror and use of the fluffiest bath-robes I've ever seen! The towels were clean and soft too. The bed was fantastic. It was well made with crisp white sheets, a duvet and a carefully folded bedspread. It was topped with 4 soft pillows and decorated with 2 roll pillows, a lovely picture pillow and a cute little teddy with a jumper on! The bed was soft and comfy.
