I was pleasantly surprised considering some of the reviews I had read on another site. That said, I believe the reviews predated the renovations undertaken at the hotel. We had a double room with a well-kitted out bathroom with a soaker tub. The bathroom had obviously been redone. The rooms were fairly quiet but not completely soundproofed. Also, there was work being done on the facade of the hotel so, if we were working in the room during the afternoon, we had to keep the window closed to minimize the noise. Wifi is available at no extra charge but if you need to use it for several days you'll need to get the password each day. Breakfast is also available at the hotel for 9\u20ac, which is not bad considering the offering: half a baguette with butter and jam, cheese, viennoiserie (usually a croissant or pain au chocolat), fruit juice, and coffee/hot chocolate/tea. The service from the hotel staff was also very courteous and professional. The only downside to the hotel may be the location.

Let's keep things relatively simple. The downsides: - It's not all that cheap at \u20ac140/night rack rate for a 3* hotel, but then Paris is expensive at the best of times, and the \u00a3/\u20ac exchange rate is pretty poor at the moment. - I could barely access the free wireless internet up on the 6th floor (room 62). This wasn't too much of an issue for the second half of my stay, but while I was working it's a fairly essential feature. I managed to cobble together a weak signal by remotely tethering my smartphone, giving me some much needed flexibility in picking up the network. This problem may be confined to the 6th floor only, I've no idea. This could be easily solved by adding a few extra routers so that there's one on each floor. - The breakfast isn't really brilliant value at \u20ac8. I'd much rather grab something from one of the nearby patisseries, but some people (like the below reviewer) may find the opposite - it just depends on your outlook, really. And the upsides, which far outweigh the downsides. - It was exceptionally clean and the room was well tended every day. - The room was a decent size for Paris. Sure, if you're used to US room sizes, it's going to be a shock to the system, but this is Paris and rooms are small, so it felt relatively roomy for the two of us! - It has been recently refurbished. Some of the traveller photos I've seen on here are very different to how the rooms are now. It's a huge change and really makes it feel like a nice place to be. - The staff are fantastic. I can't praise them highly enough. - The location is pretty good - a leisurely 5 minute walk up the road to the Alesia Metro station, very easy to find (two stops and you're at RER B with its links to Gare Du Nord, CDG etc.). The walk to the Jean Moulin tube/Porte D'Orleans tube and metro stations down the road is even shorter. Plenty of places to eat and drink nearby if you don't want to head further afield. I had an awesome steak at the very unassuming looking Jardins Contini a couple of minutes walk on from the Alesia Metro station on Av. du General Leclerc. - The location is also nice and quite - just off Av. Jean Moulin in a quiet street with very little activity. It was 30+ degrees while we were there, and save for a rubbish collection in the morning, there was no noise in the vicinity, even with the windows wide open. I've probably forgotten some of the other plus points - there really were lots of them. I'm not quite sure about the experience of the earlier reviewer - the \u20ac8 breakfast option was clearly conveyed and the option was there to take it or leave it on a daily basis. All in all, I'd have absolutely no hesitation in heading back to Hotel Chatillon - it's fantastic.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHidden gem, off the beaten track, recommended\u201d", "Author": "Matt365", "ReviewID": "UR118615224", "Content": "This hotel is well-kept and quiet, being set back from the main road in a quiet little cobbled square, which also makes it a little trickier to find than other hotels.

The room we had was simple but smart and clean, and a good size for Paris - the furniture was of a pretty good standard and was modern and all matched, with the added bonus of a decent LCD TV and a safe in the wardrobe. The bathroom looked newly renovated and was decorated to a good standard. It's a short walk (10 minutes or so) to the nearest metro, Porte d'Orleans, which also has a tram stop, although you can walk up to Alesia which is a couple of minutes further in the other direction. There are plenty of bars, brasseries and patisseries nearby. We had no problems with noise, and in fact found the place to be very quiet with regard to street noise - we slept with the window open no problem.

So to secure the room and not mess about with the internet, I called and confirmed the available room with Gerard. However the price was 130 per night (so 390 for 3 nights) He explained that the reason for this price difference was was because we would be getting a recently remodeled room. We wanted the security of a room, so confirmed the higher price for the 'new' room. However, when we got there, while the room was nice, it did not seem like an upgraded room. We approached the nice lady at reception and she gave another explanation: that we are paying high season prices for the basic room, otherwise it would be even more. This did not go with the previous explanation (of the night before!), but we let it go. I mentioned to Gerard when I met him that that was not what he had said, but he said the lady had already explained to me about the high season, and dismissed further conversation on the matter. The first night we could not sleep due to heat wave and no fan in the room. Next morning, we asked Gerard if possible to have a small fan put in the room and were told of how rare to have this heat in Paris and that they do not have air conditioner and very difficult to obtain a fan, but would speak with owner. I just had the thought that I have been hearing of Paris heat waves for the last several years! But dare not mention it! The feeling I had was that our need for a fan was troublesome to them. Next night no fan in the room. We spoke to a very nice man at reception that night, Vincent, who gave us his own small personal fan for our use for the next two nights - this at least helped to move the air. The hotel itself is charming small hotel, clean, nice breakfast room, and good breakfast. it is several blocks from the subway/metro station. and almost at the end of that metro 4 line.

We were incredibly excited and really looked forward to spending a nice, romantic and care-free weekend away.

Sure, the rooms were ok, and I say ok because the bed was a bit of a nightmare and the room was stuffy, but hey, I guess \u20ac80 is 'inexpensive' Paris-style. No, what ruined our weekend was the staff at hotel Chatillon, and expecially a baldish guy in I would say his forties. Unfortunately I do not rememeber his name, I would have gladly posted it here as a warning to all other travellers. He was never nice to us and made us feel uncomfortable. We were dressed nicely and were polite but he obviously had it in for us. First of all he seemed offended that we did not want to sign up for the hotel breakfast. We like to have options and I have never been a fan of hotel breakfasts anyways. Hotel staff really should not act like that when you say no to paying an extra \u20ac7-8 for a croissant and a cup of coffee. Now, we are young so we like going to a few bars at night. The first evening we came home around 2AM and went quitely to bed, he had to open the door for us but made us feel like there was a curfew and that we had broken it. Come on, we are on holiday for God's sake! The next day we had a nice day around Paris and tried staying away from the hotel as much as we could due to the snobby hotel staff. What really made me leave Paris with a sour taste in my mouth was the last day when we were checking out. He called us from the reception 5 minutes BEFORE checkout time to check if we were out yet. I said we would be down in a few minutes. We hurried as best as we can and when the phone rang again 5 minutes later, at the exact check out time I said we were leaving the room. He made me feel very stressed and also unwanted, and when we were in the reception 5 minutes after check out I thought he was going to yell at us. We were going to pay for the stay then and I said I wanted to go to the ATM, which is a couple of minutes around the corner, to take out cash as I pay high charges and did not want to make two withdrawals as I needed cash for the day as well. He looked at me with disgust and said \"Wat is that?* referring to the ATM and I said it is where you take out money using your ATM card. My partner would wait in the reception with our luggage. He did not want me to do this, it was obviously very problematic for him. In the end I was let out so I could get to the ATM and when we paid and left they didn't even say thank you for staying or anything.

The cleaning staff insisted on changing our towels and sheets every day, even when we put out the Do Not Disturb sign. Other than that, the hotel staff was really nice.

The double room has a bed (double, a little hard), a desk with chair, a tv plasma with only french channels (not even an MTV or other music channel) and a wardrobe. The carpet is very ugly and looks very cheap and I didn't like at all the bathroom (no improvements at all). The big minus for the hotel is the stuff, there was an arrogant guy there. For example - when we tried to pay the hotel he didn't want to receive 500 Euro (so take care not to pay the hotel with 500), and when we ask why he said not to waist his precious time...come on..We paid with the card but his attitude made us left from Paris not so happy.

For the safe, you need to get the code at the reception and you have to use the one you get there which I did not understand to be very safe...

I stayed there with a friend and my daughter from 16th Jan to 19th Jan 2009 and our stay was not enjoyable. Betty, the lady at reception was charming and always professional. She helped us with guides to Paris and potential restaurants we could eat at. However, on arrival to the hotel we were told that buggies could not go to the rooms, which we adhered to and always left the buggy in the front room everytime and also they told us they run a policy of no eating in the rooms. On the 2nd day of our stay we got back really late and could not stop for dinner at a restaurant, as my daughter was tired. We decided to buy a snack to eat at the hotel. On return to the hotel the receptionist very rudely asked us whether we had brought any food back which we said we had and then he went on to question us as to whether we did not know there was a no eating policy in the rooms. As we had had breakfast in the dining room, we had assumed that we could eat in the dining room, we told him. He refused point blank and brushed past us into the foyer, saying he had had enough in French. Unfortunately for him, I understand and speak fluent French. He then proceeded to tell us to go and find a cafe in the neighbourhood at about 11:30pm at night and that he could not allow us to eat there. This was a very awkward and humiliating experience. He then said he would have to call the management to inform them and ask whether we could eat in the dining room. At this point we decided to go out to have our snack. There were no cafe's open in the area so myself my 3 year old daughter and friend had to sit on a bench at nearly midnight to have our snack. We decided to tell the gentlemen that he had been rude to us and that was unacceptable. The next day, we were not up early enough to go for breakfast and were surprised with a call in the morning, asking us if we wanted our breakfast in bed. What a turn in event. Was this perhaps the result of the extreme rudeness of their personnel. A day later we checked out after our break was over and in my haste to leave, left my tom tom (GPS) in the hotel room safe. I realised on my arrival to the UK, that I had left my tom tom and called the hotel to check this was the case. They confirmed this. Then I made the mistake of asking them if they could send it back to me, if I paid the charges which they vehemently refused and informed me rudely that they were not a courrier service. I phoned TNT who would not do this as I was a domestic customer and phoned DHL who were telling me that it would cost me 85 euros which is half the price of the tom tom. I therefore decided to find alternative ways of returning my tom tom through my brother's wife, who has family in Paris. I again asked the hotel if they could send the tom tom to the address in Paris, so this could be returned to me,....The receptionist (male)cut me short telling me that did he not tell me to use DHL, to which I explained the costing issue, he then proceeded to rudely tell me that if I had family, then I could get them to come over to collect the tom tom and put the phone down. I rest my case. Where is the customer service in this experience.....I will never go back to Hotel Chatillon or recommend them to anyone.
