Taxi drivers seemed to have major problems finding it though. No bar, and breakfast was extra so we headed to nearby cafe for a very good value option every morning. Easy to walk to centre - close to University. Beds were hard, pillows inadequate and room temperature impossible to control. Gave us a very dark room that smelt very strongly of cleaning fluids first, but readily swapped to much nicer room overlooking street with balcony on request. One word of warning - I used the rooftop jacuzzi which was nice but I slipped and injured myself badly when I got out. My fault really but it was a very hard fall and I'm in plaster as a result.

We were taking a mediterrainian cruise which embarked from Barcelona and stayed here for 2 nights prior to our cruise. This was our first time in Barcelona. We've travelled the world (I used to be a travel agent) so we have experienced it all (luxurious accomodations, 5 stars to below average/poor accomodations. To sum this hotel up (it was recommended by a respected travel agent we've dealt with for years), you won't find a hotel in Barcelona that gives you the best value overall than Sunotel Central. Here is my review: Cleanliness: One of the main positives is this hotel is extremely clean. Our room, the lobby, everything is kept spotless. Food: there is a restaurant which serves breakfast. We never ate there although from what we've read and heard the food is very good. Rooms: the rooms are extremely tiny and tight, but very clean. It was tight for 2 people. One set of rooms face the street, these rooms are louder but arguably more interesting as you can open you window and look out onto the street. We stayed in the rooms at the back of the hotel, which are quieter and look out at the backs of other hotels/apartments. I was fun opening the window (no screens like north american buildings) and looking out. Roof top pool: we never used it but went to check it out. Looked very tiny but very clean. I wish I had swam and tanned there. Location: great!!! You can walk to La Rambla (Barcelona's version of Times Square, Piccadilly Circus or Toronto's Yonge St, Paris' Champs Elysees, if you will) within 15-20 mins. Plus this hotel is located near a University and is in a very safe area. Can't beat it. If you stay near La Rambla you'd be paying at least double the price. Service: very average. When we arrived from the airport, a very nice young man let us leave our bags with the front desk hours before check in. Another time the male at the front desk wasn't very friendly. Overall: this hotel is small, clean, interesting, in a great location and overall the best value for you money. Nothing fancy but I would stay here again in a heart beat.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwful bed.

For a quick city weekend break (where I don't want to pack a lot), I expect a 4 star hotel to provide a number of basic things, such as conditioner (there is shampoo but no conditioner), a shower cap, an iron (there is a shared ironing room but I would expect a 4 star hotel to have an in-room iron), and for the housekeeping to clear the trash for example. Also, there were only 2 pillows (one each) and I had to ask 3 times for another pillow as I sleep on 2 pillows (posture reasons).

(a) The light would turn off after around 3 min in the washroom of the hotel lobby although someone was still in it. It was weird that we needed to look for the switch in the dark and manually switched on the light couple of times. (b) The hallway is always dark unless someone walks through. Very dark.. 2. The hotel is severely undermanned. (a) We and other guests were locked out of the hotel because the front desk person was not there. It was around 6pm/7pm. We tried at least 5 min to ring the bell before the person came back. She didn't say anything to us at all. (b) We were first given a room where the air conditioning did not work. There was no technician to help. The only front desk person came but she had no idea how the thing operates. We asked for a room on the same floor as my parents'. The room was not ready until 6~7 pm. I talked to the maid. She told me that she was the only person cleaning the entire hotel in the afternoon. No wonder it took forever. 3. The room was made but the trash was left on the table and inside the washroom. We stayed there for 4 nights. After the 2nd day, it was not hard to notice that the floor was never cleaned or wiped.

We checked in and the bloke at the desk was rather abrupt - not totally rude, but hardly welcoming. Sod it, we were tired... so we went up to the room and were very pleasantly surprised. It was very clean, a good size and we were more than happy. 2 days later... we had noticed a few 'niggles' which were: 1) An exposed wire underneath the bathroom sink - it wasn't connected to anywhere and it looked rather dangerous 2) The lowest the air-con would go was 19 degrees and we couldn't open any windows - therefore we found it quite hard to sleep as it was very hot 3) On Saturday night we heard quite a lot of shouting from outside which continued for a while (Ok.. not the hotels fault, I guess!) We stayed room only so can't comment on the breakfast. The next morning, we asked for directions and the young woman on the desk was incredibly polite and helpful - she sold us the 'bus touristic' tickets (well worth it) and off we went. When checking out, we were allowed to store our luggage in a room next to reception and the young woman booked us a taxi which arrived on time. It cost us 25 Euros to get a taxi from the airport and 31 Euros to get one to the airport. Whilst the Univeristat stop really isn't that far away, we arrived when it was dark and thought it would be safer for 2 young women to take a taxi directly to the hotel. The hotel is in a good location for sightseeing - a 15 minute walk to Las Ramblas and there are loads of tapas places very close by (10 feet or so) so you have a wide variety of food, should you not wish to eat in the hotel. We had room service the first night and were very impressed - it arrived within 20 minutes and was very cheap - 16 Euros for dinner (and that included the 3 Euro surcharge for room service). Would we stay there again? I'd say probably - it certainly wasn't a 'bad' hotel and even the grumpy bloke seemed more pleasant the next time we saw him (I guess everyone has bad days).

The people in it seemed to be 'older' travellers, (by that I mean over 40 like myself !). There appeared to be buisness travellers also. As previous reviews, the bar was hardly ever open but we weren't too concerned as there is a bar on the corner who serve excellent G & T's!

The room was clean and the only lacking item was a kettle/tea and coffee but not unusual in Spanish hotels. Breakfast was good and plenty of choice. We sat around the pool a couple of afternoons and although it wasnt warm enough to swim it appeared to be well looked after.
