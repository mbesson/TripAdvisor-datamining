The river is across the road so position is excellent. Problem is that the reception staff look like they have been told the world will end in a few months. Never seen such a miserable group of people. The concierge though was excellent. I was told by reception that I had to pay the bill on checkout and the woman was quite rude. Then she realised that my company was paying the bill and simply grunted. No apology The rooms are adequate and quite large and for the rate they are good for value. Bit used looking but I would stay there again. At the moment it is a 3.5 star hotel. Cheer the reception staff up and tell them that it is them that the customer sees first and you will have a 5 star. So easy to fix the problem but someone isn't getting it.

My father stayed in this hotel for 7 nights. He was on a business trip. Previously he stayed in this hotel and he hadn't encountered any problems. The room was a bit old. The quality of hotel service has deteriorated. This time when he was checking out of the hotel, the reception told him that he had to pay for a consumed bottle of whisky from his room's mini-bar. When he told them that he did not drink anything from the mini-bar, they brought a bottle whisky from his room's minibar. That bottle was full (!), but slightly opened. You should know that my father does not consume alcohol at all. He was in a hurry to catch a flight, so he tried to argue a bit with them, but eventually he was UNFAIRLY charged 100 Dirhams for that whisky bottle. When he came back home, he was deeply frustrated with the management of this hotel. That is why he asked me to write this review on his behalf. So when you check in to this hotel, you should check the mini-bar and its contents.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cIt is the worst hotel I've ever visited.\u201d", "Author": "Green_Greeen", "ReviewID": "UR117480582", "Content": "- courtesy of front desk is very low - Rooms displayed online are just just pictures of coming renovation not the real existing rooms.

For example, you don't find that slipper you usually find in hotels. When you enter the low ceiling lobby, the first thing that catches your attention is not any special decoration, but a moldy humid smell. This smell follows you up to the rooms floors, and some may get used to it but not me. And I guess this is not really hygienic... In the evening the lobby is full of drunkards stumbling out of the really noisy night club. Also, club dwellers share the same lifts as room guests.

There was no hot water in the morning for a shower and breakfast.... what can you say. Looking at it made me loose my appetite. Tinned fruit looked the most eatable. Requested a taxi and told we had to wait 20 minutes so decided to wonder down the road for one. Decided to drink and eat at a different hotel (Hilton Dubai Creek) as we had stayed here before and knew we could not be let down by the service and quality. Thank goodness we did as upon our return to the hotel we decided to go for a night cap. Thought we would try out the English Bar (no longer English) and there was no one there, so we decided to try the other bar and at least that provided entertainment for an hour or 2. Had a few quick drinks then went back to the room. Booked a wake up call for 06.15 and that came through at 06.45 so I was glad I set the alarm on my phone. None of the buttons on the top of the phone worked, and half the lights in the bedroom did not work. No really great views from the Hotel.
