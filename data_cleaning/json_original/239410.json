It's located in an upscale but young-partying area as well as more established local neighborhood places as wel. Close to great nightlife and yet you can turn the corner and find a neat park. The place has internet pc as well. The night guy was very, very pleasant and always answered questions regarding the neighborhood. It has an elevator so you don't have to lug the suitcases up 3 flights of stairs. It's located between Tribunal and Bilbao metro stops and you can easily walk into some neat areas all around.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lagos, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cClean quiet hostal in Madrid\u201d", "Author": "539mxb", "ReviewID": "UR7484486", "Content": "This should have been a review of the Hostal Macarena in Madrid, unfortunately when we arrived they denied having received my fax with the CC details, and the hostal was full. However the very nice owner had room in the Hostal Sil, also owned by him, and drove us there personally. The price was the same but it was about a fifteen minute walk from the Plaza Mayor. We decided to stay there for all three nights, the rooms were clean, a proper double bed, excellent ensuite facilities, and very quiet. It is near two subway stations as well so handy to get to from the airport.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location & Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lafran", "ReviewID": "UR6353647", "Content": "We stayed for a second year at this hotel and found the experiencewas as good as ever. The location is great in a very trendy area and close to all the sites. I am happy to report that we did not see many tourists in this area. At night it can be noisy. People love to party so you may need ear plugs. We found the area very safe and the best way to get there is spending 1euro from the aiport on the Metro and then one block further. At the Metro you can get different tourist day passes very resonable for local touring and trips to the train stations. Ricardo usually runs the desk and is very pleasant to deal with. Make sure he tells you about the greatest seafood resturant at low budget prices. Its a couple of blocks from the hotel. If you want to be next to the Plaza Mayor, try the Hostal La Macarena. (Jose at the desk) We liked the Sil better because of the location. We had room 203 and free internet.", "Date": "December 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Genf", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and well located\u201d", "Author": "Poncharelo", "ReviewID": "UR5819301", "Content": "The good: Very nice rooms, recently renovated, clean, and friendly staff.
