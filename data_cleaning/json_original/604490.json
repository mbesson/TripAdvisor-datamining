{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Now called Suites PF - adequate, but no more We were booked into this hotel by conference organisers. I would not have chosen this hotel myself. It is very noisy - a six lane highway that is busy 24 hours a day stands very close to the hotel, and the internal walls are so thin that any TV noise from an adjoining suite reverberates into your room. Rooms are reasonably sized and include a work area, but wireless internet access was extremely patchy and usually required a trip to the lobby. The whole hotel felt like an office building that had been hastily converted into a hotel.The hotel is located on a run-down block at the edge of Zona Rosa which didn't feel safe late at night. Taxi drivers do not know where the Suites PF is and will usually drop you at the Plaza Florencia round the corner, so make sure you print a map if arriving from the airport or with luggage.I would not stay here again and wouldn't encourage others to do so.", "Date": "Aug 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR300925505", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "KAlcorn"}, {"Content": "Just OK We have chosen the Holiday Inn Zona Rosa Mexico City for its location in a quiet street in Mexico City. Go for it if you are looking for that. The rooms are big and clean, although it isn't the newest of building. Service from room-made was good. Service at reception was very poor and receptionst were not helpful and not at all attentive. From Mexico City we wanted to move on to Chihuahua in the nort of Mexico and needed help in finding a hotel in Chihuahua. Therefore we asked at reception if a reservation could be made at the holiday inn there. We were given the telephonnumber only and told to phone up ourselves. By asking again the holiday inn in chihuahua was contacted and the phone call forwarded to us. The information we got at the other end was that the hotel was full (which wasn't a problem). What a surprised us, that the phone call was charged to our bill (40 mexican pesos = 4 US$). This is not service we expected.", "Date": "Nov 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR373935133", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "hualdan"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d604490-r18877193-Quality_Suites_Cd_de_Mexico_Zona_Rosa_PF-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "604490", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
