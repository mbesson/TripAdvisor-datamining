The hotel is a 5 minute walk from 'Cornelia' Metro station so access to all of Rome is very good. It is not in a particularly nice part of town.. Lots of graffiti and rubbish.. But the hotel itself is clean. Very basic but we had a comfortable stay for the four nights we were there. In my opinion the main down side was the bed was two singles pushed together to form a double which was a little uncomfortable having a gap in the middle of the bed!! The staff were very friendly and accommodating - my partner is gluten and wheat free but was advised by the man on reception to point this fact out to the breakfast waitress and she in turn provided him with gluten free options at breakfast. I know a lot of people have complained about the size of the bedrooms - as far as I'm concerned you get what you pay for! If you are just going to use the hotel as your base for exploring Rome then I'd say the size of the room and bathroom was perfect! The only time we spent in the hotel was to sleep at night, which after a long day of sightseeing the last thing on my mind was the size of the room! Plenty of wardrobe and shelf space.

Arrived in Rome after a lovely flight with Jet2, to be told off by the transfer people!!! (consorzia - dont use them they are hopeless - make your own way to the hotel its very easy!). We arrived at Pinewood and greeted by a lovely receptionist - who as soon as we told her our names, she went straight onto make a phone call, we knew at this stage that something was very very wrong!!!! After she had finished on the phone we were told that the hotel was full and that they had thought we had cancelled our booking (still unsure why they thought that as it was part of a package deal with Thomas Cook and we were not told we had to reconfirm before we travelled). She did however offer to get a taxi to take us to a nearby hotel (it was absolutely throwing it down at this point). So..... we were told to come back in the morning (anytime???) and we would have a room for the night. So.... we got a taxi to a nearby hotel - when we arrived there we were told that they only had one room left and so we didnt have much of a choice here!... the room was the room that looked as though they had used it for guests to use as a 'shower room', it was so run down that we thought we were actually staying at the Colleseum! Nonetheless, we dropped our luggage and off we went to Rome - where we had a fabulous day sightseeing. We then went back to the Pinewood at 10.00 am, the other hotel told us we had to check in after 2pm but we had a trip booked at 12.00 noon so we had to take our luggage somewhere. Imagine our surprise when we arrived and they told us our room was ready!!!! considering the check out time is 11.00 am - maybe our suspicious minds told us something was not quite right! Anyway... they had tried to redeem themselves by being very helpful and leaving us a bottle of red wine (not sure if that was standard or not, but was very nice!). The hotel overall is very nice - you get what you pay for and the breakfast although a little boring was sufficient. Its on the the main route into the centre of Rome (Bus 49) and you can get around very cheaply - 1 euro per ticket or 4 euros for a pass. Dont let this put you off as we were quite happy with what we got (eventually!) but I would recommend phoning the hotel to confirm before you fly! Oh and as said previously if you can make your own way to the airport then do, as the transfer company were over an hour late, even though we had been told the day before what time they would be coming... luckily the driver drove like Lewis Hamilton and we just made it - although we werent seated together! Rome is unbelievable, its cheap to eat in the right places and we had a lovely weekend.

Overall we were happy with the hotel, the reception was modern and pleasant and all members of staff were friendly and helpful \u2013 particularly the reception staff. The rooms were clean though showing a little sign of wear and tear which I guess is to be expected. There\u2019s a flat screen TV, power shower in the bathroom but couldn\u2019t find a mini-bar. The multi occupancy rooms have a bed-settee in a room that can be separated by sliding doors so the overall room is kind of a suite. This gave space for four people, though I hear some rooms can accommodate up to five people. Breakfast was OK with drinks, cereals, breads and croissants etc, parking is free out the front of the hotel and there is a bar in reception though it was closed by the time we arrived. Nearest metro station (Cornelia) is about 15 minutes walk which takes you direct into the city for 1 Euro, or buy a day ticket for 4 Euros. Rome is absolutely dripping in big sights, history and culture, expect queues at the major attractions such as the coliseum and Vatican (queue was far smaller for the Vatican in the afternoon). We looped the city on the topless bus to get a grounding and then used it to get from sight to sight. We had been warned by the hotel staff to watch out for distraction thieves and pick pockets etc as I hear it can be a problem though we saw nothing and you just need to be a little vigilant as you would in any large city that has a large number of tourists. We travelled on the metro and walked back from the station around midnight as a family and felt safe. Also, just in case you\u2019re not aware the metro map looks quite impressive but there are only two actual metro lines giving an X route over the city, other lines are either tram or bus that jostle with the traffic.

Reception was excellent. Spoke English and French with no problems. Nice lobby for a medium size hotel. Elevators are small, typical of many smaller places in Europe, but fonctioned well.With two elevators, practically no waiting time Our room on the third floor, at the front of the hotel was quite acceptable for European standards.Even had a small balcony with chairs and table facing a large park across the street. Room not large but clean, a bath with an excellent shower with plenty of hot water at all time .Flat screen TV with a few English CNN, BBC and Fench, TV5 .stations We slept very well on the harder than \"we're used to\" beds.Quiet place even if there were tours like Insight Vacations, Globus etc staying at the hotel.These tours being there is a a good reference to choose this hotel. Serve yourself breakfasts were very good. Sorry no toasts, just croissants and rolls.Good selection of coffee,juices,fruits,cereals,yogurt,buns and plenty of tables. This hotel is well located if you tour with a car, ample parking. For the others,busses are frequent right in front of the hotel, and less than 10 minutes walk to the excellent Metro/subway system. Within 3 minutes left of the hotel , there is a market. Near the Metro station turn left and within 5 minutes you'll find \"corner pizzerias\" with a good selectiion of other buffet syle food for a much better price. The hotel referred limo to the Airport was a bit pricey but we felt like big shots in the big black Mercedez. From the Airport to the Hotel, do not hesitate to book \"Viator\" shuttle.

There was a nice small bar, and the staff were very helpful (I asked for something everyday). The breakfast was good (good scrambled eggs, pastries) except for the juice machine (watery). The location wasn't a problem for me via public transportation. It is a 10-15 minute walk to the station, and a 10-15 minute ride to Termini. So, despite the fact that the hotel is on the periphery of Rome, access was not a problem at all. When you get off the Cornelia station, you need to walk south toward the park (or total darkness if you're arriving at night) and the hotel will be on your left. The park was nice, esp. in the morning. The hotel is quiet, despite its approx. to the main road, and away from the crowds. There are some services near the train station.

Not much bad to say about the rooms apart from the views were not to 'Mrs. Richards' standard (Fawlty Towers!), mainly tower blocks the same level as the hotel so you get to see for quite a long way. Room service was good though on the first day we were unwelcomed by a receptionist for turning up early to the hotel (not our fault, its just that even Mussolini made the trains run on time). Restaurants nearby were not exactly haute cuisine but they were too out of the way to be any good. So for a good restaurant, you will never go wrong with going to the centre of Rome as it is not as expensive as you think. Recommended restaurants are Pizza Ciro near Spanish Steps, this is the oldest pizzaria in Rome and is very good. Sun Pizza was also very good, near Spanish Steps, ask me for exact address as i do not know off the top of my head but be sure to book for both.

The facts (according to the web): 1. 3 stars 2. 600 mtrs from Cornelia metro station 3. Good sights of the surroundings. 4. Warming atmosphere The reality (according to my experience): 1. The 3 italian stars wouldn't be considered as a 2 star or even a hostel according to spanish laws (old fashioned builidng -specially the elevators-, small rooms, very small bathrooms, no satellite tv or mini bar... 2. The metro is 10-15 minutes walking but it stops at 9 pm for works so you'll need to take taxis after having dinner in the downtown. 3. The sights are nothing special (a park with pines, not sights of the city) 4. The staff is really usefull and charming. They do speak a lot of languages and they try to speak others similar to italian (spanish, potuguese). Concluding: be prepared to be cheated and to pay a lot of money for things they not value at all. All the city is the same so don't think about it and just enjoy Rome. Having interiorized that, the Pinewood Rome is a good option just because is cheap, quiet, the staff is kind and is not excessively far from everything (at least it has the subway near). If you can pay more (around 200 euros per night) some friends have reccomend me two hotels: Franklin Feel The Sound and Meli\u00e1 Rome. Quality assured, they say.
