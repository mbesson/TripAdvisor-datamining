Took the free shuttle to the hotel. Got lucky as shuttle came within 5 mins of me finding where the stop for all the hotel shuttles were. Quick 5 minute trip to the hotel. The hotel and room looked fairly modern. Found the bed comfortable but didn't like the pillows. Found them kind of small and puffy vs the down pillows which I like better. There's free wifi in the room but I had problems connecting to it and ended up just tethering to my phone. Didn't watch a lot of tv but there did seem to be a lot of channels. Standard bathroom amenities. Iron and ironing board came in handy. There's a pool and gym in the hotel but I didn't have time to check it out. Staff were friendly. Primarily interacted with front desk and doorman/bell. No problems with housekeeping. A taxi downtown cost approximately $50-55 pre-tip and took about 30-45mins. Generally didn't have to wait long for taxis. Didn't eat in the hotel. There were a number of food choices nearby. Tony Romas (ribs), Jack Astor's (hip pub), Canyon Creek (steakhouse), Tucker's Marketplace (buffet), and Boston Pizza were within a block. Slightly further out but still within walking distance was Montana's. One slight negative is that you get some airplane noise but of course it's to be expected being so close to the airport To sum it up, it's a solid place to stay if you need to be near the airport.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Bay, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel for flight layover\u201d", "Author": "JillMarch2012", "ReviewID": "UR126193666", "Content": "Arrived at the 3:30 Am and the staff was awsome and very friendly ever at that hour.

We stayed the night of February 1 on Air Canada's dime because they missed our connection. Location: Its near the airport so not much around. There are three or four restaurants in front of the hotel which I would choose over the hotel food. Checkin: Quick and efficient. You can't get a late checkout unless you are a Priority Club member with status or paying $50. This is not helpful when you are stuck until 815pm for your next flight. Room: My wife though it was more equivalent to an old Hampton Inns room than something the Crowne Plaza would be associated with. We had two double beds, with just enough space to move around. Lets say space was a premium. There was a desk and what looked like a 20\" flat screen tv. I would expect more from a Crowne Plaza location. The bathroom was in desperate need of updating. The sink was updated but shower was ancient. If you are over 6'2\", you would have a problem with the low ceiling and I am only 5'9\" but had to bend down to was my hair. Water pressure was reasonable. We both thought the bed was hard and woke up a little stiff the next day. Restaurant: Poor combination of bar, lounge and restaurant. The night we ate there, there was a piano singer in the lounge but because it is one big open space, there was no quiet spot to have dinner with the wife. That is why the diners were probably as far away from the piano as possible. I am not sure where the bar, lounge and restaurant begin and end. The dinner service was indifferent and the food was bland. For lunch the next day, there was lots of staff wandering around but few servicing the guests. Was never offered water, no jam tray brought with the toast, never asked how the food was. Again, food was bland. Unfortunately, with the airline dollars, we could only eat at the hotel otherwise we would have gone elsewhere. intangibles: The shuttle service to the airport was good but the driver tossed in and stacked luggage with no regard that it wasn't his. Luggage storage was appreciated. Overall, don't know why Air Canada prefers them, lots of flight crews there but I would not stay here and wonder if it should be the Crown Plaza, not Crowne Plaza.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Temiskaming Shores, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSweet dreams\u201d", "Author": "NormMary", "ReviewID": "UR123365278", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel on December 8 prior to our December 9th flight to Cuba.

So unlike most airport hotel guests I actually spent my days and nights in the place for several days. Just in case you wondered why I seem to have so much time on my hands to study the hotels and post here on TripAdvisor. OK, reception is very nice. Charming staff, caring and welcoming. Tuesday evenings there is a kind of cocktail party for Priority Club members with snacky things and wine or beer and it was very nice to meet the manager/staff and guests. Guests had great stories to tell though the margarine tub one was probably the best I have ever heard! The hotel layout is a bit confusing, but you have to bear in mind that I am easily confused. I looked at the map of the hotel and found the pool and sauna but the gym/workout room is the other side of the lobby and there is a pillar in the middle of the lobby that makes it hard to see the sign pointing in that direction. There is also a cunningly hidden chocolate/snack shop back there. I didn't even notice it until day 3. It's kind of tacked on to the end of the back of the reception desk and when you first look you slightly wonder if you should even be back there. Well I did. Elevators are swift, sometimes a bit too swift when it comes to doors opening and closing. Gym/workout room. Gets busy at times. Lots of equipment though some of it is better/newer than other bits, but it all works. One morning when I was trundling along doing my 3 miles another guest came in and complained about the cleaning lady being there and the fumes. I honestly couldn't really smell anything from her cleaning and as the room is open 24/7, heck they have to clean it some time!. Not to mention the added bonus for me (white haired old granny) is the view of very nice young pilots making sure they keep fit. sigh... where was I? Oh right.... Pool: it has a shallow end, and a shallow end, and a shallow middle. On the other hand the hot tub is deep. If you only have little legs, I only have little legs, it is a big step to get in and out. Food: walking distance to pretty good choices. Menu, could do with a few more choices but of course most people are not staying several days as I was. The soup and salad option at lunchtime was lovely but I had no idea what it would cost as it was not on the menu. Having said that, on the menu, really do try the gorgonzola, spinach, pear and walnut salad. It's really excellent. Parking. On a previous visit my husband had noticed a car(not his) had been broken into, back window smashed. Also we saw a couple of guys wandering around trying car door handles in the evening, so don't leave valuables in the car. Not the hotel's fault, probably good advice any time you park anywhere. It is well worth signing up for the free Priority Club membership because there is parking for members immediately at the front of the hotel. Not to mention the points of course. Didn't take shuttle bus to airport but I understand that it costs about $6 or so. Room: small and if one person is using the desk and the other wants to get to the other side you can squeeze past or crawl across the bed. The bathroom is also small. But regardless of that, it was clean. You have the option not to have the room serviced at all on any particular day if you prefer and I quite liked that. Nice little bag of lavendar spray, earplugs and eye mask on bed. Loved being able to open the window. I actually like the sound of an airport and planes, even the sound of the flags above the entry way in the wind, though during the storm while we were there the flags got all caught up and I SO wanted to get out there and untangle them. Somehow I doubt that is a TripAdvisor type tip that people want to read about, sorry. Free Wifi, good speed. One thing to note, they seem to change the password half way through the week and don't warn you, so if you can't connect, ask for the new password. Also the floor we were on has the funniest and most welcome sign that I have ever seen in an hotel. They promise that this is a quiet floor, ask that you do not have the TV turned up too loud and/or slam doors and in return guarantee that there will be no children, circus animals or marching bands booked onto that floor.

Part of this is because I love travel, and partly because I also work with hospitality as a Desk Agent. I attended the Anime North Convention at the end of May this year, so I booked as early as I could, knowing full well that the hotel would book up quickly. A note to people who call the toll free number: this is not directly to the hotel. A lot of people don't realize this when booking, even I forgot at first. The service I received from the 1-800 number was mediocre at best. The lady who took my call sounded like when was having a rough day and that my call was a burden. Of course, this does NOT reflect the hotel itself, as it is only a toll free line which is for plenty of the crown plaza hotels. It took the lady a few minutes to tell me what was included with the room as well, which bothered me a bit at first, but knowing not all of the hotels were the same, I can understand why she had to go looking, this was fine. However, a suggestion to others looking to book, call direct. The service you'll receive from the staff directly at the hotel will likely be far superior, and you will have all of your questions answered. I confirmed this by calling the toll free number about a week before arriving to confirm my reservation, as well as ask several things regarding the hotel. They were un-able to answer half of my questions, and directed me to the direct line where I received friendly service and had my questions answered quickly. Upon arriving, we were stuck down by the restaurant on site in the incredibly long line up to check in. Not that the agents were slow, just that there was a massive amount of people attending this convention, most of which had bags surrounding them with their costumes and took up a fair bit of the line. Considering how many people there were, getting to the desk agent was not a particularly long wait, long enough for how many people were there, I felt the wait time was fair, knowing what it's like to be on the other side of the desk. When myself and my friend finally got to the desk, we provided her with our names and informed her we wanted to pay cash. We were informed it was a $50.00 damage deposit per night without a credit card. Again, fair.You have to cover yourself for those who wreck the rooms, and I felt a $50.00 damage deposit for the rooms was nothing, considering the deposits we have. Do not worry, we were well aware of the deposit procedure's, as we inquired about it before arriving. One small snag at check in, however. The lady at the desk looked at her computer for a few moments, then finally informed us that our room was not yet ready. This surprised me a little since it was after 5:00pm, and check out time is at 12:00 noon. I glanced around and noticed some flight attendants just dropping their key cards in the deposit box by the door and leaving the building. I can understand the attendants don't really have much of a place to go, however when you have expected arrivals, late check-outs are a no-no where I come from. The lady was quick to offer us something else instead. Originally booked into a room with two double beds, she asked if we would like to take a room with one king bed as it was already ready and free. The price remained the same. It took only a moment of deliberating on whether or not we'd be comfortable sharing a bed, and were fine with it in the end, as we had intended to put 4 people in a room with 2 doubles before. The upgrade was appreciated, especially with a lobby congested with people for the convention. Waiting for our room to be finished would have been a painful wait with all of our luggage. Props for the agent, I wish I could remember her name to let the manager know how well she handled the situation, and was very personable. It was a little annoying that we were booked on the highest floor, the elevator stopping at the floor below us and trying to get our luggage up the last set of stairs was a challenge. We could have asked for one of the bell boys to take it, but they looked very busy with the people who had tons more luggage, so we made due. We loved our room. It was very bright, cozy, and as many others have said, the lavender pillow spray and earplugs are a nice gift left for those who are light sleepers with the airport. Honestly though, i hardly heard the planes, and I'm an incredibly light sleeper. Coffee machine in the room, ice bucket, access to the pool, sauna and hot tub (call ahead of time about the hot tub and sauna though, they don't have it running all of the time but would be glad to turn it on for you prior to you arriving to the pool). Did I mention the view was excellent? Technically only a view of the city and so on, but being so high up didn't seem so bad once you had such a nice look outside at night. One thing that bothered me was that there was no continental breakfast included, even though we were paying over $100.00 per night. Not having it provided, we had brought some dry foods with us, but contemplated using the order form in the room to hang on the door knob for a pre-ordered hot breakfast. We changed our minds once we saw the price for what you got though. $14-18 for some toast, bacon, eggs and a coffee was a bit much. This was probably the only thing that really bugged me about my stay as a desk agent. The service is superb, however. The agents are always friendly and smiling, and personable. The room was spotless, cozy, warm, all appliances works just fine, and check out was smooth and simple. For having a hotel at least 95% full of excited conventioneers, plenty of which were teenagers to young adults, it was incredibly quiet, and never seemed out of control. Summary: Plus sides: Cozy room, affordable price, accommodated when there was an issue, friendly professional service, pool towels always filled, quiet for being an airport hotel Downsides: No continental even with the price we paid and restaurant too expensive to eat in, late check outs on a busy day caused us, and possibly some other conventioneers some problems. All in all, I was very pleased with my stay. Whether it's for a convention, or just an overnight stop on your way elsewhere, Crowne Plaza is a good choice. The issues I had was a situational issue that was quickly redeemed, and the breakfast can be easily overlooked as there are some great places nearby that serve very hearty meals at excellent prices.

I also stayed at the Sandman on the same trip (unexpectedly due to a flight cancellation). That hotel was probably on a par with Crowne plaza, perhaps the Sandman is a little more hip but not quite up to the quality of the service at the CP or comfort of the bed. Either would be a good choice. I noted a lot of the aircrew appear to stay at the CP, which to me indicates its a good bet for a decent sleep. I was pleased there was a vegetarian option on the room service menu too, which wasn't exactly gourmet but perfectly adequate.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cfantastic staff, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "analyzethis", "ReviewID": "UR109732089", "Content": "I always stay at Crown Plaza Toronto Airport...my favourite!

I hope you enjoy the report! Being an Intercontinental Ambassador, I want to take advantage of my PC Gold card, the 10% bonus points and the double points which is the current offer they are advertising. I decided to start my series of reports by staying at the Crowne Plaza Toronto Airport. When I pulled up I began to think \"man, this hotel doesn't look like the pictures\", but I the outside hides the beautifully refurbished inside well! Unless I am staying at an Intercontinental, I go to the hotel I would like to stay at and check with the front desk to see what their \"walk-in\" rate is for the night. I knew that the rate for one night in a standard King room was $169.00CAD on the internet booking system and wanted to see the comparison between online and in-person. When I arrived I was friendly greeted by the front desk where I asked to get a rate quote. While they looked a little confused at first, during their search for rates I explained that I wanted to get a \"refresh\" and they understood. I provided them with my Ambassador card and they pulled me up a rate of $119.00 for the room I had found. Once I heard that number, I was quickly registered and checked in. One snag which I found was that when I asked about parking I was informed that it was an extra $14. While I was less than impressed, I was still saving over $40 I was going to spend anyways. Once parked, I headed upto my Standard King room. A quick elevator ride up and a short walk down the hall lead me to my room. I opened up the door, switched on the light and saw what I was expecting. A recently refreshed Crowne Plaza styled room which looked very clean, modern, and extremely inviting. As you walked in, the washroom was directly to my left which featured a large sink, large toilet and freshly renovated shower (walls). The tub had some bad wear and tear, which at first I was not impressed with but when I realized it was just flaking a little paint off it was still just ok. Overall the bathroom was clean and also inviting. Moving into the room itself there is a small mirrored closet is located behind the door, a large flat screen TV which sat on the wall above a long desk/drawer set. Opposite of the desk was the huge king sized bed which featured the standard Crowne Plaza ammenity kit of a sleeping mask and pillow scent. The bed was very comfortable and featured 7 (just the way I like it!). Also included in the room was a very large and comfortable leather office chair for the desk/drawer combo and a lounge chair. There is one downside however, and it is one that plagues all airport hotels. The noise of airplanes taking off at all hours of the night. Getting to sleep was a bit of a challenge, but without too much effort I ended up in dream land in no time. Planes take off every couple of minutes, but that night the noise was only there because the airport was using the runway which flew above the hotel. Otherwise, the noise would have been much less. Overall, fantastic hotel! The price was alright I was very happy to see that I got a largely reduced rate by doing the walk-in but was put back when I realized that parking was so expensive. All in all, I was very happy with my stay and I can assure you that I will be returning in the near future. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good hotel near Toronto Airport!

We needed some time to get away and reconnect. Just to give you an idea as to how tired we were, we checked in at 3PM, and instantly fell asleep! So much for a romantic weekend! Check in was a breeze. The only compliant was the $50 incidental fee. You have to pay that \"just in case\" something happens. Since this is the first time I've encountered that at a hotel, it threw me off for a bit. Especially since I had already paid for the room before I had even entered the hotel. But they do refund the money back to you - minus any incidents at the end of your stay. We were on the Quiet Zone level - means no wild parties or kidsruning in the hallway there. The room was modern, nice flat screen tv. They have a clock/CD that you can hook up your IPOD to so you can listen to your own music if you like. The bathrooms are a bit on the small side, not enough room for two people, unless one is standing in the shower! The bed is comfortable, and the room temperature can be set to what you feel like. Since me and the other half like a warm room, we were able to adjust the heater. The hotel provides you with a set of ear plugs - to help block out the noise of the airplanes as they fly by. But since we both can sleep pretty much through everything, that was not needed! My only complaint is that the tv reception was horrible for the lower channels. Really fuzzy and two of the channels kept on overlapping. However, the higher up you went in the channels the clearer the screen was. Also the batteries in the remote control were almost dead so you had to be in the right spot to change the channel. Didn't get a chance to use the hotel facilites, may have to try that the next time.
