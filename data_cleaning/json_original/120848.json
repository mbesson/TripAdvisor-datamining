The friendly staff and quaint atmosphere keep us coming back. This is a unique older hotel with flavor. Love the new (to us)fountain in the courtyard too. Large rooms with New Orleans furniture, high ceilings and privacy. We always stay in the upper rooms above the courtyard. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There are no ice machines, soda machines, pool, etc. this is more similar to a bed and breakfast. The management will get ice for you from the kitchen until 10pm and they sell sodas and snacks in office. No parking lot, but ale parking on side streets and we have never had any problems. This is all part of why we stay here. Do not want cookie cutter. Travel a Loy and look for great alternatives. Located away from noise of downtown but easy trolley ride to everything. Walk within 2 blocks to restaurants, bars, coffee shop, boutiques. Zea's restaurant is our favorite, try the duck empanadas! Pastries and coffee served at hotel but if you want more, Tavern on corner serves excellent breakfast and bloody Mary's.

I was very excited and Mom was curious since she had never experienced staying in other than fancy, more impersonal hotels. Before I start complaining, I must say that the staff is very nice and friendly and that the place looks charming and cozy. We were greeted by a nice lady called Aura and a gentleman who helped us out with our luggage; Aura showed us the way to our room. At first I thought it was very convenient because it was located on the first floor (no elevators here, of course) and in the back of the building, next to the breakfast area. It seemed to be very quiet too. The bathroom had the smallest sink I've ever seen in a hotel (or motel!); no room for toiletries and the towels were clean but pretty old. When I was ready to go to bed, the heater smelled weird, like when something is burning, and soon enough it broke; we woke up in the middle of the night freezing, and to top it of, a garbage truck stopped by and spent what seemed hours on the side of the street emptying the huge dumpsters and making the loudest noise, and a dog who lived in the building behind the hotel (right outside our window) started barking and didn't stop until late morning.... Breakfast was pretty lame: some coffee, teas, some red juice they said was apple juice, half and half, oatmeal, cake and bagels and a cheap cream cheese; no healthy protein, no milk, no fruits. After a very lovely day out, we got back to the hotel at around 10:30pm to learn that we had to move our stuff to another room on the second floor, because they could not repair the air conditioning unit. We thought that even though it was very inconvenient, (since we had to leave the hotel next morning) it was worth it, so we packed and up we went. What seemed to be a nicer and warm room with a fake fireplace, ended up being just another room right above the one we stayed the first night, with an extremely slippery bathtub, and the noise from the garbage truck and the barking dog repeated all over again waking us up way too early. I feel bad for writing a review like this, and I wish I could say that we just got and unlucky bedroom and an isolated issue, but unfortunately I can't.

The coziness of the hotel almost makes you feel as though you're staying in someone's house, in a way. They also have a resident kitty, who was the sweetest thing, and let me snuggle her when I was missing my own cat. The rooms are nice and the sheets are clean. There was ample storage space for clothes (a closet, and a nightstand with giant drawers). The room also came with a microwave and mini refrigerator, which was so useful to have when we wanted to snack on our leftovers from that day's dinner. The kitchenette also has a sink and some cupboards which were great for extra storage. Housekeeping was great in the sense that we didn't even know that they had been in there, until we went to the bathroom to see that we had fresh towels and that things were tidied up a bit. They very much respected our belongings, and everything was just as we had left it. One of the best perks of this hotel is that it was walking distance (or trolley distance) from everywhere that we needed to be! We walked to/from the train station which is about four blocks away. On our first night there we went walking around to familiarize ourselves with the area, and before we knew it, we were in the Quarter! It was about a twenty minute walk, and when we didn't want to walk, we didn't have to because the trolley line is right outside the front door! There are also some awesome restaurants right up and down the street from the hotel, including a great sushi place, and the tavern right next door. Also, if you find yourself running out of toothpaste or something like that, then there's a Walgreen's about three blocks away! All in all, it was a great stay.

The bathroom was also nice - marble counter, etc. When we arrived, the staff was nice, but not overly friendly, but when we called them about a problem with our air conditioner and with our phone, they responded promptly by coming right up to get the air conditioner fixed and brought a replacement phone. The only complaint about this hotel is that you have to find parking on the street either in front of the hotel, on the side of the building, in the back of the building, anywhere you can find it, which was not always convenient. Also, because our room was directly above the sidewalk and the street, we heard a lot of noise - people being loud outside, traffic, etc. There are restaurants within walking distance, and we went to the St. Charles Tavern late one night (24 hours). It was a fun little place, friendly staff, good food and drinks. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cA Fantastic beautiful warm & friendly place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoHelga", "ReviewID": "UR106121351", "Content": "After checking on trip advisor I booked a room for my daughter and I for Easter week at the Avenue Garden Hotel at 1509 St Charles St New orleans La..

What a fantastic find. This is a converted home turned hotel. It has a lot of charm. Me and my girlfriend stayed for 2 nights.

We were treated like family from the get go. The room we were given was VERY clean. It had been renovated and you could tell that they put a lot of effort into the design. The bathroom was very modern and stylish with a rain shower head. We laughed at the fact that there was a mirror over the bed! Talk about kinky. The bed was comfortable. Only small drawbacks was that there was no safe and the side tables were small so you couldn't really rest anything on them. The hotel is located a little further away from the French Quarter. You will definitely need to take a taxi or trolly to get around. Great location if you plan on seeing the Garden District or Arts area (on Julia St) or just simply getting away from the hustle and bustle of the French Quarter without going TOO far. There are BEAUTIFUL old style houses in this area if you walk further along St Charles. Tulane University is a ways down the road too. We caught a few students drinking at the local pub on our way down to the French Quarter. Very harmless, fun loving crowd! There's not much as far as dining in the area. A restaurant named Zea, but its pretty much Burger King and Popeye's from there! The bar on the corner had a great po boy though and a great bartender. I really want to take a moment though to comment about the people that work there AND the owner. Honestly, you will not find any more southern hospitality. The first night we got there, the lock on my suitcase jammed and at 10pm they made every effort to find a bolt cutter for me. The receptionist (Aura) was SO helpful and friendly. But the owner, Lydia, a sweeter lady you will not find. A true southern belle. Spend some time if you can to just talk to her. The stories she can tell and she knows so much of the history of the city. She seriously made our trip and I can't wait to come back in the years ahead to continue our conversations.

One of the most important aspects of all our vacations is where we stay. We select a place based on comfort, safety, location, affordability and any special flair. Well last week, the Avenue Garden Hotel met all our expectation and more. The Avenue Garden is essentially a boutique Hotel/B&B located directly of the trolley line in the Garden District. The Hotel, built in the 1800s, maintains the style and class for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traveler but also is reminiscent of being at home. When you arrive, you receive a key to the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front door and a room key (not a computer chip card). If you have a car to park, then you also get a garage door opener to the Hotel garage less than 1 block away. The Hotel management and staff willingly help with your luggage, parking the car, and any else they can. I booked the hotel through Bookit.com. Bookit advertised free parking even though the Hotel expressly (I saw the emails) explained to Bookit that parking was not free. This is what was so special about Avenue Garden Hotel. Due to Bookit misinformation, the Hotel management decided to upgrade our room to a wing of the hotel where we practically had complete privacy. Now, the hotel manager did not have to open up a separate wing of the hotel just for us, but she did. She did not have to put us in a bigger room with antique amenities, but she did. She did not have to waive our parking fee, but she did. She and her staff did not have to tell us the best hot spots in the French Quarter, but they did.

The location was great...a ten minute trolley ride (depending on traffic) to the French Quarter. The trolley stopped outside the hotel, less than half a block away. Plenty of free parking on the side streets (thanks to Lydia for that tip)...the police station is two blocks away so the area felt pretty safe. We saw officers eating at all of the restaurants around the hotel at various times of the day. Voodoo BBQ which is next door was really good. There is also a 24 hour Tavern next to Voodoo which serves ok food. At Pizza joint on the other side of the hotel which was always packed & Emeril's Delmonico, just a block or so away across the street. As for the hotel itself, it's broken into two buildings...the main house, where you check in and the building that is adjacent to it through a very cool deck/patio area. We stayed in the adjacent building. The room was clean and had plenty of space for us to store our cloths. The only problem we had was that there was a door to an adjoining room...it didn't dull any noise. It was like we were in the room with them.

We were in our room less then 8 hours a day, so it didn't really bother us but I could see where the noise may bother others.

For a start when they say parking they mean that either you pay an extra twenty a night or they direct you to find a side street to park in. We had booked and paid on line which confused the girl on reception who still thought we had to pay, she later appologised. It is unlikley that you will be able to park close to the hotel so travel light as once you arrive there are lots and lots of stairs to climb although to be fair a lady member of staff did offer to help carry some bags. The hotel does have character but that shouldnt include things like cracked mirror in the hall, silvering coming off the mirror in the bathroom etc. As you enter the room the door barely misses banging into the bed and we had a great view of a brick wall. This was the only hotel room we have ever stayed in that doesnt provide at least one bin, nor does it provide coffee making facilities. The bedhead is lovely carved wood but as a result it has sharp edges to bang your head on. The towels provided are the thin and of poor quality. After unpacking we set off to see some sights and got back a few hours later to find the room to our door wide open and two workmen inside working in the bathroom, they said they were doing routing maintence and stayed a further half hour. We later discovered that they were not doing routing maintenance but trying to fix the toilet, however they failed and the toilet continually refilled all night. The breakfast bar consists of two tables in a small alcove at the foot of the stairs, they say they provide cerials however by this they mean packets of oatmeal and grits not cornflakes etc. This would have been fine as I like oatmeal however they provide neither a microwave or kettle just a flask of warm water so that was a non starter. So we settled for toast however they only provide one toaster for all the guests and although it has four slots only two where working to there was a queue but thats just as well as there is only one small table to eat at indoors. We then thought well we will just have some orange juice but only apple is provided but if you want cake there is more than you can shake a stick at. Oh and if you have a problem with cats you may want to give this a miss as they have free run including the kitchen area. Guests are limited to certain hours at the hotel in that they have to leave by eleven pm. The walls are increadibly thin and therefore expect to be woken by any late arrvals and be heard even talking in your room. Certainly you will be woken by street noise or by any rain drumming on the air con units. In terms of location it is just too far to walk to the French Quarter but the street car does stop just outside however as this stop is at the end of the line expect to have to stand for the journey and in the evening the car may well be full and go sailing past, On coming back I misplaced my keys somewhere in the hall way and explained this to the man on reception as I was looking for them, he was indifferent and certainly never offered any assistance. This sounds a bit harsh and in fairness the hotel was ok if a bit below average its just that the comments here made it sound brilliant and its certainly not that.

We don't usually eat cake for breakfast, but it is New Orleans, and it is a decadent way to start a decadent day. We also can't say enough positive things about the staff! They were unbelievably kind and helpful!!! They went above and beyond any expectations to help us fulfill our slightest whim, even in the middle of the night!

We replied we were, and she informed us she was calling to tell us there was an open parking spot in front of the hotel and she had been waiting out front for us. That is how we met Litya, the hotel manager, a charming southern lady who then took the time to show us around the former townhome (my guess) that was our hotel. She answered all of our touristy questions and even recommended The Acme Oyster House to eat, which became our favorite (try the char-grilled oysters!). About the hotel: This is a quaint, small hotel, it is not the Marriott or Hilton. We were looking for something that was had the character of the city, and in my opinion this place has it. The room was medium size, good enough for two people, it had an old fireplace that had been sealed, nice king size bed, tv and window a/c unit that definitely kept the room cool (I keep my house at 72 degrees year round, I like it cold, I cannot sleep if it's hot, and the window unit definitely worked!) The bathroom was a little small, but if you're only complaint is that you wish there was more bathroom space, that's a good thing. There was a continental breakfest served every morning, I didn't partake, as half the reason for the trip was to have NOLA food, but I saw groups of people each morning eating together on the patio sitting area. Coffee was ready every morning, which I did have. The area is great, lots of restaurants around the area.

That being said, the staff is wonderful, the rooms are clean, there's free internet access, a lovely courtyard patio, and a New Orleans-style rooftop balcony that looks onto St. Charles. Not the part of St. Charles in the Garden District - that's further uptown; this is a slightly grittier, but still pretty nice, part of St Charles closer to the Quarter. This has been the major selling point for us: location, location, location. There's a street car stop right across from the hotel, and a cab into the heart of the Quarter is not expensive from here either. There are two tavern-type bars at either end of the block that are both open 24/7. (The St. Charles Tavern used to have awesome food, but is under new management and now the formerly delicious gumbo tastes like it came from a can. Bring back the old SCT!) There is a pretty good fast-food style BBQ place next to the hotel, and a truly excellent - and very reasonably priced - gourmet pizza place on the other side. Oh, and a new sushi/Japanese place just opened a few doors down (haven't gotten to try that one yet). In short, the Avenue Garden is surrounded by fabulous food choices, is close to both the Quarter and Uptown, and is a wonderful mix of New Orleans personality and professionalism.

The accommodations were perfect. The staff is incredibly friendly and the surrounding area is amazing.

We travel often and prefer off-beat, privately owned properties so the Avenue Garden was right up our alley. That said, there are both pros and cons. On the upside, the location in the Garden District is convenient to the street car, dining and the New Orleans vibe is palpable. It should be noted that the hotel offers very limited parking in its garage around the block (with a glitchy garage door) so you may be parking on the street any where within a several block radius. Keep that in mind if you are uncomfortable leaving your car unattended the neighborhood. The hotel does have a loading zone in the front and we were able to park there long enough to move our bags in and out. Upon check-in, we were given a room without a shower curtain but with clothes and personal items in the armoire (the result of a minor miscommunication, as it turns out). Those things were easily remedied but the door didn't lock and that was not! We were moved to another, less desirable room for the night and then moved again to a nicer room the next day. Having seen three rooms, I can honestly say that the furnishings are a little bit dinged but the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms functional, and the overall level of cleanliness is quite good. There are some oddities afoot however: despite two network hubs, there is no wi-fi - no connectability, no signal - but there is a computer for use in a common area and it had good internet speed. All three rooms we saw had ironing boards but only one had an iron. One room had only one lamp and it was in the opposite corner from the beds. There were no hairdryers. If you are traveling by car, seriously consider bringing your own pillows. On the plus side, the staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The owner is making upgrades to the property.

We were very impressed with the hotel. With paying such a cheap rate ($59/night), I was a little nervous about what we'd get because 'you get what you pay for'. We arrived in town around 11 a.m. and didn't figure our room would be ready, but figured we'd stop and see anyway. Well, it wasn't so we decided to take the street car down to the French Quarter and start our sight seeing. We left our luggage in the car because we drove down, but they were also willing to store your luggage in a side room for you if you needed to. We had left our phone number with them, so they called us when the room was ready, which was nice so we didn't have to keep wondering. We chose to park on the side streets, not in the garage that was offered, and had absolutely no problems. The hardest time we had finding parking was in the French Quarter, not around our hotel. After checking in, showing us our room and offering to help carry our luggage for us, the girl working the front desk left us to get settled in. Our room was great!! It was number 47 which I would definitely recommend. It was on the top floor on the front so we had two double doors going out to the balcony and a king size bed. They made this room very modern, as well. The bed (king size) was not the most comfortable, but it served its purpose. My only two complaints about this hotel would be the light in the bathroom above the mirror didn't work and the light bulb in the ceiling didn't work all the time as well. My husband was trying to get the bulb in the ceiling to work, and it shattered everywhere. They came up and cleaned it up very quickly, but never got it replaced, so I had to do my hair/makeup in the main room with the light from a lamp. My second complaint is there's no phone in the room. That made our previous problem a little inconvenient. Overall, I would recommend this hotel! It's location was great with the street car right out front and two great restaurants on each side of it!

The room had a king sized bed(comfy bed and pillows), desk and chair, nice size t.v. and a non working fireplace that added a bit of charm. The bathroom may have been a little outdated as well but was well lit by a small window and had great water pressure as well as an abundance of hot water...I love hot showers. The front desk was very helpful in finding me the best spots in town to eat and listen to live music.

I'm both cheap and a single traveler, so it is a great hotel for me. When I first started coming to New Orleans, I would compare prices and the AGH was always very reasonably priced compared to its competition. A couple of the rooms I have stayed in were a little on the small side, but they were plenty for just me. The bigger rooms should be enough for a couple. The hotel is located in sort of an odd neighborhood that isn't in any of the destinations, but it is near to all of them. I really don't understand why people would want to pay a severe premium to stay in the French Quarter and the nonsense that it entails when you can stay 5 minutes away for a fraction of the price. The hotel doesn't have a bar or restaurant, but it really wouldn't make sense to have either when there is a perfectly good BBQ joint on one side and an excellent pizza place on the other.

A few small flaws keep it from perfection, but for the price I don't think it can be beat anywhere. I had never visited New Orleans before, so I have no point of reference for the feel of the city and the Garden District, nor for what makes a good price for a hotel there. But since what we paid was less than a Motel 6 here in Wilmington, N.C., (and which is nowhere near either the beach or the river!) and the hotel itself and the neighborhood it lives in were both significantly more charming than the average Motel 6, I call it a fabulous bargain. As a boutique hotel, the Avenue Garden probably offers a wide variety of rooms, so I will specify that we were in Room 16. It's a two-bed double, with two double windows (although the view is nothing to write home about \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a brick wall on one side and a vacant lot and cyclone fence, with morning glories, on the other) providing plenty of natural light. The window air conditioning unit wasn't on when we arrived late in a sweltering afternoon, but it cooled off adequately while we were out for dinner. The beds, bathroom, shower, and water pressure were all fine, but the water temperature \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \"cold\" water so warm that no hot needed to be added for an August shower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c left something to be desired. The biggest issue we had with the hotel staff was the mystification with which they greeted my request for something nonskid to stand on in the smooth-as-glass bathtub while showering. Apparently their 78-year-old mothers aren't using it! We made do with a towel in the tub. The second-biggest issue was their insistence on making up the entire room every day, removing perfectly good soap and shampoo, when we specifically asked them to leave clean towels only. We also had a minor problem with the remote control for the TV that took four people two days to fix. For those driving to New Orleans or renting a car for the visit, note carefully: the garage is very small, perhaps eight spaces. It is free, which is great, but there wasn't a space available the day we arrived, so the car had to stay on the street in a metered space that needs quarters beginning at 8 a.m. Fortunately, we were having breakfast around the corner and saw some other guests leaving to go check out, so I ran and got the prized garage clicker before I fed any meters. The staff suggested that it would help to mention that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re driving when you make the reservation, although they didn't go so far as to say that would guarantee a spot as they are first-come, first-serve. There is also a distinct lack of information provided about the hotel's services and offerings, at least in our room. We had to follow a man with an ice bucket to find the ice machine. The desk is open (I think) between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., with a phone number for other-hours emergencies. There is a breakfast area (it looks like one and one desk clerk referred to it as such), but no breakfast, only coffee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and infuriatingly enough, they turn off the reservoir-style coffee maker so that it takes an hour to heat up and I couldn't even make tea that I brought myself until 8 a.m., after arising at 6 since I was still on Eastern time. The website claims internet access in every room, but since there was no desk and this was among the amenities about which no information was provided, I never even got out my laptop to try and find out. The old, slow computer in the lobby just outside the room sufficed for a quick map search or to check my email. Somehow it got logged off one morning, but the staff got it back up for me when I asked. The staff, except for the two issues noted above, were all very friendly and helpful. There were a couple of unusual aspects to the reservation and they dealt with them in a an outstandingly satisfactory fashion. When I left the keys on the nightstand during a jaunt down on the bayous, they happily let us in when we returned, and they even printed a map for me, out of my email. While it would be a very long and perhaps not recommended walk to the French Quarter, it can also be a pain to drive. Fortunately we went there with family members who were staying there, so I didn't have to drive or pay for a cab. Based upon my observations of traffic, etc., I think I would drive and pay to park in the public lot along the river near the French Market for a daytime visit and take a cab for an evening out in the French Quarter. It's also important to note that the streetcars, as of this writing at the end of August 2007, are still not running along St. Charles Avenue past Lee Circle (coming from the French Quarter). Lee Circle is about 10 blocks away, but I didn't see a likely (safe and comfortable) pedestrian route there. I don't know what the schedule is for restoring streetcar service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once they are back, the transportation issue would be much less important. I might even do without a car on a return trip if the streetcar were running \u00e2\u20ac\u201c airport shuttle is $13 each way per person, so for just me it would be a decent savings. Right in the walkable radius of the hotel are several options for food, including Emeril's Delmonico. We didn't eat there, but certainly would give it a try if we hadn't had such a busy schedule already. The best meal we had in three days there was at VooDoo BBQ right next door \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so close that the hotel's back patio connects to theirs! A party of six had all the major offerings on the menu but the ribs, and it was all absolutely wonderful, from the pulled pork and brisket to the corn pudding and \"gris-gris greens\" (mustard) just like Grandma's. St. Charles Tavern around the corner was good for breakfast (think neighborhood bar that morphs into pancake house at dawn, open 24 hours!) but we ran into a real attitude problem on the second visit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c look for a separate review shortly. The rest of our party was staying in a nice, slightly larger hotel with a pool, in the French Quarter, for about $20 a night more for a comparable room also including free parking, and walking distance to all the tourist stuff. Those who want to be in the thick of things in the French Quarter may want to spend a little more, especially if they don't plan to drive at all. But for us, with a schedule that included several legs on I-10, accessed only five blocks from the hotel, this one really suited us, and if I go back I will definitely stay there again. As for New Orleans itself, well, there isn't room in a review like this. It was unbelievable all the way around, but to us what is most remarkable is the resiliency of the city and its people. It is still terrible in many places, and we may well have dealt with people whose living conditions are still bad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but in tourist places and elsewhere, they were warm and welcoming and never let on, and we were deeply impressed.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina, Saskatchewan Canada", "Title": "\u201cWas like being at home\u201d", "Author": "HeartNewOrleans", "ReviewID": "UR7630925", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel in June of 2004 and had a wonderful time.

Our double room was converted to two singles (which doesn't work well with a 3 year old), and then we ended up with a single with a rollaway. To date (admittedly, only a few business days since), we have not seen a refund for the room discrepancy. Also, although parking is mentioned as available, it is provided at an extra cost of $10 a day. And that gets you a garage door opener to their storage facility, which houses five cars at best, and requires you to Back out onto a major thoroughfare to leave. Additionally, they oversell the parking, to the point that our last night we were unable to make use of it. They were at least gracious enough to refund the cost of the parking for all nights. Continental breakfast does not exist at this point, post Katrina. Entry to the hotel is through a single front door. Our room was down a hall, outside, then up a stairwell outside. The entrance was a block and a half away from the 'available' parking. Construction work started around 8:30 each day we were there (including a weekend), with the accompanying noises, some of which managed to be just outside our room. Also, our room had a broken water pipe for the shower stall, to the point we could see water leaking through the wall in two places above the shower head. The resultant smell of mold (and possibly a dead animal in the walls) made the bathroom a chore to use.

Misses: -Caf\u00c3\u00a9 du Monde-beignets are inconsistent. First day we ordered them they were hot, fresh and airy, the second day we ordered them they were cold, spongy and heavy. There is another caf\u00c3\u00a9, Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Beignet across the street but it was closed for the duration of our stay. - 24 hour St. Charles tavern/restaurant a few blocks down from the hotel, stay far, far away from this place. My boyfriend ate a sandwich there on our last night and became violently ill with food poisoning. We wrote a letter to the health department regarding this incident. We had a car and used it during the day. Streetcars are still not running so we walked to the French Quarter in the evenings and took a cab back to the hotel. There are busses that run along St. Charles, but the service is not very frequent. Because we had a car we were able to venture out of the tourist districts and visit the various districts that were hit by the hurricane. It was encouraging to see the effort being made by residents to help each other get their lives and properties back together.

(One of them has a round bed in it!) We had the right townhouse upstairs balcony room and our friends had the other room behind ours. Both were enclosed in a tiny hall that made us feel like we had our own wing! There were other rooms that were accessable by the outside porch and we loved the little patio area. We also had #45 downstairs which faced the street and the young people loved it. It was big enough to handle 3 21yrs olds and all their stuff and beautifully decorated. The staff was very helpful and courteous, especially since we arrived between the departure of one tropical storm and the anticipated arrival of the next one. Our beds were quite comfy and we had no noise from the street. Besides the restuarants nearby, there is also a day spa a couple of doors down.

We wanted to experience the historical value and culture of the city first-hand, so we opted not for one of the larger, newer hotels downtown - like the Wyndham. We chose the Avenue Garden because it looked quaint online, the price was beyond right, free parking was being offered at the time, and, above all, there were no recent bad reviews. We really value other travelers' comments and, because of that, I hope this review helps others. As other reviewers have said, this hotel has loads of potential and good features - good location, nice artwork on the walls, tall ceilings, secure parking, etc. Larger, structural refurbishments would make this place fabulous. However, there are several low-cost things that NEED to be remedied now: spots on towels, spots on blanket, spots on lamp shade, hole in sheet, not changing sheets daily, permanent rather than replaced-daily bathmat, old and lumpy pillows, etc. These things make ALL the difference between \"great\" and \"wish we would've stayed elsewhere.\" I wish I would have taken pictures of our room because we were clearly not in one of the recently remodeled rooms; other rooms on this site were much nicer than the one we stayed in. I don't consider myself a \"picky\" traveler because we don't spend a lot of time in the room when we travel - but the bathroom we had actually made it DIFFICULT to get ready efficiently and get out on your way. It was super tiny (which is something that can't be fixed without lots of $$) BUT, there was no place on the sink for toiletries, a mini garbage can that we quickly overflowed, no place for anything in the shower - I found myself holding my razor in my teeth while I lathered up to shave my legs.

The hotel could use a bit of work as far as maintenance goes but it's obvious that the owners are trying hard to get it in top shape and keep it up. The privately owned hotel feels like a modified bed and breakfast. The staff was sincere and very accommodating but may not be as knowledgeable as the professionally trained staff from a hotel chain. We didn't get quite the information we were hoping for as far as tours and general information. However, they were courteous and helpful as we needed to store some food items for our 2-year-old in their fridge. The first night, we were given room #45 which was a BIG, very beautiful, stand-alone room with private entry, giant ceiling, beautiful bathroom and architecture. The only problem for us was that it faced the street and was very, very noisy - so we asked for a room change and were re-assigned to room #30. This was a smaller but quiet, private and cozy room on the third floor (it was the only room on that floor). People who may have concerns about climbing a lot of stairs should request not to be put in this room as there are many stairs and no elevator. The room was clean and nice and we had maid service daily, including the carpet being vacuumed (which we really appreciated since our little boy had left several trails of cracker and cereal bar crumbs). The hotel was located right on the St. Charles streetcar line. There were plenty of restaurants within a few blocks of the hotel: Slice Pizzeria (check out their calzones) and Voodoo BBQ (not that impressive). The St. Charles Tavern (food was ok, a good place to mingle with the locals) is approximately 20 feet away, a Cajun/Mexican restaurant across the street, a 5-star Emeril restaurant, and fast food restaurants like KFC, Wendy's and Burger King are just around the corner. There is also a Walgreen's and an ice-cream shop 2-3 blocks away and the D-Day museum is within 15 minutes walking distance. You don't need a car when you stay at this hotel. Some previous reviewers stated that the streetcars are always full - you can avoid that by leaving earlier (8:30am - 9:30am). We never had to wait for more than 15 minutes even on the weekend. Safety - the main street seemed pretty safe. There were joggers running in the area all the time. Breakfast - The hotel's breakfast was typical: bagels, English muffins, cereal (two kinds), milk, coffee and orange juice. Nothing fancy but will save you some breakfast $$ if you're on a budget. I was hoping to try out the banana bread some of the previous reviewers were talking about but it was not available during our stay. Price - Incredible value. One piece of advice - shop for the cheapest rate on the web and then call the hotel directly and ask for that rate. That way, you will guarantee yourself the lowest rate and avoid paying the service fees the travel websites charge. Summary - Avenue Garden hotel is not the Hyatt (and you are not paying the Hyatt's rate, either). Unless you're honeymooners, what you need is a comfortable and cozy place where you can have a good night of sleep after a busy sightseeing day, and this place fits the bill.

The staff were informally pleasant and courteous not fawning, like I have encountered elsewhere in the USA. The breakfast was basic (bagel, muffins, cream cheese, jam, coffee, juice) but suitable. The location is ok, being close to the Garden District and not far from the French Quarter by tram (I might have walked into town in the mornings if I had spent long enough to get my bearings, but I took the tram instead). There was a small amount of mould in the bathroom, but nothing terrible. There was free internet/web e-mail access. I was very pleased with what I got for my money and although I rarely visit the same town twice for pleasure (the world is so big and life is so short!) I would consider staying there again if I was staying in New Orleans again. But if I had a bigger budget I might also stay in a quiet part of the French quarter instead. Basically you get what you pay for and this was the very most I would expect to get for my money. If you book into this place, don't expect the hotel to be the highlight of your stay in New Orleans - it's not a designer hotel experience by any means, just a clean, comfortable pleasant place to stay in while you are touring the swamps/French Quarter/Garden district (the latter is very close by). Having said that, I felt like it was a very suitable place to stay in New Orleans, very good to get a feel for the character of a non-touristy bit of town, rather than some boring generic higher class hotel in the centre of a town. Out of everywhere in the world I have been, the hotel reminded me of cheap, informal, pleasant, quiet hotels in Northern Europe - like Holland.

When we arrived I was amazed at how well they took care of the place, lots of southern art on the walls, very charming. The first room they put us in was nice, but there was no balcony, and the window had a view of a wall, I said I thought we were getting a room with a balcony. She said if we waited a few minutes that they would put us in one of their newly renovated rooms, so we had lunch at the voodoo bbq, which by the way is excellent, and when we came back they showed us to our room. We were the first people to ever stay in this room, since the renovation, and it was beautiful, with a private balcony and wicker furnature. The bed was huge with a satin comforter and pillows. The bathroom was all marble, this room was so charming that I felt right at home.

The hotel certainly not a \"4-star hotel\" by the standard definition, but it deserves 4 stars based on the price-to-quality ratio. My wife and I, who are both \"poor\" students, stayed there 3 nights, right before Christmas, and paid $53/night. The hotel was acceptable; the hotel itself was definitely a good value for the price and location, especially considering most other hotels in the ZIP code were nearly twice as expensive. It's not in the heart of the French Quarter, but that section is loud and crowded anyway, so I liked being a mile away from the \"action.\" The St. Charles trolley stops 20 ft. from the hotel door and will take you right to Burbon Street/French Quarter within 10 minutes, so, if you want to save $30-$50 by not staying in the F.Q., this hotel is a good bet. The best deal for transportation is to buy a 3-day trolley/bus pass, which is available for $12 at Williams Grocery about 8 blocks up St. Charles. (It's easy to miss the sign, unless you're walking on the opposite side of the street.) If you fly in, don't rent a car unless you must. Parking is scarce and expensive, and the streets are narrow and confusing. We took the E-2 bus, which runs from the airport's upper deck right into the heart of the N.O. business district (downtown). It is about a 10-15 block walk to the hotel from the final stop of the bus to the hotel. It's around a 15 minute walk, quite an exercise when you're towing luggage, but it is not too bad compared to the $26-$28 that you would spend on a cab or a shuttle for two. The hotel is fairly clean, though older. It is like a mediocre bed and breakfast. There were places that could have used a touch of paint, and there was a little rust on the metal fixtures. You must be rung into the building by someone at the front desk, and there is no one manning the desk in the middle of the night (11 pm to 7 am, I believe), so they give you a key to get into the hotel along with your room key. All in all, though, it was not that bad. Unless you're used to staying in the Ritz-Carlton, this is a fine choice for those on a budget. Besides, when you're a tourist to N.O., you don't really spend much time in the hotel anyway. Each morning, there is a continental breakfast. It's decent--bagles, English muffins, cereal with milk, orange juice; one morning there was also cinnamon bread and hard-boiled eggs. There is almost always free Twinnings tea and mediocre coffee (though sometimes they ran out of tea bags; you can ask for more, though). Next to the small eating area (gets crowded in the morning), there is a small outdoor patio where you can eat if the weather permits. There is also a sitting room/computer room. Internet use is free, but there is sometimes a line of 2-3 people waiting to use the one computer during popular hours. The decoration of this room is a bit tacky and outdated (ugly green cover on the couch, old unread books on bookshelves, antiquated computer manuals with the books, etc.). The room was acceptable, TV had dozens of cable channels, bathroom was fairly clean, and maid was competent. There was no \"Do Not Disturb\" doorhanger, so I guess you have no choice about maid service. The bed was large and comfortable, and the room, as promised, included ironing board, table, chairs, and extra pillow. There was an ice bucket, but it did not come with a liner bag, and I never saw an ice machine anyway, so we didn't use the bucket. The staff seemed nice, but I didn't get the extreme friendliness that other people have reported. We arrived a few hours early, and William let us check in early after a 15-min wait to get the room ready, so that was nice. He wasn't especially friendly, but was not rude either; he was just \"there.\" The other staff members were just \"there\" for us too. I have no specific complaints or praises for them. The one main complaint I have happened one week after we checked out. We prepaid for the room, so we did not have to pay when we checked in or out. However, since we had paid in advance, when we checked in, we were charged a provisional $60 to offset any expenses we might incur while there. This was fine with me; many hotels do this, and I knew we would have no other expenses of importance on the room. We were supposed to have this provisional charge refunded when we left if there were no other charges. While we were there, the only additional expenses we had were 2 local phone calls (35 cents each)--that's it. Well, a week after we checked out, I viewed my credit card statment and found that we had been charged $43 extra!! (not 70 cents!) I immediately called the hotel and asked for the reason for this charge. The woman who answered appeared to be new. She looked at my account in the computer and could not find any record of this extra charge. She said (this is a direct quote), \"We didn't make no charges on your card.\" I told her I was looking right at my credit card statement with the extra $43 charge, so someone obviously did. She could not explain it, so I asked that William to call me the next day, since he was the one who checked me in. I thought maybe he could explain the extra charge. I didn't receive a phone call, but I did contact my credit card company to challenge the bogus charge, and they took it off. I'm still not sure why this charge was made, so I recommend anyone staying at this hotel to double-check your credit card statement to make sure your card is properly charged. If it hadn't been for this frustrating surprise, I would have granted the hotel a 4 rating. I would probably stay here again if I return to N.O., but I'll be sure to watch the charges to my card.", "Date": "January 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cThe Charm of New Orleans\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2971263", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here during our anniversery for a nice little gettaway.

The frontdesk workers were so helpful and friendly, which is one of the main reasons why I know we will be staying here again next visit to New Orleans. The location is perfect because it is right smack dab in the middle of the garden distriict and the French Quarter, which allowed us to veiw other areas of New Orleans besides Bourbon Street. We stayed in a beautifully decorated room facing St. Charles Avenue, which is their honeymoon suite. They upgraded our room to this suite when they realized it was our anniversery. The suite had a red velvet circular bed and a mirror on the ceiling... very romantic, and is located on the second floor of this to die for pizzaria.

We got to the hotel and the room I was told we were booked in was \"under construction\" and we couldn't stay in it. I was told we would be in a revamped room when we booked with a new bathroom. They moved us to another room and it did look clean, but looked like it wasn't remodeled in about 30 years. The baseboard in the bathroom was splintering off and mold was around the base of the tub. The room had a view of a brick wall and had really no character. Let's say the holiday inn or best western is way above. We would have been paying $55.00 a night and that room was NOT worth $55.00 a night. So we thought we could deal with it, tried to be in good spirits, and went out for lunch. About 6 hours later we get back and open the door to find our luggage is missing and a note says our bags are moved and to go to the front desk. We were told our room had termites and they moved us to room 12. This room was right next to the front desk and was totally loud and noisy. We found a bag of half eaten chips in the room, the toilet seat was dirty and again the atmosphere was just depressing. Needed major work on the bathroom especially. We decided we needed to leave. I was not going to let the room ruin our trip. The front desk person was VERY nice and understanding and didn't give us any problem. He worked with us and gave us our money back, I think he knew we felt cheated. As we were waiting for him, we saw a hotel staff member bringing wine to the remodeled room we were supposed to have in the beginning, so they obviously lied to us about the under construction excuse and had given away the room to someone else. It just seems like this place has potential, but needs work. They should have remodeled the whole place before they opened it. They had the water turned off for about 6 hours that day on the one half of the hotel and I know people were at the front desk complaining about not being able to shower or shave. The hotel's solution was to let them into an unoccupied room in the other side of the hotel to use the bathroom, they were trying to be helpful. I also think the location is not great. It's in a kind of ugly section of town inbetween the garden district and the Business District. For first-time traveleres to New Orleans, this place is not a good option because you won't get the true New Orleans expereince unless you stay in the or close to the Quarter. If you are a college kid who does not CARE at all about the room and you are planning on just somewhere to crash, this place is OK. But if you are a couple looking for a romantic place, a business traveler or family, this place is not for you. It has a small amount of potential to be a nicer place, they just need to get organized and work out the kinks.", "Date": "December 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2883469", "Content": "I stayed at the Avenue Garden Hotel in late October.

Everyone from the front desk staff, housekeeping to even the owner are helpful with whatever I may have asked. The hotel has a great New Orleans charm to it, they have a FREE breakfast in the morning, the streetcar is directly outside the front door of the hotel making it so easy to get back and forth to the hotel from the French Quater. There is so much to do in this area of the city even though it is not in the main area, the French Quater. It is in this area the locals call the Garden District, it is an old area of New Orleans that the homes are like masions, they are amazing, it is for sure the most beautiful area in New Orleans that I saw.
