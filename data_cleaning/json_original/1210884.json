The room was smallish and cluttered with too much furniture (occasional table, freestanding lamp, heater and second chair). There was a hot water jug for making tea/coffee (if you took your own) but only 2 glass tumblers for drinking from. The room also had a fridge and a safe. The shower was brilliant - hot, powerful and the bathroom remained dry. Towels were individually wrapped in plastic - not good for conservation but kept them dry as the towel rack was located in the shower cubicle. The hotel does not provide breakfast but the location is just off Nathan Road where there are plenty of eateries. The nearest MTR station is Jordan which is about 5 minutes walk away.", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cClean\u201d", "Author": "misslenganji", "ReviewID": "UR35512777", "Content": "simple thing to say. looking for a simple clean room with no other services then fine you got it. good if youre on a budget close to shopping streets minibar for you to fill up so good cheap option. i stayed at the Nathan hotel which is lovely but made a mistake and forgot to book a room on my return from mainland china. When i got to hong kong i found it was a holiday and all good hotels where booked. I simply got a cab and went to the nearest hotel that looked ok from the lobby. I guess i must have saved a good amount of money and was comfortable enough. the rooms are clean the lobby is nice and you get simple amenities in the bathroom which is a shower but then again that was fine because i never use baths in hotels anyway. ( you don't know if they are cleaned properly no matter how shiny) i would say this is a simple value hotel comparable to say a travel lodge in the uk.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "New San Diego Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1210884-Reviews-New_San_Diego_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.1-4 Chi Woo Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1210884", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b8/3c/65/cluttered-bedroom-at.jpg"}}
