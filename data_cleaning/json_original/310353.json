{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Exceptional value, very clean! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Punawai as an alternative to a pricey hotel we were staying at in downtown Honolulu. The room was very clean, had a complete kitchen, a new bathroom and even parking! Great location, it's walking distance to the beach and all the shopping. Kathy the manager was also very nice. An extrordinary value at $100 per night.", "Date": "Sep 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR880337232", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Lauren_Val"}, {"Content": "Second time's not a charm We stayed at the Aloha Punawai for the first time in December of 05 and loved it. We felt very comfortable with the clean but basic accomodations and loved the young couple taking care of the place...they were very helpful with directions and recommendations, were warm, and interesting to talk to. We didn't see much of the owner on our first visit, but she seemed nice enough. The hotel is very clean and great for travelers like us who don't spend much time in the room, so we came back in July of 07 to find a different couple taking care of the property. They were around all the time and we often felt like they were babysitting our comings and goings...very uncomfortable. When we did finally see the owner, she did not remember us nor was she friendly. She barely cracked a smile. The outdoor area was renovated nicely, but the rooms still haven't been updated since 1975. We will not be back for a third visit and recommend you spend and extra ten bucks per night at a place you know you will feel welcome.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR461561571", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Carl33"}, {"Content": "Great location and value for the money I stayed at the Aloha Punawai Hotel because the location is great. The beach is a two minute walk from the hotel and the post office is across the street. The rates are reasonable. I visited Oahu in December 2006 for the Honolulu Marathon and the Aloha Punawai Hotel cost me only $818.93 for seven nights including tax. The owner and staff are friendly and helpful. If you want luxury stay at the Halekulani or Sheraton Moana Surfrider. Aloha Punawai is just right for people who need a safe and clean place to stay in.", "Date": "Jul 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR523547110", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AloharunnerSanDiego"}, {"Content": "Too Close for Comfort We booked with this hotel based on the rave review in Frommer's. There are pros and cons associated with the Aloha Punawai. Yes, it was very affordably priced--but the best benefit was the location! It is within walking distance of nice shops-- and only 1/2 block away from the Outrigger, so you can go there for beach access and meals (plenty of dining options). The downside with this hotel--and to us, this was a very big downfall--is the lack of privacy. My husband and I felt like we were in high school, with our comings and goings being monitored by our parents. There appeared to be lots of vacant rooms, yet the innkeeper placed us right next door to her. We felt she was scrutinizing us each time we came and left. She left a huffy note for my husband in our room once when we went out. We were not comfortable at all. Finally, though we did save money by staying here, we were basically staying in a college dorm room. Window air conditioners; a bathroom window that would not shut (opened onto the courtyard where the innkeepers and their friends frequently sat at patio tables);1950-s style appliances; and the cement block walls and sterile tile floors were reminiscent of a hospital room. I could have probably overlooked the lack of personality in the room if I hadn't felt like I was the center of attention for some nosy innkeepers.", "Date": "Jan 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR119698316", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "3Bostons"}, {"Content": "Affordable, well-located, no frills, motel-style hotel We stayed at this motel-styled hotel from April 20 to April 27th, 2006. It is located half a block from the beach, it's very clean, and the people who run the place are friendly and extremely helpful. When we first arrived, we were disappointed by the cement block walls (although they were painted), the very basic furniture, the lack of a view, and the size of the space. But the place came with a full kitchen, the cleaning service was great, and we were VERY well located, especially considering that we were only paying $95 per night. I should mention that we had our 3 year old and our 10 month old with us, so we weren't planning on splurging on our surroundings. If you want to treat yourself to the luxuries, this isn't the place for you. But if you want a place you can rely on as your launching pad to the sights and events of Waikiki without spending too much money on your accomodation, call this place. We checked out three other hotels while we were there (research for our next trip), and by the time we left, we were extremely grateful we wound up at the Aloha Punawai. Aloha!
