First of all I looked everywhere trying to get transportation from the airport, finally I called the Inn for suggestions, they have a private driver (Maru) with a Limo, who meet us at the airport, and brought us straight to the Hotel, great service and cheaper that a cab! So our trip started off on a good foot, as a side note do not jay walk in Seattle and obey the walk/no walk signals, as we were getting out of the limo a pedestrian was getting a ticket! we stayed in a room on the third floor, everything you would need, small ref., microwave, coffee pot. The room didn't have air conditioning, but I understand they have some rooms with, this didn't effect us, the weather was nice. A block down from the Inn is a Safeway food store, you can literally eat all your meals right there! A few blocks east is the space needle and Monorail, we rode the monorail downtown and back, easy access, if you don't mind walking a little bit. We wanted to take a tour since my wife had never been here, went down to the front desk and they arranged a tour with Northwest for us, also helped us get to a baseball game that evening, very friendly and helpful. We did the #1 Seattle City Tour, I recommend this tour (3 Hr +) . One of the reasons we flew into Seattle was because its cheaper than Vancouver, and we wanted to see the city. There are several ways to get to Vancouver, but we rode the Amtrak Cascades, it left Seattle at 7:40 am. make online reservations in advance, this was a great way to travel, scenic and not stressful. Arrives in Vancouver @ 11:40 am. If I did this trip again I would stay at the Mediterranean Inn again, I almost forgot the roof view was voted one of the top 10 Hotel Views in the country, got some really good pictures from there, and met some fine folks there too.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDecent Hotel, Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "EmilyandSam", "ReviewID": "UR126053424", "Content": "Having lived in Seattle for 29 years, I never had a personal need to stay at a hotel. Since we have moved away, I stayed at the Inn recently on a trip back to Seattle. For $84/night, you really can't beat that rate! The hotel is located on lower Queen Anne. Queen Anne is the neighborhood next to downtown Seattle, so a great, vibrant neighborhood close to everything. Easy access to I-5, a quick bus ride/walk/cab to downtown Seattle (less than 2 miles), a block from Key Area, and maybe only a mile to the Seattle waterfront. Queen Anne is divided into 2 neighborhoods - upper and lower Queen Anne. Both parts of \"the hill\" have great restaurants and cute shops, but lower Queen Anne has a younger, more urban vibe while upper Queen Anne is more residential. The hotel room was clean, service was friendly, but the hotel is relatively no frills. I may have a different opinion if I had visited the rooftop deck, which looks pretty amazing from the pictures on Trip Advisor. The window in my room looked into other rooms. It was a little disappointing that wi-fi was not free, as I feel like so many hotels offer free wi-fi now. I did really love the Starbucks access from the lobby - a true sign you're in Seattle! I believe parking was $15, and I recommend it, as parking is scarce since this hotel is so close to Key Arena and downtown. Some great places in the neighborhood are Peso's or Laredo's (both are Mexican restaurants with fun bars), The Great Nabob for a neighborhood bar with good local beer on tap, The Sitting Room for a cozy glass of wine and European-style hors d'oeuvres, and don't forget 2 Seattle institutions for casual dining - Pagliacci's Pizza and Dick's Drive-In hamburgers... both within a block of the Inn.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "misharpittman", "ReviewID": "UR125480796", "Content": "We arrived a little early but they went out of their way to let us check in early,parking in alley behind with secure gates and you use a card key to gain entry.The rooms are smaller but very clean and they have nice beds with Starbucks coffee and Tazo tea in the room and pop corn with bottled water.This hotel is decorated very nice and is very clean with a Starbucks adjacent to the lobby, Hey that must mean it is Seattle!!!!But the location is great to sight see and the bus system is available and lots of taxis everywhere so do not hesitate this place is GREAT.You can grab the monorail also but parking downtown can add up pretty fast so taking transit is a great option", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, Washington", "Title": "\u201cLovely little hotel for a family trip!\u201d", "Author": "DanielleDes", "ReviewID": "UR124949241", "Content": "We stayed four days in this charming, well placed hotel.

When my partner flushed the toilet for the first time it was half a centimeter from overflowing filled with toilet paper. Rang the front desk to which I was informed that there was no \"maintence person\" on duty and that I could come down and get a plunger to plunge the toilet myself! I had to get dressed out of my pjs and go to the front lobby not one of the staff who was working at the time offered to come up and assist with the toilet and I had to ask if the toliet was not fixed could we swap rooms. They said they would swap us to another room, but as we were jet lagged and had already unpacked our things and stocked up the fridge with fruit and water it was not an option at that time of night. So I plunged and fixed the toilet myself and then had to walk down to return the plunger. In the morning I requested to speak to the manager to inform her of the situation but she was unavailable at the time. Staff were not sympathetic or apologetic to the situation until I requested to speak to the manager it was then that one of the employees apologized and as compensation wiped the Internet room fee of 4.95 so I now find the matter settled with the apology. But it does bring me to all the hidden costs, on arrival we were not informed of the rewards program in which you are charged for Internet, movies, to use the roof top access, use of the gym, coffee in the room ect. This all came to 8 dollars per day and it is written on a card that is left if your room. How ever this is very confusing and unclear I then took is card down to the lobby and even the girl at the desk agreed that it was confusing we were not getting charged this and most of the amenities on the card are free of charge such as accessing the roof and using the gym but the rest of it you do get charged for. I find it very confusing and unclear and I think the hotel need to clarify all is with guests when they arrive. The reason I rated this so low is the fact that I had to plunge the toilet myself, I had to ask twice before someone could look at the toilet and then someone only came and took a two second look the next evening! Not impressed at all.

This seemed ok & we were told our room would be ready by 12.30pm,come back then. On return at 2.pm we were told to wait, our room was not ready. 2 hrs later, after watching people check in, walk in off the street & get rooms, several visits to reception to enquire on our room, falling asleep in the foyer we were finally 'allowed to enter\". Would it have been so difficult for this hotel to change our room & give us a room already prepared. This hotel was clearly not full. To see others walk in off the street & go straight to a room was not a good first impression. Unfortunately airlines do not cater their flights to hotel check in times. Maybe its time hotels showed a little understanding towards those on long distance flights? Afterall we pay for it! And we go away informing others on our travels & at home as to how we are treated. This reflects not only on the hotel but on the city itself. My partner & I both felt the customer service for the duration of our stay (4 nights) was not only poor but quite rude. Listening to the conversations whist we were waiting a pattern started to emerge. American travellers were spoken/treated to in a cheerful, polite & helpful manner. international - sullen, unhelpful & unfriendly. On the plus side: room was large & clean. Bed was very comfortable & linen spotless. There was a kitchenette, though this did not supply any utensils - can cook in the microwave but need to visit the supermarket across the road to purchase said. Bathroom was clean but shower/water pressure poor. The rooftop view is lovely & a nice place to coffee/wine & nibble if warm enough. Starbucks can be accessed from the hotel foyer which is convienent. The noise in this hotel is incredible. Our room was in front of the elevators. All night we could hear the lifts moving & the doors opening/closing as well as other guests talking/yelling in the hallways. The walls are paper thin, we were distrubed by the guests upstairs & next door thumping around, everytime they used the toilet we could actually hear & even somone snoring. Traffic noise, buses/trucks early in the morning was awful. This was our first trip to Seattle. If i returned I would definately stay closer to the city. It is just too far out. Most of the sights are in the city area. There is a monorail to the Spaceneedle which we used, it is a short walk to the hotel from there. Buses are available but it seemed that we spent all our time in the city & could have just had a day looking around the Queen Ann area. Pike place market, Space needle & walking the waterfront are all worth doing. We caught the bus to Museum of Aviation. Locals assisted us to find right buses & the drivers were friendly & helpful. Museum was a highlight, this is really worth a look. We also visited the Gold Rush Museum & Fire Museum. Both worth a look if you are wandering around the city with no plans. Lovely staff ready to answer any questions. The Underground Tour was a little lame but we did enjoy due to the guides involved. Hilarious banter. These guides certainly made up for the lack of \"views' with their ability to spin a tale & interact with the group.

For a real run, keep going along the running/bike trails and head up north to Discovery Park which was amazing with a 2.8 mile loop trail with smaller more difficult single track trails heading off down to the beaches.

While I was aware of the rather stiff parking charge in advance, I justified the high room price as being due to the property's location. At worst I figured that the money I saved not needing to rent a car for the two days of my stay would be a wash against the added cost.

The hotel is completely non-smoking, but smells as if it didn't use to be. It's not a quiet place, and you may be able to hear the baby crying in the next room (we did). The positives include very comfortable beds, flat-screen TVs, and excellent staff. They are top-notch, especially Guadalupe, who seemed to bend over backwards for every guest. Amanda was nice, but a \"loud talker\". I didn't see more than two people on duty at a time. They were busy, but appeared to be in control. There is underground parking for $15/day. A very large and well-equipped business center, plus two computers in the lobby for quick use. Starbucks is accessible through the lobby. A decent fitness room is on the bottom floor, along with a laundromat and snack room. The front door is secured at night, accessible only by key. The Med rents rooms by the night, week, or month.

There were some small cosmetic issues with the room, but nothing that compromised safety or comfort. Our only complaint was that our window didn't close properly. We weren't on a ground floor, so it didn't matter much to us. At least the thermostat worked, and the electric heat was a welcome change to hotels that blast noisy air on you off and on all night. Everyone was helpful, efficient, and friendly. The next day we walked downstairs to grab coffe, then to the Seattle Center to take the monorail to downtown. It was a bonus that parking at the hotel was only $15, so we were able to leave the car there. We chose to park on the street at night (free), right in front of the hotel.

Another bonus was the microwave, sink, and refrigerator which was a perfect mini-kitchen for us to store food after our Thanksgiving feast. We filled it up, even though it was spacious.

There are a row of restaurants near the hotel, namely a place called 5 Spot up the road. It is a HELL of a walk, so you may need to take the bus bc it is uphill. They serve breakfast and is very nice :) Seattle Space Needle is walking distance. CONS: Not very close to Downtown, you would have to take public transportation. BUT, they are very close to the bus stop and almost every bus goes downtown so thats a plus. Bus fare is $1.75 and you get like 4 hrs or so to transfer and things. Its VERY convenient! =D Most buses downtown are FREE as well so go crazy haha Hotel also has a small kitchenette.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and were pleased with the accommodations for the price we paid. My wife and I were only in town for about 30 hours to see a Seattle Seahawks football game and meet up with friends. We were primarily only looking for a place to rest at night. This hotel was ideal for such a stay. The Mediterranean is a little out of downtown, but you can take a bus for $1.75 and be in downtown in about 5 minutes. You can also walk to the Space Needle. The area seemed very safe with lots of restaurants. We arrived around 1:30 pm and the official check-in time is 4:00 pm. They were able to get us a room immediately, which was very gratifying after flying 3,000 miles across the country. The room was a little on the small side and it showed a little age. The carpets in the hallways definitely need to be replaced. The bathroom was of a decent size, clean, and had nice water pressure. There were plenty of towels. The amenities were of a good quality. The bed was a full-sized bed, but was big enough for the both of us and comfortable. The channel selection was only OK. Most other hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in had a larger selection. The room also came with a refrigerator, microwave, mini-kitchen, desk, and sofa chair. There was a complimentary continental breakfast in the morning, which we did take advantage of, and they also had a fitness center. I especially liked that the hotel provided us with two free bottles of water and microwave popcorn in the room. The staff of the hotel was very friendly too. After I went to retrieve my luggage from the concierge after the football game was over, I offered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Guadalupe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a tip, but she refused. That was nice customer service. The hotel also had a nice rooftop deck with plenty of chairs to relax in with an awesome view of the Seattle skyline. They also had two free internet stations and a Starbucks connected to the property. As for the negatives: Like other reviewers I agree that the window coverings were bizarre, giving you an option of total darkness or light with total transparency for others to see in the room. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was appropriate during the era of the Carter Presidency, not today. The rooms were on the small side and there could have been more channels to choose from.

It was the nicest hotel I've stayed at in any major city for even double that price. The room was spotless and the decor cheery and tasteful. Some folks might consider the room small but personally I dislike the yawning spaces in some hotels -- this felt like a well-appointed guest room in a private home. Beds were comfortable with silky smooth cotton sheets, vellux blankets and plump pillows. The little kichenette with microwave, fridge and sink would make it great for an extended stay and the desk was a good size with a comfortable chair. I liked the TV being atop a tall dresser -- made it easier to watch in bed. Though it was somewhat warm while I was there (low 80's during the day, 60's at night) I was happy to crank open the large windows that looked out on the interior terrace, sort of a large light shaft in the center of the building. That and the ceiling fan kept it comfortable and I much preferred it to the clammy, musty chill of the usual hotel AC units. I didn't mind at all not having an outside view because I could easily go up to the 7th floor roof deck and sit in the Adirondack chairs with a 360 degree panorama of Puget Sound, the mountains, the nearby Space Needle and all of the city center spread out beyong -- what a terrific view, day or night! Take your breakfast up there! The parking garage was very handy and reasonably priced considering the going rate at the city lots. Public transport was nearby and you could walk to some shopping and restaurants (I had dinner at an Italian bistro around the corner that was sublime). It was only a 5 minute drive to the city center and very easy access to the central parkway of Route 5. There is no kitchen in the hotel but the lobby is attached to a Starbucks and I was able to get a nice breakfast there (recommend the eggwhite, feta, spinach and sun-dried tomato wrap -- yummy!)

I was not aware that I would be required to pay for the privilege of checking in. I paid the parking ticket within 2 weeks, but then received a letter from the City of Seattle that I had not paid on time. I sent a copy of my canceled check and assumed the matter was closed. Now, 6 months later, I received notice that I not only owe the ticket, (paid) but late fees and collection costs for an additional $45.00.

We were in Seattle for a weekend event out by the airport. We stayed the first two nights at the airport Marriott which was excellent. But, for Sunday night, we decided we would try the Mediteranean so as to be downtown in the middle of everything. Considering the relative locations of the two and the fact that the Mediteranean was at least $40 (not including parking, isn't that nice of them) more a night we may as well have stayed at the Marriott. The room there was definitely a lot nicer as well as being a lot cheaper. The hotel itself definitely had a certain Hostel/Camp feel to it. The room is small and the bed is low and the tiny TV and stand alone VCR in the room were defintely the cherry on top. The staff is ok but largely ditzy and a little out of it. I kinda felt like I had wandered into a cool kids party back in high school. You know, where everyone is stoned and laughing at some in joke that you aren't a part of. The best thing to recommend this hotel is the location. It is right in the middle of everything and the neighborhood is very nice and has access to many of the great amenities. What would be really great is if they offered a bike rental serivice as that would get you anywhere in downtown. The hotel is ok, I would consider it to be a really basic, basic hotel with a good location. But extremely expensive for what you get. Overall it is clean and well maintained.

From a sink to wash dirty cups to a microwave to heat up milk and fridge, we were glad with the amenities. I remembered reading some reviews saying not to stay in the rooms next to the street, so I called in advance to reserve a room on a higher floor and away from the street level. That was helpful as we were on the fifth floor with a slight view of the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound. It was quiet and we were able to get a good night rest. The only thing that I wished the hotel provided were plates/bowls and utensils and of course dishwashing liquid for us to wash stuff (maybe a small packet of cleaning supplies?). The bathroom was alright though I wished the water power from the showerhead would be stronger. And also, it would really be nice if the quality of the toilet paper was better. But like many have commented, this is not a luxury hotel, but it was perfect for our weekend stay in Seattle. Two things that I really liked about the Inn is its proximity to Safeway (just opposite). It made it so easy for us to drop by the supermarket on the way back to the hotel to pick up milk, snacks, stuff for our son. Another plus is having Starbucks in the lobby. The smell of fresh coffee as you walk into the lobby is priceless. The first morning we were there, I woke up extra early, bought myself a caramel macchiato from Starbucks and went to the rooftop to catch the sunrise. It was perfect. Some good places for food around the inn include Phuket, a small Thai restaurant just across the street on Queen Anne Ave. Not a lot of choices but food is relatively tasty and reasonably priced. We also tried Roti, an Indian restaurant just a little further down Queen Anne Ave across the street and its amazing! One good tip for those coming from the airport would be to call the inn the day before and get their personal car service to pick you up. Its a $35 flat rate.

The hotel also had 2 computers set up with the internet, for guests to use w/o a reservation, and then they also had a business room with more computers and printers. The access to the internet was very helpful, when trying to find new things to do and to check email away from home. The hotel is centrally located. Although it is not in the middle of downtown, it is within easy walking distance to City Center where you can take the monorail that takes you downtown, as well as to the Sonics Stadium and the Space Needle. We stayed on the 6th floor and had a nice view of the lake, as well as the Space Needle (if we looked out towards the left). We took advantage of the outlook on the roof, on our first night (when it was dry) to look out at the beautiful city. As we all know, people that live in Seattle drink a lot of coffee, so there is a Starbucks on the lobby level of the hotel. We did not go to that Starbucks, but it was nice to know it was there. The only quirks that the hotel had was the parking fee and the bed. The hotel charges $12.00 a day for guests to park in the garage. Also, the beds were a bit too bouncy -everytime my husband would turn in his sleep, I'd bounce all over the place and I would wake up with an achey back.

Not luxury, but very simple and comfortable.

The lobby is warm and welcoming. The desk staff are some of the nicest I've ever encountered. They're naturally friendly and helpful without that trained-to-the-teeth faux friendliness you see at other hotels. My room on the 5th floor had a sweet little view of Elliott Bay and the rooftop deck has a stunning view. Right outside the hotel there are two grocery stores, a neighborhood movie theater and every kind of ethnic restaurant you could ever wish for. (Try Racha Thai and fondue dessert at the Melting Pot.) After work each day, I walked to the top of Queen Anne Hill and found a little park with a stunning view of Elliott Bay, the Space Needle, the city and Mt. Rainier.

There are some definite highlights to this hotel: 1/ the view is unparalleled to other hotels and really other locations in town -unless you find yourself on a loft deck in Queen Anne Hill, 2/ the staff is also pretty accomodating (e.g. Phil the night manager on call was more than accomodating and the cleaning/service people seemed more than friendly - or so it seemed). 3/ the mini fridges stocked with diet and regular Coke are a nice touch - even though its probably sponsored by Coke as some sort of in-room/in-kind gesture for the customers -whatever the case -its a really nice touch 4/ love that they have e-mail (high-speed and complimentary) on site. With positives, there are some definite negatives too- in my opinion: 1/ if you are looking for a bed that is not squishy, big in size or one with more than 2 pillows - this isn't your place (e.g. its definitely not the W with their \"heavenly\" beds, but at $120 a night its definitely not putting a dent in your pocket book either) I did ask for 4 pillows and was ultimately my request was accomodated (but only after a set of questions: 1/ how many people are in your room and 2/ why do you need 4 pillows). Hey, if you've seen the Travel Spies, at least I didn't ask for 20 plus pillows sent to my room and arranged on my bed in a triangle. I was less than impressed with the response to my request but ultimately satisfied with the outcome. 2/ there was a strong odor in our room - primarily coming from the floors --mix of cleaning stringent and bad smells 3/ carpet needs cleaning or refurbishing 4/ stay away from rooms on the street side - above the coffee shop or under the rooftop deck 5/ no air conditioning - this was a big surprise - but we definitely would have been okay with it had our room not been right over the street and the construction going on on the rooftop directly across from us - this isn't really the hotel fault (other than not having A/C as an added expense) 6/ if you plan on having someone at the front desk either hold your items -please beware - someone dropped something off for me and they gave it away to somone else --i wasn't very happy with their response -- something to the effect that we can't help that someone asked for the same item - next time please ask for their name - not that I have a unique name (i actually have a common one), but I don't think too many people just drop by for the same item within 2 hours.

As a side issue I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d also seriously recommend visitors buy the Seattle frommers guide for the walking tours of the city and surrounding neighbourhoods, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fantastically informative and fun\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and with a landmark like that space needle as a reference point you need not worry about getting lost :) Enjoy this beautiful city and hotel I wish to visit again very soon.", "Date": "April 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redwood City, CA.", "Title": "\u201cWe loved this hotel and its location--would stay again!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3091432", "Content": "Stayed just a couple nights this past weekend and we got a great deal on a hotel with a great location and room. It is located in lower Queen Anne which has several little shops and restaurants/bars/cinema in the area, or you can take a short walk uphill to Upper Queen Anne where you'll find the markets and more cute shops and restaurants. Also what is great is that you can walk from the hotel to the Seattle Center which has the Space Needle, The Monorail to get into town ($1.50 each way), The Experience Music Project ans Science Center, The Key Area (where the Seattle Sonics play basketball), and an amusement park. You could also walk to downtown Seattle or Belltown in 15-20 minutes. The hotel room is roomy enough with a kitchenette. Quiet also, free internet service, a small workout room, and a VCR in the room (with BlockBuster across the street). Also, Starbucks is located right off the lobby for those coffee fixes. We'd stay here again!", "Date": "January 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cexcellent place\u201d", "Author": "gabelou75", "ReviewID": "UR2836290", "Content": "a great hotel with nice room and very interresting location. free internet access in the lobby and you can use printer totally free. in fact the best hotel in the city , for us.", "Date": "November 20, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Mediterranean Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d258824-Reviews-Mediterranean_Inn-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$99 - $172*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">425 Queen Anne Avenue North</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "258824", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fa/a6/faa6eab827152c820b5dacd3367199235large.jpg"}}
