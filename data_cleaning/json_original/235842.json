I arrived having broken my foot in Florence 3 days earlier, in a cast and on crutches! From the outset the hotel staff went out of their way to help us - I really cannot speak highly enough of how wonderful they all were. I was very grateful. Now the hotel... It was relatively easy to find being an easy 5-10 minute walk from San Zecharia vaporetto stop. There was just one small bridge to cross. The rooms we had were very clean, comfortable and well appointed. (We appreciated having tea making facilities). Bathrooms were modern and fresh. (We were moved to a room with disabled bathroom after first night) The hotel is located in relatively quiet area bordering San Marco and Castello. While away from the busy tourist areas they were still in easy reach(even for me!) and there are good and well priced restaurants close by. A laundrette is located just a few stores to the right too! We enjoyed the breakfast which included eggs in addition to the usual offerings. Pastries and rolls were often still warm if you took the early breakfast option. Having stayed near Rialto on our last visit, we enjoyed the quieter ambience of the area. Service and price beat views hands down in our view.

The hotel is centrally located, making it within easy walking distance of most places in Venice. When you first arrive in Venice either by public transit boat, shuttle boat or taxi boat, you'll need to get off at the S. Zaccaria landing, which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel provides easy walking directions from this dock on their site. The hotel itself is very clean, with a friendly staff. They even let us use the dining area when it was closed to eat lunch we brought back to the hotel. In the mornings, a free full breakfast is provided.

Premises are well-equipped; bathroom was perfect, with a hair dryer and a shower niche which is generally better than a separate cabin. The room was arranged in the traditional, ancient style with a comfy bed; the only disturbance was some noisy parties during the first night.

The breakfast room is bright and cheerful, with Venetian glass light fixtures and Burano lace tablecloths, and displays of Venetian glass.

He gave us all sorts of info about activities and transportation options, as well as detailed info about the hotel itself such as breafast times.

The room was very adaquate with a nice bathroom, TV and air conditioning. It even had a hidden safe in the closet and a desk for writing post cards and relaxing. The only complaint is that the hotel has very thin walls - you can hear everything that is going on in the hallway and adjacent rooms.

When we arrived on Friday morning, we were given choice of 3 rooms, and got to see each of the three to pick the one we liked most. We selected one on the top floor because it had a nice balcony from which to soak up the atmosphere (note that the balcony did not really have a view but was Italianesque and nice to enjoy a drink on after a day exploring Venice). One point to make here is that there is no elevator, so if stairs wear you out, select a lower floor. However, the staff carried our luggage up and down the stairs when we arrived and departed. 2] Nice breakfast each morning, with broad selection of items. 3] Really convenient location; only about a 5 minute walk to San Marco Piazza, and about a 10 minute walk to Rialto Bridge. Several nice restaurants nearby. 4] Very good value for Venice in what was still the shoulder of the high season. Negatives: 1] No real drawbacks but I will identify a couple items to keep in mind as you consider the best place for you to book your stay. 2] First, this is not a 'luxury' hotel so if you want to be pampered and expect fancy, this is not your place. It is a comfortable room, but not high end. This should go without saying based on the price, but want to emphasize. 3] If you book through a 3rd party (e.g. hotels.com), you will not have choice of room and may be placed in 'sister' hotel, which happened to the couple checking in before us. They were not happy about it and got pretty loud. Best to book direct if you want to know you will be at this hotel property.

The location of Al Piave really is fantastic! It is great for walking everywhere but also a short walk from one of the many canals for water taxis (should you require one). It certainly is a bonus when you are walking round in 40 degrees of heat and have the option to nip back to the hotel for a quick shower/change of clothes or a little midday siesta.

Overall, my experience has been pleasant. The bed was quite spacious, the room nicely appointed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a slight whiff of bygone times. The bathroom also left me satisfied. That being said, certain things need improvement. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak for the other rooms at the hotel, but certain things in mine could use a little upgrading. For instance, the night table lamps \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though pretty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work properly; one of then did not turn on at all, the other did, but you had to wait about thirty seconds while abstaining from any sharp movements. I rarely do any bedtime reading while on vacation, but for some it may be an issue. Another thing was temperature control. The air condition worked (the city was under a heat wave for a few days), but the temperature was set on 16C (if memory serves me right), and could not be regulated, so it was too cold at night. The room safe was also a bit tricky to use, involving both a key and a little finger-twisting; in fact, it was the only non-electronic safe that I came across having stayed at five different hotels during my trip. Overall, nothing that really detracted from my experience at the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was quite agreeable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I feel these things do need to be mentioned nonetheless. Front desk service was impeccable; the staff in general were delightfully helpful and friendly. The breakfast was fairly good. The location is excellent; about 7-10 minutes of brisk walking from the main action of Piazza San Marco. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re arriving with heavy luggage and disembarking at San Zaccaria vaporetto stop (close to Piazza San Marco), add another 5-7 minutes.

As a matter of fact we tried our best Italian on them when ever we had the chance and I think they appreciated it. As when I asked for a place to go and watch the Italy game during the Euro Cup I was given direction to a local \"festa\" (a street party, in this case for a saint, which one I can't remember). At this festa we were able to eat a huge plate of gnocchi with mushrooms, and a heaping plate of fried seafood, all for 7 euros each!!!! And this was down home Nonna-certified cooking. The drinks were cheap too - 2 euros/beer and 2 euros for a glass of home made wine... sweet! Oh yeah, and we got to watch the whole game with the locals on a giant screen in the town square, and then participate in their version of American (Italinan) Idol. Way too much fun!!!

Can't speak for the other rooms, but the 4-person suite is wonderful. It is across the street (really about 10 steps) from the main reception. The rooms are huge, just look at my pics. There was one entrance hall with two rooms and a huge bathroom. One room was bigger than the other - enough where the four of us would spend some time like a common room. The larger room had a fold out couch, and the smaller had an additional single bed. I imagine this would be perfect for families with three or four children. The room on the main street had thick windows that blocked street noise. The other room had windows over someone's private garden, and never heard a thing from them. We slept with the air conditioning on and it was completely quiet. Not quite sure why people have complained about mosquitoes...the air conditioning is very cold and our windows were always shut - didn't see a single mosquito. The decor is simply what you would find in any Italian apartment. High ceilings, minimal art, and wooden furniture - the room was lovely. It felt as if we were staying in someone's apartment, rather than a hotel. We had no kitchen, but did have a mini fridge. Rooms were very clean and the bedding was comfortable and soft. We felt very at home here, and always looked forward to ending the night with a bottle of wine in our \"apartment.\" Breakfast is good. Scrambled eggs, cereal, fruit, yogurt, selection of meats and cheeses, and bread. The coffee with frothed milk is pure heaven!!! Staff was very helpful in arranging our reservation and with directions. I love the night time staff. The women during the daytime seem a bit frosty, but were helpful nevertheless. Directions on website for the water taxi Alilaguna are correct. I think people have just not realized that San Zaccaria stop has several piers that stetch along the waterway. If you walk off the end of the pier, your pier might not be directly in front of Calle de Rasse. Calle de Rasse is marked very clearly...don't go down a street unless you see the large Calle de Rasse sign. This was overall a fabulous stay. We paid 265Euro/night between two couples.

The hotel encompasses two adjacent buildings and there is a small patio area with tables between the buildings which is a nice place to relax for a few minutes. We were able to walk everywhere and enjoyed the area around the hotel. On the same side of the street and just next door to the hotel is a nice restaurant - Tratorria Agli Artista - that we enjoyed. There are several small markets in the area that sell reasonable (for Venice - which is VERY expensive) water, sodas and wine. The room has a mini-refrigerator so you can stock it with your own provisions. The included breakfast was quite good - included cereal, eggs, breads, pastries, yogurt, cheese, etc. Tip - the hotel's website provides directions to the hotel from the waterbus that are a bit misleading.

On our first visit in 1999 we stayed at the Savoia & Jolanda right on the Grand Canal. Our room at the Savoia & Jolanda (as I recall) were somewhat small but very elegantly decorated with a rather small bathroom. The main attraction for my wife and I was the location of the Savoia and Jolanda on the Grand Canal. Things are a lot different seven years later, Riva degli Schiavoni would become almost deserted and San Marco had very few people milling about the square in the evening. especially after the day tripper tourist would head back to the mainland. San Marco and Riva degli Schiavoni now remain crowded with tourist until late at night. During the day, Riva degli Schianvoni becomes so crowded it's almost impossible to walk thru the sea of humanity flooding the streets and San Marco. The Hotel Al Piave is located 5 minutes walk from San Marco and the Grand Canal, which I found to be a relief from the oppressive crowds on Riva degli Schiavoni. The only negative, that comes to mind is the hotel's directions. Once we found the hotel, the yound lady working the front desk greeted me with excellent English and a pleasant manner. Our room really was actually a mini-apartment located in a seprate building on the second floor (sorry no elevator). The room itself was actually two seperate bedrooms with a shared bath. The rooms were huge and had seperate A/C units that we could control. The furnishing and overall cleanliness were superior. The beds were comfortable and housekeeping cleaned the room without any issues. I dealt with three seperate desk clerks while staying here, one was the wife of the Owner (sorry I didn't get her name), all were pleasant and willing to spend time answering any questions I had. I was offered a discount for cash, my total bill for two nights came to 510.00 euro, which included breakfeast.

With 30+ years of travel under my belt, I have learned that luxury is not necessarily an \"adequate\" room at the Hotel Danieli for a fortune, but may be an affordable family run hotel, centrally located in a city which is very expensive. As mentioned, the hotel is perfectly located. It's a few minutes walk from San Marco, about an 8 minute walk from the Rialto, and just a block from Campo Santa Maria Formosa. The Al Piave is in a neighborhood with a small grocery (water, wine, orange juice, soda, salami, cheese, bread, etc.), a green-grocer a few doors away (lettuce, tomatoes, pears, apples, etc.) and two pastry shops. As for the hotel. We (adult daughter - 25 years old and I) had a \"mini-suite\" in the annex just down the street from the main hotel. It had a tiny sitting room with TV, mini-bar, table and two chairs. The bathroom was completely updated --- tiled, adequately lighted, small \"server\" for make-up, etc., shower with ample hot water, and towel warmer. The bedroom (while again small --- it's Venice) was terrific. We had a king-sized bed (firm, and better than most I've had in far more expensive hotels). There were also individual reading lamps (and little night-lights). Linens were clean and crisp. Towels were plentiful. Views from both the bedroom (onto a little square with a well-head) and from the \"sitting area\" (onto another little square) were just wonderful. The family running the hotel obviously takes pride in their establishment. Their standards are high. Everything ran smoothly and the room was immaculate. Their cleaning staff is truly amazing. I cannot say enough about how our rooms were maintained. Ilaria and her family (we also had extensive conversations with her mother) were extremely helpful in all respects. They provided information about Venice, booked concert tickets, made restaurant suggestions and reservations, allowed free internet service (so we could check our mail), arranged transportion to the airport, and generally helped us with all issues in Venice. Venice can be a very expensive city. I cannot imagine a better value and experience than this hotel. I have never written a review before, but I've been impressed with Trip Adivsor.

It looked like a small, friendly hotel and an outstanding value: we called to check on rates and found that the hotel gives a discount for cash and booked us over the phone, confirming by e-mail. On arrival, we took the water bus from the airport to St Marks square, then walked to the hotel. You need a map, even if you know Venice: it's a twisty walk to the hotel, but suitcase-friendly (no stairs to navigate) and about a ten minute stroll. The hotel is located along a narrow street (aren't they all), full of charm, in a neighborhood street lined with shops, stores, restaurants, laundromat a block away. It felt more like a residential area than a tourist shopping one, but very safe and comfortable. Watch for the labeled hotel lantern over the street or you might miss the door. The lobby is warm and wood, the greeting warm and friendly. They checked us in quickly and efficiently, showed us across a courtyard to our room (up a flight of stairs), and left us to settle in helpfully without being obtrusive. The room was very good: a large bed in the main room (actually two twins pushed together and covered with a sheet), and a smaller single in a curtained alcove. Closet and drawers were abundant, and the heating worked well. The tiled bathroom was about twice the size of a standard hotel one: stall shower, bidet, nice sink, good lighting, no tub. The street noise is present, but not unreasonable: it's a few blocks off the main tourist artery and foot traffic thins out considerably after dark. The hotel feels like a small B&B: the staff is very personable and helpful: they sold us tickets for the waterbus at standard rate (putting the charge on our bill when requested), gave helpful recommendations to nearby restaurants, and were very considerate about asking if we minded their friendly dog in the lobby (we didn't: it's a sweetie). The small restaurant off the lobby serves a good breakfast in the morning: there is a buffet with a good assortment of breads, fruits, cheeses, and cereals. The proprietor asked if we'd like eggs, and prepared lattes (and a refill!) to accompany the meal. The breakfast was included in the room rate, and there was no pressure to purchase any add-ons.

It did not keep the room cool enough.", "Date": "June 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3449569", "Content": "My fiance, my mother, and I stayed at the Al Piave in early May based on the excellent reviews Al Piave received on Tripadvisor and we were pleased with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff as well as the convenient location of the hotel. We had reserved a suite for three people, with two rooms sharing a bathroom. The suite (Rooms 212-213) was small (particularly the room with the single bed) but very clean with a beautiful marbled floor and a nice, deep sink in the bathroom (though the shower was smaller than we would have liked). Unfortunately, we encountered numerous problems with this suite, including faulty water temperature and a stopped up drain in the shower. When we reported these problems, the proprietess, Millella and her daughter, Ilalia immediately took action and tried to fix the defects. Not only did Millella and Ilalia act quickly, they also remembered to check with us to find out whether or not the issues had been resolved. Despite their best efforts, the problems persisted for a couple more days due to a malfunctioning boiler. When we expressed concern about the situation and asked if there was another room available, Ilalia immediately moved us to a family suite (112-114) in a building diagonally across the alley from the main hotel that wasn't affected by the boiler problem, and the proprietor, Paolo, took time out of his busy schedule to transport our luggages to the family suite. This family suite was very nice, with two large rooms, a spacious bathroom, and it was mosquito-free! We were very pleased with this change and grateful for Millella, Paolo and Ilalia's attentiveness and assistance. Millella, Paolo, and Ilalia are friendly and they genuinely care about the welfare of their guest, even going as far as giving us a Alilaguna (boats that run between the airport and Venice) ticket that they had not used for free. Millella and Ilalia also provided numerous recommendations on where to eat, visit, and shop, which proved to be quite helpful. Though the breakfast wasn't sumptuous, it offered delicious croissants and different tasty cured meats. The best part about breakfast was the coffee/tea/hot chocolate that were made fresh for each person and we felt quite pampered to have freshly brewed coffee in nicely polished coffee pots every morning. Despite the problems we encountered, we are very pleased with the way Al Piave's staff handled the difficulties. Al Piave's convenient location is also a huge plus. Not only is it close to San Marco's Square and the Rialto Bridge, there are other conveniences nearby, such as ATM machines, a laundromat, a fairly good restaurant right next door, and various markets where the locals shop. We were able to purchase water and snacks at decent prices to carry around with us. We hope to return in February for Carnivale and if so, we will definitely stay at Al Piave again.", "Date": "May 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPleaseant Suprise\u201d", "Author": "kmason5727", "ReviewID": "UR3438953", "Content": "Sorry for the late review, but this has been my first chance to advise.

Instead we were greated by 2 friendly persons who turned out to be the owners. Having booked a double room, we were offered a choice between this or our own studio apartment. We chose the appartment, although it was very compact, it was clean, tidy, and very quiet. In short it was charming. The breakfast was great, nothing over the top but with a choice of cereal crossaints, meats,cheese, juice and coffee what more would you want. The location is superb a couple minutes from St Marks Square and Rialto bridge. One note of warning however it can be tricky to find if you go off your usual route, if you get lost as we did don't try and map read back, its much easier to head back to San Marco Vaparetto stop and follow the straight route as per the card supplied when you check in.

What a jewel this turned out to be. Ideally situated for all Venice's main sights. Easy to find despite comments else where.

The rooms are fine for the English, perhaps on the small side for our American cousins (but everything has to be big for them, doesn't it?) A very good continental breakfast and leisurely too...up to 10.00am There are plenty of excellent bars and restuarants in the area from moderate to the expensive. We liked Do Mori for a Tapas style stand up lunch. The Alle Madonna is an excellent Fish restaurant. Both these are just over the Rialto bridge.

My wife and I did a whirlwind last minute trip to Italy on Feb 19-25th 2005. First of all, everything you read about regarding the small size of the rooms and even smaller size of the room showers is absolutely correct. Hotel Al Piave is 5 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge and 5 minutes in a different direction to Piazza San Marco. We were very pleased with the location We took the Alilaguna from the airport to the hotel and got off at the San Marco stop, which is the last stop on the route. The Alilaguna is 10 euros per person and is very easy to use. The airport Alilaguna booth accepts credit cards but the booths in the the city do not. You can buy your roundtrip ticket at the airport, so if you want to save your euros, just buy all you Alilaguna tickets at the airport with your credit card. It takes almost exactly one hour from the airport to the San Marco stop. It leaves every 30 minutes. The first day we just walked around and got the feel for the place. The second day, we bought a one day water bus pass. It was 10.50 euros and well worth the money. Most food places will not accept credit card unless you spend a certain minimum. We mostly ate pizza and pasta. Pizza is about 5-7 euros and pasta is the same. Food is excellent. The Hotel Piave staff is awesome and most helpful. The room is nicely decorated. The only English channels on tv is CNN and BBC. My only comment to the hotel would be to add some more english speaking channels. It would have been very welcome while I was still adjusting to the time change at night. Breakfast is provided and is a nice start to the day. Same food everyday, but it tasted just fine. Overall, I would definitely return to the Hotel Al Piave. By the way, if you pay cash instead of credit card, they will reduce your hotel rate. We paid 10 euros less per night by paying in cash. We went to Rome and paid a good amount more for the hotels over there. It was nowhere near as nice as this hotel. Also, I was very pleased with how clean they kept the rooms.

It's also fairly convenient for getting to the airport (if you have a decent map!) - quite close to the Zaccharia vaporetto stop, where you can get an Alilaguna boat to the airport for only 10 euros. If you have trouble with stairs, do ask about the studio - it's on the ground floor, an unusual bonus in Venice. You simply walk a block to the main hotel for breakfast, which is unusually good and includes fabulous hot chocolate.

It wasn't cramped, it was really clean and had a downstairs shower room and upstairs kitchen/living area with separate double bedroom. Moreover, it was very reasonably priced (just 145 euros a night)...making it an excellent, central, base for exploring the city. The other review moans about the steps.
