Right in front of the facilities is the B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L playa montones. There is nothing more refreshing than opening the balcony doors to this magnificent view (and sound) of the oceans. Our room was neat clean, the beds and pillows super comfortable, and the room amenities were of great quality. DO NOT HESITATE TO BOOK THIS HOTEL.

So let me start with the beach. You go there for the beach because the cabanas are essentially on the beach with a boardwalk and some palm trees between. (In fact, one morning I was up early and a man climbing a palm to hack down coconuts a few feet from the porch was, too.) The beach is shaped like a rounded W with you standing at the bottom. On the left you have a long sweeping arc of gorgeous, rolling surf. White crests, huge sand drag, delightful for lying on your back and letting the waves take you wherever; terrific for body surfing, too. In low tide you can swim in the waves and feel like a fish in a sand bowl, so steep is the ledge formed by the crashing waves. On the right of the W you have \"la posita,\" an amazingly clear stretch of water barely a leg deep at its deepest spot and always calm because of the reef protecting it from the larger ocean. We have a toddler and she was in it 4 times a day, perfectly safe, along with all the others of every age who love lounging around in the water without the athleticism waves require. Best of all, between the reef and the flat, lake-like part is an underwater circular ledge that creates a little lagoon easily navigable for bigger kids and great for snorkeling. If this beach (Montones) sounds good for you, you will enjoy these accommodations because there you are-- no packing or hauling needed. We swam before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch, you get the idea. Also on site are a modest but refreshing pool, a small basketball court, some swings... we never get to using them, but others might find them fun. Now. The cabins I recommend for their porches. Ask for a hammock when you check in. They hang it up for you, and suddenly the non-watery part of your vacation is all set, too. Our 2-month-old could nap in it, our big kids shared it with raucous swinging, I read a whole book there while happily listening to the surf. The porch also comes with an outdoor table and chairs, so you can have all of your meals out there in the shade. We always rent one of the 2BR cabanas with a kitchen, getting groceries at the ECONO market in downtown Isabela and cooking for ourselves all week to save money. The oven is small, but there are four burners on the gas stove top and each unit has a grill outside. You might go to Olas y Arena, the outdoor restaurant nestled between the cabanas with equally spectacular views, for a meal or two, but it's not cheap and only some things on the menu are truly tasty. When you get groceries, pick up dish soap and a sponge. Pack a drying towel. Life will be so much better. And hang or refrigerate your food as though bears are coming. The bugs can be like bears if you give them something to get excited about. The bedrooms are set up well but they're no place to hang out, mostly because housekeeping barely visits and beach places get dirty fast. Same goes for the bathroom, which is fine at first but then icky within hours of arriving and then you're stuck with it. Wear flipflops inside. Bring your own facecloth. Use the mop and pail they leave for you. If you're particular about clean linen and are staying more than two nights, it wouldn't hurt to bring a spare set of sheets. Downtown Isabela is a poor, run-down place. We have family in town so it isn't so bad. But it's certainly no destination for tourists except for groceries. If you're looking for activities, go to the caves or the observatory, go horseback riding a few miles down the coast, or learn to snorkel. And if you want luxury just for a meal, skip this parador's restaurant and drive up the coast 5 minutes to Villa Montana's restaurant, Eclipse. It is spectacularly aesthetically pleasing and worth every penny just to sit in it, never mind eat in it. We have been to these little cabins year after year at different times, and sometimes it's serene and other times it's throbbing with music, so you have to roll with it. Depends on who's there with you because the beach itself is public. Also there's a PA system that the housekeeping uses to communicate and it's rare but a bloody nuisance when they use it. So there's the nitty gritty.

It was decorated very cute, and very clean. The only thing I could find wrong with the villa was the bathroom was really small, but we didn't spend much time in the bathroom anyway, lol. Villa 18 had 2 bedrooms, small living room and eat inkitchen. Two suggestions I would make is 1. bring an extension cord, because there aren't many electric outlets 2. If you plan on cooking, ask for kitchenwares when you make your reservation. They charge $20 a day to rent a container full of kitchenware, pots, pans, coffeemaker, plates, forks, etc. The grounds were also clean and neat. They even raked around the spots that had no grass, etc. It reminded me of zen gardens :) You can tell that they are constainly upkeeping the place. While we were having a late lunch at the restaurant, an artist was putting little touchs on some murals. The staff was all friendly; from the desk clerk, to the security guards, housekeeping and waitress. I just can't say enough good things about this place! I've stayed at more expensive, \"exclusive\" places in Puerto Rico these last few years (Interconntential, El Convento, Bahia Salinas, to name a few); but I truly believe this place gave me the biggest \"bang\" for my money!

Not only did they offer me what I thougth I was not going to get (being high season) they offer me a great rate without too much effort on my part. It was around 1:30pm and the clerk said that althoug the check in time was not until 5pm we could go right ahead and check in at that time. I was given a great 2nd floor unit right in front of the ocean. It was as clean as you can expect a beach front hotel to be. It was very large and it came with a kitchen. We droped our bags, got dressed for the beach and headed over for the sand. As we walked toward the beach I asked an attendant if they had beach chairs, and we got 2.

We picked this place because the pictures online looked beautiful. Let me tell you - they had a great photographer ! We were there for my sisters wedding. The rooms were terriable ! When we checked in after a late night of travel we were very disappointed. The room was very small with 2 standard beds that they tried to pass off as queen beds. When making the reservation I had asked for a pull out because we were sharing the room - three people. Of course there was no pull out when we got there and they acted like I was crazy. I threw a complete hissy fit on the people there. I was charged almost 200.00 a night for a complete crap hole. The curtains in the bedroom had mold on them, the room smelled musty, and it was dirty. We ended up changing rooms to a \"2 bedroom cabin\". It was not ocean front like we had reserved. Because it was really late and I was tired of arguing we stayed one night in this room and then in the morning changed rooms again. This place had windows that would not close, the bathroom widow had no screen in it to keep the bugs out, and there was a huge human hair ball hanging from the window in the shower. It was dirty ! The 3rd room we stayed in was a little better, most of the windows closed but it was still dirty. There were ants coming out of the molding around the sink and counter also. The only way to stop them was to shove bleach wipes in the cracks around the whole counter. As far as a \"kitchen - ha - There was a stove that looked like it was from the 60\"s. No microwave and the refrigerator barely kept things cold. My whole family got the shaft on their rooms. I did not go barefoot in any of the rooms. I had to wear my flip flops in the shower ! There was no hot water in any of the sinks or shower in any room. Not even in the rest room in the restraunt. My sister had already made the wedding plans here so I had to settle and stay. If I was alone, I would have left on day one. The wedding planner was ok - but let me tell you they try to charge you for every little thing...if you don't watch they switch and change things at last minute and hope you don't notice. I think the planner could have been more helpful. The wedding itself turned out beautiful. The beach was just ok - it was crushed shells to the left and sand to the right. We walked to the lava rocks and it was rough on the course sand. It was really beautiful. On our way back we found small 1\" ziplock baggies and a couple of used syringes on the beach ! I was terrified we would get a needle stick. I also want to say if you are an animal lover this place will break your heart. There are starving cats and dogs all over the grounds. It is heart breaking - it really upset me. I made sure I fed any scraps I had to the dogs. The dogs were hurt ,diseased, and dirty. The cats had bad eyes and were really dirty too. I wanted to cry everytime I saw one. I would have liked to help them all. I did see a stray cat licking out of the \"creamer\" on one of the tables in the restraunt. The waitress shooed it away and left the creamer ! It was drinking it and she left it !! She was one of the really rude waitresses at the resort dining area. The dining was an not exactly the greatest either. The food was good but the service was terriable. It took 2-3 hours to get a meal and there were hardly any people in the place. I don't like to spend that much time eating when I am on vaction. This was the absolute worst place to stay. I think they have one or two good rooms that they used for the photo shoot and the rest are crap! I guess we were not lucky enought to get the nice rooms! I would never stay here again.

I was right about the room, but the resort was far from world class. This was our fourth trip to Puerto Rico and the first time staying in Isabela. I would not recommend Isabela or Mar Hau. The customer service was terrible. The bar keepers and waiters/ waitresses were awful. The concierge was rude every time we called; we needed directions and they kept putting us on 15 minute hold times. Once we got there they were not any better.

The pool bar / grill was closed. The shack to rent beach chairs/ towels/ umbrellas was closed. We were able to get some beach chairs after a long ordeal with the front desk, maids and groundskeepers. The restaurant, which was supposed to be great, was not so. We had expected to eat most of our meals there, but after getting bad drinks at the bar and a waitress who was downright rude, we never went back.

It's not mandatory to stay here in order to have the reception there, but it turned out to be extremely convenient. Definitely the best aspect of this hotel is the location. Just about every villa is literally steps to the beach (but be warned that some are not - be sure to ask). If you were to go out on your deck and throw a ball you could probably hit the water. The beach is extremely quiet during the week, and you feel like you've got your own private beach. A lot of villas have kitchens so you can easily run up to your room to get snacks or a refill on your drink. And for the really prepared they have grills (provide your own charcoal). Do yourself a big favor and make a run to the WalMart and supermarket when you arrive to stock up on necessities (out on RT 2, about 15 minutes away). With the exception of the restaurant there is nothing else open or nearby during the week. The snack bar/gameroom did open but not until the weekend. Other restaurants are a short drive away, but probably not within walking distance. The restaurant onsite, Olas y Arenas, is truly a hidden gem. The owner Zelma is a transplanted NYC gourmet chef who creates some of the most delicious dishes I have ever had. We had our wedding reception at her restaurant and to say it was phenomenal would be an understatement. The food was fantastic and her staff went out of their way to make sure we all had a good time. By the end of the night everybody was dancing. Now for some warnings. For starts, the experience with the front desk was unpredictable. Sometimes you will get a very friendly and helpful person, and sometimes you will get the complete opposite. Luckily my wife speaks fluent Spanish which helped a lot. It's also important to note that you have to pay extra for daily maid service, which is really a must. They also provide very limited cleaning supplies for the kitchen (no sponge, paper towels, etc) so you might want to throw some of this into your luggage. As mentioned above, there's not much around besides the beach and the restaurant. Unless you intend to eat at the restaurant for every meal, I'd highly advise getting a rental car. I suppose it is possible to walk to the restaurants near Jobos beach, but it's not a short stroll (btw - the little yellow shack with the white bars on it has some of the best mahi-mahi pinchos you will ever have). Also as mentioned it would be a good idea to make a trip to WalMart or one of the supermarkets to stock up on supplies.

Spoke with another couple who had had a similar experience. We refused that room and got another with same window condition (looked like they hadn't been washed in the 3 years we weren't there). The draperies hadn't been opened in ages and were very dirty. But it did have a balcony view of beach, and a stove & frig. We left to visit Rincon for 2 nights and called the del Mar Hau to try to get out of the rest of our reservation, but they refused. The \"manager\" asked what was wrong, so I told him about the rugs, windows, draperies filth. And, they finally gave a room like we were used to, which now goes for $150. In other words they tried.... I think they washed the windows and the curtains didn't smell that bad; tile floors, much easier to keep clean. French doors open out to beach, nice, yes, that's why we came back 4 times. The beach has good snorkling and swimming. Lots of surfers stay in the cottages and split the high cost. So, the \"owners/managers\" are relying on their incredibly wonderful location and beach to charge their high fees. While, quality suffers. We were there 4 years ago when they bought and were placing the NEW beds. We saw them do it. However, the beds did get pretty worn and uncomfortable in 5 years of frequent use. Also, they don't use mattress pads which help hold the sheets on and can be washed,,,,, so you hope that the sheets fit well enough so you don't end up sleeping directly on the mattress like I did the first night ,,,, not nice. And the restaurant...... whoa, gemme a break. It is common knowledge that the restaurant is no good. Eh food, and really bad service, as witnessed by very few people eating there. One example: fresh PRican bread is baked fresh and delivered everyday, almost everywhere (even the funky local cigar store/mini market). We tried the restaurant once more.... asked for some bread & butter to tide us over and received lousy whole wheat sandwich bread sliced in half with some weird roasted unfresh roasted garlic. Eck, we almost went back to our room to get our fresh bread. All in all, it is really a shame.

We started planning April of 05. When we contacted the hotel and informed them that we were having a family reunion (with at least 7 - 10 families in attendance) we requested a special rate and the answer was a resounding NO. That should have stopped us right there but we decided that because of the location and the beauty of the surroundings it would be worth whatever the cost. We rented 9 homes in total (which by the way since we had booked so early we requested that we have as many of the houses one next to the other and they were not able to comply), There were over 40 family members and because we were given such a small time frame to book, several members could not make it . So, those members booked in area hotels and figured we could just go in and spend our time with our families even though we would have the inconvenience of having to travel back out again late in the evening. To our surprise, the first family that arrived wednesday night was told at the gate that they were not allowed to go in unless they were actually staying there. That our only solution was to call our family out to the parking lot to say hello. Had we even known that this was to happen, we would have NEVER booked with them since what good is a family reunion if the rest of the family cannot be with you. The next solution that they gave us was for our family members to pay $25.00 per day EACH person that wanted to come in for the day! Our reunion was from Wednesday thru Sunday!! After much discussion they were then \"KIND\" enough?! to lower the price to $10.00 per day. Now for those of us who did stay this is what follows: The houses were ok right in front of a beautiful beach. Our problems were; old kitchen equipment, toilets would back up, there were no fresh towels everyday but every 2-3 days, if you needed a clean towel and it was not your day to receive one, you had to pay $0.45 per additional towel. At the last minute we had 1 guest that could not get a room there and since she was travelling alone we thought it best that she bunk with one of us. We did not mind having to pay for her but it was ridiculous that what served as her bed was a twin size matter on the floor costing $45.00 per day... This was a simple mattress!!!! I could go on, but I want to leave the rest for my family to write about, which I am sure they will. It does need to be said that the location was breathtaking, the beaches were both adult and children friendly. As a person whom has been on several trips (as far a Brazil), for once I have been disappointed and in my own backyard. And believe me when I say that Puerto Rico is a truly extraordinary Island with the beaches, hotels and especially the warmth that our people can provided with their open arms and doors at all times.

We live in New Jersey and stayed at the Villas 5/2 - 5/6, along with 35 wedding guests that flew in from Florida, Atlanta, New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia whom also stayed at Parador villas Del Mar Hau. NOTE: The Villas and the Restaurant are separate owned and each has their own management. This was a GREAT advantage. Olas y Arena Restaurant - Their service is outstanding! Our weekend wedding vacation would not have been as wonderful and memorable had it not been for their service during breakfast, lunch, dinner, rehearsal dinner/BBQ and reception. The presentation of the food was phenomenal and the taste was delicious. Luis & Zelma are a great team! All of my guests absolutely LOVED them and their staff. From the moment that we arrived, both Luis & Zelma wanted to meet & greet us. If either one of them saw us, they acknowledge us and made us feel appreciated and welcomed at ALL times. Their main concern was that \"La Novia\" (the bride) was always HAPPY even if it didn't have anything to do with the Restaurant. Yes, they may be short staffed but Luis wears ALL HATS and exceeds his service as a waiter, entertainer, griller, labor guy, bar tender... I even saw him make many trips to the beach to bring my guest MOJITOS!! I look forward to the Inauguration -- Count on our support! Villas - Are in deed very nice, comfortable and a relaxing place facility. During our stay I noticed renovations being done to some of the Villas which are GREAT! However, they have a pretty long way to go in terms of friendly service and customer appreciation. I began planning my wedding in 5/2006 when I purposely visited the Island to select the venue for my wedding. During this trip I fell in love with the simplicity and secluded area of this location. I was looking for a beach to have my wedding, location for my ceremony and a place to stay for me and my out of town guests. Parador Villas del Mar had it all and I contracted the space for all of the above. Unfortunately, the Villas staff changed at least 3x's and my contract became a big JOKE. I had many unreturned phone calls, left numerous messages for the 1 person assigned to my group block. On numerous occasions I called and was left on hold for a ridiculous long time, sometimes I would hang up and dial again just to get someone live on the phone. Many times I would be told that the person I needed to speak with was either on vacation, gone for the day, out sick and NOBODY else could assist me because only that particular individual I was working with could assist me. As the bride I would have appreciated some \"TLC\" (Tender, Loving, Care) from the Villa management. Perhaps, a \"THANK YOU\" for bringing them such a large group, maybe a complimentary stay (1 night at least), or even some VIP treatment, a \"WELCOME\" bottle of wine, or maybe a simple floral arrangement.... something just to say thank you. I must acknowledge that in my group I had a total of 5 - pre-teens including my son who is 12. they had a wonderful time in the pool, game room, riding horses, basketball courts and the fact that these city kids had the freedom to roam around this guarded facility was a PLUS, PLUS. The fact that I am an event planner in the trade show industry makes my expectations very high. However, customer service is a MUST no matter how big or small your facility is.

It's ok, I won't judging you. However, for anyone looking to experience paradise on an under-developed carribean island, look no farther. I am a native Floridian who recently had the opportunity to visit the island with my girlfriend and her family (all native Puerto Ricans). They booked the place and said it was fabulous, having stayed at Villas Del Mar Hau several times before. I was skeptical, so I looked it up here. Of course, after reading rather nasty reviews, I became worried. I didn't have much of a choice, however (as any of you may understatnd, I was outranked in the politics of Latin family...), so I went hoping to make the best of it. Was the room spotless? Not exactly. However, I'm a bit of a germ-o-phobe, and I had no problem. This was a beach cabana, with everything you could possibly need (sans food supplies - bring everything you may need, including toiletries. Drinking on the beach is allowed, too.) Think of it as posh camping, with a Fridge and kitchen cooking/grilling capacites, on the shores of paradise. I have never seen a finer beach! The water, the sand, the people - all was perfect. As to the complaints of previous posters - I can not agree. With regard to the pool, I have no idea. (Why go in a pool when you have an amazing, crystal clear ocean to swim in?) I had no issue with bugs, save mosquitos outside (bring your bug spray). There were certainly crabs about (charming!), though I found none in my room. And, we stayed in a 6 person cabana with two rather new model a/c units. We left the bedroom doors open to the rest of the place in the day with the units on, and it was nice and cool. At night, our room temp was downright cold. I strung up the hammock I bought in Isabela on my front porch back home, hoping to recapture a little of the magic I found on the beach at Villas Del Mar Hau. I write this review only in the hopes that open-minded travelers will discover this enchanting spot. Beware \"Hilton-hoppers\" - It is not a resort. These are beach cabanas meant to be a charming and practical \"base\" for your island and beach adventures. If you're looking for the sterile atmosphere of Disney World, go to Florida.

As an American it is embarrassing to me. I live in Santa Rosa, California in beautiful wine country and can't say enough good things about the Villas. I think all the bad reviews come from people that had unrealistic expectations and were expecting a \"resort\" experience. If you are looking for a crowded concrete jungle beach resort where cabana boys cater to you and serve you tropical drinks w/unbrellas, then you got the wrong place. If you are a fat, dumb American with bad manners and think hotel employees should take your abusive attitude and just smile, you've got the wrong place. I have been there 3 times now and am planning my next trip to go soon. I see a lot of comments about how all the good reviews are from native Puerto Ricans. Yes, you are right. Many city folk from San Juan consider this the ultimate vacation spot on the island. And it's for good reason. It is totally unspoiled. There are not many places left in the world where there are miles of unspoiled beachfront property with just sand dunes and no buildings. If you are into nature and just walking out the front door of your cabin right on the beach and walking a 1/4 mile, only to find yourself with your lover on a deserted beach. : ) Then this IS the place for you. About 70 paces to the right of the Villas is an incredible wading pool, about 6\"-1' in depth, perfect for kids to play around in. If you walk further (30 paces) into the wading pool (I'll include a picture) it drops off to an incredible snorkeling area, protected from the waves. Schools of tropical fish swim around and even if you have never snorkeled before this spot makes it really easy. My then 5 year old had an experience of a lifetime snorkeling with me. Swimming around with schools of tropical fish is amazing!!! You really feel connected with nature. By the way the water is soooooo warm and relaxing, no chill factor whatsoever. Truly amazing and very very safe. Obviously the weekends are much more festive and friendly folks from all around the island come there to party, barbeque, play music, dance and generally have a good time. Nothing out of hand, just good clean family fun. If you are looking for solitude then go during the week otherwise on the weekend if you want ot be alone just walk down the beach a 1/4-1/2 mile and there will be no one in site. What I am trying to say here is that this is a place for Puerto Ricans, not fat butt spoiled Americans with attitudes. Blend in, be polite, friendly and the local folk will embrace you with open arms. The cabins right on the beach and I mean right on the beach (the sound of the waves lull you to sleep at night, incredible!!!!!!) are simple and include cable TV but no telephone. Quite frankly I am glad there is no telephone and kind of wish the temptation of TV was not there. There is a restaurant, but you also get a kitchenette with a refrigerator, stove and table. There is also a living room area with a couch and some chairs. The floors are wood and if you track sand into the room no big deal. Each morning the service folk will come in give you new towels, make the beds up and sweep up the floor. Food can be bought in Isabela at 2 different markets. The offerings are simple and if you expect high-end food, it just doesn't exist. Isabela is not a wealthy resort town. Again, if you don't walk around like you own the place and just blend in, the folks there will be genuinely friendly and helpful to you. It is not at all like the locals in Mexico. There was 2 bedrooms one with a Queensize bed that was a little lumpy but totally sleepable and the second room had 2 sets of bunk beds. Ideal for a big family. Windows are not made out of glass, but rather a louvered thick hard platic that open and close like venician blinds. All rooms come eqipped with AC, which is a nice option. Privacy is pretty good, quite acceptable. The bathroom is simple, shower bathtub and sink. Hanging out on your cabin's porch and playing card or board games in the shade is quite relaxing. Bottom line. If you are looking for simplicity of life and getting close to nature this is TOTALLY the place for you. I find the cabins quite charming and feel they serve as a reminder that life does not need to be so complex. If you live a bohemian lifestyle you are absolutly going to fall in love with this place!! Big time!! I have traveled all around the world and can confidently say that if you are into getting out of the rat race and just relaxing in nature, hanging out on a beach with absolutely no one in sight. You will NEVER find a better deal. The price of admission is dirt-cheap. Places like this won't last forever. I feel privileged to have stumbled upon it. Viva Villas de Mar Hau!!!! ps.

I was well before the 14 day cancellation window and the agent said that a check for the entire nights stay would have to be mailed to me instead of reversing the credit card charges. Two months, ten plus phone calls and four emails have all been ignored. When calling, one cannot talk to someone in administration unless between the hours of 8 and 4. When calls are made within these hours I have heard all sorts of reasons as to why the check has not arrived; \"system down, check cutting agents on vacation, it's in the mail, can you call back?\". I was even hung up on once and when I called back there was no answer. On two ccasions when they said they would return my calls in 10-15 minutes, no call was returned. The four email messages sent to the hotel have never been responded to. I have now contacted my credit card agency to reverse the charges. I have also contacted the Puerto Rico tourism board to let them know just how one of the hotels in their paradore program treats customers. I recommend shying away from this hotel unless you do not value your money! Dealing with this hotel has proven to be one giant headache.", "Date": "December 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "Title": "\u201cWOW\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4160702", "Content": "Beatiful place.

This is NOT a fancy schmancy place. Do not expect resorty snobbery here. Expect rustic cottages right ON the beach - where you can surf on one half & snorkel on the other half.

If you love natural beauty and plan to enjoy meals you grill yourself, and eat on the porch overlooking the sea, after a day of playing on the beach or horesbackriding, This place is fabulous.

So far I had to get my credit card company involve in order to get the refund but everytime the company contact them they lied and tell them that they already mailed it. Not only is happenning to me but also to my two sisters who live in Puerto Rico and still don't have their refunds. I live in California but I'm originally from Puerto Rico and it is embarrasing to read your reviews and to find out that this type of business practice and bad customer service is true. At this point I don't care if I loose my deposit but I am very greatfull to all the people who stayed at this place and took the time to save the horrible experience to me and others. I agreed with everyone else who said that all good reviews of this place must be from the owners.

The beach which is on the outside of the cottages is superb, your at walking distance about two feet or less and just to be able to get away from your everyday hassle is conforting.
