The second day they came to our room and agreed it was not warm and said it would be fixed. Third day we said we would have to leave the hotel if we did not get a different room so the moved us. The gentleman who moved us said \"our compliments\" which we took to mean one free night for the severe inconvenience of a cold shower for three days. Upon leaving we were asked for payment and told their compliments meant they had upgraded our room.

I only stayed there the one night as I had to take the bus to Stansted early the next morning, I don't think I'd have wanted to stay any longer. First impression: The hotel was rather shabby, dingy and in need of a refurbish, and smelt stale. When I went in, there was no one on reception, but after a few minutes the manager (I presume he was the manager) emerged from an office under the stairs - he told me that if there was no one at the reception desk, I should go to the office. He was a very strange man indeed, and kept asking me my details over and over again even though I handed him my printed out email confirmation, which contained all my details. He didn't want to look at the confirmation. There was a packet of tablets, a toy car and small other miscellaneous items lying on the desk, and he asked me twice if any of them were mine. ??? Again he asked me to confirm I was staying one night only. I reminded him that I had to check out early, at 5.30 am, and he told me that I wouldn't be able to use the lift between 11.30 pm and 6.00 am, as it would be switched off. He then started telling me about breakfast which started at 6.00 am. Again I had to remind him I would be away before 6 am. He gave me thekey to the room I was staying in (rather worryingly the one key opened both the main door to the hotel, as well as the room). The room itself was functional, and not as bad as I thought it would be. Although there were tiles missing from the walls in the ensuite bathroom, and the sealant/grouting round the shower tray was a little mouldy, and could have done with a scrub. There was no heating in the room, so it was a little chilly, and the water in the bathroom wasn't very hot, so I had a lukewarm shower before going to bed. The sheets and blankets seemed to be clean, and the bed was comfortable, and the room location was very quiet. I would only recommend this hotel if you need to catch the early Easybus or National Express coach to Stansted, as the stop for these is only a 5-10 min walk up the road.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cNot worth it at any price, even if it's free!\u201d", "Author": "BostonRolly", "ReviewID": "UR88425317", "Content": "This hotel was a joke.

I searched and found the Georgian Hotel which has a great location just 10 minutes walk from Oxford Street so we shop at leisure and go out for the evening without worrying about catching trains and lugging bags around. When we arrived we could see it was an old building but whereas this could be made into a real selling point, (original features and all that), this place just looked run down. As soon as you walk in you can smell the kitchen and it permeates the building. The owner / manager was pleasant enough and, despite some nauseating comments about my mum being my sister, check in was speedy. We had had to pay in advance and now I know why! I'd booked a family room with a double and a single bed as no twin was available. The room was basic which wasn't a problem as we weren't intending to be in much. Toilet and bathroom was clean although lacked any necessities like soap. The carpets were grubby and the room stuffy. We went out but when we came back to sleep the nightmare began. This hotel has no double glazing and we were on the street side. Even on the fourth floor we were kept awake all night by the sounds of three lanes of one way traffic flying past. This would have been annoying but liveable if it wasn't for the APPALLING beds. Dirty stained sheets, lumpy (actually physically lumpy!!) beds that were unbelievably uncomfortable and worst of all, having been in my single bed about half an hour I suddenly begain to smell urine! Obviously as it was a family room, a child must have wet the bed at some point and it was just foul! I put towels down in the bed so I wasn't sleeping close to the mattress but even after a short time my pyjamas smelt of urine. I ended up sharing with my mum in the double which was as uncomfortable but at least minus the pee. Having barely slept a wink we went down for breakfast the next morning which was a pitiful affair. No cooked breakfasts of any kind, no fresh fruit, no yoghurt, no herbal / fruit teas, no pastries. All the offered was tea, coffee, two kinds of cereal and toast. For my \u00c2\u00a3110 a night I expect a little more. And just to add to the fun, the dining room is a tiny, dingy basement area with too few tables, peeling wallpaper and grimy decor. This was just the worst stay I've ever had. Even thinking about it makes me shudder and it made us just want to escape to the point we left for home and didn't spend the Sunday in London. This is not a cheap hotel and for \u00c2\u00a3110 you expect a decent level of HYGIENE and facilities. If this was the last hotel in London, I would rather sleep on a bench.

The staff was incredibly slow, had to wait for 10 minutes before they answered the doorbell when we arrived in the afternoon. Breakfast was advertised as very good by the hotel manager: a few slices of toast, marmelade, cheese and ham. Orange juice was served in 3cl glasses known as small schnapps glasses at home.

We Booked over the net without checking tripadvisor (not making that mistake again), for 7 nights, going to a wedding in London on the 2nd last day, so space and cleanliness was needed in our room. Checked in at reception, whose first comment was \"the room is too small for you\" (it was), \"we can't do anything until tomorrow as we are fully booked out\" (FA Cup Final). The room only had a room for a bed (double, not queen), a table, 1 power point and a shelf with a jug and some tea and coffee. The bathroom was a disgrace, mould in the showers, a small shaving cabinet, no iron or hair dryer in the room - told no iron because of 'fire risk\", the hair dryer was available after 10:30 in the morning and my fiancee had to go down into the basement to iron the clothes. Fortunately only 1 night was paid for, we spent 2.5 hours looking that night for other accomodation, told reception we would not be staying the following 6 nights and caught a cab to The Shaftesbury Metyropolitan near Paddington railway station.

The Georgian Hotel at Gloucester Place was said to have a three star rating, so we did not expect more than something equal to a two star hotel anywhere else in the world. The location is great. A short walk from Baker Street station, and also within walking distance of Hyde Park and Oxford Street. But that is just about the only positive things worth to mention. First of all: Our bathroom was located across the hallway. Terribly intimidating, because we had to get dressed just to take a pee. There was no soap, and the shower only had cold water. And as I was going to London with a mate, I ordered a twin bed room. But when I arrived late at night due to a delayed flight, it turned out to be one single bed. And as the staff only were present until 10 PM, there were nothing to do about this before the next morning. So I could do nothing but sleep on the floor! When I confronted the unfriendly (Indian) hotel manager the next morning with this, he only said that they by no means needed to pay attention my room preference. So to get a bed to sleep in, we had to pay 60 pounds more to upgrade to a triple room! This is a definite no-go!

It was dingy, not very clean, and the towel didn't look as though it had been properly washed. On returning to the room, I realised that this wasn't very clean either - the bedspread was awful, and the sheets were stained. The lock on the door was loose and insecure.

It had a double bed, wardrobe, TV and tea/coffee facilities. The thing we found odd was the en suite bathroom that was actually across the landing. It was a private bathroom but not the most convenient when you need the loo at 3 in the morning. The breakfast was basic but again passable. Consisted of unlimited supply of tea/coffee and juice, toast, cereak and eggs, cheese, ham etc. Was OK but some good cooked food would be welcome.
