Also, for the price, I didn't even get breakfast. I could have stayed in Sultanahment in a nicer place, paid less and had breakfast included. The only thing the door guy did is check the metal detector. Never even offered to open the door or help with packages. The room are clean but small. But not even a scrap of paper to make a note. If you wanted a sea view, more money. The front desk was good about calling a taxi but after all there is a taxi stand close by. The food in the restaurant was okay. The waiter made it out that my plate was going to large portion, not. Wait was nice,but service was a little slow forthr amount of customers there. I don't recommend this hotel. Pay more money and stay at the Novotel or even the Sheraton if you need to be in the Atakoy/Bakirkoy area.
