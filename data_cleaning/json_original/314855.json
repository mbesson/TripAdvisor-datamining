I really feel that you pay for the location only... the room itself was very small and the bathroom was tiny. I'm really not normally one to complain about this sort of thing, but the shower was so small that shaving my legs felt like an extreme sport. It's literally only about shoulder width wide in all directions, and I'm quite a small person! It's only a couple of minutes from the main train station and bus station, so no dragging suitcases around a lot of bridges. And it meant that I didn't get very lost, because when heading back in the evenings I just had to follow all the numerous signs to the train station! I was worried that being next to a train station would mean the area was shaddy, but it wasn't the case at all. I felt safe there as a female traveler on my own. However while the location is good because it's on the main island... it's also a decent walk from the main tourist areas: ~30mins to rialto bridge, ~40mins to st. marks square.

We had to go up or down a total of 5 sets of stairs& 6 hallways each time to/from our room, with no emergency exit in between. The hotel was dark and dingy (it was like an episode of The Shiining), all kidding aside, I was actually afraid, that if there was a fire we would have never been able to navigate our way out of there-very hazardous -Place smells like a urinal in an mens bathroom of an all night bar. The place had the appearance of being clean, but smelt, looked and felt dingy & crudy. -Bathrooms exceptionally small (with septic drain in floor-adding the the urine aroma) -Rooms exceptionally small (barely room for bed), which meant luggage was something you had to step over each time you walked to/from the bathroom or entrance -Can hear noise from adjoining rooms & hallways -Barking dog, that had access to the hotel basement and garden (which our window opened to) -Constant incovenience of giving up the room key when leaving the hotel (for what reason I do not know). When picking up the key, they never asked for ID to validate that were were the registered guests of that room -They advertise \"Wi-Fi access\", truth is Wi-fi is only available in the hotel lobby (which has NO privacy) and costs $9 Euro each time you use it. Overally I would be hard pressed to rate this hotel a 1/2 star let alone 4 (even with its convenient location). Without a doubt, Hotel Nazionale is the worst Hotel I have every had the displeasure of experiencing (and I travel alot).

Unfortunately, it was sold out, so I made a quest to find another hotel near the train/bus stations. This hotel was located in the perfect spot. We took the train from Rome to Venice, and this hotel was literally a two minute walk from the train station. At 6AM, the sign was lit up and this hotel was super easy to find. Although the surrounding hotels in the area had elevators and were fancier (and probably enormously expensive), this hotel had a dozen stairs to get to the lobby, and several more staircases to get to your room. Breakfast was included in the room, but we missed it both days we were there - once too late, once too early. This hotel is also on the walking route to the main sites; the perfect walk for shopping, eating, and photos. Overall, if you're on a tight budget and you need a place to stay for a couple of days near the train/bus stations, then this is the perfect hotel.

Our bus dropped us off at the station, and instead of taking the vaporetto over to the Ferrovia, which is the closest stop to the hotel, we walked it. It took a few minutes, and was hard since we had luggage and had to go over the bridge with all those steps.. but we managed to make it just fine. The hotel is situated between 2 restaurants, and is easy to find. There's a big neon sign overhead as well. In order to get to the hotel lobby, you have a long staircase that you have to climb which is hard when you have large, heavy luggage like we did. It's about 30 or so steps up. The staff was friendly at times, and short sometimes, depending on who was at the front desk. They all spoke English. They have a kind gentleman who helped us to our room with our luggage. We stayed on the 2nd floor in a double room. The room was fairly small, almost all bed, but there was enough room for both our large luggage and some space to still walk around. There's a closet and a safe inside it. There's was a TV, a hairdryer in the bathroom, and you have to pay for internet access if you bring your laptop. Only soap and shampoo was given. The restroom was very small. I could sit on the toilet, and lean my arm on the sink. There's a bidet and a very, very small area for the shower. The shower curtain, if not careful will stick to your body when showering, and it's easy to get the entire bathroom all wet when taking a shower because it's just a shower curtain. No wonder they have a cover over the toilet paper! It wasn't that bad, it's doable, just small. The room was quiet, and we were able to get a good night's sleep from all the walking and vaporetti rides around Venice. We experienced no noise in the corridors or next to us.

There are permanent residents here and they have a cat that they let wander the hallways. The hallways smell like cat pee. People with allergies beware! The rooms were small, but managable. We had a triple which was a double bed and a single bed on the second floor. They advertise air conditioning, though there was none. There was a unit in our room that blew air, but not below 80F. Seriously. The hall was cooler. The staff was rude. They tried to tell me the air conditioning was b/c Europeans do not value cool air. The they said I had to be patient. (We left it on while we toured for hours.) They refused to change my room. They allegedly sent in a technician when we were out and we were informed that it was working.

All new and clean and apparently very large compared to the rest of the rooms people in our tour got. The breakfast was ok, ham and cheese and croissants and rolls, cereal, yogurts, etc, but the trick concerning the undrinkable coffee on offer is to order a cappaccino, which will be brought to you and is excellent! I only realised that on the 3rd morning and wish I had done it each morning! They will also make hot chocolate for the kids. The hotel was in great location, near the railway station and also near a canal bus stop, very useful.

The material texture wallpaper probably made it impossible to rid of the smell. As a non smoker this caused me some distress and a headache but had paid in advance and not able to move on. I come from New Zealand where the smoking regulations are tighter than I observed in Europe so smoking may be a cultural issue. The lack of assistance with luggage was also unhelpful. On the positive side I note some reviewers complained re breakfast, but when I was there, there was a good range of cereal, bread, croissants and boiled eggs on a 'much as you want' basis so I felt that aspect good value.

I stayed in Hotel Nazionale for 2 nights and 3 days. POSITIVES: o LOCATION - it is near the bus station (Piazzale Roma), train station (Stazione Sta. Lucia), vaporetto stop (Ferrovia stop). It is on a quite busy street, so even during early mornings there are people and shops open. This is good for single travellers. o STAFF - the staff is very friendly. They can speak english, but they are patient enough if you want to try your Italian. I tried asking questions about where things are and they are helpful enough. o ROOM - I go the single bed room. I found everything I needed in it, but it is really basic as it can get. I was a bit shocked by the size of the room, but in the end I've accepted it as it is budget as budget goes. It was comfortable anyway. There were a number of channels availabe on TV most of it were Italian channels. There were 1 or 2 channels in English. o SECURITY - unlike other hotels I've tried around the world, I found that Hotel Nazionale is quite safe. I did not lose anything. My things were not touched when I was away. NEGATIVES: o NO AIRCON - I went when it was a bit cool during the night. There were mosquitoes coming inside my room, so had to close the windows. I tried turning on the airconditioning, but hot air was blowing out of the unit. The receptionist said that it is a central control in the whole building, they have not switched onto cold air yet. I forgot to bring my bug repellant, so woke up with a few bites. o BATHROOM/TOILET STINKS - every time I go to the bathroom, it smelled like stale cigarette smoke and unclean toilet seat. I don't know where it was coming from. Maybe from the canal water, I dont know, but it really bothered me. o THIN ROOM WALLS - it was too thin. I was awakened a number of times by the adjoining room. They were really noisy, but I realised they were having a normal conversation (they did laugh a bit loud though).
