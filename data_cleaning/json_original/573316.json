The breakfast was excellent, internet useful, mini bar a bonus and the sports centre an asset, but I wasn't in Rome to swim. I was there to go large on the culture and sight seeing. This is where this hotel hits a stumbling block if you are not properly prepared. Basically you are compromising on price over location. If this hotel was within a mile of the historic centre it would be 3 times the price. So, if you are prepared to compromise and don't mind the adventure of traveling on public transport this hotel is for you. Following is hopefully all the info you will need for getting about on public transport. Firstly you can get from the airport to the hotel for 9 Euros (each). Firstly, as you exit Terminal 3, up and to your right is the way to the train terminal. Once here purchase a ticket from the machine (they are in English, or go to the ticket office if you're not confident) from Fiumicino to (St) Ostiense. This should cost 8 Euros. at this ticket machine purchase a further 1 trip ticket for 1 euro. You will need this for the metro and bus. Before going onto the platform ensure you verify your train ticket by slipping it into one of the yellow machines and having it punched and a code put on it.The journey from the airport should take about 30 mins. On arrival at Ostiense (which is a bit like Paddington with a train station and underground (metro), make your way to Piramide metro station which is a 2 min walk through the train station. From Piramide validate your 1 euro ticket in one of the machines similar to that you used earlier. Hop on the B line metro towards Laurentina. Hop off at EUR Palasport and exit out of the station onto via America. Keeping the shops and restaurants on your right and the park and lake on your left walk about 200 yds to the bus stop. (you have to cross a road and the bus stop is just after the wheelie bins and in front of a large chinese restaurant. A quick look at the bus stop sign shows you the bus route as 778. The name America is enclosed in a rectangle and the stop for the hotel is 'Jachino'. Hop on the 778, no need to show your ticket and no one will ask for it (the same one you used for the metro). The jouney will take about 15-20 mins and look out for these landmarks. Pam supermarket on your right. After this you will turn right up a hill. this is via Jachino. There is a stop going up the hill, one just over the brow and the final one (the one you want at the bottom, look for the bright yellow petrol station). Press the bell to stop the bus, get off and the entrance to the hotel is just to the left of the petrol station. Easy!! For getting into Rome itself: Purchase travel tickets from the newstand located 100 yds to the left of the hotel. Go past the petrol station, cross the road, go past the perfume shop, ice cream parlour, chinese restaurant and coffee bar and there it is. Tickets for 1 euro will do for 75 mins of travel, enough to get you into Rome but only good for 1 metro journey. Tickets for 1 day (4 Euros) and the 3 day tourist ticket (11 Euros) can only be purchased from the machines or ticket offices in the metro, (again in English). Once purchased the bus stop is to the left of the hotel in front of the petrol station. Again it's the 778. Hop on and insert your ticket face down into the yellow machine and validate it. Keep an eye out for the lake with water polo nets on your right. You will turn right just after this into via America. You need to get off at the second stop before the bus turns left. Off the bus and carry on up the road for 100 yds to the metro. this is EUR Palasport. Hop on the metro (line B) towards Rebibiba(?). You'll see a list of stops on the train (much like the London underground) and the main stopping points are Colloseo ( colloseum: step off here, exit and it's right across the road) and Termini, the main train station for Rome. If you want to go the Vatican get off at Termini, go to the bus station outside and get on Bus 64. It goes all the way to the Vatican. Hope this info helps. Just one word of warning....keep your belongings close, pockets done up and bags secure. I'm now minus and iphone 4s all thanks to some light fingered git. It was lifted out of my unzipped jacket pocket whilst on a crowded bus. You have been warned!!", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greater London", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful\u201d", "Author": "Tallies", "ReviewID": "UR127142049", "Content": "6 of us visited Rome this weekend and stayed at this hotel - We loved the stocked free fridge but missed coffee making facilities - Very modern and the best continental breakfast you could ask for and yes as quoted before the staff are a real asset.

The busstop is jsut outside and takes you to the Metro - we bought a 3 day pass and could use the bus and Metro as much as we wanted.

I was there the first week of Feb 2012 when a rare snowstorm shut down Rome. Cars without tire chains were ordered off the road which shut down all taxis, leaving me unable to get to the airport to fly back to the US. The front desk started trying to make alternate arrangements while I headed back to my room figuring I'd be stranded for a least a couple of days. 30 minutes later, I get a knock at the door and it is the owner of the hotel, telling me he had heard I needed a ride to the airport and he would take me there in his own car. 45 minutes later I was at the airport and made my flight.

I only stayed in Rome for one night so needed to be in between the town centre and the airport, which the hotel was. It is approx. 20 minutes into the city and to the airport from the hotel via public transport. The breakfast was also excellent.

Receptionist said \"if you want to drink or eat go to the bar outside of the hotel\". The toilette was broken and with continuous flow of water, and we could not sleep in the night of our arrival. They did not check the room before our arrival although we paid for the whole day. No compensation or sorry from the staff!!! Transportation There is no shuttle bus to the airport and if you arrive late you are looking at around 45 \u2013 50 Euros for 13 kms with a taxi unless you are Italian and know the bus routes which most stop at 12 midnight. The hotel is very far from Rome centre if you use public transport, otherwise be prepared to pay a taxi 30 - 50 Euros for each single journey. However if you choose to stay in this hotel then some advise on saving money on transport: You need to take the bus with number 778 or 708 for half our trip to the nearest metro station which is Palasport. There is a bus every half hour so if it is winter or autumn, be prepared to wear warm clothes or you will freeze. Then you need to take the metro for another 9 stops (another half hour) until the main train station in order to be able to visit the different points of interest. Location There are no supermarkets, decent restaurants in the area. The hotel offers poor breakfast nothing related with sports nutrition. Food - Drinks There is no decent food or drinks after breakfast time. Forget it!!! And this is a sports hotel. Flashnews: Do they know that people doing sports need nutrition and supplementation? I guess another gimmick to get clients! I was devastated as I am doing sports professionally and expected at least something more with protein than eggs in the breakfast. Gym The gym is a public gym with many people using it, however you can use it without a fee. We did not use the pool because so many people were doing aquaerobics leaving just one lane empty in which 10 people swimmed. There is also a glass window overlooking the pool for spectators. The sports bar? Its a joke. 3 old sandwiches and lots of soft drinks. Fresh Juices, proteins, sports nutrition? ha, you wish!!! if you are in bodybuilding make sure you take your aminos and proteins with you (as well as cooking equipment or canned food). The equipment is old Technogym but substantial to exercise decently. Other services When we asked a cable to use the Internet they gave us a cable 10 cm long. There is no wifi so you are stuck in using your laptop on the dressing table. No room service. Actually no service at all besides the crap breakfast. Make sure you close well your room door Verdict Will never return back. This hotel needs a decent managerial staff to reinvent it and realise what a sports hotel should be. There are falsely advertising as sports hotel. They should be advertised as the place you go to starve yourself.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cBe very alert with Laura\u201d", "Author": "DLB6262", "ReviewID": "UR112974108", "Content": "Very simple!!!.

Going back to the hotel and its services- the hotel is exactly the same as in pictures- it\u2019s very clean and nice. The people, who work there are very nice- I had a flight at 6pm and had to ask for a late check-out (usually it\u2019s 10 in the morning) - absolutely no problem at all, I checked out some time around 2 pm, after I went for swimming pool, sauna and Jacuzzi before my flight back home :-) The breakfast was good- the waiters very attentive, and quite good selection of fresh fruits, muesli\u2019s, yoghurts, pastries, juices\u2026 I think full Irish breakfast was at the additional cost, but hey well, when in Italy eat like Italian\u2019s do \uf04a I was absolutely happy with that :-) It is nice to come back from all day walking around tour to this lovely place. The swimming pool facilities are not only for hotel use, they are for general public as well. That didn\u2019t bother me, well it\u2019s not the luxury 5 star SPA hotel, but if you want to have a nice swim after sightseeing and have some relaxing time in Jacuzzi or steam room- it\u2019s all good.

The reasons are simple: GREAT because it is difficult to find such a good value for money at a 4 star hotel (I got excellent rates both times), staff is friendly, the facilities and rooms are modern, clean and adequate, breakfast is basic but with good and fresh products, the location is quite calm, parking is free (unless full but that has not happened to me and I stayed there twice) and there is an adjacent 25m pool free of charge (even though the staff there is not so friendly, but who cares if you want to swim your daily programme and possibly find an empty lane just for you as it happened to me early in the morning!). COMPLICATED if you are looking for a central location or a romantic place (the area around the hotel is a bit desolated) and I guess it has no sense to travel for tourism and spent an hour on public transport to get into the City and another hour to get out of it again on a poor Roman public transport... because the hotel is far out, in the South-Western outskirts nearby EUR.
