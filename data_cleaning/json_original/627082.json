{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lovely Villa, but far from everything The villas and rooms were lovely. The staff is extremely friendly and warm and do everything to make you feel comfortable. The villa was an experience in itself. However, I would like to mention that the villa is quite far from everwhere and though the hotel does provide a free drop to Kuta or Seminiyak, you need to get back on your own. The cost is susbstantial if you hire a taxi back everytime you want to go to the beach or market.That said, I would recommend the villa to people looking for a peaceful and quite holiday, away from the crowds. However, if you want to be in the midst of activity this place is not for you.", "Date": "Sep 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR434877810", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Pallavi455"}, {"Content": "Awesome super duper       The living area", "Date": "Jun 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR354137330", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TimmyTonsil"}, {"Content": "The Kunja is a Hidden Gem My wife and I stayed at the Kunja for four nights from New Years Eve 2008. We wanted to stay somewhere exclusive, private and very luxurious.Well, the Kunja was a stand out! The villas are gorgeous! Massive open air living areas, gorgeous bedroom, bathroom and the pool and grounds are fabulous.Some people may not like that the living areas and bathroom are open air and so are whatever the temperature is outside but personally I liked it. It made me remember that I was on a tropical island and also appreciate just how good the air conditioning in the Bedroom was. The large open living area does have two ceiling fans made though which made the living area very comfortable. And if you do get hot, go for a swim in your private pool, completely nude, no one can see you over the 3m+ high rendered walls!Every morning someone would come and make us breakfast in our own villa at a time we requested and we also arranged for two masseurs to give us private massages in the grounds of our private villa on transportable massage beds. The staff were incredibly obliging, even running out for extra candles and chocolates late one night when we were feeling romantic.The Kunja is for the discerning guest who wants to relax in private and doesn't need to be seen lounging by a big pool at a large resort. With that in mind, it is worth stating that it does not have a bar, or its own restaurant. There is a bar adjoined to the reception but is not owned and run by the Kunja. But with free transport to and from anywhere in the Seminyak/Legian/Kuta area, who needs your own restaurant and bar?! Get one of their private cars to drive you to such places as Breeze at Samaya and Ku De Ta. (both excellent)Last word: the photos almost do not do this Hotel justice. It is in fact more beautiful than their images show. I took some photos of our villa that make the ones on the web site look average. It truly is a great Hotel and I would highly recommend it.Travis  Leonie FancourtPerth, Western Australia", "Date": "Jan 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR519827368", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "The_Fancourts"}, {"Content": "\u6d60\u5a42\u5bb3\u9287\ue21a\u3047\u9355\ue76c\u4ef9\u5a09\u5a3f\u4f28\u9287\uff43\u4ef8\u9287\u88e4\u4ee7\u9287\u52e9\u4ef9\u9287\u6b0d\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(22855232, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR164161393", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u93c8\u20ac\u6942?!   showReview(19168849, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR790664992", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u6434\u51a6\u20ac\u546b\u4efa\u9287\u693c\u4ee7\u5a32\u6943\u53cd\u9287\u66d8\u5022\u9287\u71b4\u5147\u9288\uff43\u5135\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u9286?#x201d;   showReview(19163504, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR402692601", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d627082-r19782193-Kunja_Hotel-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "627082", "Price": "$313"}}
