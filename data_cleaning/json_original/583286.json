It is half an hour from busy Ubud, with a free car service for trips into town - but why you would want to leave your 4 poster room, with its amazing jungle views, private heated plunge pool, deck, and 5 star room service is beyond us.... (oh, we did sneak out for some excellent massages in the riverside spa, and for meals in the lovely restaurant)This is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in - many thanks to charming Hadi, the front office manager, and his excellent staff for looking after us so well during our stay.

My wife and I stayed at the Hanging Gardens for an entire week recently and we loved every minute. This place is so unique! It's built on a steep slope in the rain forest outside of Ubud making it very secluded and private. The staff is so friendly and helpful, and they aren`t this way just because they expect a tip in return. The Balinese are a kind folk, always smiling. We were very impressed with our villa. Lots of wood, windows, a private plunge pool with a deck, and so much style! The fenicular transport up and down the hotel grounds was so much fun. Eating breakfast overlooking the rain forest every day was simply amazing. The cocktails were equally amazing, delicious! Dinner was of the highest quality with the service to match. We loved every single moment at Hanging Gardens and can't wait to return. Dana, the food and beverage manager, was totally cool and very helpful with anything we needed during our week-long stay. All in all, we think this was the best hotel we've ever experienced.Thank you Hanging Gardens!Jake and Andrea", "Date": "Dec 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR352185257", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "amph33"}, {"Content": "The best       main pool", "Date": "Dec 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR462747106", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Zabka"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Hideaway I stayed at the Hanging Gardens with my girlfriend and it was the perfect hideaway. It's a great place for couples. Our villa had a private sundeck and infinity edge pool overlooking the valley. You could hear a small river below. The whole place sits on a hillside and is very nicely arranged. The staff were amazing! Friendly, helpful and humble. Very charming! The massage we had at the couples' room was a dream! We had dinner at the restaurant and through room service, set on our private deck, both fantastic!Only problem: the little funicular that takes you up and down the hill, eg. from your villa to the restaurant, was broken when we arrived so we had to walk a lot. Once again the staff were amazing, one gentleman walked with us and offered to explain the wildlife and flowers to us. It was charming, very charming!

It is a spectacular property.We booked a family suite that was great for our family of four (kids ages 8 and 12). There were two bedrooms, with the kid's bedroom downstairs and two bathrooms -- that was a pleasant and unexpected surprise. Many family suites I've stayed in across the world seem to have only one shared bathroom.The master bedroom and bath were lovely -- huge, well furnished, completely comfortable. The plunge pool was fantastic; it overlooked thick green forest.The people who work at this property have to be just some of the loveliest I've ever met. From the driver who picks you up to the check in staff to the funicular operator -- EVERYONE is happy to see you and by the second day they know your names and greet you so enthusiastically when you return from an outing. No request is denied and the staff is eager to learn your preferences.The library, the bar, the dining room are all very nice and everywhere you see special little touches that add up to a wonderful atmosphere.If you stay here then walk all the way down to the river and relax down on the bamboo deck and listen to the water rushing by. Downtown Ubud is a bit chaotic and is overflowing with tourists and lots of restaurants and hotels. If you want that busy buzz then don't stay at Ubud Hanging Gardens.If you want a peaceful and romantic place that is probably unlike anywhere you've ever been then choose this wonderful hotel.", "Date": "Nov 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR392429150", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ajmita"}, {"Content": "The perfect start to the perfect honeymoon I am writing a belated entry following our honeymoon in July.

The design of the hotel has no regard for privacy or for quiet. The cable car runs all night, the pumps running the indiviudal pools run most of the night, the AC's of your neighbors' villas run all night (because they like living behind closed doors and windows, not within the amazing nature that surounds them, like in their apratments back home), and the road adjacent to the hotel is full (especially at night) with cars and motorbikes flying down the hill and straining up the hill. You cannot imagine how annoying this is. I cannot understand why the developers went 30 minutes from Ubud to find land right next to a busy mountain road in a place were cars and motorbikes have almost no mufflers....what a waste.Re: privacy, you see into other people's villas below you, especially around the personal pool area, other people see into yours from above. Forget frolicking poolside in your birthday suit with your loved one. And the top villas are close to the road. There is no escape.2. Management is humorously smug. They have the audacity to request a dress code of smart elegance at dinner. You're in the jungle, bats and lizards and palms and such, surrounded by a culture that lives in sandals, and they go out of their way to make you UNcomfortable. They demand you make reservations for dinner, as there are not enough places for all guests (and you're 20-30 min from a decent restaurant). And even when the place is empty, they give you dirty looks, make you wait to 'see if that table is available' if you didn't call ahead 2 hrs. Dinner is a show of 'look at our amazing creations', at which one should express awe at the (truly good) chef's ability to make great food from great produce. Like 20 others in the city.The manager's comment to our moving to new villa to try to get some privacy and quiet was 'that is no problem.' As if my request for peace and quiet with my wife at +350 USD/night could cause him problems.... The Hanging Gardens is all very 'remember our colonial past'...and at the end of the day, its all very silly considering the overall quality - good, but not great (fit and finish is average, handles falling off of doors and sinks, etc., slow service, constant misunderstandings in english over the phone, bad breakfast).In short, go there around lunch for a massage, then sit on the lower porch, sipping your drink of choice with amazing sushi, french fusion, spicy local and great desserts, take a picture in the one of a kind pool. about an hour before nightfall, get in your car and leave. drive to one of the 10 great hotels near ubud that understands that bringing the city to the jungle is the worst that a hotel in ubud can do. One that understands why Ubud is one of the most amazing places on the planet - peace, quiet and nature.we left after the second night, went to the Pita Maha, paid 30% less, enjoyed it immensely more.", "Date": "Aug 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR218301565", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "archikyiv"}, {"Content": "Excellent garden We have just returned from a 3 days at the Hanging garden.

This put a real downer on our holiday because we were confined to our room for the rest of our stay.

So why not stay at UHG for a few nights, then move to a hotel nearer to town? This is what my boyfriend and I did, and it turned out to be the perfect arrangement.The villa we stayed in at UHG was beautiful, the infinity pool was spectacular and we had no complaints at all about the service or the privacy. We went in the rainy season and the pool was cold in the morning, but once you got in, it was fine. We went swimming every morning in fact. We borrowed their bicycles and cycled around the nearby areas - the scenery was just wonderful and the people so friendly. I'd recommend taking a daytrip to Gunung Kawi (may have misspelt it) - it's by far the best tourist destination we went to in Ubud.

Based on some favorable reports of the Hanging Gardens in several travel magazines, the Luxe guide, and my prior stay at the Pansea La Residencia, I chose to stay at your hotel. This was my fifth trip to Indonesia and I have stayed at several boutique, villa hotels in the Ubud area such as the Pita Maha and the Kupu Kupu Barong. I was extremely disappointed with many aspects of the hotel that were far below the standard I expected for the price and reputation of Orient Express and Pansea. 1) The unfavorable impressions began as soon as we stepped into the lobby. We were asked to complete the check in forms and the front desk attendant could only find one pen for the seven of us. After completing the forms we were escorted to our rooms. 2) Certainly, we were expecting a welcome drink in the lobby. No staff member explained that a welcome drink would be served to us later in the room. 3) The staff member who escorted us to the room was harried. He did not explain the facilities or orient us to the room. When we arrived at the room, he placed the key in the electrical switch and said that he was too busy to complete the room orientation but we could call the reception with any questions.4) Our baggage arrived about 45minutes later but one of the bags was missing and showed up about 20 minutes after that.5) Sometime in between the baggage deliveries, the welcome drinks and cold towels finally arrived. 6) Our bedspread and decorative bed pillows were stained. See attachment photos.7) A musical CD was included in the room entertainment center but figuring how to play it on the DVD and television system was impossible and no instructions were provided.8) Although a flat screen television is in the room, the cable signal is not high definition and as a result, the picture quality is poor.9) While we dined at the hotel the first night, housekeeping came and turned down the bed. They took the welcome drinks and towels and placed in the alcove with the Ganesh statue by the front door of our villa. The next morning when we went to breakfast, they were still sitting in the Alcove, now covered with insects.10) Universally, all of us noted that the towels in the room had stains, holes, were rough, grayed, and did not smell fresh.11) Many of the hotel staff consistently had body odor.12) Service at the restaurant was poor and the wait staff did not seem to appreciate that certain services should be automatic. Refills of coffee required constant prodding of the staff. When we requested milk for the coffee, we were directed to the large milk decanter for cereal at the buffet. 13) We inquired about Yoga at the hotel and were told that it would be $70 for one person and $140 for four.14) Internet access rates were quoted as $10 for one hour.15) The tissue dispenser next to their bed was empty on check-in, and that the bedside flashlight was dead. 16) Algae were growing, abundantly, in the main pool.17) There was absolutely no service at the main pool. If we wanted a drink or snack we had to walk up to the bar to get it. When guests vacated their lounge area at the pool, the area was not refreshed for the next guest. The used towels just lay at poolside or in hamper overflowing with towels. Garbage from prior guests was left next to the pool. See attachments.18) One morning after breakfast I walked up to the library to look for a newspaper, beer bottles from the prior night were still sitting in the lounge area next to the stairs to the library.19) When we tried to call to have coffee delivered to our room before breakfast no one answered the phone. We had to walk to the restaurant to ask for this and were told that the hotel only had two sets of coffee service for delivery and that the hotel prefers guests not to have coffee in the room. As an example of the gross disparity in the level of service and attention to detail at the Hanging gardens, I took our group to the Pita Maha since we were having dinner nearby. We walked into the lobby and I told the front desk attendant that I had stayed there previously and that I wanted my friends to see the hotel. They immediately offered us cold towels and welcome drinks then showed my friends two rooms.  I would say that I have very clear expectations from a hotel such as the Hanging Gardens .1) I expect to be greeted on arrival with a welcome drink and cold towel in the lobby.2) I expect that a daily newspaper be delivered to the room.3) In a boutique hotel of this size, breakfast should be made to order and not a buffet.4) Internet service should be complimentary or available for a nominal fee. Ten dollars is more than I pay for an entire month of high-speed access at home.5) Activities like Yoga should also be complimentary or at a nominal fee. The rates quoted are more than we would pay for access to Yoga in the most exclusive fitness centers in the United States . 6) A full compliment of spa quality bath products should be provided. Only soap, shampoo (black colored), and body lotion was provided-no bath salts, bath gel, or hair conditioner. I have some final comments on the room itself. The hotels of Bali are famous their outside bathing areas, but the outdoor shower was very unappealing. The terrazzo finish on the interior wall stops abruptly at the glass transitioning to exposed gray concrete block. The area is dingy and lacks any visual appeal. The industrial light fixture on the wall is an eyesore. The area could be improved by finishing the wall in the same manner as the interior and placing a relief on the wall, or a fountain, and some plants or carved stone lanterns which could be lit at night with the turndown service. Given the distance that the Hanging Gardens is from Ubud, I think that the hotel should go out of its way to provide services and perks that make a stay there special and worth the inconvenience of its location. As you can see, we were all disappointed with many aspects of our stay with you. If it was simply one or two issues, I would have easily let it go. However, our experience was so far below the standards that we associate with Pansea and Orient Express that I had to formally bring it to your attention. I hope that you find this helpful.", "Date": "Feb 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR577659957", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "luxetraveler"}, {"Content": "magical place               More photos", "Date": "Feb 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR771085373", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "baliboyLondon"}, {"Content": "Jungle Cozy Wonderfully secluded Pansea Orient Express hotel in the middle of the jungle with private villa style setting, each with its own plunge pool.

Not to mention that the hotel overlooks a beautiful Hindu temple.The room was stunning, the chocolate chip cookies that you get from the turndown service was a nice touch. The food at the hotel was good and not too expensive.The staff were all very friendly and helpful.The negatives:- I wish that the in room pool was heated, cause there are moments (at night) where it will be nice to be able to dip into the pool.- This is more of saftey issue.We went in the raininy season and it rained almost everyday. Eventhough the rain will only last for 5 or 10 minutes at a time and wasnt heavy at all. However, it made the pathway from the room to the lobby very slippery. They should add some sort of grid on the pathway to help guests get to their rooms safely.Other than that my whole family had a wonderful realxing time at this resort and we will highly recommend it.", "Date": "Jan 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR916729187", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Rubee1402"}, {"Content": "outstanding secluded relaxation       bed", "Date": "Jan 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR789401363", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Carruth"}, {"Content": "Ubud hanging gardens Hanging Gardens is a perfect place to enjoy your travel companion.

The air in the mountains is much drier than that of the beach areas which is a major plus!!! I wish I could have stayed there longer. Our only recommendation is that you arrange transportation in advance. The hotel offers it and after the Denpasar airport experience you'll be happy to know someone is waiting to whisk you away to paradise.
