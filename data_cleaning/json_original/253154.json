I was on a girls break and stayed 4 nights. The first room was small so we asked Emmanuelle at reception for a better room and he moved us immediately to a 3 bed spacious room at the rear of the hotel. We requested extra towels & pillows and everything appeared straight away, they could'nt do enough for us. Quality of towels, linens very good, toiletries, bidet, well stocked fridge, all excellent. Always had hot water, hairdryer, a/c etc. Free internet but via a code on a printed receipt from reception which expires every 24 hrs which is a tad annoying. Coffee at breakfast is terrible, breakfast is cold continental buffet / no eggs, great pastries, croissants. Local Tabachi kiosk and Carrefour supermarket 5 mins walk, bus stops on Nomentana Street very assessible to everything so did'nt use the tube. Return journeys from central Rome after a day's sightseeing or night out were done by taxi and we split it 4 ways so was very cheap, on average 2-3 euro per person so well worth the time saved on waiting for a bus. TOP TIP REMEMBER TO WEAR TRAINERS OR SPECIALIST WALKING SHOES!!. My heart goes out to Emmanuelle who looked after us admirably he deserves a medal from Loan hotel group. Try the Cotton Club (jazz club) near the hotel and a great pizza pasta traditional cucina also closeby. Very enjoyable trip would recommend this hotel only if you don't want to be in the centre of the City (you still have traffic noise at Santa Costanza).

That hotel was in no way near the vatican and as well far away from any public subway (only a bus transport downtown possible).

It is a simple hotel located in a quiet neighborhood of rome, well connected but still a bit off-centre. Location : The hotel is located a few bus stops away from the train station of rome and is not exactly city-centre. However it is very well connected with the super dense transportation system of rome. There are a bunch of buses(public transport) which leave from right outside the hotel and a couple of them stop almost right at the hotel doorstep.Some are the superfast ones which take you to Roma-termini in 5 min tops. I think this more than compensates for its location bit far from the city centre.It is located in a very quiet residential neighborhood which seems a bit upmarket. I saw a couple of foriegn embassies when i took a stroll around the hotel. There is a supermarket right across the street from the hotel which is an added advantage ( for some). It is not located close to ANY of the sights but the buses next to the hotel take you almost anywhere in rome including to the vatican. Hotel and rooms : The hotel is not the most posh and well maintained hotel one can find but this needs to be co-related to the price you are paying. The rooms are well kept but are not very recently renovated. The bathroom is quite spacious but i found the shower cubicle tiny. The decor is kinda old and due to the wooden steps and lobbies,one can hear faintly the footsteps of people in the hallways or stairs.The carpeting is also old and holds the cigarette smell so kinda smells smoky most of the times.Some rooms windows open out on the street which isnt very busy and also the window blocks out all the noise if any.The TV was not the latest and basic at best...but again, its what you pay for.All and all not at all a BAD room to stay in but definitely could do with improvements. Staff and service : the hotel staff was very polite and helpful. The guy running the night shift when we arrived was very friendly but i couldn't say the same about the lady or other guy in the morning shift. They were not rude but not very friendly either. The friendly receptionist helped and guided us a lot with bus routes and sights to see.The staff at breakfast was not as prompt as one would want and only turned up when a refill was seriously needed. The housekeeping staff was ok but they forgot to replace the towels in my room but did so when asked for later.Check-in Check out was also effortless. We checked in really later : 2 AM in the morning and a special mention for the friendly receptionist..coz he was as cheerful and accommodating..as one would want..after a ryanair flight and long taxi wait and taxi ride. Breakfast: The breakfast is the usual European bfast with cold meat, lots of rolls and buns and 2-3 types of bread, cereal, cereal bars, rusk, jams, marmalade, nutella and likes.Very well stocked to be honest. The Coffee and tea was good too and only slight downside was that it was not supervised very well coz although we got our coffee refills in time, the bread rolls or milk were not replenished untill couple of people were standing there waiting. Other : there is a very nice restaurant down the road ( away from the bus stop) and couple of good cafes and bars as well...Decent lunch or dinner places for sure ! In conclusion : this is a nice hotel if you are either too late to book ( last min booking) or on a tight budget. Everything is decent but nothing memorable. This would be my back-up hotel if i dont find anything in the city centre.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood\u201d", "Author": "Stephen T Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR124652636", "Content": "Some rooms were a bit small but had everything you needed in them.

The receptionist was unsympathetic and also contributed to the conversation in Italian. Nothing improved when we went to our room which stunk of cigarettes. The receptionist insisted that this was a non-smoking establishment. The breakfast is also terrible with croissants being the only edible thing. While we had to stay there multiple times due to the tour package, they always insist on taking our room key every time you leave the hotel, even if you say you're going round the corner to get a coffee. They insist! Which gave them the name 'Hotel Gestapo' while we were staying there. I also had a friend who needed to crash for a couple of hours in the afternoon while she waited for a flight. For her to be allowed into the hotel, the insisted on keeping her passport and were really really rude about it.

You can leave with this, me, personally all these things that I mentioned before didnt affect me , because I just needed a cheap hotel to sleep after being all day in the center of rome. What destroyed everything were THE HORRIBLE WALLS IN THE HOTEL. The walls are not concrete, are something like a very slim wood so, if your neighbor speaks just a little, you hear it like if he is doing it in your ears.

We didn't need luxury for our stay in Rome as we were out of the room for the entire day and only came back to sleep, bathe and eat! The location of the hotel was also pretty good, it's a 10 minute walk to get to the nearest metro although they do appear to be building one that is much closer than that (not sure when that will be finished though!) it's then very easy to get into central Rome on the metro as there is only two lines (A and B). The service was acceptable, every one we encountered spoke English and was well mannered although they weren't overly friendly however, this really didn't concern us. As for the breakfast, it was acceptable, I would have preferred more of a variety e.g. toast, fresh fruit, muffins, a cooked breakfast would also have been lovely but I completely understand that for the price and being in Italy a continental breakfast is pretty standard! Positives: Excellent value for money, Good location, Good air conditioning, Nice balcony, Perfectly comfortable and acceptable bed, TV. Negatives: Shower in our particular room was difficult to use as it seemed to cascade over your head and I constantly felt like I was drowning and this in turn made the floor become soaking wet which we had to mop up with our towels, Could have had a slightly better breakfast selection, Staff could have been friendlier, There also could have been more pillows in the room as the ones provided were very flat and I definitely needed another one. I would end my review by saying that if you are looking to go to Rome and have a fantastic time sight seeing, eating at wonderful restaurants and soaking up the Italian culture on a budget then this is the hotel for you whereas if you are looking for a little bit of luxury and don't have to watch the pennies then go for a better hotel in the centre of Rome.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oradea, Romania", "Title": "\u201ca good hotel for a fair price\u201d", "Author": "dellya", "ReviewID": "UR118934118", "Content": "Nice hotel, clean rooms and helpful personell.

There are several buses, but it can be a bit hard to judge where to get off the bus as some are express buses and others stop at every stop. Once we found the right stop, the hotel is a few metres from the bus stop, which is very convenient. It was easy and quick to check in. We were put in a room on the 6th floor - the lift only goes up to the fifth floor, but that didn't really bother us. The room was more of an issue - it was a narrow attic room, which was really hot and only had a small sloping window we couldn't even see out of. I had read another review on this website of someone put into a similar room, who asked to move. So we decided to ask if we could move rooms, which is the first time we had ever done that. It was late by this stage. The staff said nothing was available for that night, but they would try to move us the next day, which to their credit they did. We ended up with a nice room on the 3rd floor with a balcony. The rooms aren't large, but were nice and had everything we needed, including a small fridge, which was handy for keeping food for lunch in. Beds were comfortable, but would have been nice to have extra pillows. TV didn't have many english channels (except BBC world news), but we didn't really expect that. Breakfast is self service and was fine. Lots of choice. The only thing we didn't really like was the 'fruit juice', which was more like squash/cordial. The staff were all courteous and friendly. There is a large supermarket less than 5 minutes walk away and a tobacconists over the road which sells metro/bus tickets (1 euro for one bus trip, 4 euros for a day, or 11 euros for 3 days). We ate a local pizzeria restaurant one evening, which was very good. One of our travel guides had a bus map, so we used the buses all over the city. It does take longer than you think to get from one side of the city to the other, but there is a bus from the hotel that goes to the Collesseum and one from just down the road that goes straight to the Vatican. One thing we were sorry to miss were the catacombes, which are literally over the road from the hotel. They were shut for a month when we were there. If you travel from the nearest metro station (Bologna) and go one stop to Tiburtina train station, you can get a train to Tivoli (1 hour journey - about 2.20 euros return!). Also, we saw a much cheaper train to the airport (something like 3 euros instead of the direct trains costing 11 euros from termini). The train anouncements leave something to be desired - oh, and you must stamp your ticket in the platform machine before you get on the train! Best to leave lots of time if you are not familiar with Italian trains.

They promised a brand name hotel, comparing the 3 stars with Hilton, DoubleTree, etc. I don't know what their definition of \"brand-name\" is, but it doesn't match mine. I checked in, and the guy spoke English pretty well, and it was fast. This hotel has a standard metal key on a very heavy key fob. I looked around and they have a pretty expansive living room-like lobby, brightly lit, with plenty of couches and a small and expensive bar in the corner. I never saw anyone there, so as a social watering-hole, it's a no. There's also one computer station connected to the internet for tenant use. They also have 24 hour access cards to their WiFi. I was given my room and when I walked in, I thought I was in Eastern Europe. The room stands approximately 5.5 ft x 11 ft with a twin size bed and dim lighting. It's very cramped. I just have carry-on luggage and it's taking up a lot of real estate. The desk, which is right by the floor-to-ceiling window/door, reminds me of something I had when I was in Fourth Grade. Good thing I have a netbook...it fits perfectly on this desk. They did manage to cram a not-very-well stocked minibar into the room between the foot of the bed and the desk. The wardrobe is on the other side of the window behind the desk. In order to open it, you have to tuck the chair in all the way under the desk. The television is around a 20\" screen mounted high on the wall. The remote control doesn't work. The TV is very basic with a bunch of local Italian channels, CNN and BBC in English. I had to reach up to turn it on and change the channels Onto the bathroom. The door to the bathroom only opens halfway before being stopped by the side of the twin bed. The bathroom itself is small, but nicely appointed with marble tile, and complete with a decent sized pedastal sink, toilet, bidet, and stand up shower. The hotel provided one towel and a floor mat towel, two small bars of soap, and a bottle of shampoo. Above the sink, there's a small glass ledge to lay out your hygiene items, enough space for one person's hygiene items. The shower is placed in a corner of the bathroom and has sliding doors...well, it's supposed to have sliding doors. One of the doors was missing, allowing a nice chilly draft into the shower. The water splashes down onto the marble floor and all over the bidet. The drain is also slow. I went to the front desk and told them that my shower was missing a door, as this was the straw that broke the camel's back. The management seemed to have no problem with it and they were dismissive about a missing door on the shower. I told them that water was all over the ground and they said that housekeeping cleans all that. I think they were saying that the door wasn't supposed to be there, which kinda made me feel like they were saying I was dumb. I just kinda waived it off and started writing this review.

From the outside, the hotel is nothing to look at.... and from the inside it's still no palace. But the rooms are well equiped and clean. The beds were nice, the bathroom had a good shower, a comfy toilet, and for some reason a soundsystem that amplified the sound from the tv (presumably so that you could listen to a radio channel whilst showering). Just don't expect a very tasty and satisfying breakfast. The food at this hotel was pretty disgusting. The problems we had were with the staff. Twice in a row, the cleaning staff had left our door open. Not \"unlocked open\", literally open. When we complained with the staff at the desk, they blamed me for not closing the door properly. The next day it happened again. Both times our hotelroom door had stood open for at least half a day. Luckily, our room was in a small corridor on the groundfloor which almost no-one goes through, since it only leads to 3 rooms.

About the Hotel Santa Constanza - only B & B accommodation available, but breakfast very adequate, consisting of ham, cheese, bread rolls, quassants, fruit juice and coffee etc. Twin room and en-suite bathroom on first floor was a good size, clean and comfortable, but the wash basin had to be drained slowly or the waste water would rise from the centre drain cover in this 'wet-room' style bathroom. When we first arrived we were given a double bedroom on the 6th floor which was 'smelly', miserable and dark, but as we had booked a twin they swapped us to the 1st floor.

Leave the hotel and walk to the left for a few minutes and you will come across a friendly cafe where you can eat sandwiches cakes and beer. Further down the road is a McDonalds.

However, having decided on Rome, I found that the flight prices on easyjet had doubled and so I turned to Lastminute.com for a 'deal'. After hours of searching we decided on Hotel Costanza, three stars etc., the location seemed central and tube connections nearby. We flew in to Champino airport and met our pre-booked transfer (average cost of transfers \u00a335 each way, we paid \u00a390 for both to ensure a good service and booked in advance). The transfer time was around half an hour. Arriving at the hotel around 6pm, we were told there was 'big problem' we never really got to understand why, but we were told we would have to be transferred for the first night to an equivalent hotel. We were only there for three nights so packing and unpacking for one night was a nuisance. However the hotel agreed that a taxi would take us to our new hotel and collect us at 9am the following morning to drop our bags back at Costanza. The 'equivalent hotel' was okay but not as nice, no mini bar for cold drinks, no aircon, further from the tube and the room was much smaller but it was clean and dry so we go on with it. The following morning we waited patiently for the taxi, but none arrived and after half an hour we had to walk back to the original hotel. They apologised and we left our bags while we went exploring and they prepared the room. On the plus side, they allowed us to park our hired mopeds in their car park free of charge and left a complimentary bottle of champagne in our room. The location was good, a 10 minute walk down the long Via Aprille XXi road to the Bologna stop of the tube. Breakfast was reasonable - good by european standards and the staff were as helpful as could be with directions reservations etc. The room which ws apparently one of the better ones to compensate for our trouble, was large and clean but the bath plug didn't work so we couldn't soak after a long day sightseeing. The room was fully airconditioned and impeccably clean. Decent restauirants nearby and if you hire a moped everything is within 5 - 10 minutes ride.

We usually ate out in the city, but there are a few restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, including the San Marino pizzeria, which attracts the locals.

I suggest rooms in the back, preferably the larger corner rooms which are quiet , well lit, and larger than some others. The front rooms are very nice but tend to be noisy with the street traffic in the day. The Staff is the best I've EVER seen in Rome. Very friendly, polite, knowedgeable about the area, multilingual, and will help you with anything you need. Excellent housekeepers, spotless rooms. A charming breakfast room (although you non-Italians need to ask for capuchino from the white-jacketed waiter or be stuck with the terrible junk in the decanter, er, don't forget to leave him a time when you check out, about 1-2 Euro a day is nice for him and the housekeepers too). It does take 20 minutes to get downtown on the bus but generally you get a seat. The subway station is Bologna but is about 20 minutes walk to the hotel; but not bad without luggage. A grocery store down the street, newstand with English papers on the corner, a cool Lebanese restaurant (take a left before the grocery and bear right when the street splits). Lots of little places to eat at night. We booked early in low season and paid around 100Euros a night. Worth every cent. Would stay again.

The welcome on arrival was excellent, the receptionist spoke perfect english without asking we were given a map of the city and told were we could catch the bus into the city- very helpful. The bus stop is just around the corner and the service is frequent. There is also a metro station down the road from the hotel, which i would recommend to most. From the metro station (bolgna) you keep on the same road as the vialle xxi apprile exit and can not miss the hotel, it is about 5-10 minute walk, which we did not find too hard even with a heavy suitcase. Although if you do struggle walking generally a taxi may be useful or getting on the bus. Location rise I think it is an excellent choice, away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre but definitely close enough to get to all the sights without too long a journey. The bus takes you to the centre of Rome in less than 10 minutes- if that. The hotel room was nice enough as was the bathroom, although both were not large they were more than adequate. Our room did have air conditioning. The breakfast was nice enough you could eat as much as you want, the ice dusted croisants come highly recommended.

The walk from Bologna Metro Station could be a bit far, try taking the bus, it'd take you directly to the terminal. The area seemed generally safe, I walked every night from the Metro around midnight and didn't see anything suspicious. One nice thing is that it's away from the tourist trap, you can actually pick up a few snacks from a local and reasonably priced grocery/ drug store down the street.

No subway after 930pm to Bologna. all buses routed through termini which was always a bit of a hassle and very busy. very disappointed with the cleanliness of the city itself, alot of graffiti and litter everywhere, luckily hotel was different. very little open on Sunday near the hotel, bit of a ghost town.", "Date": "July 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, England", "Title": "\u201cCould be better\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3660651", "Content": "My husband and I went to Rome for our 3 month wedding anniversary. I researched deals and thought this hotel looked decent enough. Well, if you want to be in the centre of things, do not choose this hotel. We had to take the metro and walk forever to find the hotel the first night. And when we were hungry at 9pm there were no restaurants open or even around the area, very disappointing! We ended up finding a McDonald's and laughed about our lack of Italian food that first night. The hotel was decent enough, nice lobby and breakfast room with a basic choice of food. Don't be deceived by the pictures of the rooms however. I found our room very small, and while it had a huge balcony to walk out on, we never got to enjoy it because it rained most of the time we were there, which of course can't be blamed on the hotel! But we were kept awake by people from the room above us, hence very thin floors/walls. The other odd thing were these dark green shutters on the windows which you could use to shut out any light from outside, but the annoying thing was the noise it made when you went to close them, and the fact that you could hear people from other rooms closing their shutters too!! Despite the hotel being away from the centre of town, we also heard scooters beeping at each other all night. We went for a nice relaxing holiday but found we did not get much peaceful sleep.
