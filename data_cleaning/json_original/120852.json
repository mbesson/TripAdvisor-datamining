It was only a block away to get to Bourbon Street but the noise level never hit the hotel. The hotel is tended to as you would expect a Ritz hotel to be. The conversion from a department store to a hotel would never be guessed at; although the elevator switching stands out as the hotel not being the original occupant of the space. The elevator's were not a big deal to us as we are used to different elevator banks for specific floors for work, etc. But, if you are staying with family or friends and they are in a different area I could see how that could be frustrating. We stayed in the Club level and it was worth every penny. I highly recommend it to anyone who would enjoy light-fare being available any time (in-between hours they offer light snacks, etc.) and would like to start or end their touring with a drink (or more; they do not limit you) in the Club lounge. Drinks consisted of offerings of three selections of red and three selections of white, Champagne, a number of beer selections, mixed drinks made to order, and all the expected dessert wines. The food selection varied day by day, but there was always enough for my husband and I to find that we never needed a formal breakfast, etc. The Club lounge is beautiful and offers seating for everyone's style from quiet tables to large overstuffed chairs. The staff there was incredible and very attentive. Foster was extremely helpful with dinner reservations and suggestions. He also makes a signature drink that we highly recommend you ask him about if he is on the floor during your visit. Somewhere along the course of our stay he asked about why we were visiting NOLA and we mentioned it was our anniversary. That night he had sent Chocolate Covered Strawberries to our room with his compliments which was a lovey touch. Overall, the hotel was a wonderful haven from the hustle and bustle of the city during our stay.

With few exceptions, you can count on a Ritz Carlton to be elegant, clean and luxurious, with an attentive staff providing top-notch service.

During my most recent stay, my room was nothing special, lacking even a decent view. I have, however, stayed in suites at this hotel and they were nothing short of spectacular. The beds are always comfortable, the room decor consistent with the rest of the hotel, and spacious bathrooms. For Marriott Platinum members, internet service is free, otherwise, it is $12.95 a day. The hotel has an excellent fitness center open 24 hours with numerous cardio machines and a separate weight room. The hotel has a great location - right on Canal Street, on the French Quarter side. You are easily within walking distance to Bourbon Street and all the attractions of the Quarter. Additionally, there is a street car stop directly across from the hotel, as well as the Canal Street shopping and business district. The hotel also has valet parking, which is not a guarantee in New Orleans. The hotel's bar is quite popular, particularly on weekend nights. It makes the elevators crowded, the wait at valet longer and perhaps most annoying--the inebriated guests and bar patrons being loud and obnoxious in the lobby as well as the hallways of the guest floors.

I think we made the perfect choice. PROS: 1. Location is fantastic. If you head out the back entrance you are a block from Bourbon street, yet when you return home you feel a world away, which is fantastic when you see how seedy some elements along Bourbon street are (FYI I felt safe the entire trip and walked around on my own). 2. Rooms, I thought they were great. Our bed was comfy, our room was well decorated. The bathroom, though not huge, was tasteful, and separate door for comode from the rest of the bathroom, which I liked. 3. Service, the conceirge was helpful, when I asked for guidance on two occasions I got knowledgeable, professional advice, without the condescending air some concierges have. Bellhop was friendly and helpful. I like turn down service, bring me little chocolates and bedside slippers and I'm a happy camper. Check in & check out were a breeze. 4. Crowd, pretty upscale people (I know, snobby, but New Orleans is a mixed bag my friends--part of the charm but nice to have a break from the \"charming\"). I saw a few NBA players from Houston in the lobby...funny how they stand out. 5. Cost, we found the rates for our dates more than affordable, given the caliber of the hotel 6. Gym, it's pretty darn nice for a hotel, they have the cardio room with individual TVs on the machines, a weight room, and a Yoga stretch room with weights, medicine balls and cool yoga mats. I spent like an hour doing yoga by myself, uninterrupted. fun. CONS: 1. Noise, our room faced Canal street and I didn't hear regular traffic but the first night I heard several sets of sirens from emergency vehicles. My husband never woke, and I didn't hear it subsequent nights. Perhaps a courtyard room would be quiter. 2. Pool, only indoor lap pool and jacuzzi. For such a hot climate, a nice pool scene could be fun. Tips 1. We traveled in January. I'm from San Diego and packed for San Diego winter. It was 75 degrees and 97% humidity. I made use of the Shops at Canal (Athropologie, Saks 5th Avenue, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor...I missed you JCREW coming FEb 2012). I wish I had brought one warm weather outfit \"Just in case\"...learn from my mistake. 2. Men bring sports coats, for restaurants like Galatoire's and Commander's Palace, where you'll stick out without one. (By the way, we enjoyed Galatoire's, Commander's Palace was disappointing to us). 3. St Charles Streetcar $1.25 one way, or $3 all day pass, need exact change, the pick up stop at Lady Footlocker on Canal about a block away. I had a Garden District walking tour in the travel book from the library and it gave history on homes in the area (ie Ann Rice's former home, Jefferson Davis' home, etc). Great city to visit.

Prior to even arriving, we had some issues that were popping up around our reservation and we never received a call back from the hotel desk staff after several attempts to get help. Upon arrival, we found no doormen or anyone waiting for us. It took us several tries to find the reception area and, when we did, there were no notes in our file about any prior conversations we had with the hotel. Our room was fine - clean and comfortable - but nothing special. I had to work all day Friday so I had two meals via room service. The first, breakfast, was excellent - piping hot and fresh. The second, lunch, was meager and disappointing. The room service staff, though, was quite prompt and friendly. After an extremely loud evening where we heard raucous bachelor and bachelorette parties raging on until all hours, my wife and my mother went down to talk to someone at the front desk. We finally spoke to someone who was interested in our situation, Jerry, who apologized profusely and moved us over to the club level. AH! This is where the Ritz-Carlton was. We finally realized that we were initially put in the equivalent of a Marriott. You have to be on the club level in a totally different area of the hotel to get the Ritz experience. Everyone in the club area including the desk staff were wonderful. The rooms were beautiful with hardwood floors, amazing bathrooms, and canopy beds. When Jerry found out we were celebrating two birthdays, he had treats sent up to our rooms. We appreciated Jerry doing his best to make our stay better. In the end, the hotel is well-located and more affordable than the typical Ritz. Several employees were trying to make the experience pleasant and others seemed to not care. The hotel is definitely average if you are used to excellent R-C treatment. We would stay there again if the price were to be right, but will definitely look for other alternatives on special occasions. Several of my family members travel for work and host conferences/events in hotels all of the time.

The in-room internet (wi-fi and/or wired) is fairly slow, and they charge you for it. Free wi-fi should be standard at nice hotels in my opinion.

Despite working double shifts over the holidays, he maintained an amazing spirit and really did make all the difference. Thank you Will!!

Particularly helpful and great were Kimberly, Janice, and Foster. Great staff, really worked hard to accommodate us. They really tried hard in the club level lounge to accommodate food and drink requests. But wow, the the rest of the hotel... a disaster. In fact, they should never call that a ritz-carlton.The one thing they did that was positive was an upgrade to club level for the night i had a regular room. But from there it became a disaster, and considering two nights I was paying the high rate of $619 a night, it was inexcusable. Rooms- club level had nice furnishings, but dark and sleeping area small for the price. Also inner courtyard ones are really dark, and a large commode blocks one of the two windows making it even darker and smaller. They need to just have a tV stand like in the regular rooms. Also they say courtyard room is quieter, but the push-bar on the door out into the hallway was very loud every time anyone came in our out. M Bistro- made reservations for 7:30. Most people were already seated (you can listen to jazz in davenport Lounge which is a plus). waited for a hostess for 10 minutes. Another 15 for the menu (so glad jazz was playing). The waitress eventually took our order that included one appetizer. An hour and ten minutes, I had to waive her down to ask the whereabouts of the appetizer... she apologized, went to the kitchen, then went about her business without coming up to us. Another 10 minutes we got up and left. The entire time the hostess was at her desk once. i came up there one time, nobody ever appeared. when we left, nobody was at the host stand to inform that we were leaving... Management - that's the worst part. I told the front desk that we walked out on the restaurant. he told me the manager will call, not a word. The next day our room was not cleaned until I had to find a supervisor, at 5:30 pm... I told one of the club level supervisors about my troubles and they again said they talekd to a manager, Jonathan Hall, and he'd call me back. never did. Then the room key got cut off, so we had to walk to another part of the hotel to reception to get to club level. i demanded to see the manager this time. He walked out from the direction of the bar. Listened, didn't apologize, nothing. Just walked me to the room to make sure the keys worked. (they did, but got cut off again the next day). some lady at the bar was motioning to him as we walked past (I was in front, so she didn't realize we were walking together), but he signed to her not to interrupt. And yet i couldn't get him to call me back after 2 requests. Neither did he bother to apologize for the service at the restaurant. i never saw or heard from another manager or him again. Cell/Internet - There is virtually no cell phone reception in the rooms on club level 4, yet they charge internet fees. front desk said even the lounge had a fee, which turned out to be wrong. at check out i had a question about the charge, nobody could help. In fact, since i had two reservations, they said they only see one reservation up in the club level and thought conversation was over until i insisted... eventually club level offered me two massages (I get $100 credit from Amex, but that would've not quite covered one massage), so I was grateful for that. But management downstairs did nothing. not sorry, not anything. And when I got back i learned that they dared charge me for my drink at teh bar and wouldn't credit it back. The crowd- I have never seen so many loud, ill-bred people. In the library room - shouting (Mark from Gainesville, your relatives who were in NOLA on 12/30 hate your fiancee so much I got to hear all of it from another room of the club lounge). Two ladies in the relaxation room were also discussing men at the top of their lungs before my massage, and were still at it an hour later. as i was checking out at the club level one-person counter a man walked up, pushed me to the side and plopped himself in front of the front desk person i was talking to. he stood there the entire time we discussed my bill, listening to every detail!!!!! right there. The hotel staff are too scared to say anything to the guests. But all in all, they all deserve each other.

I had caused a work conference to be held here and it went very well. I had stayed here on other times for business and it was excellent. This trip, we decided to bring our toddler and stay for 5 nights. We almost decided to stay instead at the Windsor Court because their renovation was now finished. We made a very bad decision to stay at the Ritz. The problems began at check-in and did not end until we checked out. Check in. Our trip in was long because of weather delays and we were checking in at 7:30 pm. We had requested with our reservation that a crib be in our room when we arrived for we knew we might have a cranky toddler with us. We confirmed our request with the hotel before our arrival. When we checked in, we confirmed at the front desk that the crib would be there. He assured us that it was there but if for some reason it were not, he would have the crib brought to the room within 5 minutes. The crib was not in the room. We call immediately, for our toddler was very tired. Our luggage finally arrives 20 minutes later. It had somehow gotten delayed coming to our room from the valet. Still no crib. The bellman calls housekeeping. 20 minutes later again no crib. I return to the front desk and beg for a crib. The same person who checked me in and calls housekeeping and they tell him that they would be bringing it now. The front desk attendant was very annoyed that I returned to the front desk to ask for the crib but after 45 minutes of waiting I was unsure what else I could do. The Ritz also explains that they offer housekeeping two times per day and lists the hour. Again because of our toddler who goes to bed early, we called and asked housekeeping to complete the second service before 6:30pm to avoid any conflicts. At 7pm, we call housekeeping because they have not arrived. They say they will be there in five minutes. At 7:20, we call again, they say they will be there in 5 minutes. By 7:40, I say it is too late to come for we have to put our baby to sleep. We will make do with the towels that we have. I explain that I was putting the DND/privacy sign on the door and please do come to our room for I do not want the baby to wake up. At 8pm, housekeeping comes, bangs on the door and wakes up our baby. I cannot understand how housekeeping could have done this when I requested that they not and we have the DND sign on the door. We finally get our toddler down to sleep at 8:20. At 8:25, housekeeping calls the room. Again they wake up the baby. I tell them that I cannot believe they would call when I told them that I did not want to be disturbed. We finally put the baby down again after 15 minutes of crying. But housekeeping calls again at 8:45 and wakes him up again. At this point, I am beside myself that we are being so harassed by housekeeping that I go to the front desk to speak to a manager. He listens to the story that I just told, apologizes and asks when I want housekeeping to come every night for the remainder of my stay. I say 6pm. Well, housekeeping does not come by 6pm any of our five nights and I have to call every night to request additional service. None of this would be a big deal but for the fact we had a toddler who goes to sleep early. Also housekeeping during our stay was very inconsistent in quality. The maid the evening of the 30th was top notch but the others were not. They randomly took it upon themselves to move our belongings and place them in drawers throughout the suite. It was baffling to us what they had done until we started opening up drawers. Also, while they say they change linens every 2 nights unless requested otherwise, they did not honor their own rules. We requested otherwise for linens to be changed daily, but instead they changed the sheets only once during our five night stay. Also, during visits, they did not always leave us with a full supply of towels. One evening we were told that the hotel had ran out of hand towels and none were available. That seemed very odd. Also, the housekeepers did not always replace the empty bottles of shampoo and conditioner. The hotel provides a list of babysitting services but they are rightfully careful to point out they are not recommending the services. We used two services on the list.. One service was great but it was not available all the nights we wanted, so we used another service on the list. While we confirmed twice, the sitter from the second service was a no-show. We missed our Commander's Palace reservation. So, we decided to order room service. We order soup, salad and pizza. They said it would take 45 minutes. It took over 2 hours and 15 minutes to arrive and the pizza was cold on arrival. We called to check on our order, after about 90 minutes and they assured us, it would arrive right away. Luckily, room service agreed to comp the meal because we had waited so long. We booked under the Amex platinum program which includes breakfast. When reviewing my bill, I noticed a restaurant charge appeared which was incorrect. I go to the front desk to rectify the issue, and the person there really seemed to lack the essential skills to work at the reception desk. She initially disagreed with me that the charge was on the bill, although I showed her a copy of the express checkout invoice where it appeared. She then said that it was for breakfast. I told her that under the program, I pay only tip and tax, as the bill reflected for other days. She disagreed but eventually understood how the Amex program worked and agreed with me. She then said that I must have eaten breakfast twice on one day. I assured that I had not. She then pulls the invoices and tells me that I was charged twice for the same breakfast but she was only going to charge me for one. This whole process that should have taken 2 minutes to resolve took 15 minutes. Sadly, another guest was at the front desk with the same problem but far worse. It is astonishing that the Ritz front desk personnel do not understand the program. She then asked me how my stay had been. I told her very disappointing and that I had regretted my decision to stay at the Ritz. She said only have a nice day and asked no questions. We were a little concerned ahead of our arrival dealing with the concierge. It was very difficult to communicate with them in a way they could understand to make restaurant reservations. We asked for dinner reservations for 5 nights and gave them a list of restaurants from which to choose. To make a long story short, our request was misunderstood and took several emails to get it worked out. While these service experiences with housekeeping, room service and the front desk ruined the trip for my wife and me, there is much to the hotel to be commended. The room itself was beautiful. We booked and received an executive suite, The room was excellent in every way. Wonderful bed, nice bath, great furnishings, quiet opening to courtyard. The covered valet area is so nice. The location of the hotel is perfect. The restaurant staff could not have been nicer. They went above and beyond. They were truly exceptional. The breakfast buffet was great. High tea was great. The lounge food and drinks were great. The setting was excellent. There are steps everywhere with no ramps. I'm unsure how the hotel believes it complies with the ADA. There is locked door to use a lift that requires a key but there was no one who would open it for us. We are not disabled, but it was very difficult navigating the stairs with a stroller and the Ritz employees rarely offered to help with the exception of one male employee who always offered to help. The day concierge was great in suggesting day outings for us. They could not have been nicer or more helpful to us. The valet service was excellent. In fact, upon checking out, he asked how our stay was, and I told him not very good. He said, oh now, what did we do wrong with the car. I said, it had nothing to do with valet services which had been great. Rather, it related solely to housekeeping, room service and the front desk. He asked if a manger had spoken to me at checkout. I said no. I told him that the front desk clerk could have cared less whether our stay went well. He was horrified, and took our contact information and promised we would hear from the Ritz. If everyone at the Ritz was of the quality of the valet guest services person who was so wonderful to us at the end, none of these problems would have happened. Bottom line-- the repeated service snafus ruined our trip. The hotel would have been fine if we did not have our child with us and we traveled many years before he came along. Now, we need a hotel who can provide sufficient service to make traveling with a toddler something short of a nightmare. I give the Ritz extremely low marks and would discourage any family with a young child from staying here. The Ritz management at this hotel runs the risk of ruining a beautiful property by letting such service standards exist. I hope the Ritz management decides it wants to provide quality service, for they should not be allowed to ruin such a fabulous property.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hinsdale", "Title": "\u201cThe Ritz?

We did not eat in the hotel restaurants, but ate in the many excellent restaurants in & near the French Quarter. After assigning us to the 3rd Floor facing Canal street, thanks to other reviewers' suggestions on here, we requested higher floor & away from the street, we got 2 rooms on the 10th floor, however, got views to AC equip on the roof, but it was very quiet. Although public spaces are outstanding, Rooms are just OK, didn't feel as luxurious for the price. Front desk, concierge, & bell desk personnel are average, not as friendly as expected, esp from the Ritz. Maid service were outstanding. We had 2 issues that were troubling, unacceptable for when staying at the Ritz. 1. We forgot a folder of paperwork in our car after dropping off at valet. We had to call down 3 times, personally came down to talk to concierge, who sent us over to the bell desk, who had to go back to concierge to no solution. Next day we called service manager who stated that it will be delivered to our room. Later in the day, still no folder. We sent our daughter down to concierge desk to finally picked up folder. So much aggravation for such a simple task. 2, I used hot tub by myself at 9:30pm Sat night by myself. Excellent experience. Brought entire family back to use hot tub at same time, 9:30pm, Sun night. But it was closed/locked. Staff would not open/allow us to use, said it was closed because the spa was closed, even though it was located in between the 2 fitness center rooms, which is open 24 hours. Our high school & college age kids wondered why was the small pool & hot tub run/operated by the spa, while they can be just as likely to be injured in the unsupervised 24 hour fitness center, without a hotel phone, & esp when it's located away from the main hotel premises. 3. One small complaint was that on Sunday morning, hotel had dozens of NY Times newspapers avail, but no local New Orleans newspaper. Overall, it was an decent stay.

We had a couples massage and we both came away very refreshed and relaxed.

We have stayed in about half of the Ritz Carlton properties and this one does not even compare to Ritz Carlton's in Atlanta, Palm Beach, Boston or New York. The property is visually nice, and conveniently located, but is starting to show wear and tear. We felt that the biggest disappointment was the lack of attention to details and customer service. Upon check in...nobody knew our name, a Ritz Carlton trademark in almost all locations. We were never greeted by name or recognized in any way. The gentleman that checked us in gave us inaccurate information regarding our room, stating that we had a view of the downtown when we had a view of the building and inner courtyard. The room was large with two queen size beds which is always a plus with a family. The concierge was very nice via e-mail and set us up with dinner and brunch and tour reservations, but never followed up upon our arrival. In addition, all the recommendations were just average. We had dinner at Pelican Club and the service and food was just okay. We had brunch at Mr. B's and the jazz was almost non existent and the food awful ( stay away). The VIP tour was a two hour bus ride with a walk through a graveyard. No other tour options were presented to us via email so we assumed that this was a great quick overview. Wrong, don't waste your time! The best things we did in New Orleans (this was our second trip) were things we picked out on our own. The World War ll Museum is not to be missed! The concierge did not mention that one at all! The Jazz at the hotel was as good if not better than the places we were sent, so start there if you are looking for music and dancing, as you should be in New Orleans. The spa was the other great disappointment. We just came back from the Ritz Carlton Cancun and that was a first class spa, as is The Ritz Carlton Palm Beach. My hair appointment with Kim was excellent, but the actual spa services were average at best as are the accommodations. The tranquility room was without any special seating or hot neck rings or warm blankets. The magazines were months old and the massage( a special cafe ole massage, not only had no special aroma, but was just mediocre). The main reason that we booked this hotel and not the JW was because the spa was so highly rated. I am telling you, I go to a lot of world class spas, and this was not in the big leagues. The worst part about the averageness of the hotel, was that management did not seem to care when we spoke up about some of these issues. If you enjoy staying in Marriott Hotels, which we do, this is a fine hotel. However, it is a Ritz Carlton and it needs to outshine it's sister hotels as it does in most major cities. We would never stay here again, there are too many other interesting properties in New Orleans to bother with one that lost it's lustre.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cThis is kind of funny.........\u201d", "Author": "Sally G", "ReviewID": "UR121369726", "Content": "We didn't stay at the Ritz-Carlton but we did meet a friend there for brunch and ended up having Thanksgiving dinner there in the restaurant.

Great experience from start to finish. We had a group attending for a long weekend and there was a last minute problem with getting a couple of the suites we had reserved.

They had everything done before anyone even checked in. Fantastic fix to the problem and the proactiveness in providing a solution was very much appreciated. All of our party was extremely happy with the service and rooms. I will say that if you are staying in the Club Level (they actually call is something entirely different - Maison Orleans) get a porter...if you do not you will be mightily lost. Maison Orleans is basically a cozy little boutique hotel within the immensity of the Ritz Carlton. No less that three elevators are required to get to your room from the valet stand. There is a private entrance along Iberville where you can avoid going through the whole hotel...but you figure that out later. Check in was warm and welcoming, the room was beautiful with hardwood floors and a canopied bed. It also had fantastic views of the french quarter roofs, the St. Louis Cathedral, and the River. Could not ask for more. We were very near the elevators which worried me, but I didn't hear a thing from the hallway or the elevators. The food, service and drinks in the club lounge were lovely and while the hotel tries to maintain some sort of dress code for the lounge I was a bit put off by the assorted flip flops and tank tops wandering through (this was on the men) acting a bit like it was a frat house. The rooms in the lounge were far too elegant for these guys. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't stuffy, I just enjoyed a little less drunken revelry in the lounge than what was going on two blocks away on Bourbon. Not that big a deal. Anyway, the staff in the lounge were amazing, engaging and full of helpful information. They even retrieved the 6 hours new iPhone I was foolish enough to leave there as we took off for dinner. I am extremely grateful for that! I could go on and on, but basically this place was pretty near perfect on every front.

Upon arrival we were enveloped by the luscious scent of gardenia floating through the air and the staff instantly welcomed us with their Southern hospitality. We came in pretty early on a Friday morning and figured we would drop our luggage off until our room was ready so we could walk around and explore. Much to our delight we found our room was ready and we were quickly and smoothly checked in, before 11am. We were a little worried about the room after reading some other reviews. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find a clean, very spacious and well appointed room with large windows overlooking New Orleans. The bathroom had a separate toilet area which was great for 3 girls! \u00c2\u00a0The products in the bathroom were not lacking either, they provide q-tips, cotton swabs, makeup remover, mouthwash, shower cap and shower gel, in addition to the typical shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The room did not have a coffee maker. When we called to inquire about this they said it did not come standard in the rooms but that they would be happy to bring one up, complimentary of course! The coffee maker arrived immediately and was delivered in a beautiful wooden box made specially for the coffee maker, these are the details that I would expect from a Ritz, delivered. The staff was phenomenal and treated us very well. The concierge was spot on with dining recommendations which were always fantastic. The lobby and lounging areas were really relaxing and serene and there was plenty of space to find a quiet spot alone or to enjoy a coffee or drink with friends. The only complaint we had was the Internet in the business center which was ridiculously overcharged at around $8 for 15 minutes and a dollar a page to print. The free wireless in the lobby was so slow it was excruciating, and we were never able to hook up to the wifi in our \u00c2\u00a0room because it just wouldn't work. In addition while we did not receive services at the spa we did check it and the fitness center/pool/hot tub area out. The entire spa and fitness center area was very nice. It had small details one would expect and appreciate such as cold cucumber infused hand towels for refreshment and revitalization as well as calming music. The fitness center was pretty big for a hotel in New Orleans where space is a premium. After our cruise when we returned to New Orleans and had a few hours to kill, they let us keep our bags at the Ritz while we made a last trip to the French quarter. This is the kind of thing that is well above and beyond and will not be forgotten. All three of us agreed that this hotel was well worth the price (which by the way was actually quite reasonable and comparable to much lesser hotels in the area) and if any of us return to New Orleans, we all agreed we would be returning to the Ritz Tip: checkout Bloody Marys Tours for a great time while you are in New Orleans!", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAnother great Ritz experience\u201d", "Author": "Ticder", "ReviewID": "UR118483952", "Content": "Wonderful customer service!

Close enough to walk to everything, yet far enough away so you won't be distracted by noise. The lobby is a flight up from the street level and actually not easy to find. Getting to the club level from the lobby is another hike. The main restaurant was just average, in my mind. We ate lunch there twice and were not impressed either time. Very unusual for a Ritz. Service was slow and a burger was prepared so poorly one time, the staff comped it. Speaking of the staff, all were fantastic and had a \"Let's make it special\" attitude. We did not drink at the main bar, as the club level has drinks included. The rooms were nice, but smaller than most Ritz Carltons I've stayed at. Now on to the Club/Concierge Level. I cannot say enough about the pampering, service, food, friendship of the staff. It was quite clearly the most wonderful hotel experience of my life. From pouring drinks, to making dinner and tour reservations and offering suggestions for spa treatments, the ladies and gentlemen of the club level rocked our universe.

The hotel is right on Canal Street and in a great location \"within\" the French Quarter but also very close to the Central Business District. I was about 7.5 months pregnant, so although we booked a room with double beds we asked once we got there if they could put us in a room with a king or even queen bed, which they immediately said was not possible - I would guess it was because we were staying for 5 nights and they didn't want to give up a premium room. They said they were totally booked, but we rarely saw a single person coming out of a hotel room or out of the elevator... so I'm guessing they were not booked. A double bed is tight for two people. The rooms and hotel lobby were gorgeously appointed, and we also really liked the courtyard, though the chairs were very hard to move and were not very comfortable in the courtyard. It also seemed like the place guests went to smoke, there was rarely anyone there who wasn't smoking. The hotel was able to get us into our room early, as we had arrived at around 11 AM and just had to grab some lunch before our room was ready. They asked us if we wanted to switch rooms halfway through our trip, which was awkward--we declined--because they were remodeling in our wing and said it might be noisy. We didn't notice any noise, but we did notice our wing was fairly empty. We did make one complaint about housekeeping, and it was immediately resolved and the housekeeping staff brought a plate of cookies and called to make sure we were satisfied, which was nice. Water was always well stocked in our room and the room itself was well cleaned always. The bathrooms are really gorgeous and comfortable, and there is a separate enclosure for the toilet, which is an amenity I loved. The website says there is no pool, but there is a pool! It is a small pool and it's not for swimming laps or anything, but there is a switch to turn on a resistance wave if you are interested in exercising. However, it would have been nice to know that you can use the pool without the resistance switch turned on if you're just looking to cool off, and there is also a hot tub. Adjoining the pool is a terrific exercise room too! I hadn't stayed at a Ritz Carlton before, and I would say my expectations were partially met. It was a beautiful place, but the service could use a little bit of improvement. That being said, they responded well to the minor complaint we had and I would go back. If there was any lack of excellence it would be in service--they responded great once there was a problem, but the minor problems shouldn't have really existed in the first place... if you're the Ritz Carlton.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mandeville, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cA mess\u201d", "Author": "DeniseRagan", "ReviewID": "UR118009598", "Content": "Once again we gave the Ritz Carlton a chance BUT it proved that it will never be as impressive at the other RC's we have stayed in.

My husband and I came to NOLA to celebrate another year of putting up with each other. I initially booked the Royal Sonesta but when I thought I'd be doing a solo trip I changed my plans to the Ritz.

I booked a regular room at the AAA rate but when we early-checked in were told we'd gotten a free upgrade to the Executive Suite. SERIOUSLY?? This was too good to be true! The room was not quite ready so we left for lunch. The whole time I'm thinking is the ES really a full-fledged suite? I had my doubts all through lunch thinking this is too good to be true. We returned to the hotel an hour later at 1 p.m. and the rooms were ready. I confirmed that we'd be getting a suite at the regular room rate. It was confirmed. We opened the door to the suite and we almost fell out. How BEAUTIFUL! There's an entrance way. Off the entrance is a half bath. Then you walk into this huge living room with a huge picture window looking right down on Canal St. Connected by French doors was the huge bedroom and connected to that was the spacious bathroom with a glass enclosed shower, a second shower & deep bath tub, 2 vanity sinks and a separate room for the commode with a phone on the wall, and all of this enclosed in marble. I still could not believe our luck so while in the commode room I called the front desk and confirmed that I would pay the rate for the regular room. Once I got this third confirmation the celebration was on. The suite has 2 flat screens, mini bar, desk, chaise lounge, sofa and wing chairs, coffee pot w/accessories and an amazing gardenia fresh scent. Spotlessly clean with turndown service and towel changes twice daily. The bed was heavenly with big fluffy pillows. I requested feather pillows. Once we came into the room and the ice bucket had been filled for us after we'd been partying. I always looked forward to returning to the hotel where we were greeted by wonderful gardenia scented candles in the foyer. I had to buy one for the house in their signature store.

I was very disappointed. First, on every instance I interacted with the staff, they called me Ms. Jones, rather than Dr. Jones. I thought the staff at the Ritz would be a little more attentive to detail. The hotel was large and beautifully decorated, and well located. There were these candles in the lobby area with what I guessed to be their signature scent, which were pleasant at first, then seemed to become too cloying. The room was average in size, it was fine, nicely decorated. Bed and pillows were great. When I first arrived at the room, there was this housekeeper there who was bringing in a mini refirgerator. I am not sure why. She plugged it in next to the bed and I found the whole scene to be very curious. I had to wait for her to finish before I could come into the room and put my things down, as she was in the way. On the morning after the first night, I had gotten up very early to attend a conference....and the hairdryer was not working. I called housekeeping to request another hairdryer. Fifteen minutes later I called housekeeping again. I had to leave to catch the shuttle to the conference, WITH A WET HEAD. I stopped at the front desk to point this out, and they just gave excuses (We were looking for an empty room that had another haridryer, Ms. Jones). Since I had to get up very early and leave by 6:30 every morning, I placed the completed breakfast menu card outside my door in the evenings. Every single day, the menu card was not replaced, so I had to stop by the front desk and ask for one. Every day. Stupid. Since this was a business trip, I really just wanted a nice place to stay and did not expect to have to ask for this and that repeatedly. I noticed a long hair in the bathtub, which could have been mine. It was there for three days, which means that they did not clean the bathtub daily. To top it all off, I have a milk allergy. I advised the front desk of this when I checked in, and wrote it on the breakfast menu card every time. On my last morning, room service called me at the time the breakfast should have been delivered to tell me that they make their oatmeal with milk, Ms. Jones. This was the third time that week that I had had the oatmeal. Apparently it did not cross their minds on this occasion, to make a bowl of oatmeal with water instead of milk. Absolutely stupid. And I had to wait for the breakfast, which was now late, and hardly got to eat it as I had to be out of the room and catch my shuttle to the conference. The atmosphere was very relaxed, almost too relaxed (maybe it is a New Orleans thing). At one point I was passing through the lobby and the people behind the front desk were joking around, almost knee-slapping. I must say that they did refund one nights' stay after I complained on check out. I really would have preferred to have had better service as I was willing and planning to pay for the full week. My conference was very intense and I wished that I did not have to contact housekeeping and the front of the house so much (would rather not at all, really). I had had dinner one night at one of the nearby W hotels, and I felt more welcomed there than at this hotel.

The best part was there was a door to that little hallway and, when I went to sleep, I would close that exterior door. I slept until 10 am one day as you could not even hear the housekeeping staff with that door closed. The other room in the alcove was occupied at least one night as I noticed a privacy sign on their door, but I never heard a peep from that room. Room 751 also had a great view of the Mississippi, which was a bonus for me. A very spacious room as well. I would highly recommend requesting this room. I paid only $119 per night, but it was the low season. Housekeeping staff was exceptional at this hotel; bringing ice, chocolates, and extra bottles of water all for free, along with keeping the room spotlessly clean. Some minor downsides to this facility: saw a cockroach in the atrium on two different occasions; no slippers; no coffee in the room and they charge $12 for two cups of coffee from room service; and two different elevators in two different locations to get out to the street or to the motor court. A major upside to this hotel though was the friendly and helpful staff encountered throughout the facility.

Fortunately the girl who checked us in immediately resolved the problem and moved us to another level. The club lounge had a nice display of food and wine and champagne for self service, while beer and cocktails were to be ordered and served. One time in our 5 day stay did anyone manning that lounge ever ask us if we would like to order a drink. One time I walked up to an attendant and asked her if I could order a drink and she said sure but was in middle of setting up dessert. When she finished, even though we were sitting 10 feet away, she never came and took our drink order. Not quite satisfied that the money we spent on club level was worth the frustration.

All to please the children and ruin our vacation in the meantime! This was certainly not what we had in mind when we booked at the Ritz, and we do truly resent being made to feel like second class guests just because we were traveling with our children -- especially since their company goes out of its way to make it appear that their properties are family-friendly.

I work hard and love to party, and was excited to take a few days off from a trip to NYC to head to New Orleans for great food, music, and some of the most genuine, friendly people you'll ever meet. The City delivered on all three; it's a wonderful place and my only regret is that I'm not able to return to that wonderful city more often. The Ritz Carleton brand, has always had a storied reputation among Les Grandes Dames of the hotel world - Ritz Place Vendome is beyond awesome (with a price tag to match). I've stayed at a few other Ritz locations in the US and Middle East though, and they always felt like tarted up 4 stars. The Ritz New Orleans fell to the bottom of the later characterization. She's an old showgirl, tired and worn, the pain from her massive bunions becoming unbearable as her old routine teeters on, turning to progressively down market crowds in her efforts to make a buck. Enough of the rambling analogies, I know New Orleans is a City where there are no open container laws and even this \"sophisticated gentlemen\" could be seen bouncing down Bourbon with a 'hand grenade', but in the Ritz I had the pleasure of finding discarded cans of beer in the halls, in the elevators, in the lobby. Not cool guys, this isn't Animal House. The Hotel that week was hosting a convention of, I believe, Gift Fruit store owners, distributors, and suppliers. Not the crowd I normally hang with but very nice, hard working people who I'm sure contribute to an important part of the American economy. However... but there's something about wading through crowds of half-price conventioners every time I walk through the lobby on my way up from or to my $400/ night hotel room that detracts from the whole experience. I know there's not always going to be a gift fruit convention, but clearly they're working the convention crowd angle, which is fine, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the Holiday Inn. The concierge and hotel management were terrible. So bad, in fact, that just thinking about my experience with them makes me want to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbazooka-puke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 all over my keyboard. Intrusive, disruptive, going so far as to suggest I find another hotel when I strongly objected to being disturbed four times in the course of an hour over a mix-up on check out times. Common' really - just apologize and stop knocking on my door when I'm sleeping; it's that easy. (\"Greg, what is the worst fraternity on this campus?\") The room was large, but nondescript, the view was of a parking lot, the entire experience lacked any trace of either elegance of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccool factor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The lobby was nice, but not overwhelming; the marble on the stairs from the front entrance is chipped; the door men were very nice, but seem to be part time employees because they were never there. The only positive aspect was the location, right on the edge of the French Quarter, close enough to be on top of the action, far enough not to be stuck in it. Overall, if you get a half-price room, maybe $200 or less a night, then go for it- you can't beat the location. If you're in town for a leisurely trip and looking for a more genuine New Orleans feel, with pleasant staff and real style, then go somewhere else.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cRCNOLA met and sometimes exceeded our Expectations\u201d", "Author": "Bigger32", "ReviewID": "UR95186587", "Content": "We stayed on the Club Level. Very nice! Elegant and private, with separate entrance from the rest of the hotel guests. Food was excellent on club level, but, we stayed for a week, and the repeated offering became somewhat tedious. But, food was abundant, and liquor and beverages, and snacks were endless. I really enjoyed the antiques, like the cheese cart, and the excellent gumbo. Our suite was one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, with fireplaces, canopied beds, and marble everywhere. While I do not expect things to always be brand new, I do expect them to be clean and not stained--the Ritz can do better in this department, especially at the rates they collect. We had Thanksgiving Brunch in the Main dining room on Thanksgiving Day--this was the most expensive brunch I have ever been to. I believe the bill was approaching $200 or more for 2. HOWEVER, it was also the very nicest brunch I have ever experienced! There were so many different types of foods that you could not possibly try everything. Nonetheless, it was the absolute most impressive spread I have personally ever seen. We sometimes went down to have breakfast in the dining room. This was my only complaint. The food was sometimes poor. Sometimes the service was even worse. One morning, the waiter took about 45 minutes to bring an order of waffles. His attitude was very sullen and dismissive in the first place. The waffles arrived cold and hard like bricks, like they had been sitting around for awhile. Needless to say, we complained. I was more insulted over the waiters attitude towards us than the poor quality of the food. The Ritz did their best to make it up to us by inviting us to a \"special\" dinner which we accepted. They pulled out all the RC stops for this dinner, and I must say, I was impressed. Eventhough I am not a big wine drinker, they served a different premium wine with each course of this meal. I simply do not care about wines that much, but, I knew they were going first class with each offering--so I certainly appreciated the jesture. There were probably 10 or 12 courses to the meal, by the way. Frankly, they seerved us so many things, I can't even recall what all we had, except, I do remember the trio of gumbos which was impressive and very good. The manager of the restaurant came over and spent a great deal of time with us, and also apologized for our poor experience in the hotel dining room. We were very happy that they bent over to make things right with us--after all, while not high rollers, we are very regular visitors to the RC hotel chain, and I do EXPECT things to be right. Frankly this level of service and caring is the difference between the Ritz and the Marriott, for example...and we are willing to pay for that. When things aren't right, we EXPECT that the Ritz will fix it, not just say: \"too bad\". So, things were mostly as expected--excellent. When they weren't, I believe the RC stepped up to fix it.

Service was always excellent, especially in the Davenport lounge/restaurant where the food was excellent, far better than some of the high-end meals we ate at some restaurants in the French Quarter. There was usually a doorman to hold the Canal St. door open, but about 10-20% of the time, he wasn't there. There is no revolving door at this spot. The regular help at the restaurants, the maids, the doormen and bellmen were very friendly and pleasant. The heating/air conditioning system worked very well in our room. There was a 42 inch (guess at size) LCD tv with several HD channels. The room was attractively decorated (only two quarter-sized black stains on the carpet), but much more light would've been greatly appreciated - the light is from lamps - no overhead lighting in the main section. The bathroom had marble floors and had a bathtub with shower rather than a glass-enclosure shower; water pressure was just adequate. The bathroom itself could've used some lights over the large mirror - it was relatively dark standing at the sink when looking in the mirror. There was also no venting fan in the bathroom which made for some easily heard embarrassing noises and odors! The feather bed was soft and so comfortable - it made our firm mattress at home seem like concrete in comparison. The pillows were comfortable too. Our room was a deluxe as was our friends' room, but their room was a few square feet larger. There is an ethernet connection for internet; our friends said it cost them to use it. There is a small room near registration with several computers; it costs $7.50 for the first 15 minutes. Parking is expensive - with tax it's about $42.50 per 24 hour period. I asked for subtotaled bills during our stay and kept getting charged the parking fee (we had NO car and just used taxis). I'd show it to the registration clerks and the fee would get removed (without the clerks saying they were sorry), then added back on for the next day! Our friends did not get charged the parking fee, but were charged for other services they had not used. So check your bill carefully and ask for a subtotal every few days. The concierge desk offers tips, but doesn't seem to know the good tours. The city tour we got saw mostly things like the outside of a graveyard (not the streets inside it) and areas where already wretched houses in seedy areas had been wiped out by Katrina as we heard diatribes about the gov't handling of the aftermath. The swamp airboat tour ($90 pp) we also booked thru the concierge desk was terrible compared to one we took a few years ago. The boat barely moved as we sat looking at swamp plants. How unexciting. Finally, the concierge recommendation of shopping along Magazine Ave was WAY overrated; I would skip this area entirely (and hire a new concierge staff).", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cPersonal Service - great location - beautiful rooms\u201d", "Author": "jonisb", "ReviewID": "UR82649955", "Content": "We have stayed at The Ritz Carlton in New Orleans on several occasions.

In the past no one would recommend that as soon as you enter there is no cell phone usage and to lower your voice so others can enjoy the facilities. I have had to leave on occasion in the past due to loud conversations both on phones and among staff. I am also excited to see some additions to the massage offerings such as Thai massage. Both my husband and I had excellent masseuses (Angel is very highly trained and I would recommend her to everyone).

While I'm sure that was probably better than hearing Canal St traffic all night, it isn't what I thought I would find in a hotel of that caliber. Also, I've heard about the exception service that the Ritz offers. Other collegues have stayed at other properties across the country and raved about how they were treated. I have honestly received better guest service at the Quality Inn in Mocksville, NC. Not to say that anyone was exceptionly rude or unfriendly, but again I've seen better service at hotels with fewer stars. Also, the hotel did not offer things that you see at other properties for a much lower rate. Valet parking was outrageous. At $36/day + tax, it was well over the price other French Quarter hotels charge. I don't mind paying for valet, but what makes the Ritz' parking $10 more expensive than the Omni which is 4 blocks away? Another key point is internet access. In the digital age, I expect either free high speed access or free wi-fi. Not at the Ritz. Expect to pay over $35 for 5 days worth of access. My suggestion, bring an aircard or walk down the block to Starbucks where it's free. I am not swearing off the Ritz brand, but I definitely will not be staying at the Ritz in New Orleans again.

Yes, the decor is old world & traditional, but this is a Ritz-Carlton and it absolutely fits in New Orleans. If you want edgy and cool, go stay at the W Hotel. The hotel location is good to visit New Orleans, however the hotel is located not too far from an iffy & dilapidated area... keep that in mind, but I can't see why tourists would wander in that area anyhow.

It was FANTASTIC. It was our 5th wedding anniversary and all of the staff, from the concierge to the housekeeping was intent on treating us royally. There were champagne and chocolates upon our arrival (and not just regular chocolates--handpainted goodies and strawberries dipped to look like they were wearing miniature tuxedos) and our room was gorgeous. We actually had a view with 3 large windows overlooking Iberville down to the French Quarter. Our room was on the 8th floor. The bathroom was spacious (tub fit myself and my 6'-5\" husband), the room was spacious and unlike previous reviewers, I thought housekeeping did a really great job keeping us well stocked with fresh towels, toiletries etc. The bed was very comfy too and I love turn down service when it is done properly, which this was...including putting our slippers on each side of the bed. The staff was very friendly and forthcoming with recommendations and pointers. Jaoul (at the desk), Anne and Andrea were so helpful. When you stay in the \"club\" at Maison Orleans, there is food and beverage available 24 hours a day. The breakfasts were considered continental but too me they were more than that. Lox, fresh fruit, homemade oatmeal, omellette station, French pastry and cereals etc were wonderful to choose from. The buffet of goodies at the elevators (chocolate chip and other cookies, French Macaroons, hand painted toffee pieces and taffy) were especially welcoming after a long day traipsing around the city. Also, the cafe au lait was delish. And I thought the facility itself was well appointed with French bergere chairs, old paintings and beautiful chandeliers. You can sit in the library or a living room setting to have cheese and crackers and a glass of wine in the afternoon as well.

Travel agent called while we were in cab from airport to say hotel had contacted her to say we'd been bumped from Club Level due to a held over conference. Upon check in offered room on 10th floor facing Canal St. Told wait for different room was 40 plus guests long so took it. Street noise even at that level, although told there wouldn't be (knew better from experience living in NYC and street noise not an issue for us but shows the misinformation started early). Was given club level amenity access (first and last \"xtra\" although verbally quoted new room rate $20 lower than what ended up on our bill, so guess we did end up paying for that too). When tried to use it had to return to the front desk to have key reprogrammed as initially had not been programmed with access as promised. Hotel room a bit dated but clean as were lobby areas (more updated). Stale smoke smell throughout hallways on our floor but thankfully not in our non smoking room. Had to call front desk again after settling into room as discovered bath linens not fully stocked. Club area also very nice. Food so so but free drinks. Service ok. Got there at time \"lunch\" ending and told to grab food we wanted quickly as they were cleaning up. Had person in club lounge make reservations for dinner and lunch the next day via concierge. Told concierge would have map/reservation for dinner printed out and slipped under our door as we had mentioned wanting to rest before dinner and she said that way we wouldn't be disturbed. Instead about 2 hours before our dinner reservation the concierge called our room to say she had indeed confirmed the dinner reservation and didn't give directions before hanging up. Googled directions ourselves just before leaving for dinner. Walked the 6 blocks or so to the restaurant only to find a private party that had rented out the whole restaurant still winding down with the hostess telling us on our inquiring about our reservation, \"I told her (concierge) we wouldn't have an opening until at least 10pm\". Walked back to the hotel to talk with concierge and figure out where to eat (now 10pm) and first thing she says is not \"sorry\" but \"who did you talk to\". I guess we were supposed to ignore the annoyed stares of the party guests and the hostess and demand the manager?! Next she asked us to walk back and try again as was now 10pm?!! (We had just left the restaurant 10 minutes before and there was no indication they would be ready even at 10pm and no offer from them to just come back). Finally she said she was sorry and what did we want to do then. We said we wanted to eat! She ended up recommending a restaurant just around the corner (GW Fins). Food only so so but passable but service horrible and decor dated/overdone. Waiter insisted on pushing certain menu items (one recommendation excellent, one poor and two others so so) and inattentive. Bread arrived after the appetizer, etc. Lunch the next day wonderful as we had had the reservation made to one of our favorite restaurants, Bayona, ie we did NOT leave it up to the concierge. Should have just done the same with dinner the night before but thought we might try something different. Next day at the spa: overall the most positive experience at the hotel but still with issues. Upon checking in and going to the women's changing area, asked by two different staff about slipper size but slippers never brought to room. Heard name being called to go to first treatment and I informed massage therapist I didn't have slippers. Told to just walk to massage room barefoot and he would get my slippers after. Also, no music in massage treatment room. Massage, facial, mani/pedi all excellent though. Next issue: in town and staying at this hotel for a wedding. Spouse asked several times of different staff about getting to the offsite wedding and how much time to allow, etc. Inquired about needing limo service vs trolley vs walking vs taxi and told taxi would be the best option (too far to walk/trolley didn't go that far on Canal/no need for limo as taxi easy to get and fast) and to allow 10 minutes. Did that only to find taxi line of 40 plus people and no cabs in sight. Tried to talk to staff that were flagging down cabs (most people in line going to concert starting 30 minutes after the wedding start time) and told just to get in back of the line. Spouse spoke with person inside and told the hotel vehicle was on its way down from the garage to take us. Left the taxi line to wait for hotel vehicle. When hotel vehicle showed up 5 minutes later, told by driver (who was supposedly a manager) that he had to make a run to the concert first and took off. Staff member who had told us to wait clearly surprised too and very apologetic but told there was nothing to do but wait and try to flag down a cab for us. Went back to taxi line, now clearly late for wedding and again at back of line. another 15 minutes and finally got taxi to arrive at wedding 1/2 hour late and nearly over. Next day needed extra towels for room and called housekeeping. Told they'd be sent right up. half hour later finally noticed housekeeping cart on our hallway and just asked that person for towels. Half hour after that finally someone knocked with more towels. An hour for towels? No way to just contact your staff already on the floor and have them respond to guest request? Other comments: staff rarely made eye contact; had exactly two staff greet us the entire stay; only occasionally saw staff at main and back entrance doors and never once had them opened for us. all pretty small details but details we've not seen overlook at other supposedly comparable properties. We never demanded anything for the above and numerous service snafus but in past experiences with much less inconveniences at other again supposedly comparable properties have been offered small things like champagne sent to room or spa discount to compensate No mention of anything of the sort at the Ritz, just an occasional \"sorry\" by harried staff.

I can not vouch for the mens locker room, but the relaxing area in the ladies locker room had beds to rest on and was VERY relaxing before and after my professional quality massage.

The room was on the small side and the decor was drab and \"tired\" looking. The service in almost all departments was confused or careless. The hotel was clearly understaffed. Concierge service was truly amazing: After waiting 2 days (and after more than one reminder), Concierge No. 1 still had not gotten our Christmas Eve reservations, nor the sitting we requested for the Ritz's Christmas Brunch. Spotting a different concierge on duty, we tried our luck again. Within 5 minutes, Concierge No. 2 got our dinner reservations plus the seating we wanted for brunch. Clearly the previous poster who complained about concierge services got Concierge No. 1. The restaurant food was quite good overall, but service was haphazard and slow. The one dining disaster was the Christmas Brunch. We had the 12:00 seating. Unfortunately, the food appeared and tasted like it was left over from the 10:30 seating. Everything except the carving station tasted like it had been sitting in the chafing dishes for ages. At $75 a piece, plus INCLUDED 20% tip (for worthless service), we left feeling genuinely ripped off. I've been to many $75 or more brunches before, and this was by far the worst I've ever encountered. The last straw came at checkout. Our package included breakfasts and free internet services. The bill included charges for both, plus tax on valet parking which we hadn't even used. (Mind you, no charge for the valet parking, just the tax.) Each charge was accompanied by state tax, plus local tax, so by the time they straightened out the bill and each charge and tax item removed (which took an ridiculous length of time), the total was reduced by $300!

I had a total of 3 spa treatments. The cafe au lait scrub and hot stone massage were both great. The vichy shower experience with the scrub was phenomenal! Unfortunately, the signature facial was just average. All treatments allow for access to the spa sauna and jacuzzi. The spa staff were fantastic offering mimosas/champagne quite often- a nice touch. I never felt rushed and one can literally stay for hours. Regarding the club lounge, the offerings were good (the gumbo was excellent) and the staff attentive without being intrusive. The wine/champagne was present from lunch onward. I felt very comfortable just sitting and reading while sipping a nice glass of cabernet. A quick word about room service- the bread pudding came with a pecan praline which was absolutely fantastic. The entree was good and the service prompt.

From the time that I arrived to the end of the stay was great! When I arrived at the Ritz Carlton, the bailsmen immediately opened my door with a greeting; they tagged my luggage and stated that they would be up to my room shortly. I went to the check-in counter, it was a smooth process. As you walk any where in this prestigious hotel, everyone.. I mean everyone greets you! The atmosphere is so clean, beautiful, and extravagant! I felt like I was a queen in a palace the entire stay. When you call for anything, they always greet you by your name (the name that the reservation is under) and always glad to assist you. We always needed extra towels, etc.. and they were very prompt in bringing those things up very quickly. Also, we were offered \"Turn Down\" service every night. The package we booked for the Ritz was called \"A Piece Of Mind\" which included the All American Breakfast for $24. We had breakfast every morning; the hotel staff in the dining area made the trip that much more relaxing. We always tipped and was taken care of after each experience. I would like to give a special shout out to William and Le Salle, they made sure that our breakfast experience was one that we would always remember. When you entered in the dining area, they seated you by pulling out your chairs and placing a napkin in your lap. The food was always hot and delicious! We jad a minor / major problem -- one morning before we left we asked for our room to be cleaned, the housekeeper said ok. We left and returned many hours later to find our room was opened & unlocked. We immediately checked our laptops, aircards, camaras, money, etc.. We called down to the front desk to speak to a manager, we were transferred to her cell. We stated to the manager what happened and she apologized and promised us that this was a mistake and will not happen again. She also wanted to know what time tomorrow would we like our rooms to be cleaned, we stated to her a time. She didn't offer any type if compusation, so I stated to her that this is a prestigous luxury hotel that we are paying $200 per night and our room was left wide open, we need to be compusated besides \"it want happen again.\" So I requested a credit to be used in the restaurant; she issued a $50 credit plus drinks on them. I felt like that if I hadn't persued that we need to be compusated, that they would have did nothing! That minor incident didn't make the stay worse, it was a little glitch! Also, I would recommend that if you drink alot of water, please go to the Wal-Greens or the store down the street to purchase some water and drinks. Of Course hotel food, items are more expensive than regular prices. The location is very accessible to Bourbon Street, the trolleys, only blocks away from other tourist attractions. Also, we booked a tour at the Riverwalk called \"The Rebirth of New Orleans\" this was the best $50 you can spend to see outside of the toursit areas, this tour will show you the areas that were most effected by Hurricane Katrina, you can see the water levels that stood for days on end, the signs/markings from the National Gaurds, the actual levey that broke, the cemetary, etc. So, this is a must go!

I just came from one several days ago, and I'm still stressed. I was wondering why, when I realized, it's the Ritz, the EVIL staff at Ritz Carlton New Orleans and their cruddy rooms!!! Let me backtrack a bit. I booked a 3 night, extended weekend stay at the Ritz. We paid for a package, and paid extra to stay at the Ritz because I have stayed at many, many a Ritz Carlton and the quality I was expecting, so I thought, is pretty much the same at all properties. Wrong, oh so wrong! We were booked into a standard room. I really didn't care to see a view or anything out the window because the Ritz is located at Canal Street, and what am I really going to look at, street traffic? No thanks! If I was in Hawaii and staying at an oceanfront hotel, I would have opted for a completely category. Since this was New Orleans, I'm focusing my vacation time mostly on Bourbon, Royal and Magazine Streets. No time for looking at street traffic. Of course, the room category is where my living hell began. We arrived at the hotel at night since we came from San Francisco. Even with a direct flight, it's 5 hours minimum. The room we were given reeked of smoke. Couldn't deal with that so my husband phoned the front desk for another room. We were told that a king bed is not available because we checked-in so late. Also, the room about 4 doors down from the elevator and extra hangers I requested when booking the hotel were completely forgotten too. The lady said they only had 2 doubles left if we wanted non-smoking. After more dickering, they upgraded us to a room with 2 kings, semantics, grr!!! We thought everything was ok, until after we quickly unpacked and went out for dinner at 12 midnight (remember, we wasted 2 hours moving rooms already), it was time to sleep. Except I couldn't, all night long, because there was a weird noise coming from the ceiling. After wasting 1 sleepless night of my 3 night \"relaxing\" getaway, I called for maintenance to try and fix that noise. A couple of more hours wasted waiting for the guy, we were told that we'd have to move rooms because he'll pretty much have to rip open the ceiling before he could figure out what's wrong. I called the front desk again and was told that no rooms were available at the time, but wait 2 more hours and they'll see what they could do. We go out for lunch and came back to the front desk, where we were shown another room in the same floor as their spa. This one now had the sound of running water. \"Constantly\" running water. And then another room, the 1 king bed as usual, nowhere near the elevator. After all the he-- we've been through so far and the sleepless night, they have the chutzpah to dump us onto the same room. We promptly checked-out, because we have wasted 1-1/2 days of our very short vacation so far switching rooms thanks to the Ritz. While checking-out by the way, my husband overheard another person complaining at the front desk that there's a RAT in his room. Not a mouse, but a RAT!!! This is the Ritz? Well, the price certainly reflected it (like $36 a day for valet service). That's not so bad if they delivered though, but didn't.

NOT What a Ritz-Carlton Should Be.\u201d", "Author": "EastHuron", "ReviewID": "UR38805646", "Content": "Most people who stay at a Ritz Carlton property fall into one of two camps: Camp 1: There is NOTHING the hotel can do wrong. These people are so blown away by the name on the door and the lion logo on the bath mat that everything is just perfect, no matter what. Camp 2: There is NOTHING the hotel can do right. These people nitpick the tiniest details, demand utter perfection, pitch fits, complain, and won't settle for anything less than the warped idea of luxury that resides only in their own minds. We don't fall into either of those groups. Rather, we're totally reasonable people who travel three or four times a year, purely for enjoyment, and stay in 4, 4.5, and 5-star establishments. We have definite reasonable expectations, preferring not to complain, but willing to do so if something's really amiss. We stayed four nights, so we had plenty of time to evaluate. In summary, while this is a nice hotel, it is certainly NOT in the league of other 5-star places we've experienced in Chicago, Vegas, and Boston. Here's why: 1. STAINED LINENS BECAUSE OF A HOUSEKEEPING MISHAP. After checking in at 2:00 a.m. due to a late flight, we unpacked everything, took quick showers, and got ready to crash for the night. Upon pulling back the bedding, a nasty brownish stain was right there in the middle of the bed. And crumbs. And some colorful glitter. The bedding obviously hadn't been changed. Rather, the housekeeping staff mistakenly \"freshened up\" the room, as they typically do with turndown service. We called the front desk. The staff was apologetic and responded immediately, so we stood awkwardly (in our PJ's) in the bathroom for about 20 minutes as the bed linens were changed. It was an honest mistake, but not a good way to begin. Nothing was offered to us for our trouble. 2. TIRED DECOR. While nothing was obviously worn out or abused, the room decor just isn't on par with true 5-star establishments. A wrinkled dust ruffle. A pillowtop for the mattress that didn't quite fit. Outdated wallpaper. Uninteresting photos. Typical window treatments. Small rooms. 3. OLD BATHROOM. In terms of 5-star properties, the bathroom here doesn't cut it. Traditional bathtubs with straight shower rods (not even the easily installable curved ones) with fabric shower curtains and a $15 shower head provide a 1980's shower experience. A big pedestal sink and virtually no counter space looks OK, but provides no functionality. Towels that don't impress in the least. One (not two) marginal bathrobe. You get the point. In contrast, the bathrooms should be redone with glass shower stalls, higher-end fixtures, better towels, lots of counter space and beautifully lit mirrors. 4. THE LITTLE THINGS. One of our two room keys didn't work and had to wait at the desk twice to get it replaced. (They were having key problems, according to the staff member at the desk.) Trays from room service sat in the hallways a little too long. The door handles were worn. The housekeeping--while very good--was inconsistent. The windows were dirty. The lighting and the operation of room lights was outdated. Old phones and an outdated voicemail system. An unsolicited offer (via a voicemail message and flashing red light) to save 20% at the spa seemed a little tacky. The desk attendant--albeit 2:00 a.m.--wasn't particularly friendly or welcoming, particularly to two weary travelers who booked four nights at the R.C. In all, we would recommend the Ritz Carlton, particularly if an internet special comes around. And the location is great if you want to spend a lot of time in the French Quarter. If you go in expecting a 4-star experience, you'll get it. If you're expecting a 5-star one, you'll be disappointed.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNIcve hotel, with a nice location\u201d", "Author": "BrentD", "ReviewID": "UR38669973", "Content": "Having stayed at the Ritz in Cleveland( nasty) and the Ritz in Battery Park New York(wonderful) I chose this hotel due to it's reviews by others, and the other hotel choices were not really what I was looking for.

The first level is that of french, marble and an english feel. I know it sounds weird, but it was the genre in which I saw and felt. Nice, and not over done. You must then take an elevator(all were very fast throughout our stay) to the third level reception. There are 3 or 4 check in lines, and because of our early arrival, we were checked in very fast. Took the elevator up with the bell hop and were let into the room. Nice 42 inch plasma, very ornate bedding and furniture. Medium size room overlooking the courtyard. Heavy window treatments and sheers to keep the light out during nap time. The bath has upper end products, soaps, shoe shine and sewing kits. Towels are plentiful, and the marble shower and bath were nice. Hot water and pressure were nice. There is a nice big bar with entertainment each night we were there, along with the \"library\" is a nice private cigar bar opened to guests of the Ritz and members. Nice cigar menu. Price of cigars range from $25.00 for a Fuente to $120.00 for a Fuente Opus X. I feel wayyyyyyy over priced, as I brought my Opus X's from home, and only paid $30.00 a piece for mine at the cigar shop back home. The mark up on the Opus X is sinful.

Went to Bombay Club for a drink and apps one evening, but seemed too old and velvety there, so we walked through Bourbon Street on the way home and sat at the Ritz bar and enjoyed a nice evening there.

Nice to people watch, but powered donuts and coffee and being pecked by birds high on sugar....not my cup of tea.

However, we had requested a crib, and that was not in the room, and took 20 minutes to arrive after 2 calls. That was our only disappointment of the weekend. We opted for the cheap room with \"no view\" for $129 a night. What we received was a standard Ritz Carlton room, which was quite nice. The \"no view\" referred to a view of a courtyard, and the building on the other side of the courtyard was abandoned. If you like views, pay the extra money for a good view. If you are not bothered (like us), then keep the sheer curtain closed, and you'll have a full and comfortable Ritz Carlton room to enjoy. Our room had a large closet, king sized bed, and all standard accessories. The refrigerator was large enough to hold a few drinks for the baby, which helped us out. There was also plenty of space in the room, even after adding the crib. The room and the bathroom were both clean. The air conditioning was comfortable and we could adjust the temperature. We originally weren't sure about the location, but decided that it was quite convenient in the end. Jackson Square, the Aquarium, and Harrah's were an easy 10 minute walk. Also, the Charles Street Car could be boarded 2 blocks from the hotel to head over to the zoo and Garden District. Bourbon St was also 2 blocks away, but the noise did not travel to the hotel. We were able to find a good number of restaurants and breakfast cafes with walking distance. We did not try the hotel spa or restaurants.

Also, the concierge gave us incorrect closing times for some common attractions, which we found odd. The hotel helped arrange a car to transport us from the airport with a forward-facing child seat.

We were traveling with our small dog and the Ritz Carlton chain is pet friendly with a $150 nonrefundable fee. We've never been to a Ritz Carlton before so we had no preconceived notion of what to expect. The hotel is all valet at about $36 per day. The hotel was easy to find. We loaded our bags on to a cart but a valet parked the car and a bellhop brought our bags to the room in a timely manner (about 10-15 minutes). Check-in was very fast and the lobby smells wonderful with these amazing candles. We bought 2 in the gift shop prior to our departure ($24 each). Everyone fussed over our little dog. When we got to our room, the housekeeping was already doing the turn-down service. The turn-down service consists of a mini bottled water with a glass, removal of the cover throw and accent pillows, turning down the bed sheets, and 2 chocolates. Our room was on the interior side which I liked based on previous reviews about road noise. We only had 1 wall that attached to another room so it was extremely quiet. Probably the most quiet hotel I've ever been to. We were in search of a good comforter and liked theirs so much that we purchased it! We visited the concierge multiple times throughout the trip and he was extremely helpful with finding excellent restaurants. One day when we had some time to kill, he sent us to the WWII museum. We ate at the Ritz restaurant one night. For an upscale restaurant, I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars. The location is great, 2 blocks to Bourbon Street and 1 mile to Cafe du Monde. My fiance visited the spa and received the Magnolia scrub and a facial ($150 each). It was a little too expensive for my taste but I was amazed by the large selection of choices. He loved the Magnolia scrub but didn't enjoy the facial. Not that it wasn't good, just not something he was in to. Overall, it's a great hotel and we're already planning on weekend trips to this hotel. My cons would be that there is no good place for your dog to releive his/herself. The closest grass is 2 blocks away and is the median in the middle of the street near a bus stop. It's not the best place at night and my dog could rarely make it the full 2 blocks. But let's face it, she's not the only one peeing on the sidewalks of New Orleans. This isn't a real con since it doesn't affect most people. My other con would be the elevators. You can't just go straight from the rooms to the ground level. You have to take one elevator to the lobby, walk through the lobby to the other side, and then take another elevator the rest of the way down. The good side is that it discourages people who don't have rooms at the hotel from going up to the room levels.", "Date": "August 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "DC", "Title": "\u201cClassy Establishment\u201d", "Author": "Squirrel43", "ReviewID": "UR35620341", "Content": "The recently remodeled Ritz was very nice.

Since I had stayed there in the past and thoroughly enjoyed it, I was very excited to stay there once again. However, from the day we checked in to the day we checked out, we were plagued with a number of incidents that left me wanting to never stay there or any other Ritz Carlton ever again. It all started when we first drove into the Ritz (the Ritz side not the Maison Orleans side) to valet our car and check in. From then on, these problems occurred: 1. The valet who registered my car was rude. Not in the sense of necessarily saying anything rude. However, his demeanor and attitude were somewhat uncomfortable to me. He seemed to be rushing me, and he was not very cordial. 2. When we arrived at the check in desk, there was nobody there to check us in. We sat on a couch and waited for about 15 minutes. That is ridiculous. It's one thing to wait in line, but it is completely different when there is no one to check you in. In my life time, that has never happened to me anywhere. There is no excuse for that; especially at a Ritz Carlton. 3. Around 7:15 on Saturday night, I went to the concierge desk to get a recommendation for a restaurant. Guess what, there was nobody there. There was a sign at the desk that said, \"Sorry for the inconvenience. I am currently helping with a dinner party downstairs.\" When paying five star prices (and a little extra for being on the club level), one expects a concierge there at all times to help with any questions or needs. 4. Saturday night, we came back to the hotel and ordered room service. They said it would take thirty minutes or less. Guess what, it took about an hour and a half. By the time the porter got to our room, I was half asleep. And when he came in to the room, he did not present any of the food items and did not take the covers off of any of our items. He came in, dropped the food off, and left like he was in a hurry to go make a bet at the race track. 5. Sunday, we were getting ready for dinner. It was around 6:30, and the maid knocked on our door to do the turn down service. I told her to come back later. We went to dinner and came back around 10:30 later that night to find that housekeeping never came to our room. So our room was still dirty, and even worse we had no more towels. So the next morning, I used the same towel as I had used the night before. There is no excuse for that. 6. Monday morning, we ordered room service. It was literally the worst breakfast that myself and my wife I had ever had in our lives. The eggs benedict I ordered was cold. My wife pancakes were not only cold, but the consistency of the pancakes was that of cardboard. 7. When I checked out, the person checking us out was rude. He acted like he did not care about my stay. It was almost like he had no personality. He was like.....a robot. The only positive thing I have to say is that the manager of the hotel was very receptive in listening to our disputes. She told me she was very embarrassed about what happened. She explained to me that this is not the Ritz Carlton's motto, and she was going to do everything in her power to make things right. She seemed very sincere and apologetic, and I strongly believed that she was going to strive to make things better at the hotel. Unfortunately, the Ritz Carlton/ Maison Orleans gave me a bad taste in my mouth.

Despite all of these events occurring, NOLA as a whole was fairly subdued and quiet. The economic recession and post-Katrina woes are still affecting NOLA. We received a standard king bed room with a corporate discount. Considering we paid about half of the rack rate, we were very pleased. We did not have a view at all and the room itself was rather dark. However, the room itself was spacious, clean and sparsely furnished. The bathroom was large, ample shelf space, and a separate enclosed toilet area (I love this). It took a day to get adjusted to the slimy/hard water of the Mississippi River. They provided ample toiletries and a blow dryer. They had a mini coffee pot for your usage. The TV was flat screen, about 27-30\". The bed was very comfortable and plush. We had restful sleep and it was extremely quiet at night, despite parties being held throughout the night. There was a large desk, a large chair with ottoman, and a bench at the end of the bed, which I also really love. The closet was large and there are robes and a large umbrella. The housekeeper left chocolates on our pillow. The hotel itself is gorgeous. The outside atrium is really nice and a great place to meet your party or to wait for others. There are 2 sets of elevators you have to use: one to go up to the actual rooms (that requires you to put in your hotel card, so have it ready), and another to go down to Canal St. The doorman on Canal, an older gentleman, is very nice and friendly. The concierge was very helpful and accommodating. In addition, there is a small business center to the left of the front desk. They have the computer set-up so that you can quickly print out boarding passes, for free, before you leave. Very helpful. The location is also great. When we stepped out of Canal St, the parades were right outside. It is also close to the streetcar stop. It is several blocks from Bourbon and the craziness of NOLA, so it is close enough to enjoy but far enough to get some respite from the crowds and noise.

After waiting for three other guests to be served\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnone of whom were checking in\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit was our turn. Our check-in started smoothly, my credit card was swiped within 30 seconds of greeting the clerk. It was the next step that would prove problematic: room selection. The front desk clerk could not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153find\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a room for us. She spent several minutes paging through screen after screen of data on her computer and still could not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153find\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd us that room. Next, she excused herself, disappearing for a few minutes into the office on my left and brought out Patrick to help her. Then, they both began to page through screen after screen of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer system. Furiously pecking at their respective keyboards, they settled on Room 763 and sent us on our way, about one half-hour after we arrived. Now, there were four more guests waiting behind us. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Scent of the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and Room 763: According to the hotel staff, every Ritz-Carlton hotel has what they call the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scent of the hotel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That smell is incorporated into the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air fresheners and cleaning products. My wife and I are both allergic to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scent of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Ritz-Carlton New Orleans, my wife more so than me. While we were only mildly affected in the lobby, it was our room that made us sick. Upon entering room 763 we both felt our throats tighten. We both took our allergy medications and left for dinner. The next day, when we woke up, my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face was swollen, she was tearing up, and she had difficulty breathing. Around 11 AM we called the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front office and asked about changing rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit was then that we were told that the scent is used everywhere in the hotel, and that some of their regular guests call ahead to request \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scent-free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms. At that time we were told that a room would be prepared for us. Returning to the business purpose of my stay I asked whether my wife could coordinate the move. Based on the instructions of the front office, my wife stayed in the room waiting for a telephone call\u00e2\u20ac\u201done that never came. While out on business I called twice to check on the status of our replacement room, only to find out that no one from the hotel had even talked to my wife. Imagine my surprise when I returned at 3 PM\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnearly four hours later\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto find my wife still in the room. Her symptoms had worsened considerably; her voice had turned hoarse and she was taking her inhaler. Shocked to see my wife in such a state I called the front office again. This time James told us that another room would be ready in two hours. Only after explaining that we had already been waiting four hours for this room change did he seem to express any concern for my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ordeal. When Jeffrey, the bellman, arrived to move our belongings he commented about the strong odor in the room. We were moved to room 575 within a half hour. Room 575 was only marginally better. The next morning we learned that the housekeepers were not told to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153de-feather\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the room. Placing our request directly with the housekeeper, our room was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153de-feathered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd just in time for the last night of our stay. We slept much better that night. One element of this whole ordeal did surprise us: No one ever called during our stay to follow-up on our concerns. No one. In-Room Dining: When travelling on business I have grown accustomed to room service breakfasts. Eating breakfast in my room gives me another half-hour when I can dress, read the newspaper, and otherwise prepare for my day. Both of our in-room breakfasts were disappointing. Our first breakfast arrived 10 minutes late and was missing food from both of our plates. Although they brought up the missing items, other hotels will usually \u00e2\u20ac\u0153comp\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a tardy breakfast, the Ritz-Carlton does not. On the next morning of our stay I noticed that the bill seemed too high, even for room service. Yes, I know about the delivery charge, mandatory percentage service charge and sales tax\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthese add-ons can easily increase a room service bill by 35 percent. Yet, upon audit, the bill was still too high. When I called to inquire about the discrepancy the staff reported prices for our order in excess of those listed on our in-room menu. Their response \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, you must have an old menu.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd No offer of adjustment was made. Not every experience during our stay was bad. This hotel has very friendly bellmen, housekeepers and doormen. At times it seemed like they were the only ones who really cared about our stay and our well being. But for the problems described above, this review would have and should have been about them\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the times they went out their way to help us. Two days after we returned home I asked my wife what she thought of our trip.

The Ritz in New Orleans is actually two older hotels that were refurbished and combined into one at some point. The layout shows this history - it's a bit confusing to get around the hotel. The lobby on the third floor so you take one elevator up from the street, and then a different set of elevators to the rooms. Getting from your hotel room to one of the conference rooms also requires two separate elevators, even if you're only going from the 5th floor to the 2nd. The decor is what you'd expect from a Ritz, I suppose, but it's not my style at all. Lots of frills and fluff, very dated. Clean and well cared for, but not my thing. There's a large typical hotel bar and an adjoining outdoor courtyard. Service in the bar wasn't great, and I wasn't unhappy paying $12 for poorly mixed cocktails, so I didn't spend much time there. The courtyard was often busy with guests, but whenever I stopped in it was uninhabitable due to wind swirling around between the four enclosing walls, and I didn't find it welcoming.

With our room overlooking Canal Street, it seemed like every ten minutes after midnight we would hear some music passing by. While it was loud not enough to prevent me from sleeping, you could clearly hear it and it might bother some people. So just note that with any prime location close to all the attractions, there can be drawbacks. ROOMS: The rooms are appointed in a traditional yet attractive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153French Heritage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decor with typical Ritz Carlton classical furniture with dark wood. While the bathroom was nicely appointed with carrera marble and Bulgari bath amenities, it lacked a separate walk in shower, which most Ritz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have. On the plus side, the beds were lavishly done in Ritz Carlton style with Frette linens, feather duvets, ext. The room also had a larger than normal Flat screen TV which was very nice. However, the room had an incomplete feel: there was a large open space in the right corner next to the TV (see pictures). After the two doubles beds, TV, and desk there was no other furniture. However, it should be noted that we requested a rollaway bed so they could have been making room for that. But they could have easily accommodated a lounge chair, which most hotels have, in addition to the rollaway bed. SERVICE: The service at the Ritz Carlton in New Orleans certainly met my expectations. Every single person I encountered, without exception, made every effort to get to know us. The concierge was very informed on every attraction around the city and the service at the On Trois lounge was unusually quick, especially considering the crowd on a Friday night before dinner. While one comes to expect this at Ritz Carlton properties, the efficiency of the restaurant service seemed to exceed expectations. However, there were was one huge caveat. No turn down service whatsoever! That indicates that the service here is probably inconsistent. So unfortunately the highest I can give the service is 4 dots. DINING: We had hors d'oeuvres and drinks in the On Trois lounge which was a great experience. Filled with turn of the century antiques, it is probably the best place to go before dinner. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s odd how they only serve afternoon tea on the Saturday and Sunday. While we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat breakfast or lunch at the hotel, I would recommend eating off-site. I have heard the hotel restaurant, M\u00c3\u00a9lange, is not that good and there are so many great restaurants in the city. We opted to eat breakfast at the famous Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de Monde which was awesome. While it is more of a tourist attraction, it is still a can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss. SPA/OTHER AMENITIES: While I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the spa, it looked like a superb facility. Certainly on par with the other city spas I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. I talked to someone who said it is one of the companies most award winning spas. No pool? I stayed at two Hampton Inns in the last two weeks, both of which had pools. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand that. VALUE: Honestly, I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be complaining about anything. $149 per night. Yes, $149. The rates are usually lower during the holidays due to decreased business activity but this was the lowest rate I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen for any Ritz Carlton. The recession must really be affecting them. OVERALL: Based on my one night stay, I have concluded that this is a very nice hotel with a few drawbacks. While it is hard to make conclusions based on such a short stay, I would say this would probably your best bet in New Orleans considering its proximity to the French Quarter and the quality of the accommodations.", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - Stay Here if you Can!\u201d", "Author": "gb10", "ReviewID": "UR24050130", "Content": "My stay here was perfect.

We have routinely stayed at five star resorts in Hawaii, Mexico, the Caribbean, and the Bahamas, and thought this would be up to the same standard. To give you a little background on us, we have been very fortunate in life and have been able to secure good educations and nice jobs; my husband is an attorney and I have an MBA. Yet, we look, act, and are just regular down-to-earth people who treat people in the same manner in which we hope to be treated. Perhaps that was our problem-we weren't as \"high society\" as the Ritz prefers. During our last trip to NOLA at the end of October in 2008, we stayed at the Ritz Carlton, in truth due to the fact that we got a good deal online. We thought it would be up to par like the other five star hotels or resorts we have stayed at. It absolutely was not, and we would never stay there again. First of all, I'm unclear if we got the room we did because of the method in which we booked it, but the room was terrible. It was very dingy, smelled of smoke, the bed had an old bed spread and pillows on it, an uncomfortable old mattress, there was literally no cold water in the bathroom regardless of how long we let the water run, no ice bucket, no complimentary morning paper, and we had no in-room coffee re-fills. The little coffee machine was there, and there was one styrofoam cup, and that was it. The following morning, upon discovery of the fact that there were no coffee refills, we had to call housekeeping for them to deliver some of the little packets; a task which took about 25 minutes on their part. The lack of cold water in the bathroom was terrible because on the day we arrived, my husband came down with the flu and we spent almost the entire day in the room. Not having the convenience of being able to give him a cold cup of water was awful. Overall, as far as the room was concerned, we were very disappointed. This was definitely not what we expected from the Ritz! With regard to the customer service at the hotel, we had a question at the front desk regarding the Ritz's unadvertised practice of automatically charging your credit card upon check in for hotel incidentals that may come up during your stay, ultimately releasing the money back to you within 5-10 days after you leave if you didn't charge any incidentals. In our case, it was well over $1,000 due to the length of our stay. We were very unhappy with the way they handled the situation. The staff at the Ritz was clearly bothered by us inquiring, and acted rather belittling towards us. We were only inquiring because we noticed the unexpected sum of money taken from our checking account the following day, and because the Ritz had never indicated what their practice was regarding the automatic incidential charge, we were rather concerned by the withdrawal. It was clear that if you are not the sort of individual where money isn't an issue, the Ritz isn't interested in having you stay at their hotel. They were rude, loud, annoyed, and unpleasant. All in all, definitely not worth the money or the experience. We stayed at the La Pavillon the trip before and it was far nicer than the Ritz in all respects; room quality, amenities, customer service, etc. The only plus for staying at the Ritz Carlton is the location-which is excellent.

This makes it chaotic, confusing and utterly disorganized. I stayed on what is referred to as the \"Club Level\" of the Hotel Iberville...or Iberville Suites, I believe. It had a separate entrance and dining area, with its own food service and staff. But be very clear: It is not the Ritz Carlton. For that, one must traverse a series of dizzying corridors and complicated elevator banks to find the Ritz dining room, bar and front desk, which are located on the property's 3rd floor: Another source of confusion. All of this is slightly mitigated with the help of a staff whose sole responsible seems to be navigating lost guests to their final destination. In short, this property is a logistical nightmare. My idea of a hotel is a front entrance, a hotel bar and restaurant, one or two sets of elevators...and one building. If there are two buildings, like the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills, for example, one can simply walk from one to the other. The same applies to The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs. At the Ritz in New Orleans, however, there is no escape from what appears to be an endless labyrinth of passageways and elevator banks.

Maintenance did come but then we continued to get calls and knocks on the door from other maintenance personel asking we needed our toilet fixed, etc. This did not sit too well with me. I would recommend this hotel, however, do think it is a bit overpriced. The concierge service could have been more helpful and friendly.

I also don't understand why the less expensive hotels can provide internet service for free, but the more expensive end hotels charge you an arm and a leg to access high speed internet. If memory serves me correctly, I believe they charged $12.95 for 24 hours of internet access. It really should be free. I also was a little irritated that the entire hotel is on satellite instead of cable. It rained for several hours during my first day there and the television reception went out. What makes this hotel so very nice, is that you feel at home in your room. It is very much like sitting in your living room. The sofa chairs are comfortable and the beds are amazing. The ATM is kept in a secret room near the reservation desk. This is a great safety feature because someone has to let you in for anyone to access the ATM.

The public rooms were lovely, guest room was attractively decorated, bed and bedding were luxurious, nicely designed bathroom with luxurious toiletries. However, there were some issues that came up during our stay that surprised me, given that this hotel is part of the Ritz Carlton chain. The first thing that we noticed upon arriving is that the hotel is a bit difficult to navigate. Partly this is because this is an older style building, but partly because there are 3 hotels sharing the property. Upon entering it is necessary to take an elevator up to the 3rd floor to check in. This elevator only services the first 3 floors. Then it was necessary to transfer to another elevator to reach the rest of the hotel. Given that I was there for a conference, it was necessary to constantly transfer between elevators to get where I was going. This wasn't terrible, just a bit annoying. Even more annoying was that the elevators indicated that the spa was on the 4th floor. Upon exiting, there aren't clear instructions on where to go. If you are lucky, you will eventually find your way to another set of elevators which you must take to the first floor (this is not indicated anywhere, you just have to figure it out). I saw several families hopelessly wandering the 4th floor, asking in exasperation where the spa was. Second, the guest room itself was not maintained to a standard I'd expect for a Ritz Carlton. The carpet had multiple, dark stains that have clearly been there for a long time. The sink was really slow to drain, the faucet leaked, the shower drain was broken, and it took 5 minutes of running the water before getting hot water in the shower. Again, these are not huge problems, just surprising for a Ritz Carlton. Even more surprising was the inconsistency in housekeeping. On the first day of our stay we did not receive daytime housekeeping - they just never came. And it's not as though we were in the room all day either - in fact, one of the housekeepers, who was working on the room across the hall watched us leave (and just as an aside, she didn't greet us at all). Luckily our bed did get made up and our bathroom tidied by the evening turndown service. On one night we received chocolates at bedtime, but the other 2 nights we did not. On the last night of our stay we came back to the room in the evening to find the radio blasting on a rock station. Although I know some hotels turn on the radio to a classical music station or play a relaxing CD as part of the turndown service, perhaps this person did not understand that concept. Finally, the hotel food was quite disappointing. We ate breakfast in the restaurant one morning and found the food to be mediocre, but the coffee was awful. I have to say that the conference food wasn't bad, and the coffee at the conference was much better than at the restaurant. On the last morning of my stay I received a copy of the bill for express checkout, but no instructions on how to do the express checkout. When I contacted the front desk the woman I spoke with said that she would check me out, and told me that she would send me a copy of the zeroed out bill via e-mail. It never arrived. On the bright side, most staff were friendly and helpful, the fitness center was well-equipped, and the spa was fabulous. The location of the hotel was also good - right on the French Quarter, but across the street from the Central Business District. There is also a streetcar that runs on Canal Street in front of the hotel. Just as an aside, we did not drive, but my understanding is that the parking at the hotel is extremely expensive, and for those who value a pool, there is no full-sized pool at this hotel, although there is a small exercise pool in the fitness center. Would I stay at this hotel again? I'd consider it if the price was right, but honestly I think I'd be inclined to try one of the other hotels in the area.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201cRitz New Orleans, overlooks the small stuff\u201d", "Author": "missmc123", "ReviewID": "UR16544684", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel twice after Katrina ,and I think that the Ritz is not as great as everyone says.

The Ritz staff assured me that all the gift bags would be delivered 2 days prior to the wedding. The afternoon before the wedding it was brought to my attention that no one had received a bag. An employee by the name of Johanna assured me it would be taken care of immediately. At about 130 am I phoned the hotel operator because the bags still hadn't been delivered. She informed me there was no manager for that shift and she would have someone call me back. A very nice young lady named Jenifer returned my call within a matter of a few minutes. She introduced herself as Loss Prevention but would be the \"acting\" overnight manager and assured me once again this matter would be taken care of. I was skeptical..about 10 minutes later, Jenifer called me back. She explained that only 10 bags remained and she had no indication of who received what. She offered to photocopy the directions and include a nice letter offering those who didn't receive a bag to pick it up at the front desk. Jenifer put that under every single guests door in the wedding party and literally saved us from having a disaster. She also put together two very extravagant gift bags for the bride and groom and delivered them herself to the room. If it wasn't for her actions noone would have made it to the wedding on time or at all. Unlike most of the other employees we encountered she was the only one who was truly concerned about our issue.

It is about 2 blocks away from the beginning of Bourbon Street, short walks away from many historical sites and it's near the street car stop you take to ride up St Charles street into the Garden District. The room on the 7th floor we had was very spacious, tastefully decorated and clean with a king bed. It didn't have a view; but we didn't ask for the more expensive room that had views. Although the shower pressure was very low, the bathroom was stocked with a nice brand of soaps/shampoos/lotions. The staff are friendly but make sure you ask the concierge when you have a question about anything outside the hotel as both times we asked something of the person at the front desk, we were given the wrong information. Another note: if you leave a beverage bottle in your room that isn't completely full, it will be thrown away by the housekeeper (we lost 2 large bottles of fruit drinks that were 1/2 empty). The only time my husband and I ate at the hotel restaurant was to have appetizers but the food was really good and not too expensive. ( I had crawfish quesadilla that came in 4 slices and was really tasty and filling for about $15). I noticed a sushi cart set up every evening in a lobby area by the restaurant/bar. The restaurant has live music and the night we were there, 2 famous local musicians showed up to play with the jazz band. The hotel lobby offers complimentary lemonade in the afternoons. It seemed that the check-in counter located on the 3rd floor usually had one person working so service can be a bit slow. If you park a rental car in the valet parking lot it will cost you $32 a day.

The first time was a little crazy, but after a the first walk-thru it was fine. I can't say enough positive things about my stay there. Gracious and lovely are just the most appropriate way to describe it. The building is a beautiful Grand Dame. Elegant in every fashion. Beatiful floral arrangements at every turn that lightly scent the air. Books available to peruse while you enjoy a cocktail. I felt like I was staying at an elegant B&B without the forced friendly-ness of being in someone's house and sharing meals. The room was lovely. Very English country. I loved it. The bathrooms were fabulous and they provided Bulgari products, which I love. I absolutely loved the room. The Club level provided 5 presentations a day and by the time we arrived it was just savories and cocktails, which was fine. However all the presentations were great. We would get coffee, tea and a light breakfast and really be good for the rest of the day. We could come back in the afternoon for a cocktail and snack before heading out for dinner. We actually saved money on food. The quality was fabulous and the portion sizes were right on - just little bites. Not enough to fill you up, but enough to curb the appetite or get you going in the morning. The hotel provides a complimentary Mercedes to shuttle guests from place to place. We really prefer to walk and take the trolley but we did utilize it for a ride to Emeril's and Adubon Park one early morning. The service was lovely. It was friendly, yet restrained.

When we arrived in the afternoon the front desk said the rooms were not ready yet and that it would be an hour or so. We said that wasn't a problem that we would go to the restaurant and get something to eat, and before going made sure they had our request for \"rooms near, not connecting, but near.\" We were assured that they would be.

My wife labeled it \"marginal/unacceptable\", while I found it \"annoying\", but nonetheless had a great time in a lush, relaxing environment. On the plus side is the fantastic staff. They seem genuinely interested in personally making your stay as welcoming as possible. Everyone greets you, everyone asks if there's anything they can do, even the bellman who happens to be on the elevator you just got on. They are unfailingly polite, without slipping over the edge to smarmy or obsequious. On the minus side is the inconsistent attention to detail. While the problems were minor, there were a lot of them. It took three days to get correct newspapers delivered, and then again wrong papers were delivered a few days later. The coffee filter wasn't cleaned from the previous guest, and for the last two days, the coffee supply wasn't replenished. No washclothes on the last night. There was a complete service melt down in the restaurant Saturday morning. The room could have been dusted and vacuumed more completely. The wrong car was brought down from valet parking. These aren't the sort of problems one would expect at a Ritz, let alone so many of them in one stay of 8 nights. Once called to the staff's attention, everything was made right, and one of the front desk staff seemed to make it her personal mission to get the newspapers right. In all honesty, we had gotten an extremely good rate on Expedia, and if I had been paying close to standard rates, I might have been as unforgiving as my wife. If you talk to anyone in New Orleans, you learn that recovery has been slowed for a number of reasons, including the fact that the labor pool has shrunk so much that it's difficult to hire for almost any job. One has to believe that this factors into this Ritz's inability to maintain a consistently excellent level of service. But this is what New Orleans 2008 is. You can walk out the door of the Ritz, turn left, be on Bourbon Street in two blocks and enjoy yourself as if Katrina never happened. Or, you can turn right, walk 6 or 7 blocks and find a tent city of people living under Interstate 10.

The club level has its own valet area and back door straight down the elevators, which was very handy. It was a few blocks further than a lot of other hotels, but that was nice in a way too.

There, we were welcomed once again by a young lady who asked us to accompany her upstairs where we would register. As we walked, she told us that we had been upgraded to the Club Level, and would be enjoying some very nice amenities. She was right. One thing we noticed about the entire staff at the Ritz-Carlton throughout our stay is that from the maintenance staff to the management, everyone looks you in the eye, greets you, and makes sure that you feel welcome. Our check-in on the Club Level was so quick that I can barely remember it. Our room was a wonderful surprise! The bathroom was large and elegant, with marble everywhere. We enjoyed a few relaxing baths in a very deep tub, large enough to comfortably hold two people, and deeper than any tub that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever found in any hotel. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a Jacuzzi type tub, but that really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. There were two large candlesticks and bath salts that made for a very relaxing experience. There is also a menu of romantic baths available from the hotel for an even more special experience. Two comfortable robes were put to good use during our stay. The marble shower had an adjustable spray and enough pressure for our comfort. The bath was stocked with everything you might need, including a makeup mirror, clean glasses, comb, Bulgari soaps and hair products, and even a scale (which we totally ignored), and even a telephone. A nice touch was a volume control within reach of the tub, for music played from the radio or your own CD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The room was spacious enough so that we never felt crowded, and was thoughtfully equipped with luggage stands, a desk with a table-high outlet and optional hi-speed Internet, a wall safe in the closet (keyed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not combination), clock radio with iPod connectivity, a good cable television selection, a radio/DVD combo unit that supplies music to the bathroom if desired, a sitting chair, and an ironing board and iron. All of these things translated into a most comfortable travel experience. The room comfortably held a king-sized bed with a canopy, desk and nightstand, library shelf with hard-bound books, a faux coal fireplace and dresser. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very critical of hotel beds, but fell fast asleep at the Ritz, and woke up feeling refreshed. Simply put, our room was quiet, comfortable and luxurious. We missed the evening turndown service on our first two nights, because we were in our room showering and getting ready to go out for the evening. On those nights, we did get a fresh bucket of ice from the ladies doing the turndown service, who obviously didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to intrude on our privacy. On the nights that we were out of the room, our ice was filled, our bed turned down, a bed-time story (interesting local-color stories) placed on our pillow, and two delicious wrapped chocolates placed on fresh drinking glasses. The Club Level also has private elevators to take you to the ground level at the rear of the hotel and onto Iberville St at Dauphine St., where you step into the heart of the French Quarter. 24 hour room service was available, but never needed. The Club Level provided delicious food and drinks throughout the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including: breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, Hors D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ouvres at dinner, and desserts and cordials in the late evening. Wine, soft drinks, tea & coffee, and cocktails were also available. The quality of the food on the Club Level was superior. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really a terrific convenience as well. We were attending a convention, and were on the run for most of our time in New Orleans, so we found the immediate availability of terrific food to be an indispensable amenity.

It is uncanny how many of the reviews on this site are right on when it comes to problems with this hotel. Check in was probably one of the best things we experieced. After reading alot of horror stories, I was prepared to encounter problems. But we checked in early at 11am and there was no problem. The hotel lobby was nice but the fact that you must take an elevator to the lobby from the ground floor and then switch to the room elevators was annoying, espcially since the elevators were slow at night. The lobby was all marbe and pretty. THe atrium adjacent to teh lobby was nice. Our room was 508-it was on one of the lower floors that overlooked the atrium. The room was not big. When you walk in you have a hallway with a closet and the bathroom and then you enter the room. The bed was comfortable. The atrium was loud at night and kept me up for awhile. Our room only had one trashcan which is what most reviewers complained about. when i read the complaint i thought it was a trivial problem but I realize now how annoying it is not to have a trashcan in the bathroom. Surely, a ritz could afford two trashcans. Also, there are no pens anywhere. THere are tons of pads of paper but no pen to write with (another common complaint on this site). Our phone in our room did not work-we had three of them and they were all out. Also, our TV did not work for most of Friday day when we wanted to watch basketball games. The gym was ok-each machine had its on tv but the reception was poor and maybe 3 channels came in. The weight roomwas subpar and I actually hurt myself on a piece of equipment that was not working properly. The service in the hotel is horrible. Our room service took 2 hours to come and when it did our lobster bisque was cold! We complained and they did comp us that which they should have. Maid service was not existent. The maid never came Friday at all. Turndown service came when we were out after 9pm and removed all of our towels but did not replace them. We came home to zero towels. We did not even have a washcloth to wash our faces. It was ridiculous. Also, they left dirty glasses and an empty pretzel can form the mini bar out. It was horrible. Of our entire stay, maid service never came in to clean our room-we only had turn down service and then had to ask the maid in the hall for towels. This is unacceptable for this kind of hotel. On Saturday night, some shady business was going on on our floor. SOmeone rapped on our door 3 times. When my husband went to answer it he saw a gentleman that worked for the hotel walking down the hall. He later saw him rap on another door and exchange something for a large wad of money. THis is shady business and we felt very unsafe not to mention being woken up in the middle of the night. New Orleans in general has not recovered. The cab scene is horrible. Unless you are on Canal street it is impossible to get a cab. We were in town for a wedding and had to wait 40 minutes every night to get a cab back to the hotel. This is not right. We had a discount to stay at this hotel for a wedding block. If we had to pay the regualr rate I would have been livid.

It was my first trip to New Orleans since Katrina. We picked the Ritz because of a great rate ($200 a night) that my friend who is a lawyer got through the American Bar Association. One of the girls I was with also owns a timeshare at the Ritz in Aspen. The Ritz is a lovely hotel on the edge of the French Quarter in New Orleans, about ten blocks from Harrah's and right on the trolley line. It is a great location. The hotel itself is very nice. The lobby is on the third floor which is somewhat strange. There is lovely decor and a nice courtyard area with tables for drinks. The restaurant was very good and the bar offers great live music. It is a very traditional Ritz. However our stay at the Ritz was plagued by many problems. They first put us in a room where we unpacked, and then went to lunch at the hotel. While eating we see them rolling away our luggage. They were moving our room because there were two people who had reservations with the same last name and they had given us their room. However, they never called us to tell us, and they left all of our unpacked belongings in the other room. It then took them a few hours until they had another room ready for us. Additionally, we after the mix-up we asked them to confirm our reservation and they only had us in the system for one night when we had a reservation confirmation for two nights. Also, they told us they would give us our first night free because of the mix-up but it never got into the system so we had to fight with them on checkout because the same people were not working. They did give us access to the concierge level for our trouble and that was very nice because we had lovely breakfasts and lunches and appetizers in the club for free. The rooms were fine. There was not a large assortment of toiletries but the ones provided were nice, Bvlgari. The towels were not very soft. One night they forgot to give us soap and we never received turndown service.

We saw several people being turned away at the door. We liked that security was tight. The lobby is on the 3rd floor and you have to change elevators to get to the room floors. Added to the security element I guess, but it was a little annoying. Our room was ready at 3 PM as promised although we saw many people who were waiting well after 6 pm for their rooms. Our king room was not big - and the bath area is completely seperate - which was nice but it makes the room feel even smaller. The room decor was identical to that pictured on the website. The bedding is very nice with a feather bed on the mattress - comfortable! Our one window was large with a great view of Canal St. There is a TV, mini bar, large desk and a comfortable chair.

We managed one to Commander's Palace for Sunday Brunch, but we never even thought to ask him to return to get us. We ended up walking all the way back to the hotel (almost 3 miles) which wasn't a bad idea after a big brunch - but I could have used other shoes to make the trip!

Room service also took an extremely long time to arrive.

What was great: The lounge called The Library. Very nice place for couples to go, relax, have a drink, and listen to music. My husband also had a cigar, so be aware if you don't like that sort of thing (although it was well ventilated and I was not bothered by smoke at all).

The lady who helped us get in the elevator to the 3rd floor check in area was a delight. The girl at the front desk asked me upon check in if we wanted a room on the upper floors or lower floors. I explained that it didn't matter, but what was important is that we had a room close to an elevator as my elderly Mother has trouble walking. Needless to say room 635 was at the absolute farthest distance from the elevator. I was going to go back down, but Mom said it was OK, as long as we walked slow. The room was really very good looking, big and comfortable. We did notice that there was only one garbage bin that we kept moving in between the bathroom and living area. Shampoos, robes, etc. were great. Pads of paper were near the phones, but there were no pens. Breakfast the next day was absolutely one of the worst experiences I have had in hotel eating. Other guests were walking out in disgust. I thought perhaps it was because it was Xmas Eve and who do you get to work. But where was the management. They had enought staff, they were simply incompetent. I never take it out with a bad tip, but this time, I just couldn't leave one dollar. T.J. the bartender was very friendly and made great drinks. We enjoyed it there. Concierge service was completely acceptable. Room service was quick and had a nice presentation. Housekeeping was just a bit below average. Our coffee service was not replenished so I had to call. Instead of bringing the regular cream, etc. a girl brought up powdered cream and sugar in a plastic cup. Also, we had to call every night in order to have the room cleaned. If you don't call, it won't get done until 10pm. Often we returned to the room at 6pm, and nothing was done.

The Ritz New Orleans is by far one of the nicest hotels in the world, and truly the best New Orleans has to offer. As you can see it continually garners wonderful reviews from guests, and that person who wrote the review about it being dirty or horrible clearly had no idea what they are talking about. On cleanliness, you cannot get cleaner in the city of New Orleans. As a native, I have seen most of the other hotels in the city and they were updated years before Katrina, and they have still yet to recieve a facelift. The older hotels have a distinct smell of must, which is completely absent from the Ritz. The lobby and common areas are always gleaming and smell of wonderful gardenia candles that are burning 24/7. The most important feature however, is the utterly gracious and friendly staff who are willing to go the extra mile for you. I want to correct something another post says about moving the lobby to the third floor because of Katrina. Again as a native and having stayed at the Ritz before Katrina want to say that the lobby for check in has always been on the third floor. The lobby you enter from canal or from the valet area has always been the arrival lobby, and the third floor lobby was for check in. The hotel looks exactly the same as it did before the storm, the only changes are that Jeremy Davenport now entertains in the Melange restaurant, and the French Quarter Bar goes largely unused, I believe due to the crowds that flock to see him, not the storm.

Where we ate: Breakfast at the Club Level-light stuff, fruit, berries, etc. which was good, considering our other meals. Lunch-Masperas (sp?) one day as I was scouring the city for a soft-shelled crab po-boy. Hot and hungry, settled for a shrimp sandwich (po-boy like, but on a bun) and it was good. The line outside cracked me up-all these cranky and hot people waiting to get in-you feel like you've won the lottery to get in AC. Other lunch-New Orleans School of Cooking which is in the quarter, 2 1/2-3 hrs., good food, very entertaining. Loved their jambalaya, bread pudding and pralines but the gumbo was just soso as they had to make it in less than 4-6 hrs. Dinners-the hotel restaurant. Crab trio was great, filet with crab was good, hubby's was so bad he had to complain (very unusual as he'll eat most anything). Great jazz band in there, preceded by a female singer who was also good. Also went to Commander's Palace. The BEST service I've received that I can remember, ever. Very reasonable ($39 for appetizer/entree/dessert!)-started with the waiter's suggestion of crawfish something-it was divine. Hubby said the turtle soup was good, not great. He regularly eats it at the Brennans in Houston which he prefers. Entrees were soft-shelled crab prepared with some other stuff-I'm sorry I can't remember. The crab was very good. DH had a fish dish that had crabmeat which he loved. The dessert...I truly have never tasted better cheesecake in my entire life! They make their own cream cheese! Hubby had the praline parfait but couldn't stay out of my cheesecake. We had the rest wrapped up to fit in the little fridge. It was that good. The hotel: Smells WONDERFUL! Beautiful flowers, great service (although they forgot turndown both nights), nice bathrooms with separate toilet area, nice furniture in the rooms, and frette linens!!! Slept like a baby... Other things we did: lots of walking around, antiquing, looking at art, took a nice carriage ride and got to see a funeral! You must see a New Orleans funeral! The band plays jazz (happy or sad, depending on the direction they're going) and the mourners follow it, carrying umbrellas. It was so moving, we got out of the carraige to pay our respects. I know this probably doesn't sound very action packed to most of you, but we really needed to relax this weekend. We did walk around with a 'hand grenade' which was a green drink in a silly glass. Thats always fun. And we spent Sunday morning watching Nadal beat Federer...again! Thanks for reading and please don't hesitate to visit NOLA.

We'd stayed here before, but not since Katrina. I was happy to see that while the city has a long way to go to recover, the major tourism venues were in good shape and doing brisk business. The Ritz was no exception. We had an immaculate and spacious corner room on a high floor, which offered views of the French Quarter and Canal Street (though I could have done without the Canal Street noise at times). Ritz bedding is magically comfortable and luxurious, and were it not for lots of activities planned, I could have whiled away hours in bed. The marble-clad bathroom was cool and clean, though it did take a while for hot water to make it to our shower. Service was generally excellent, but there were a few lapses -- no turndown service one night; no corkscrew to open minibar wine bottles. I'm willing to forgive quite a bit, given how hard it's been for many New Orleans business to retain good employees, but I really didn't have to. In fact, some service, such as valet for our rented car, was better than before. While I personally like the hotel's location -- I'd rather be on the edqe of the Quarter than in it -- it's clearly not for everyone. And recovery has not quite reached Canal Street beyond the Ritz. However, if you stay on Canal between the hotel and the river, and stay in the FQ, you'll be fine. One final thought: I HATE to be cold. And while I could keep the temp in my room just the way I like it, the hotel corridors seemed like an absolute icebox to me (and we had a long hike, since our room was as far from the elevator lobby as possible). Since I routinely carry a pashmina with me when I travel, I often had it with me when going out to dinner, as restaurants seem over-air-conditioned to me as well. I'm actually glad I had the wrap to get from my room to the outside as well!

Once in the room, there were several curly black hairs in the sink and in the tub- absolutely disgusting. The room was very small - would have been perfect for one- crowded for two. The bathroom was so small that all it had was a small standup sink and a small ledge above where you could cram your toiletries. There were only two bath towels and we had to call several times for extras because they do not check when they turn down the bed at night. We were promised a king bed and it definitely was a queen. The view was out to an abandoned building - so no view at all. Our luggage did not arrive for over an hour- we were told a large group checked in and they had \"lost our luggage\". The worst was the water situation. The showers took forever to heat - and once it did - it was tepid. We would get bursts of hot and cold water while showering. I have not had this happen in lesser quality hotels and certainly not a hotel like the Ritz. When we checked out- our bill was several hundred dollars more than it should have been.

Wow was I impressed! From the moment we entered the lobby, we could tell that we were definitely in a five star hotel. The entrance is on Canal St. and you step onto gorgeous marble flooring as soon as you enter through the doors. The bellmen are extremely professional and courteous; not stuck-up at all but down to earth type of professionals. To get to the lobby, you have to take the elevators to the third floor passing large plate glass windows of evening gowns that I guess are on sale in the promenade shops. As soon as you step off of the elevator into the lobby, the smell of orchids surrounds you as there is an enormous bouquet of them on a central table and dozens of orchid laced small planters throughout the lobby. If you like the feel of France;(I can compare, been there twice); you will love the lobby-period funishings, chandeliers, a beautiful flower-laced courtyard that you can sit in and have coffee which can be viewed from the lobby. I cannot say enough about the professionalism and courteousness of the staff; especially after coming from a hotel in the Tunica, Mississippi area where we received service \"with an attitude\". The Ritz (at least in New Orleans) must really go out of their way to train their staff on professionalism, courteousness and the importance of immediacy. Our room was a city view on the 7th floor that gave us an exceptional view of Canal St. which is incidentally lined with palm trees and cable cars which gives you a local feel. The room was lovely with four floor to ceiling windows; (we had a corner room) with white sheer curtains and blackout curtains for the early morining sun. The beds were extraordinary with goose down comforters and feathered pillows; (you can live by the old saying: you get what you pay for here. It is well worth it). There was also a small, antique-elegant dressing table in a vestibule-great for women putting on make-up. The bathroom; (of which I am an ultra critic) was gorgeous-as soon as you step in you are surrounded by white, gold and silver. It was so clean, we didn't wear our shoes inside. White marble floors/walls, mirrors, glass shelves; (polished of course), REAL bathmats; (white) not the towels most hotels put out for you, recessed lighting, separate toilet area with door; even the toiletpaper dispensers were polished silver! Bulgari bath products, linen eyelet shower curtains. Only disappointment was the shower; large rainfall showerhead that sort of dripped on you.

With that said, when we arrived at the hotel at 3 o'clock in the afternoon we were first told our room was ready, then it would a few minutes, so they would buy a drink, very nice. After an hour we were told, someone else actually had our room, so it would be a few more minutes. I should interject here, that some of the staff were very poorly trained and acted as if we were inconviencing them because they were so busy. We were told to go to the lounge and wait they would call us on our cell phone. Finally at 5:30, 2 and 1/2 hours after we arrived, we went back to the registation desk. The woman said, \"We have plenty of rooms in the club section, we will upgrade you\". But what she meant was we will put you in club level and charge you more. It was an extra $150 per night. We were tired from our flight and said fine. So finally after now 3 hours we were about to get to a room. Here is the kicker, when we got to the room it was occuppied. I mean, the bell boy, actually opened the door, we walked in and someone was in there! Finally got a room 3 and 1/2 hours after arriving. By the way, many other people had to wait for their rooms and we were told they were short staffed for cleaning rooms. I'd like to assume that my experience was due in part to Mardi Gras, problems finding staff in the wake of Katrina, and a hotel being renovated. ROOM Nice bed, but suprisingly a regular TV, 24 inch, limited cable. Great bathtub and a menu of exotic baths they will prepare for you. Bulgari bathroom amenities. High speed internet, but they charge you an additional $12.95 on top of the $500 plus a night they are already getting during Mardi Gras for a club level room. CLUB LOUNGE While they state 5 \"tastings\" or meals, in reality there is only 5 on Friday & Saturday. The other days it is really only 4, in fact the 4th or last of the day is simply drinks and some desserts. Overall I'm not sure if the club level is worth the extra money, in our case about $150 extra per night on top of a standard room for around $350 during Mardi Gras. In addition, it should be noted that getting to the club level requires 2 elevators and a walk. To get to your room requires a 3rd elevator. They claim a new elevator direct to the street will be open in April, so that should no longer be an issue. LOCATION While you are close to Bourbon St. and the French Quarter, it is not in the safest area of New Orleans. Be careful at night near the hotel and DO NOT WALK THE WRONG WAY UP CANAL ST. If you've been drinking, take a taxi back to the hotel. Also, always ask taxi drivers to turn on their meters. New Orleans taxi drivers are notorius for ripping off their fares. CONCIERGE We had really wanted to go to Jaces Imo's restrurant. We asked the concierge to make a reservation and she simply said it is closed. I would've expected another recommendation at least.

The rest of our stay was decent - my only other complaint would be the elevator set up - you enter from Canal St. on the 1st floor and take one of 4 elevators to the 3rd floor which is where reception, bars, and restaurants are - then you must take one of another set of elevators to reach the guest room floors. Not a major deal, but when the hotel is full on the weekends, you are forced to wait with throngs of revelers waiting to enter/exit the hotel's elevators. Also forget room service for breakfast, WAY too overpriced and taxed and service slow - just slip on a pair of shorts, a shirt, some sandals and meander through the FQ to the Frencn Market and Cafe du Monde for beignets and chickory coffee. Heck, on the weekends you can even skip the shower as the stench in the FQ will leave anyone smelling like a daisy!", "Date": "August 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "jefritz", "Title": "\u201cWe'd stay there again!\u201d", "Author": "jefritz", "ReviewID": "UR3766495", "Content": "Upon our arrival at the New Orleans Airport on Saturday, August 13, 2005 my husband phoned The Ritz to see if we could get an early check-in.

Only one robe was hanging in the closet so we had to call for another robe, which was brought up promptly. There was a bounty of snacks to eat but there was not a list of what the costs would be. We left for the afternoon and returned later on about 7:00pm. A maid was a few doors down when my husband asked her if she could show him where the ice machine was. She was pleasant. He then informed her that we would be leaving the room in about 45 minutes. She wanted to know if we would like turn down service. He told her we would. We left the hotel for our dinner and came back about 9:30pm and the room had not been turned down. We changed clothes and left again but called housekeeping asking for turn down service. We were disappointed when we arrived back to our room about midnight and found that the bed had not been turned down, no fresh towels. The next morning we called for fresh towels and they were brought up promptly. I would say that the overall bad thing about the hotel might be the maid service.

Their exercise room at the spa had enough cardio equipment (no cross-trainers), but only adequate weight training equipment. One problem I did have was obtaining internet access for my laptop.

There were generally several cabs waiting to go outside the Ritz and that was never an issue.The location of the hotel was also great.
