After the arrival at Sabiha G\u00c3\u00b6kcen we took a taxi from Taksim Place for the fixed price of 20 TL. Seems a bit expensive now but well... The two receptionists were quite friendly and helpful and their knowledge of English was sufficient for our needs. Although we arrived very early in the morning we had to wait just 20 minutes until we could go to our room and were offered free breakfast in the meantime. Negative Point: The doorman. We met him first when he took our luggage to the room although we were really able to do this by ourselves. It's about tip business. Well, he didn't seem to be happy with the amount we gave him and stayed cold to unfriendly for the rest of our stay. Our room was on the 3rd floor with disco and bus station inclusive. So it was quite noisy at night if you left the window open, but the ear plugs did its job. The room and the bathroom were clean and cleaned every day. It was totally okay for the price we payed. The surroundings of the hotel are quite shabby. Looks a bit \"dangerous\" but as we are big girls we didn't care to much about that. The tram is not far away and the famous tourist attractions can be reached by walk in less than 30 minutes. Breakfast was not too fancy but suitable. B\u00c3\u00b6rek, sausages, cheese, sweet cookies, cereals, eggs, pudding, olives, tomatoes, soup. Coffee, two kinds of juices, I missed some water, as the juices weren't that delicious. I can recommend Hotel Avlonya if you don't mind shabby surroundings, the hotel itself was quite well for our Istanbul trip.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cClean rooms, nice breakfast for a budget hotel in old town\u201d", "Author": "Solotravelman35", "ReviewID": "UR66526825", "Content": "I chose this hotel after the recommendation of a collegue and I stayed there several times. This is a real three star hotel chartered from the Turkish Tourism and Culture Ministry. I had to stay in a hotel near old town related with my business. There are sure many hotels in old town of Istanbul with much better locations, but the prices get higher. During I stayed there, I visited some other hotels nearby which may have better services. There are some hotels in Laleli, Aksaray district with swimming pools, spas, etc, but with lower service quality. There are also some similar budget hotels with cheaper prices. But I would advise this hotel to the ones for those who cares hygene in rooms, bathrooms, during breakfast. The staff seems not so professional, but they were friendly and trying their best. The only minus point for the hotel may be the district. Aksaray and Laleli is known with prostitution, so the district may not be suitable for solo travelling ladies. But I see that the places related with prostitution such as some hotels with discos, discos, some underground restaurants, etc. are being punished and closed. So, I think the district will be better in a short time. I hope a nice accomodation in Avlonya Hotel.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "romania", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "andyx28", "ReviewID": "UR35617974", "Content": "The hotel is at a stone's throw from Beyazit Boulevard, about 5-6 minutes brisk walk. From there you can either walk or take the tram to reach the historical centre of Istanbul. The hotel staff is friendly enough and ready to please the customers. Whenever we had a problem it was duly taken care of. The room we stayed in was clean, average size, with TV and fully functional air conditioning; nice and clean bathroom with hair dryer, towels and toilet paper. The street noise was a bit too loud during the day and there was a persistent smell of something which I could not quite define, but once I got used to it it didn't even bother me anylonger. We ate breakfast everyday at the hotel as it was varied enough and quite tasty and if lunch time caught us near the hotel, there were plenty of small restaurants to choose from and even one McDonald's (I strongly recommend Dondurmali Tatli, which is a combination of Turkish icecream and the usual pie they sell at McDonald's). All in all, the hotel was good value for the money we paid and although it would certainly not suit the taste of a fussy traveller it remains a nice and comfortable place for one whose only requirements are cleanliness, a cosy bed to sleep on and a good shower.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Avlonya Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d295504-Reviews-Avlonya_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">59 Kucuk Langa Caddesi 52415</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "295504", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/6f/aa/avlonya-hotel-thumbnail.jpg"}}
