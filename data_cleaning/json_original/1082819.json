{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great location! This hotel was recommended by one of our Japanese friends. It is located in the centre of Tokyo city, Ginza area. Although the room is not very big, it is enough for a family with 2 children.The hotel's rate is USD150. The location of this hotel is EXCELLENT. Once you go out of the hotel's main entrance, turn left, take a walk for 2 minutes, you can find a big (8 storeys) toy shop, which named (HAKUHINKAN) TOY PARK. BURBERRY boutique is located next door of TOY PARK. Besides, many branded shops and boutiques are lined along this street. For example, Louis Vuitton is located about 5 minutes walk behind the hotel.Another good advantage is the hotel is near to JR Shimbashi station(around 5 minutes walk), that you can access any Tokyo main stations sthrough Shimbashi Station.We enjoyed our shopping very much by staying this hotel.The hotel's website:http://www.ginkoku.co.jp/eng/", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR661008263", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "feipoalice"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d1082819-r18587513-Ginza_International_Hotel-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1082819", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
