It is very near the colosseum. It\u2019s about a 15 -20 min walk to the trevi fountain so I wouldn\u2019t say it was right in the centre. The nearest place to go eat is Trastervere which is about a 10 minute walk over the river. You can get get a good deal there, 3 courses plus drink for 8 Euro! The reception staff were very pleasant and the hotel lobby is very nice. When we first arrived we were given room 104 on the ground floor, this room is quite large, clean and modern with a lovely bathroom although the window is so high up you had to be 9ft tall to look out of it..so I asked to move the next day and we were given a garden view room (double standard) . This room was like a shoe box and not worth over 200 euros a night. After complaining they upgraded us for the last night into a junior suite room. This room was fantastic and more like the rooms you see on the website. One good thing about all of the the rooms was they have the most comfortable beds I have ever sleep in!!! Breakfast has a very good selection of fruit, toast, pastries and hot food. This is included in the room rates.

Overall I was very happy with the Hotel and our stay here, it definitely surpased our expectations and we had a very reasonably priced Junior Suite which we stayed in for five nights. The hotel staff were professional and friendly, The hotel was quite modern and as mentioned by others the garden was quiet a nice addition. The views were quite beautiful and the hotel is right across the street from the Roman Gardens, 2 minutes from the Circus Maximus and 15 minutes from the Colloseum. I felt quite lucky with the location. Of course, there was the subway and bus service but we liked to walk everywhere in the center and visit the main attractions. which is definitely possible from here. The hotel room was a 2 floored junior suite. The bathroom was clean and modern, there was a sofa, nice view and TV downstairs and a comfortable bed upstairs with another big tv. I loved the room's style and had no problems or concerns with it, I think the hotel excels in this category. Breakfast was nice, there was plenty of it but really we stuck to coffee, fruit and yogurt. Overall I was pleasently suprised with the Hotel and with the prices on offer would be happy to return. Sadly we did not try the restaurant, judging from the menu it was reasonably priced and it had a decent variety, but we had too many restaurants to try in the city in only 5 days.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Price, Excellent Location and the Service to go with it\u201d", "Author": "Lee B", "ReviewID": "UR128098043", "Content": "Me and my girlfriend went for a long weekend away to Rome and decided to book Hotel Kolbe through Expedia.

Again, lots of space, big bathroom (with bathtub) and all the toiletries needed. It had patio doors directly to the hotel's garden, which was beautiful and very quiet (only heard the church bells ringing on sunday morning for a few minutes at around 8am). Breakfast was good, though on saturday morning it was very crowded and understaffed. This reflected on a slow service cleaning up the tables, and setting them again for new customers, and refilling some of the food platters as well. Nothing that would bother you if you're not on a rush. Otherwise, nice pastries, fruit, yogurts... a bit disappointing to have a automatic coffee machine in Italy (a hand made cappuccino would be a lot nicer). WiFi didn't work very well in our room, but maybe that's because it was a bot far from the reception area. In terms of location, the hotel is just outside the roman forum (though the entrance to the forum is on the opposite side - 10 minute walk), very close to circus maximus. There are lots of buses just on the road behind the hotel and across from circus maximus. Easy to walk to Piazza Venezia (through a hill - Capitol Hill), and just across the river from Trastevere (great for restaurants and bars - 10 minute walk).

I have to say firstly the service we received was superb, the staff were very helpful and check-in and out was a breeze. The hotel itself is in an amazing location if you like the forum architecture, the coliseum and a quiet location, its perfect for you, it sits just off the track at circus maximus and within a walk of about 10 minutes of one of Rome\u2019s metro lines, Rome only has two metro lines by the way, but it is a nice walk to it. We were given a courtyard room, with large doors that opened up into a private garden space which the hotel is surrounding. This was a nice surprise and was very picturesque, the patio bar attached to the restaurant offered a nice quiet area, with the exception of the Sunday morning bells, to sit and enjoy breakfast & coffee. Breakfast was included in the package we booked, and we found the buffet breakfast well stocked and with ample selection to suit the carnivore or vegetarian and everything in between. Rome is always a walking holiday and this hotel is ideally situated for a walk around the back towards the coliseum or around the front and along the river Tiber. The room size was good, not too large, but in comparison to some of the rooms I\u2019ve previously stayed at in New York or Paris, I found it ok, not huge, but with enough space to relax. The hotel has a maze of corridors that made finding our way back to the room interesting, but overall it was fine and comfortable. On the whole the staff was really friendly, there was one staff member who could come across as rude if you put him in an American, Irish or British context, but really he was helpful, if only seeming slightly rushed or hassled. All the rest of the staff would bend over backwards to complete a task, and we were there in their quiet season so they did everything with a smile even with the seasons minimum staff requirements. .

Breakfast was Continental buffet style and bacon & scrambled eggs being replaced regularly so always fresh and plenty of fruit yoghurts cereal croissants etc. The location was great for the Roman Forum and the Colosseum with all the other sights within walking distance. After a full day walking around Rome it was nice to sit in the bar and have a glass of wine and had a good laugh with the staff on the bar and also chatted to other residents who were also there to see the Rugby. Unfortunatey it snowed the weekend we visited so the Colosseum & Forum was closed but we still saw lots and now have a great excuse to go back later in the year. The hotel can also arrange taxi transfers at good prices. We could not fault the hotel, staff and the standards (My husband works abroad so stays in hotels all the time and is very fussy & he didn't complain once).

You can walk around the Forum, past Circo Maximus to get to the main entrance and the Colosseum. The hotel is a converted convent, which makes for an interesting back story. Rooms are small but nice, we had one with a loft. The ceilings are exposed brick and wood beams. Tall windows give a great view of the gardens. Since the back faces the garden, you don\u2019t have to deal with traffic noise. Our bathroom was high end and spotless, but unfortunately smelled a little like there might be a septic tank problem. The bathroom in my sister\u2019s room did not have the smell. Beds are European hard \u2013 no Heavenly Beds here. Nice, fluffy towels. Hot breakfast buffet is very good \u2013 eggs, sausage, bacon, cereal, yogurt, lots of pastries. I know this is pretty standard in European hotels, but I love the self-serve espresso machine.

During my first two nights in Rome, I stayed at the woefully inferior Atlante Garden Hotel (see my review on Tripadvisor). So, I was determined to find an excellent and affordable hotel for my final night in Rome and thankfully the Kolbe Hotel Rome met and exceeded all my expectations. I cannot recommend this 4 Star hotel highly enough and do not have any negative comments to make about my stay there. I only wish I had stayed there for my first two nights in the city as well. I would not hesitate to stay at the Kolbe Hotel Rome again if I returned to visit the city in the future. To keep this review simple, I list the positives about this hotel under a series of headings: The Room This was a Standard Double, but the quality and size of it was in keeping with a Superior or Deluxe Double. The room overlooked the Palatine, which was a special and unexpected added bonus. The spatial scale of the room approached the size of some suites at other hotels I have stayed in, except it did not have a separate lounge area. The main room and bathroom were in superb condition and kept immaculately clean. You do have the option to book rooms overlooking the rear garden too. The Common Areas The overall appearance of the hotel is modern, with a sense of elegant understatement. There is no ostentation and dramatic grandeur found in some 5 Star hotels and I\u2019d say this is a refreshing attribute. The comfortable, spacious feel of the room extended to the common areas in the hotel, such as the reception lounge and restaurant. All areas were maintained to a superlative standard with exemplary cleanliness throughout, including the lobby toilets. A unique and delightful feature of the hotel is the rear garden, which has the atmosphere you would expect from a building which was a former monastery. The garden, weather permitting, in is a lovely place to relax and absorb the peaceful energy, which pervades it. There is a narrow terrace area on the hotel side of the garden, immediately outside the restaurant, replete with tables and chairs, where you eat your breakfast or dinner. The Staff I found all the staff I spoke to friendly, helpful and efficient. I was made to feel very welcome and enjoyed their urbane, Latin charm mixed with the right level of attentiveness. The Buffet Breakfast If this is not included with your room booking it costs an extra 10 Euros and is incredibly good value. The format is \u201cAmerican\u201d with a generous array of fresh fruit, pastries, cereal, fried foods (bacon, tomatoes, eggs, etc), yoghurts, fruit juices, toast and condiments and hot drinks. The Location I don\u2019t know what more you can ask for in Rome, except it being closer to the Vatican. As previously mentioned the front of the hotel overlooks the back of the Palatine, which adjoins the Roman Forum and is one of the largest settlements from Ancient Rome remaining in the city. You can walk to the Palatine and Roman Forum complex from the hotel in about 10 to 15 minutes. If this was not enough, the Colosseum is situated just to the other side of the Palatine. What more could you want if you have a short stay in Rome?

We spent over 80 euro and didn't like a single thing we ordered.. very disappointing.. the first night's dinner across the river at Trastevere was less than 30 euro and we were completely satisfied.. needless to say, we only ate at the hotel that one time.

At the railway station we approached the official white taxi rank and was assigned a taxi by the guy in charge. Unfortunately, the older gentlemen driving the Opel Astra estate ripped us off. In what appears to be a typical ploy he didn't drop us exactly at the front door of the hotel then did a switch on the bank notes he was given so double charging us twice. The fare should be in the region of 15 euro so best to check with the hotel for current rates and be very obvious when handing over the money. The driver who took us back the station was of similar vintage (and car!) but we agreed the fare at the outset and counted it out very deliberately. Neither driver had their meter switched on and these are official taxis. The hotel itself is right next to the Forum and our room actually looked over the wall so at night we had no difficulties with the neighbours. The room was well insulated so the cobbles outside did not affect us. Actually when we first got there we were taken to a room at the back overlooking the courtyard but that had not been made up. This taken with the taxi ride and the attitude of the front of desk (who gave the distinct impression of being the owner) gave us a poor first impression of Rome which did improve as the stay went on. The location doesn't appear to be the most central as the streets are quite winding as you walk towards the centre and the Forum forms a large obstacle to getting easily to other attractions but which are actually close by (as the crow flys). In the same little street you will find the Belgian Embassy, an indoor farmers' market (Sat and Sun), a very swish bakery plus a nice little local bar where you can get nice toasted sandwiches for a packed lunch and watch the football with the locals - this is right across the road from the Circus Maximus. Ruined temples abound and you are right next to some amazing sights.Tour buses leave from just around the corner. We ate every night in the hotel where the food was excellent, as was the service - our waiter and waitress were very friendly and attentive.

That night we decied to wwatch some TV but the only channel we had in english was sky news and the sound kept cutting out, I didnt complain about this as I didnt come to rome to watch TV and this was just a minor annoyance. The next day we went down to breakfast, there was a great selection of food, cold meats, toast, pastries, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese and ham toasties and cereals. there was also good choice of drinks, coffee, tea and jucies. My partner sampled just about everything and recommeded the pastries, I always opted for the english breakfast, it was acceptable but the eggs and bacon were very greasy and the sausage tasted like hot dogs, i still ate this everday though it tasted fine. If you do sit outside for breakfast you will be harrassed by pigeons, they wait for you to finish or turn your back and then pounce on your food, its a little irritating but you can just shoo them away. After breakfast we would go out in rome and explore the sights, I have to say that the hotel has a great location, its only a 10-15 minuite walk to the colosseum and about the same distance to the capitol and the Vittorio Emanuele II's Monument (which is breathtaking may I add). We went during furogusto and lots of resturaunts, bars, clothes shops and market stalls were set up on the side of the tiber, it was really beautiful lit up on a night and quiet cheap as it was mostly aimed at locals not tourists. we walked down the riverside ever night and it was only a 5-10 minuite walk from the hotel. There are some nice places to eat in trastevere just accross the river; try La Scala the food is quiet expensive but its very good quality and there were alot of locals in there. On the second day in rome i sprained my ankel and the hotel staff were kind enough to provide an ice pack for my foot, they were always polite and say bonjourno when they see you even the maids, who do a very nice job of cleaning the room, we always had clean towels, there was a smalll leak under the sink, we informed the front desk as we went out and by the time we returned this had been fixed, they provided good service and always tried to help if you asked for anything. We did eat at the hotel one night and were offered a complimentary glass of champagne, I had the steak with potatoes and red wine sauce, the food was good quality and the steak was cooked perfectly, buut prices were extortionate and we ended up spending 78 euros on 2 main courses and 2 drinks. I would recommend to eat out of the hotel and sample the local resturaunts. There is a very nice local pizza place near piazza augusto down Via Ara Pacis, its caulled luigis, just across the road from gusto's, about 4 euros for half a pizza and its gorgeous, we actually had seconds ( make sure you take a phrase book as they dont speak a word of english here and you will need to order in Italian) One more thing, the water in the hotel room is safe to drink and we filled our water bottles up everyday from the tap, neither of us ever got sick from the water, its also safe to fill up from the water fountains in the streets, and we filled our water bottles from these fountains everyday. overall we had a great holiday and the staff were friendly and provided a good service, the hotel had a great location and it was only minor things that lt it down. the hotel is expensive but then most hotels in rome are.

We were switched the next day...and what a difference. We were moved to our new room (Room 115)....a reasonable sized room with a king size bed and a huge bathroom including jacuzzi bath and 'rain' shower, and doors opening onto the hotel garden. I have no doubt this was probably a 'superior' room and give credit to the hotel for making up for the experience in Room 218. However the point is that there are vast differences in the rooms in this hotel which could affect anyone's stay. The location of this hotel is also subjective. It is right next to the roman forum...but on the other side of the Capitoline Hill from the city. The most direct route to the city centre therefore involves scaling the Hill each time. Obviously you can walk around it but for the elderly or infirm I certainly could not recommend this hotel for location/ access. The nearest Metro station (circo massimo) is a 5-10 minute walk and there is no tram stop nearby Breakfast was the best we had on our Italian trip, which in itself is not a major compliment. However, there was a limited range of hot food - scrambled egg, sausages (actually mini hot-dogs), and streaky bacon - as well as the usual range of jucies, cereals, fruit, tea/coffee etc. Overall, we had a mixed experience - probably positive in the main - with a beautiful room for 2 nights, decent breakfast, and good service, coupled with the fact that we are both mobile and had no real trouble with the pretty inaccessible hotel location", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location and had everything correct\u201d", "Author": "Bn1_Jon", "ReviewID": "UR79530916", "Content": "Great location next to the Forum.

Check in was quick and easy and the staff were very friendly. The room was comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. We took advice from the review of another traveller and emailed the hotel in advance of our trip and asked for a quiet room - we were given a room at the rear over looking the garden which was quiet and had a pretty outlook. Breakfast is very good - there is an excellent choice of food from cooked through to pastries, yoghurts and a vast array of really fresh ripe fruit. The hotel is ideally located in old Rome, with the Forum practically outside the hotel door. The hotel is near to the Colosseum and is in easy walking distance of al of the main sights - it was lovely to wander through the back streets to get to Vatican City, Piazza Navone etc. The hotel ha a lovely bar and perhaps the only negative is that the drinks are fairly pricey - however this really isn't a problem with so many cafes and restaurants nearby and within easy walking distance. We found many lovely restaurants in the Traveste region where you could get great tasting pizza, pasta wine and beer for two and still have change from 15 Euros. It's fun to eat at the Piazza Navone - but much more pricey. I would certainly recommend that you take anti mosquito spray or cream with you - especially if you like to sit in the garden at the Kolbe after returning from a long day of sightseeing in order to avoid being munched...if you do get munched the pharmacist in the nearby pharmacy is very helpful and is able to sell the perfect cream to treat the bites !! When we first got to Rome we took the Terra vision bus from the airport - there is a ticket booth just to the right as you go through to the arrival lounge after collecting baggage. The ticket price was very reasonable - for us 8 euros per person for a return ticket. The bus leaves from just outside the door of the airport and takes you to the station. We then took a taxi to the hotel - I suspect that we probably paid more than we should have done and you certainly need to negotiate a price and be firm. However on reflection I think that taking a taxi was worthwhile and ensured that we got to the hotel without too much hassle. On the way back we actually walked from the hotel back to the station to catch the bus - its a good 40 minute walk at a fairly brisk pace. On arriving at the station its quite hard to find the terravision departure stand - you need to walk through the station main entrance, head to the left and turn right out through the door. You will see the terravision cafe and the booking office is inside - the leaflet doesn't tell you that you need to get a pink booking card from the office before you stand in the queue. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Rome.

The bathrooms were lovely - the power shower was great! The rooms were small, but being in Rome, you don't spend much time in there anyhow. A good 4* standard. Wifi access was 20 euros for our entire stay, which was very reasonable. The best thing about the hotel is the location. Many hotels in Rome are in termini, which is a good walk from the majority of the sites. From our hotel, we could walk to the Colosseum, piazza navona, pantheon etc within 15 minutes. Also, there was a metro stop about 5 minutes walk away, which is about 2 stops from termini (where you can catch the express train to the airport). We only ate in the hotel restaurant once (probably because it was very expensive!), but I had the most enjoyable meal of my entire trip. The service was second to none and the quality of the food was fabulous. Good wine too! Definitely worth a visit. Excellent reception staff - very knowledegable. A few general tips, which I wish I knew before going to Rome. BEWARE of taxis. A 60 euro cab ride from termini to the hotel (about 2 miles max) left a sour taste for the rest of the holiday (but a positive thing was that we never got in a taxi again for the whole holiday, and I arrived home feeling very fit!). A quick google will reveal that this is a big problem in Rome, and I won't waste time by telling you all the various tricks they use on tourists to rip them off. Sometimes agreeing a fare in advance won't even help. Basically, if you stay in a hotel in the centre (like this one), there should never be any need to take a taxi. Eat in trastavere. The food is much cheaper and of a higher quality than in those restaurants close to the main tourist sites. Get a tour guide for the vatican.

The location is across the street from the Forum, but the actual entrance is a short walk away. Rome is a walking city, but everything you need is within a 20-30 minute walk. We used some buses, and the front desk was very helpful in giving us directions. From the Coluseum it was about a 20 minute walk. Walking is actually easier than it seems by looking at a map. It's not as far as it looks. Based on other reviews, I asked for a garden view room, and it was very quiet. Our room was a junior suite, with the bathroom, sofa, TV, and desk downstairs, and just a bed upstairs. Apparently there are two types of Jr suites - one like ours with gargen view and two levels, and one where it's on one level but facing the road (which cold be noisy). The breakfast was included, and had everything you could ask for - pastries, eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, etc. They will even make eggs at your request (the buffet eggs had milk so we asked for pure egg), even like sunny side or other requests. They even provided gluten free bread. It made for a wonderful start each day and with all the walking you'll need energy! WiFi rates were also reasonable, and there was even an \"all stay\" rate of 20E (for the duration of your stay), but I don't know who would be staying in their room enough to make full use of that with all the beauty of Rome to see! The only two things I was disappointed with was the fact that I had to call three times to get an iron, and when we arrived the room was cold. We tried to raise the temperature, but it wouldn't get warm, so we called the front desk and they adjusted it from there. Apparently, as is common in Europe, they limit or shut off the A/C or head seasonally, and you have to request them to change it. In this case we had to ask twice to get a comfortable temperature. Another good point is that it's only a 15-20 minute walk to Trasevere, across the river, where there are literally hundreds of restaurants to choose from. Try to check out the piazza in front of the Santa Maria church where this hilarious European-style mime who plays there at night. We saw him about 10 PM but I'm sure he's there quite a bit.

Frankly, I was disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high given all the excellent reviews this hotel received. Let's start with the location. On paper, it sounds great. The hotel faces the Roman Forum (the back of it really). However, the entrance to the Roman Forum is actually on the other side, about a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel, which is not too bad but I expected it to be significantly closer to the hotel. The other main attractions are also within walking distance (except the Vatican) but it's a good 20-25 minute walk to them, again not nearly as close as I thought they would be to the hotel. The cobblestone streets don't help much either. Secondly, even though the hotel is pretty clean/in pretty good condition, it could use a renovation/revamp. The hotel/ furniture is dull and simple. It's definitely not an elegant/fancy hotel. The rooms were the most disappointing. We stayed in a family/quad room. The ceilings were high, giving the illusion of a spacious room, however it's anything but. The bathroom was small considering it's intended for 4 people. The beds were sofa beds not actual beds. Two sofa beds were placed opposite each other, with a headboard separating them. There was no real living/sitting area. There was a small table with only one chair. Really? For a room that is intended to be used by 4 people? Overall, the design of the room was not very practical or functional. For the price and 4 star rating, I expected much more from this hotel.

I have been all over the world travelling in every star class of hotel and was not in the least bit dissapointed in the Kolbe. Yes I would use the Kolbe hotel again and would recommend to famillies and friends of all ages and abilities as has a lift to every floor and our room was spacious enough for three people. Ok we did not eat there why would you? (Too many places to explore outside) Any way the Kolbe hotel staff where polite and very knowledgeable nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is clean and we had no troubles what so ever. I travelled with two other ladies and we are varying ages from 40 to 52 the walking around Rome is safe and the distances no worry at all in fact we where amazed how quick we arrived everwhere (complementary map from the hotel) What fun we had in Rome the sights are amazing but busy at any time of the day. Word of warning about the Vatacian unless you are in a tour group expect to be waiting in a crowd up to 2 or three hours Im not jokeing. One thing you could try is if you where looking at the vatican from the front of ST Peters square go to the right hand side and follow the wall around the vatican untill you find the back entrance and get in for 15 euros each this will give you entrance to the vatican museum and the Sistine chapel leave your selves at least two hours to see everything. Go down side roads and you will be amazed at what you see hear and smell the Italians are so friendly I asked one Older gentlneman where I could find a shop localy as he was carrying a bag of milk and bread he spoke no English what so ever but with a little pointing we understood each other and left each other with a smile. Look at Eating out prices and if the place is busy it is usualy a good sign especially if they are italians my friends and I had excellent two course meals for no more than \u00a360 with drinks and tip and the service was excellent. We ate in the Jewish ghetto and also in Traverse which is a stroll across the river even in high heels. Please explore off the beaten track its such fun and you see so much more than just the tourist spots as we where three ladies travelling we found it to be very safe and hassle free. Bring a good bank balance as the shopping for clothes shoes jewelery hand bags is second to none and also another empty suit case to put everthing in!!!!!!!! Tips..... Get a taxi to and from the air port as you arrive fresh and hassle free the train and underground are packed and a little scary if you are not used to it one way the taxi cost 50 euros but split three ways not so bad the train and metro cost us 48 euros one way and we had a long walk from the metro station with luggage to the hotel. Everything is closer than you think. Bring comfortable shoes. Dont be afraid to go off the beaten track and explore you can not get lost. Enjoy.

Maybe the junior suites are infinitely nicer than the standard rooms. Maybe other travelers/reviewers have different standards. Maybe every good review on TA is a fake review from someone associated with Kolbe. I'm not sure. But this hotel was arguably the worst experience I have ever had in my entire life. The good (not that there's much) Most of the staff spoke english fairly well which made it very easy to communicate. Although there isn't a whole lot in the areas immediately surrounding the hotel, if you dont mind walking a bit the location is actually very good. It is right next to the Palatine, Circus Maximus, and not that far from the Coliseum and many of the other sights/ruins. For food and drink, you can walk into the Trastevere area in about 15-20 minutes which isnt terrible. The walk to Campo di Fiori or Piazza Navona is also around a 15 min walk. All in all a fairly convenient place to be situated. The garden is very nice to relax and get a quiet moment away from the hubbub of the city (although it closes fairly early, 11pm i believe) The bad 4 star hotel? hahahaha laughable. To be fair, I haven't traveled that much outside of the US, but no legitimate establishment in the US similar to the Kolbe would ever consider themselves a 4 star hotel. Honestly it is a 3 star if not lower at best in terms of amenities, design, ambiance, service, room, etc... etc... The wife and I had come to Rome after spending a week in Barcelona where we stayed at what was advertised as a 2 star hotel (Hotel Constanza). The 2 star hotel in Barcelona wiped the floor with Kolbe on every level. That 2 star hotel in Barcelona felt like it was a W Hotel or some other higher end resort compared to the Kolbe. The staff at Kolbe were cordial but borderline useless. We asked for restaurant recommendations and the front desk was of no help. One thing we knew for sure was that we werent going to eat sub par overpriced food at the hotel restaurant. We had an early train to catch the morning we left and asked for a wake up call but never got one. Lucky (or unlucky) for us the rooms were so terrible that we had a hard time sleeping so we were awake anyways. When I went to check out and asked the front desk why we had not gotten our wakeup call, he just said \"oh? it was in the system\" Apparantly its too much to ask for an \"I'm sorry\" or any other type of apology. To be fair, all of the staff weren't terrible. The bellhop was very friendly and helpful (although he spoke very little english) and there was one younger gentleman working in the restaurant/bar who was also very friendly, helpful, and accomodating. Hotel cleanliness was an absolute joke. Now I am not a primadonna or one whos afraid of a bit of dirt here and there, but the room we were given was uninhabitable. Immediately upon entering the room, there was a very strong funk to it. At first I thought it was because the air wasnt on and it was somewhat of a warm day. I tried to turn the air on to get some circulation in the room but the air didnt work. Great. We didnt stay long in the room, only long enough to drop our bags and head out to find a bite to eat. On the way out I mentioned that the A/C was not working so they said they would look into it. When we got back after our meal, the odor was still very noticable. I changed into some comfortable clothes to relax for a bit, kicked off the shoes, and then went to use the bathroom. When I walked out of the bathroom I noticed that the carpet right by the door was damp. I leaned down and sure enough, that is where the smell was coming from. Upon closer inspection I noticed that not only was the carpet damp and smelly, but there were green spots on the carpet. I have to say that i was the first time I ever saw moldy/mildewy anything in a 4 star hotel. It would have been a surprise to see mold/mildew in the bathtub at a 4 star hotel, but on the carpet in the room itself? I called the front desk to tell them and they sent the bellhop up to investigate. Immediately he noticed the stench too and I pointed out the area of moldy carpet to him. He took a look himself, then called the front desk from the room. After a quick conversation in Italian, he passed the phone to me. The front desk notified me that they had another room they could move me to, but it was on the ground floor. No problem I said, since there wasnt much of a view in my current room anyways. I repacked my stuff and headed back to the lobby. So the ground floor room they showed us seemed slightly smaller, and the layout wasnt as nice, but all in all it seemed ok. We moved our stuff into that room and as we were unpacking I realized why the ground floor rooms are the bottom of the barrel. Now Via San Teodoro isnt a major thoroughfare but there is still quite a bit of traffic that comes by. The walls/window were paper thin and everytime a car drove by on the cobblestoned streets it sounded like the Indy 500. Furthermore, you could make out the conversations of every passerby walker who walked by the window. I called the front desk again and told them that the noise was unacceptable. Now its not like the wife and I are older people who go to sleep early, but the constant stream of cars and noise was fairly regular up until about 2am. Noise til midnight is fine. A little after that I can deal with. But at 2 or 3am its a bit much. So I asked the front desk to move us again, and they say they have no other available standard rooms. They said I could either stay here or move back to the moldy room I had come from. Seriously... they actually offered up that moldy room. Don't you think they would have closed it off and fixed whatever problem there was? So I was given the choice between potentially health hazardous mold or a noisy room that sounded like I was sleeping on the street. Did they offer to put us in a nicer room for no charge or even a nominal charge for the hardship? No chance. I guess though in their defense, they did send up a bottle of wine. Probably cause I had to be dead drunk in order to sleep through all that noise. So after we decided to stay in that room, we headed out into the city again. After a somewhat late night we made it back to the room around 2am or so and finally fell asleep around 3am. Since we didn't have anything planned for the next morning we thought we would just sleep in. Wrong. Even though we clearly had the DO NOT DISTURB sign on, we were awoken by loud knocking at around 9am. Half awake and groggy I didnt even bother getting out of bed, I just yelled out GO... AWAY! and the knocking soon stopped. Just as I was falling asleep again the damn phone rings and its the front desk. They are questioning who I was and what I was doing in the room. WTF? I'm a paying guest who was assigned this crappy room, that's who I was. Apparantly the evening shift associate forgot to update my information in the system. Talk about efficiency. Even when we werent being bothered by early morning phone calls or the incessant street noise, it was difficult to sleep because the beds were ridiculously uncomfortable. I prefer to stay at the W Hotel (or Westins) because I like their beds. I like them so much that I bought one of the W Heavenly mattresses for the bed I use at home. Now I cant expect to have that nice of a bed at a lower tier hotel, but being 4 star supposedly, I thought it might be close. The bed/mattresses at Kolbe were worst than some $199 mattresses you can buy at Ikea. I might as well should have slept on the floor if I wanted something that rigid and stiff. We endured this craptastic room for the next 4 days because we figured it would be too much of a headache trying to find another available room, rebooking, repacking, and moving hotels. For future travelers I would really think twice about staying at this hotel. If you do decide to stay, keep expectations low. This isnt a 4 star hotel, atleast not by US or Spain standards. It is 3 star at best, 1 star at worst. I have honestly stayed at Motel 6's that were as nice as this place. Now if the rooms were cheaper, it might be OK, but at $250/nt USD this was the biggest ripoff during my entire Rome visit, and as other travelers will tell you, the entire city of Rome is not cheap.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "wndrwmn", "ReviewID": "UR62162485", "Content": "I agree with most of the other reviewers.

Not quite a 4 star by United States standards. Senior suite...2 bedrooms, 2 full baths(tub+shower in both), ground level facing courtyard with floor to ceiling doors that open to allow access to grassy area with lovely lemon and orange trees. A little nerve-wracking when the lock to courtyard door in both rooms could be pushed open....we were traveling with our children. The rooms offered privacy due to a very tiny entry way between the two entrance doors to rooms. Hard to describe...need key to access main door then opens into entry, then need key for each bedroom. Rooms were large by European standards, clean, minimally appointed to the point of being nearly austere . That's ok, don't care for clutter anyway. Each room had lcd tv, with only 2 English channels, no kid's programming in English. The kids enjoyed cartoons in German and Italien! DVD players NOT available from desk!! Bathrooms were decent size, clean, plenty of towels upon request. Slippers offered but NO robes :( ! Water was hot and plentiful and spa -like shower heads were a nice treat. No kleenex tissues available in the room. Heating needed to be activated by front desk, so just make the call. Room service was prompt and food hot. Caution ...room service hours are on Italien/island time! They do not serve prior to 7am...nor after 10pm..closed during odd hours during the day as well. Also, be advised, \"bambinos menu\" changed nearly every day...never knew what was going to be available for the kids. Something as simple as pasta with red sauce or pizza was actually hard to come by on some days...that was frustrating! The french fries were however available each day, hot and as yummy as fast food stlyle found in the USA. Prices ranged from 8 to 18 euro per item for room service. After a long day of touring, shopping, walking it was nice to order up a snack and curl up with the kids to plan the next day's adventure. Hotel's restaurant was pleasant as was the staff. Breakfast buffet was very well stocked. Coffee, latte, cappucinco, espresso, hot cocoa were all rich and delicious. Fresh, still warm pastries with chocolate inside, muffins, cakes all available each day. Sliced salami, proschutto, cheese,and mild ham were also available with multiple fresh bread options, rolls too. Yogurts, fresh juices, cereals also present. Serving time was reasonable...7am to 10am. If you have an early tour planned then ask front desk for boxed breakfast to be ready for your pre- 7am departure. no charge. Taxi service ...easy and quick. Prices ranged about 7 to 10 euro each way for trips to Vatican, piazza navonna, piazza barberinni etc. To make the return taxi trips easy we carried city map and pointed to hotel on map for so taxi driver would know our destination. Prices were always consistent, never got the impresion we were being \"taken for a ride\". We actually enjoyed the numerous taxi trips especially at night. Driving past the monuments and historical sites at night when all lit up was really something to see. For touring try Presto tours(AMerican guides) and rome's dark tours . Presto was great for a private Vatican tour, well worth the $. The Dark Tours group was excellent as well. The crypts, catacombs tour was amazing as was Masssimo, our guide. Day trip to Naples and Pompeii was good. Pompeii was really the place to see!! Colloseum morning tour was wonderful as well. I love to explore on my own but some of these sites are so vast that have a guide was a smarter way to go. Weather...ranged from 40 to nearly 60 daytime, cooler after sun goes down.

We did plenty of walking, to the Vatican, and further to the Piazza del Popolo (start of the Angels and Demons Tour - brilliant!) but you need comfortable shoes!

Our rooms were on the busy front of the hotel but felt like basement rooms. The only window was up high in the room and opened to the parking lot. I say \"opened to\" because the window would not shut all the way. So we would hear folks walking to their cars, foot traffick (our ears were at boot level, given the location of the rooms), etc. And traffic on that side of the hotel was noisy. The rooms are very new and clean -- and that is generally a huge plus for travellers. But this hotel is extremely hi tech. I am used to the European hotels where the room key goes into the wall to activate the electricity -- no problem. But there are a dizzying number of outlets and switches. Nothing is intuitively placed or labelled. During our first night, as we were in our beds, all of the power went off in our room while we were watching TV. Once we fumbled around, we were eventually able to get the lights to work in the room -- but ALL of the outlets were dead. When we mentioned this the next day, the manager told us that we had waited too long to bring it to his attention and that there was nothing he could do at 8pm at night to make the outlets in the room work. So there was no recharging our electronics. We asked for a price break or partial refund. We got nothing. The manager (who sits behind the blonde smiling lady who denies you everything) was horrible to deal with. We left early the next day and were never so glad to have left a hotel. This is a high-tech hotel that is brand new with a staff that has no clue, and worse, no motivation or desire to see that you have a nice stay. Until all the staff are fired, stay away. And you simply do not want the rooms that face the room; you will be better off in your in-laws basement apartment.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte", "Title": "\u201cStay at the River Palace Instead\u201d", "Author": "dawsoniv", "ReviewID": "UR39462477", "Content": "Nice, clean hotel, but we weren't impressed.

My partner and I stayed at the hotel in a junior suite. We had booked the room on-line via their website and had organised a mercedes cab for collection from the airport. The collection went well although the driver wanted more money than I had agreed with the hotel, though this matter was sorted after a short time. The room was large, spacious and clean although initially the tv, jacuzzi and massage chair didn't work. However after speaking to the helpful porter these were also rectiifed by the end of the day. Also the sink began to leak but again after a quick comment to the receptionist the matter was resolved. The staff were very helpful and assisted in booking a trip to Vatican City which included all the main sites and which avoided the queues. The hotel also provided a pack up breakfast for free for the trip. I have to say that the restuarant was brilliant. The setting is lovely and tranquil and i can not believe that we were in the centre of the ancient quarter and we couldn't hear a noise. The food was excellent though expensive which was predictable.

It was basically, a regular room with a pull out couch and bathroom on one floor and a loft upstairs with a bed. We whined about the bait and switch, but said they didn't have anything else. They said we could have 2 rooms the next night. Then they offered us a free drink. We didn't take them up on it, but eventually got them to give up a free dinner. They said we would have to work out the details with Expedia over the loss of a room for one night. I will say it was a nice room - we had the loft up top, so don't know how the 2 on the couch felt about it. The next night they gave us another family room, so we ended up both having family rooms. So, I thought it evened out and didn't contact Expedia for a refund at the end of the trip. The location of the hotel - while close to things like the Coliseum - is awkward to get to. It looks close on the map, but you have to walk around a lot of things to get to it from the metro stops. And the sidewalks are kind of non existent in parts of the walk, so you have to walk on the streets. Just as an aside about Rome. Someone in our party was pickpocketed on the metro right after we arrived from our long flight. These things could happen anywhere, so I'm not going to hold it against Rome. I would just suggest taking a taxi from the airport to the hotel.

If you like to walk, you can actually take the map from the front desk, - they will show you the most popular route...and walk to all the most popular sites of Rome from this hotel. There is also a museum (?) \"next door\" which hosts free outdoor summer concerts. The hotel's decor is beautiful - Italian chic. Very sophisticated. This property looked brand new. I don't think the web site does this hotel justice. In an old convent with high ceilings in the rooms, huge windows, a park-like garden in the back with fountains, chirping birds, orange and palm trees, where guests can eat their breakfast and dine in the evening, or enjoy drinks from the bar. The buffet breakfast which was included here was overly generous. Hot and cold breakfast food, the best chocolate croissants Ive had in Italy! Breakfast staff was excellent and courteous. Dinner was a bit pricy for our budget, so not eat here at night, but the menu looked good. In all our walks around Rome we did not see a hotel that would compare to these amenities (regarless of hotel star-ratings), or one as quiet, or with a garden. The rate we paid was approx 130EU. In our humble opinion this was a steal. The staff is helpful and friendly, even under pressure with a full house of guests to deal with. They were full when we arrived and I'm sure as word spreads of the quality and value here, this hotel will always be full. We asked for an upgrade since we paid/booked well in advance and were given a huge corner room (#209?) overlooking the Palatino Hill. (We had no idea of the depth of history we were looking at until after we toured.) The bathroom was enormous and fully tiled with granite, marble, spa shower etc..was beautiful. No gratuitous, cheap artwork on the walls - just beautiful fabrics on the windows and bedspread (with very effective black out curtains). Spotless. We did notice our room was larger than others (we could see when the maids were making up the rooms down the corridor). So it is worth the upgrade, if available, to a superior double (not sure of what they call it). It would have been nice also to have a garden view.

The walk to the Circus Maximus metro is about 3/4 mile, but the same distance walk in the other direction places you on the Campidoglio or at Trajan's Column. It would be nice if you could cut through the Forum to get to the Colosseum, but it's worth it to us to stay in such a nice hotel that close to the ancient sites. Also, we learned to use the buses more this trip...buy a three day pass and save your energy (pass also works on the metro and the train to Ostia). The bus stop is a block from the hotel. The front desk staff are professional, English speaking, efficient, polite. The lobby is large, lots of glass, marble, brick, and views out to the garden. The hallways and rooms are very spacious, larger than U.S. hotels. We were dismayed at first that the air conditioning wasn't working, so I asked at the front desk, and the young man said \"Oh, I will turn it on for your room\". He pressed a button there at the front desk, and we had great a/c after that. Efficient, though it would be nice if we didn't have to ask for it to be turned on. Everything is new, clean, designed for comfort of the traveler. We did not hear other guests. Lovely restaurant where a very nice breakfast is included with the room. The prices on the menu for dinners seemed high, and there good restaurants nearby (several along the V. di Portico di Octavia, a three block walk), so we didn't eat dinner there.

Sadly i was very dissapointed! Firstly when we arrived we were taken to our room which when booked was a standard double. On entering the room it appeared that we had been upgrade to a suite as there was a spiral staircase however, when we went up the stairs we were presented with an empty floor with a TV, no bed, no chairs, no sofa - just am empty space! I telephoned reception and asked where the furnature was and was told there wasn't any and it was as it was meant to be, just an empty space with a TV! After around half an hour in the room it started to get rediculously hot although we switched on the AC. In the end we asked to change rooms and were taken to a relatively small double room. This room had a computer desk and flat screen TV and as i run my own business i have to take my laptop with me wherever we go and as it seems you cannot get any other UK TV Channels in the EU except World News, i always put some movies on my laptop for us to watch before we go to bed. I also always take my SVCD to RGB adapter so we can plug the laptop into the TV and watch the movies on there instead of on the laptop. In this case however, although the TV had both RGB and HDMI outlets they were disabled so we were unable to use it. I checked this again with reception who also confirmed these were disabled. In the 7 years of running my own business and taking my laptop with movies and adapter, i have never come accross a Hotel which has disabled the scart outlets! As we arrived at night we didn't get to see much on the way to the hotel to really determine it's position but as all the reviews on TA say how central the hotel is i didn't think i had anything to worry about but the hotel is far from central. In fact it's about 3 miles outside of the old Rome town centre, ie where any shops and restaurants are. My partner is disabled but we honestly thought a 5 minute walk would take us to the restaurants but old Rome and any restaurants are a 3 mile walk away. Hardly ideal for a disabled person with difficulty walking! On the plus side though you are surrounded by ruins which is the whole point in coming to Rome. Rome has to be the most stunning city in the world but unless you like a 3 mile walk to eat out then find a different hotel. If you also expect a 4* hotel to provide 4* service with 4* ammenities then find a different hotel.

The mosaic tiles and lighting were excellent. We paid the hotel rate and felt this was OK for the size of room and facilities. Breakfast was very good and staff were helpful.

Also, not a good choice for families with very young children as the streets and pavements are all cobbled. Pushing a pushchair would be hard work! Rome is currently expensive due to euro/\u00a3 rate, but there are some good places to eat which are not too expensive. The metro is a good 10 minutes walk, but buses are close. However, tickets have to be bought from a newsagent in advance. On the buses, no-one checks the tickets as they have to be self-stamped on the bus. These don't appear to work and the Romans just tell you not to worry about it. Transport is therefore extremely cheap as everyone reuses the tickets! We used a minibus from the airport and his return fare was much cheaper than the hotel's transport. Getting there by metro is possible, but it leaves you with quite a walk from Colusseum stop.

A tour of the Vatican is a must - it was the high light of our trip and we booked woth 'Through Eternity Tours'...phenomenal!", "Date": "October 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "bolton", "Title": "\u201csuperb hotel....\u201d", "Author": "turbo_5_reno", "ReviewID": "UR20600704", "Content": "just got home from 3 wonderful nights in rome. i took my girlfriend for her 21st birthday and we both loved every minute in this superb hotel and in this magical city. i cant fault this hotel. location was excellent, the rooms where very clean, service was faultless. the bar prices where reasonable in comparison to other places we visited. if you go to rome, you must go to the trastevere area to eat, the food is excellent, much better than in the 'tourist area's'. \" a tip for any would be visitors to the colleseum... watch out for sparticus and his mates trying to take your picture... very costly!!!\"", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "bodgeUk", "ReviewID": "UR19987379", "Content": "I was really impressed with this hotel.

I looked at many hotels in Rome through multiple websites looking for at least a 4 star hotel that would accomodate a family of 5 (two connecting rooms with beds for 3 children ages 15,13 and 11). I had finally decided on the Splendide Hotel but at the last minute found the Kolbe. After speaking directly to the hotel I booked a senior room at the Kolbe for half the price of the Splendide with the guarantee of 2 connecting rooms with one king size bed and 3 separate beds for my children. The hotel staff was very accomodating and easy to communicate with. The hotel is very new, modern and everything is spotless. Our rooms overlooked the Forum and you could hear traffic noise outside which was a little annoying. The air conditioning in our room was not as powerful as the kids room. The connecting rooms opened to a private interior hallway but the doors had to be kept shut in order for the lights and air conditioning to work. So it was not convenient to go room to room but we worked out a system which included getting multiple door keys. I believe the rooms overlooking the courtyard are bigger and quieter. Rooms were nice with lots of storage space. Flat screen TV which we never watched because we were out most of the time, though my kids did watch Italian game shows since the only English TV was CNN and BBC Newsworld. The beds were quite hard but still managed to sleep well. Breakfast was served outside and was ok with scrambled eggs, cold cereals, cheese, cold cuts and pastries. It would have been nice to have more fresh fruit and toast. Staff was very helpful with arranging a driver to pick us up at the airport to the hotel, the same driver then took us to the port for the cruise and he was waiting for us when we got off the ship to take us to the airport. I would recommend this hotel if you only have a few days to stay in Rome and will be out of the hotel a fair bit. If I was planning to stay longer I might look for a hotel where the decor was a bit more traditional since I found it a bit too modern for my taste. Also it would be nice to be closer to the shopping areas. I might try the Splendide next time but then again the Kolbe hotel was quite reasonable in price and we spent the extra money in the most amazing tours. We booked tours with Through Eternity Cultural Association and they made our trip memorable. We booked a private Vatican tour with them and the Ancient Rome Walking Tour as well as Rome by Twilight Tour. The guides are extremely knowledgeable and make the history come alive. By taking all three tours we were able to get a great understanding of the history of Rome. Be prepared for lots of walking in hot weather but we really enjoyed it and my kids never complained once. For the short jet lagged time we spent in Rome we had a great time exploring Rome, eating pizza and drinking wine (not the kids!!) The only negative thing that happened was my husband left his camera in the front seat of the taxi when we went to the Vatican and even though we had the taxi drivers name and ID and phoned the taxi company within minutes of getting out the cab the driver said there was no camera. So we were down to one camera which I then dropped on the cobblestones in front the Tivoli fountain the next night. Needless to say we had to purchase a new camera prior to getting on the cruise.", "Date": "September 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cAdjacent to the Forum\u201d", "Author": "Shanehoustonlittle", "ReviewID": "UR19321474", "Content": "The hotel is adjacent to the south side of the Forum and within walking distance to many of the ancient attractions.

The beds were very nice with great mattresses and linens. The breakfast had an enormous selection of continental and english breakfast staples. We utilized the free breakfast almost every day but did not eat lunch or dinner here. The room sizes and the recent renovations seemed like a very good value for Rome in the summer. The only downside to this location was the distance to the nearest Metro station. Though there were not very many restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, the neighborhood to the south and the one six blocks east across the river made up for this with their sheer number of restaurants.

Hotel arranged a car to collect us at the airport, \u20ac60 for one way but given the heat last weekend and the distance that Da Vinci airport is from Rome it was well worth it.

Room had a terrace outside which was nice for relaxing on at the end of the day. The A/C was perfect, noted some reports on the hotel suggested internmittent A/C but the trick is to ensure that the windows and doors are all closed for the A/C to work, they all have sensors.......the rooms are very high-tech! The open spaces are really nice, breakfast is great, very generous selection and the bar was nice for some pre-dinner drinks.
