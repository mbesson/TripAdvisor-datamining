First the pluses of the Cervantes: The location was great. My husband and I were able to walk everywhere in Old San Juan. Although small, the room was quite sufficient for our needs. Very nice decor. Pleasant staff. Now the minuses: The noise from the street behind the building can carry late at night. Two of the three nights we were there we were woken up by some rowdy folks walking home from a neighboring bar. There's nothing the management can do about it, it's just the nature of the location. The lovely shower didn't have a small shelf to put shampoo, soap, etc on while showering. Really inconvenient. The floors were not as clean as I would have expected. I found a quarter and a bottle cap on the carpet from a previous tenant. There was also a small amount of mildew build-up beneath the shower door. I wouldn't have noticed it, but since I had to bend over to pick up my shampoo bottle (due to no shelf in the shower) it was evident that the corners were not cleaned well. Finally, I had an issue with the hotel after check-out. I had wanted to use a different credit card to pay for the stay rather than the one I guaranteed the room with. I gave the clerk the different card, she swiped it and gave me a receipt. When I got home and checked both credit card accounts, both accounts were charged the full fee. She didn't release the hold on the original card and it went through in addition to the charge on the second card. It took a couple of weeks to resolve. I let American Express handle it.

BE CAREFUL THAT YOU GET THE ROOM YOU BOOKED.

There was a picture of this room on the webpage. When I checked in I was put in a room with a double bed, no balcony, a sofa bed in a windowless room and one tiny window to the right of the bed. I went back down to the front desk as this was clearly not the room I had reserved. They told me at first I was in the correct room. They seemed completely confused when I gave them the description of the room as listed on their own website. I was offered a free drink as compensation but declined and asked only to be placed in the room I had booked and was being charged for. Although they were nice the women working the front desk kept insisting that I was in the right room. In fact, one of them stated to me that no rooms in the hotel had a king bed. I then pulled up their own website on my phone to show them what it said. Finally a manager came and offered to switch rooms. The next room was like a different hotel, it was beautiful with high ceilings a KING BED and was the correct type of suite. The staff at the hotel was very friendly but doesn't seem to have basic knowledge of the hotel. Yes this hotel is quite noisy due to street activity but that was expected, just bring earplugs. The bed was very comfortable and the bathrooms were nicely done. The rooms do need some minor fixes. Instead of a tv in the bedroom there was a painting placed in front of the wall mount where a tv used to be (there was one in the other room that worked fine) The bathroom had the fittings for a steam shower but it wasn't working.

Even though we only stayed for just one night, we experienced an inordinate number of issues (see them listed below), and the response we received from management regarding these issues only became more aloof and unaccommodating with each interaction. 1. Uncomfortable, Unacceptable Sleeping Situation. We were permitted to reserve, and were subsequently placed, in the Penthouse Suite--a double-occupancy room--even though we were a family of five. The hotel frequently loads more than two people into this suite, so they thought this would also be appropriate for our large family, and the sleeping spaces that they presented to us were one king-sized bed, a full-sized sleeper sofa (which my sister and I, both thirty-somethings, had to share) and an airbed on the floor. For an $800 room, the minimum one would expect is a real bed to sleep in, and only two out of the five of us could claim this. 2. Poor Room Design. The Penthouse Suite was clearly designed for couples who want to do nothing else but bathe and/or sleep, since the space allows for no other activities. The TV was in the bedroom but didn't face the bed, and only a few, very uncomfortable ottomans/chairs were set in front of the TV (which, by the way, had intermittent sound a few channels). The only way for five of us to watch TV was through the picture-window in the living room. Ironically, this ended up being somewhat of a blessing, since the bedroom also had a picture-window into the bath/shower area, allowing zero privacy for anyone wishing to bathe (very awkward for families). Lastly, lighting, outlets, and mirrors were clearly the last priorities when designing the space, since they were sparse and placed in ridiculous places. Example: no mirrors by the bathroom sink/vanity. 3. Maintenance Issues. As mentioned in previous reviews, the A/C and hot water are intermittent. A/C worked for us, but was incredibly loud--so loud that the private terrace offered nothing but the sounds of mechanical grumblings and views of a wall of plants (bamboo, I think?) blocking the parking lot across the street. Hot water was also iffy: we had it, but some showers got lukewarm by the end. The key cards stopped functioning in the middle of the night. The wifi only worked in the lobby, not in the room. And the telephones didn't work at all. 4. Poor Hotel Service. We could not check in to our room until after 4:30pm, despite the 3pm check-in. This was particularly unfortunate, since we disembarked from our cruise at 10am. Also, our room was only stocked with four towels (see #1), and despite asking three times, with assurances that they would bring up at least one more towel for our fifth family member, the towels never came. Also, none of the front desk staff was very knowledgeable about nearby restaurants, activities, etc. They would call places we identified but couldn't offer recommendations. 5. Indifferent, Unprofessional Management Response. The manager, Michelle Colon, was incredibly unhelpful. Any one of the aforementioned issues would be enough to issue a complaint, but taken together, they made the price of the room absolutely outrageous, and we sought some sort of response or compensation. During our first phone conversation (made on one of the front-staff's cell phones, about two hours after trying to reach her on the one working telephone in the hotel), we were told that there was absolutely nothing that could be done to make our sleeping situation more comfortable: no additional rooms, mattresses, or airbeds or any other offer, only the one free drink provided to my father during the 90+ minutes we waited for our room. We spoke with Michelle again the following morning, after we overheard her agree to issue a 10% refund to another couple due to their hot water problems. Although she said that she could not offer us the same, since our floor did have hot water, she would speak again to \"the owner\" to see what she could do. This was a phone conversation in Spanish, which I assume she thought we didn't understand, since she was flippant in her description of our concerns, referred to them as stupid, and highlighted that she had already given us a complimentary drink at the bar (as though this were sufficient). It's unclear whether or not \"the owner\" actually exists, since Michelle is not permitted to provide this person's direct phone number or email address, but this person(?) did end up giving Michelle authorization to issue us a 5% refund. We took what we could get, but not surprisingly, we did not believe that this was nearly enough. Note: this ended up being an actual refund, rather than a discount, since they put through the full room charge the night before our check-out. The hotel is in a convenient location in Old San Juan, which is an absolutely lovely and interesting place to visit, and I can definitely sympathize with travelers who would prefer to stay in a local, boutique hotel rather than at one of the chain hotels. But, in this case, due to the terrible service and management, the poor design choices prioritizing style over functionality, and the disruptive maintenance issues, I would definitely recommend any other option over this one.

Initially, I had reserved a room at the Milano, but I kept reading bad reviews and cancelled that reservation with a 10% administration fee to do so. I wanted to end my vacation on a high note, so I made a reservation at the Cervantes based on good reviews and its proximity to the Carnival pier. To start with, this place was hard to locate even with GPS. We walked past it probably three times. The only identification on the building is two C's etched in the glass of the doors. Nothing else, just two C's, not even an address. Once we found it, it seemed exactly what I was hoping for. We were shown to our room which was small but decorated nicely. The bathroom was very nice too. As the man was leaving our room, we asked how to turn on the AC because it was very warm in there. He then told us that it wasn't working, but it was being worked on and should be back on before too long. My husband and I exchanged glances because our cruise cabin had problems with AC too. As a result, I had slept terribly the whole time. With two nights left of a seven night cruise, and numerous service calls they finally offered to move us to another cabin. Our room at the hotel was going to be a lot hotter then our cabin! Long story short... by 10:00 PM that evening the AC still wasn't fixed and they did not want to credit us if we moved to another hotel (all of their rooms were without AC). The only thing we used the room for at that point was to store our luggage. I was prepared to sleep on the lobby couch in my p.j.s and tell every guest that came in that the AC was not working (and write a bad review). This was relayed to the owner who said if I wanted to sleep on the couch I could, but asked if I would wait till after the lobby restaurant closed at 11:00!! Wasn't that nice of him/her!! Meanwhile, my husband was emphatic that I was not sleeping on the couch and wanted to just go to another hotel. If we did that, our one night stay in San Juan was going to end up costing us $500.00! I could take another cruise for that price! Eventually, the chef at the restaurant (who was very nice and gracious) ended up calling the owner again, and was able to get the night's stay credited for us. We then moved to the Sheraton about 11:00 at night. My main complaint is that they did not tell us the AC was broken before we checked in, and they should of at least given us the choice to move somewhere else and not be charged. I understand the importance of cancellation policies, but the room was just too hot to sleep in. The most disturbing thing for me is that the owner, who is most likely a millionaire, did not seem to be concerned with his/her customers. This may be a great place to stay when everything is working well, but a better indication of quality of customer service and hospitality is how customers are treated when things are not!!", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falls Church", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place!\u201d", "Author": "Mike S", "ReviewID": "UR120552339", "Content": "My husband and I recently stayed at the hotel for our 10 year anniversary.

The Cervantes reminded me very much of the inns and small hotels of Florence, Italy. The hotel has only 12 rooms, ranging from small to grand suite. Ours had a balcony, a flat-screen television, and a dvd player. Our room was very clean, neat, stylish, and cozy. The staff at the Cervantes is the BEST I've encountered at any hotel. Everyone was warm, helpful and friendly to the utmost, and the complimentary continental breakfasts were the best complimentary continental breakfasts I've ever had. We're talking fresh, flavorful food here. Great Puerto Rican coffee. And terrific service. No buffet. On two occasions, we had the breakfasts brought to our room. I very much enjoyed staying here. The hotel has rooftop access, an award-winning restaurant, and is within walking distance of shops and attractions. It is not at all in a \"tucked-away\" corner of Old San Juan. Next door to the hotel is a spa. Across the street is a building that is hosting the Bodies Exhibit this month, and busloads of children visited the exhibit Monday through Friday during our stay at the Cervantes. Next door to the Bodies Exhibit is the public parking garage, which seems to be where just about everyone parks. That place is almost always busy, with cars going in and out. Though I very much liked the Cervantes, my fiance told me that it is the nosiest hotel he's ever stayed in and that he would not return. Prior to checking in, I did warn him that some of the Tripadvisor Reviewers complained about the noise here. He is a light sleeper, and bought ear plugs after his first night there. I don't mind the noise as much. For me, it's all part of experiencing Puerto Rico. It bears clarifying that the noise my fiance heard was the hustle and bustle of Old San Juan; the hotel itself was very quiet. In the morning, starting very early, there was the noise of the construction crew a few doors down from the hotel. At night, there was the noise of very young people partying in the street. Friday night was probably the loudest night because a drummer at a nearby square decided to put on a show at about 3 a.m. For those who want a quieter stay in a charming Old San Juan hotel, check out El Convento.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery loud, wouldn't let us leave\u201d", "Author": "Floridamb", "ReviewID": "UR26003149", "Content": "After travelling around Puerto Rico for a week, we (my husband and I, our 5 month old baby, and her grandmothers) booked our last two nights in Puerto Rico at the Cervantes.

We explained the situation to the front desk and asked to be moved to a different room. The response was that we were already placed on the 5th floor and there were no interior rooms available. We went out to find another hotel in the city and when we explained that we would have to check out we were told that they would charge us for the second night of our reservation if we left. The front desk manager said she would have to check with the owner of the hotel to determine if he wanted to charge us for the second night. Their response was \"we are not respsible for anything outside of the hotel\". At $250 a night per room, we could not afford to be charged for the room AND stay somewhere else. Later that afternoon they sent earplugs to our room.

This hotel is on a narrow street and the taxi ride there was interesting, dodging all the traffic that apparently tends to collect on Friday nights. The room was small but very well appointed. You could tell it was remodeled and decorated by an expert. It even had a wide screen HDTV. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean and well appointed. The food in the downstairs restaurant was superb. We really liked how close the hotel was to stores (Walgreens) and the water front. We walked around the old city wall and back. The only problem we had wasn't with the hotel at all but with all the people making noise out on the streets. It kept us up most of the night but I don't know how you could avoid that. The next day the front desk person went out on the street to hail us a cab and helped us get our bags in. The room rate was about $240 but with tax and food it was almost $300.

Only a few doors down the hotel you also have a great authentic local cuisine restaurant. Since the hotel is in Old san juan you don't need a car you can just walk the area.

The decor in this small boutique hotel is unique. It is the work of an outstanding Puerto Rican designer, and although I don't generally like contemporary style, this motif is done so well that anyone would be impressed. We stayed in a junior suite, which was quite commodious. Our adult children stayed in standard rooms, which were a bit small but very comfortable. Appointments are first-class: marble tiled bath, comfy bed, attractive furniture, flat screen TV. (The standard rooms and junior suites are available only with queen beds.) The restaurant on the first floor was ideal for breakfast--quiet and elegant and with a continental breakfast of many types of fruit and cheese. On two of the days I ordered white egg omelets, which were done with a flair by the chef and added little cost to our bill. The restaurant also has a very attractive bar, which was a perfect spot to relax after our busy days of sightseeing. The staff is very accommodating on day and evening shifts. They speak excellent English and do whatever they can to be of assistance (e.g., using their PC to print out airline passes and copy documents). The reservations manager, Luis Correia, contacted us a couple of times by Email prior to our stay just to confirm that all was in order. The only negative to our experience is that the attractive restored wood doors to each room's balcony are relatively sound porous. As a result, the noise from a construction site across the narrow street was very intrusive from 7:00 on. From what I could see of the building site, the work should be completed within a few months. Overall, Cervantes provided a nice blend of luxury accommodations with value received. The cost is about 20%+ below El Convento, and the experience is far more personal.", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cervantes", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g147320-d601442-Reviews-Cervantes-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$146 - $843*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Recinto Sur #329</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Old San Juan</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Juan</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00901</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "601442", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2a/67/2a670801a60a5dfe0677ce83472f26941large.jpg"}}
