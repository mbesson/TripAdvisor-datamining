The hotel is officially 3 star. However it's facilities in my opinion are that of 4 star. I think that the only reason it isn't classified as 4 star is that the hotel does not have a restaurant. The hotel itself is modern, very clean and in a safe residential neighbourhood, just outside the tourist centre of Rome. Our hotel room accommodated 3 adults and was very clean and modern. The room was also quiet and had satellite television with many channels in Italian, plus BBC CNN, ZDF Antenne 2, Sat1 etc. We also booked breakfast everyday and it is served in a nice room on a buffet self-service style. The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the Piazza Bologna metro station (line B) - take the Via Ravenna exit. It is also a 10 minute walk up the hill from Rome Tiburtina rail station (second biggest in Rome). Also very close to the 62 bus route that goes downtown. We went to a couple of nice restaurants very close to the hotel (2 minutes walk). One was called Il Tunnel and the other was called La Lanterna. Both similar price. Il Tunnel was a bit more informal and La Lanterna a little more upmarket. Both served good traditional Italian food and wine. Both very enjoyable. Tip - if you want to go to the Vatican Museum the queues were massive. You may wish to book online to save a long wait. Thank you to the staff of Mercure Roma Piazza Bologna. We will come again!

For me personally, location worked very well (prefer to be in a residential area away from the tourist buzz, to feel the real city life). Metro is nearby and after-hours return with the official white taxi from the city center was barely 12 euros with the tip. (15 euros from Trastevere) The best thing about the whole stay was that we had the huge balcony overlooking the residential street. Rooms are very small and we actually had a \"privilege\" room so I'm imagining how small the other rooms are. Apart from the nice balcony, nothing was really \"privilege\" about the stay. Upon arrival, we discovered used and dirty espresso cups on the desk. Internet is free in this type of room but since when is internet a privilege, it's free in any other hotel. Had to get the refill cards constantly (which you need to buy from the front desk if in normal room), and the wi-fi signal was shabby, and internet disrupted at times. Had the slippers and bathrobe but that's pretty standard in some other Mercure hotels I stayed in. The biggest turn off was the impression that hotel and staff wanted to rip-us off at every corner. Breakfast is not included and it's 13 euros per person. Went instead to the local cafe around the corner and had bunch of fresh paninis, wonderful cappuccino and orange juice - 12 euros for 2 persons. Parking was 25 Euros per night! And also very small, you need to be very skilled to park your car in. When asked for laundromat in the area staff offered to do the dry cleaning, 4 euros per shirt. Declined and discovered the laundromat just across the street , wash, dry and fold service for a huge bag of clothing, that's at least 20lbs, for mere 15 euros! Worst was to come - the completely false information about the taxi to the FCO airport, we were informed that the taxi ride will be 55 euros (story about how they charge for bags, then to get to the Termini station etc) and that we should take the private driver and limo instead which they will call for us. Declined again, stopped the 1st taxi around Bologna square, and for 40 euros got very fast to the FCO. They do not go to Termini at all, and no charge for luggage.

There was also a metro stop, but we preferred travelling by bus because it can get so hot and stuffy in Rome's metro tunnels. The staff was pleasant enough, but they aren't as flexible as other Accor hotels we've stayed in. As an example, we asked for more toilet paper so we don't need to ask again as we were staying for several nights, but they only gave us one. We asked if we could borrow an iron and board, they said they don't allow bringing the iron to the rooms and we'd need to go downstairs to iron our clothes.

Dislikes: - Rooms are small so not much room to move about (although we were barely in the room so we\u2019re not worried about this). Would I Recommend: - Yes, definitely. Despite the rooms being small, the beds were comfortable and the rooms were very clean which is a key selling point for us. We would definitely go back. Tips: - If you are in Rome for 3 days, purchase a Roma Pass as they are well worth the money. The Roma Pass allows you to travel on as many train and bus trips as you like within Rome and you also get entry to two tourist attractions for free and discounts on many other attractions. Some attractions also allow you to avoid queuing if you have a Roma Pass. - There are many beggars in Rome and we would suggest that you do not give them any money. Our observations of the beggars was that: 1) many of the beggars operate on a \u201cFagin\u201d basis, i.e. they beg for money and give it to a man in charge of them, 2) some beggars wore expensive clothes and were clean and tidy (one beggar was wearing a leather coat!) and 3) they want money not food (we offered a beggar some food but they threw it away when they thought we weren\u2019t looking which suggests to us that they\u2019re not that desperate).", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cQuality Hotel close to transport and centre of Rome\u201d", "Author": "Bazzer13 Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR113855344", "Content": "This hotel ticks all the box's when it comes to quality, price, and location.

Only 2 minutes walk from Bologna Metro stop, the location was great and the area around the hotel was friendly. Rooms were clean, and not too bad size wise although the bathrooms were a little snug! Good Points: * Close to Metro (250 metre walk then only 2 stops/5 mins from Termini) * Close to a supermarket and lots of little bars/cafes/pizzerias (we bought our breakfast from the bakery up the road and ate it in the little courtyard at the hotel - the staff seemed fine with this) * Free of charge fridge in the room with 4 free bottles of water on arrival * Free safe Bad Points: * Air conditioning in the hotel is automatically switched off between midnight and 9am which is just crazy. The rooms get really hot at night and even keeping the windows open didn't help that much. We visited in June and the temperature in the daytime was approx. 32 and the nighttime temperature was about 20 - I dread to think what the hotel rooms would be like in July or August! Our tip was to leave the aircon set to 5 degrees when you went out in the evening so that the room cools down enough to see you through most of the night - we found that by doing this, sleeping with just a sheet and keeping the windows open we could sleep until about 6:30/7:00 am before we woke up because we were too hot! * The right hand lift had some serious malfunctions! Avoid the right lift if possible - we saw a few people complaining about it but it wasn't fixed whilst we were there. * The cost of breakfast at the hotel was extortionate (see tips below for good alternatives locally) Our Tips for Rome: * If you are coming from FCO airport - get the train to Tiburtina (8\u20ac) rather than the train to Termini (14\u20ac) and then you can either get the Metro to Bologna or walk to the hotel from Tiburtina station itself. It is about a 10 minute walk up Via Lorenzo il Magniffico (plenty of nice places to grab a drink/snack if you need sustenance following your flight!) to Piazza Bologna and then a 3 minute walk from there down Via Ravenna to the hotel. If you get the train to Termini (as we did on arrival) it not only costs 6\u20ac more but takes twice as long. The walk from the train platform at Termini to the Linea B metro platform takes at least 10 minutes and involves lots of stairs and pushing through crowds - not ideal if you have a suitcase! * If you come out of the entrance to the hotel and walk up Via Arezzo and turn left onto Via Ravenna there is a lovely gelaterie on the corner and a really good pizza place about 4 or 5 doors down (Pizza Tonda) - it doesn't look like much but the pizza is sold by weight and 2 generous slices as well as a 'suppli' and two soft drinks came to less than 7\u20ac - not bad at all once you have experienced the prices of eating in Rome! * The supermarket is well hidden but surprisingly easy to find - it is on Via Lovorno about 50 metres down on the left hand side - it looks a bit like you are walking into the trade entrance but you're not! * The bakery you will pass on your way to and from the Metro called 'Le Panizzeria' offers an amazing croissant/pastry and a coffee/juice for less than 2\u20ac which you can then take back to the hotel with you - the hotel offers the same breakfast for 6\u20ac each - the saving is definitely worth the 2 min walk and back! Tips for Rome: * The three day Metro ticket is a godsend if you are staying in this hotel for 3 nights or more. If you are arriving late on the first day of your trip (and are just going to use the Metro to come from the train station to the hotel) it is worth just buying a single ticket (1\u20ac) for the first day and then a 3 day ticket on your second day - the 3 day tickets run on calendar days and so you miss out on a whole day of Metro travel otherwise! * There is only a 15-30 minute wait for tickets at the Vatican Museum if you go anytime between 12:30 and 1:30pm rather than then average 2.5 hour wait at busier times! * If you are planning a vist to the Colosseum, the Palatine and the Forum then head straight out of the Metro and head across the Piazza de Colosseo and then straight down Via di San Gregorio (dodging the ticket touts as you go!) After the street vendors on the right hand side you will see a very small and somewhat innocuous entrance with a small queue - this is the entrance to the Palatine and the Forum and the queue here was only 5 minutes long (at 10am on a Saturday in June) as opposed to the 2hr one at the Colosseum - you can buy a ticket here (12\u20ac) that gives you entry to all three and lets you jump the line at the Colosseum. If you do want to buy your ticket from the ticket men (so as not to wait in line at all) then buy them from ones standing right next to the entrance to the Colosseum rather than the ones right by the Metro as they were only charging 4\u20ac extra rather than 13\u20ac!! This also applies to buying parasols ladies - the ones for sale by the entrance to the Palatine are only 3\u20ac... the ones by the entrance to the Metro are 10\u20ac!!", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRome Alone\u201d", "Author": "TravellingTrippers", "ReviewID": "UR66411575", "Content": "I wanted to do a bit of sightseeing but stay in a safe, quiet and clean hotel and this was perfect.

The free buffet is fine (eggs, great italian pastrys, juice, coffee, yogurt, cereal). No pool or bathtub (just shower). The refrigerator in the room gets 4 bottles of free water. They call it a minibar but its free. You need the map to find the hotel. the piazza had 5 roads so we still needed help from a passer-by to find it. Get the Roma Card. 3 days of unlimited transport and free admission to certain museums and discount to jump off and on trambus. At track 24, walk out the nearest door (don't walk to the front) and you get it from tourist information. The Metro is old and very crowded. The metro on the corner is 5 stops directly to the coleseum (go late in the day to minimize lines). We took the last english tour at 5 PM and beat the whole line for 3.5 Euros. The 42 Bus goes from the hotel to the Vatican. More fun, less hazzle than the Metro. Returning the last stop is our hotel. Going the last stop is the Vatican. I recommend it. I would learn how to use the bus. The arrow on the sign points the direction the bus is going and the boxed name is the stop you are at. The Vatican has 15,000 people per day. When we got there, there was a line of 3000 people for the St. Peters Basilica (don't get on this line). We took the tour because we did not know where to start (don't take it). We spent one hour in the sun before going into the museum to look at a poster of the Sistene Chapel. It took 5 hours without food, water or a bathroom. One roman fainted (good thing we had the buffet breakfast). They took us to a line to the Vatican Museum outside the wall (start here).
