It's based on the average of the two apartments we rented. We had a group of 8 people and we decided to rent the top 2 canal view apartments. The middle apartment (222) was fantastic: heaters work, full kitchen, has outside deck for smoking. The stairs are not for the faint of heart. They are steep! Try to negotiate those stairs after drinking or smoking, can be a challenge. The top apartment (223) had a weird layout. the slope of the roof prevented you from standing upright in the upstairs bedroom/bathroom for fear of bumping your head. The roof was so low, i had to sit on the bottom of the tub to take a shower. They do have a handheld shower head. The toilet is on the entering floor and the toilet seat smells horrible. i think mold or mildew has been eating away at the seat causing it to smell. I told the staff member when we left, so hopefully it has been switched out. The toilet sink also doesn't work, so you have wash your hands at the kitchen sink. The apartments are self maintained, so we ended up buying hand soap, paper towels, and cleaning spray. Luckily, someone left a sponge and dish soap. You would think that if they wanted you to keep the apartment tidy, they would leave cleaning supplies. The location was fantastic Easy to get to all parts of Amsterdam via trams or bus. To get here, take the 9 tram from Central Station, get off at Rembrantplein, head north toward Amstel Canal and its located at 104 Amstel. The receptionist, Evelyn was fantasic! She was always helpful, courteous, and great with restaurant suggestions.

I did, but after a day I got the message, that the booking was canceled because of the credit card. I checked with the card provider, no problems and no request for any authorization and they could see in their system, that i paid in September 2011 with the same card, so there was no problem at all. Well, i presented this for the hotel, but they were so arrogant and still claim, that there was a credit card error, witch i know and can prove, that there isn't !!!

Our room was at the back of the hotel and faced onto another hotel, in the morning bottle bins where emptied and staff from the other hotel / restuaruant would stand out back smoking and chatting so it was difficult to have a lie in. The carpet had ominous looking discoloured and hard patches on it that made us slightly worried as to what had gone on before we got there. The sheets and bathroom was clean although the towels where very thin and felt rather old. The soap in the bathroom was found in 2 dispensers attached to the wall, one at the sink and one in the shower - I was very wary of using this as i couldnt actually see what was in it!! The fridge that was in our room smelt very mouldy and didnt work. On the third night of our stay we discovered a lovely little mouse scurrying around our room. As we managed to trap the mouse in a bin and had other people to stay with that night we didnt class this as an \"emergency\" and therefore didnt call the emergency number in the welcome book. The next day we advised reception about the mouse and said we felt we shouldnt pay for the room for that night. They offered us 25% off 1 nights stay and after about 30 mins of arguing over the phone with the manager he eventually agreed to \"generously\" give us 50% off that night. He advised that as we didnt remove our things from the room and he couldnt let it to another guest he would be unable to refund 100% of that night. Kind of worries me that he would let the room with the mouse in it to another guest????

Our room was 2 separate rooms with lots of space, a small kitchenette, and 2 TV's. Perfect for a family. It was clean enough though a fresh coat of paint would have been nice.

It had to be reasonably priced and better than average accommodation. And Hotel Amstelzicht did not disappoint. We booked on-line one evening. There was a problem with our card, and the next day one of the members of staff called and left a friendly answer phone message, even wished us Happy New Year! A personal touch that put us at ease on what reception awaited us on our arrival. We arrived on a Thursday evening, and the welcome was great. We dumped our bags and headed straight out for a bite as it was getting late. Foolishly we went to one of the first restaurants we came to. We advise that you don't go there! Can't remember what it was called but it's an Italian restaurant. Staff were miserable, only happy when you pay, and the food was soooo salty! We recommend Casa de David a fab Italian restaurant, 5 mins walk. We then headed back to the hotel, and this is where the BUT..... comes in. We stayed in Room 1, which is a massive canal view room, on the ground floor, next to the front door. We thought the traffic of people coming in & out of the hotel would be noisy, but that wasn't a problem, it was the noise of the goings on outside. Cars, scooters, and an Irish pub a few doors down and at kick out time it got very loud with drunk people loitering, and when they go the bar staff empty all their glass bottles into a bin, which seems to be right by the bedroom window! (We also found that the lighting was very dim in the room) Needless to say we didn't get much sleep, thankfully I had brought earplugs, but they didn't help a great deal. First thing my husband went to reception to ask for another room, as we were staying there for another 3 nights, and they were more than accommodating. We had the choice of three rooms, all of which we were able to view. Two of them were canal view rooms, one on the 2nd floor, can't remember the room number, looked lovely, and so did the one on the top floor, room 12 I think. But in the end we chose room 11, which was also on the top floor but at the rear of the hotel. They refunded us the difference for moving to the rear of the hotel, and even carried our bags up to our room, which we were so glad about as the stairs are steep, and they seem endless when you've just come back at the end of the day from probably walked about 6 miles. The room was so much quieter, better furnished and nice to have a window in the bathroom. There was only one niggle that we found with the room, which was the toilet leaked a bit when it was flushed. We saw three different members of staff on reception during our stay, and all of them were lovely, friendly and very professional. They were always interested in what we had planned for the day and gave great advice, and always remembered the next day to ask about how we got on. We would definitely stay again, and have already recommended Hotel Amstelzicht to friends.

Having booked months in advance we were disappointed to say the least to find they had double booked. We are told that the website we booked through had contributed to this mistake and we will be contacting them to complain. This double booking error was compounded by the attitude of the duty manager who called us 'unreasonable' and 'difficult' for making the justifiable request that the hotel arrange for us to have accomodation elsewhere for the full 3 nights of our stay. The best we were offered after much indignation on our part and plenty of uncomfortable incompetence from the duty manager was 2 nights at a hotel that was '2 mins away' for 2 nights and returning for a complementary final night at Amstelzicht. This may sound good but the arguments it took to get to this stage left a very sour taste. So we went off to our other hotel having agreed to pay the rate we would have done at Amstelzicht at what turned out to be a very nice and friendly hotel. The '2 mins away' turned out to be a half an hour walk in the pouring rain which was obviously not a great start to our Saturday night! We probably lost a good couple of hours of what should have been fun time in Amsterdam! So the saga continued upon arrival at the alternative hotel when they asked for poayment for the 2 nights stay at a more expensive rate that we had agreed to pay at Amstelzicht.

As an avid traveller, I've never stayed at a place where I felt the owners of the hotel would mingle with their guests and make sure you were happy and comfortable. With that kind of service I would opt to stay at Hotel Amstelzicht everytime I come to Amsterdam. The rooms are neat, clean, spacious and had a touch of coziness with flowers. You can always spend a load of money and stay at one of the snooty fancy hotels, but my choice would be to stay somewhere cozy, friendly, clean and safe. This sweet, quaint little hotel is my choice. Thanks for the good memories Robert and Ramon and making me feel very welcome!

We arrived at 11.20 pm at night, having emailed the hotel the day before to warn them of our late arrival. I cannot fault the Reception staff that were on duty during our stay, they were polite, friendly and helpful at all times. We negotiated the VERY steep and narrow stairs (I only take a size 5 ladies shoe and my full foot would not fit onto one of the stairs) up to our first floor room overlooking the canal at the front of the hotel (my husband had paid extra for this view). What we didn't appreciate when we booked a room with a view is that inbetwen the hotel and the canal is an extremely busy road (day and night). If peace and quiet is what you are after then do not book a room at the front of the hotel. The room in itself was large with high ceilings, but it did have a touch of shabbiness about it and the lighting in the room was so poor that it was hard to see at night. The following morning clarified what I thought, wallpaper peeling in the corner, threadbare bedspread and worn carpet. We paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac465 for 3 nights.

We flew to Amsterdam from Heathrow and walked the 15 minutes to our hotel from Central Station. We arrived at 2PM and our triple room was ready. Our room was situated at the back of the hotel next to the reception desk (cannot recall the room number). However, this was preferential because there were only 4 stairs to get into the room. As the previous reviews have mentioned, the hotel stairs are very steep. This is worth mentioning because if you are considering this hotel, and cannot climb stairs, ask for this room. The room was very clean, but well-worn (as are most small European hotels), and the queen bed and pillows were comfortable. Note, however, that if you request a triple, the cot provided is very soggy and uncomfortable. There is a refrigerator in the room, but it is only to house the mini-bar contents. They ask that you do not put your own items in it. The view was not the best as it faced the rear of the building, but we did not spend that much time in our room. It was sufficient to let in some natural light and to check on the weather before going out. The hotel does not provide breakfast, but it does offer free coffee and tea during the morning for guests. Robert was very helpful providing change for taxis, restaurant recommendations and directions to various sights. The staff was always helpful and ready with a smile. The location of the hotel could not have been better. It sits facing the Amstel, and it is literally around the corner from the Rembrandtplein which has many restaurants and outdoor cafes. It is also in an ideal location from which to sightsee and explore. After some research and comparison, we booked directly through the hotel via the Internet and received a rate of about 200 Euro per night for a triple. We felt this was a good value for the price considering the location.

The flower market, the shopping districts, great restaurants and beautiful sites are all in walking distance. I usually stay in one of their apartment style rooms- they vary in decor. Always greeted with fresh flowers and equipped with all amenities and a rather large bathroom (not standard for Euro hotels). If you are traveling during the winter months, don't worry about heating.
