Very handy for Rocafort metro, although we didn't use the metro as most amenities walkable. Placa Catalunya was a 15 min stroll and Placa Espanya about half that. The rooms were stylish and comfortable; although we overlooked the front of the hotel, we asked for a room higher up and found it was quiet. The staff are pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was really lovely with a selection of continental items - pastries, cold cuts, cheese, bread, eggs and cereals. The roof terrace was a lovely spot to lounge, though we were unable to make much use due to the inclement weather. I would imagine it is a brilliant addition when the weather is sunny and warm.

We highly recommend Lolita Taperia, a few minutes\u2019 walk from the hotel.

We weren't disappointed! Good corner location; a block from the Rocafort Metro station. We had a quiet room, away from the elevator, on level 4. (Please note that quiet is achieved by keeping the window closed; an open window is cooler, but noisy.) We asked for a room with a tub in the bathroom. Our room had the bathroom next to the room's entrance. Bathroom has a large wood sliding door for privacy, but this floor plan may not appeal to all. (Some rooms have the bathroom in a more private location in the room.) The king bed was comfortable, firm but cushioned. The bed pillows are square, a bit unusual, but still comfortable. The staff was very helpful and welcoming (reception desk and bar/restaurant). Maps were provided and highlights for first-time visitors were noted with a personal touch. They were helpful with ordering a taxi for our departure and printed our boarding tickets, too. The (free) afternoon coffee/tea time was always welcome (on days when we returned before 7PM). Cool bottled water, hot water for tea, hot coffee and hot milk were enjoyed with a croissant, or other bread/pastry item as we cooled our heels from lots of sightseeing. The bar and restaurant service was good and always friendly. We hadn't pre-booked breakfast but added that when we arrived and found how good it was. Coffee was always great from the machine, but thermal carafes of hot water, coffee and hot milk were also available. The food and drink were always of a high standard. We had 2 dinners and a night or 2 of tapas and drinks. Two nights they had live music in the bar/restaurant (a singer with pianist, a cellist and pianist played jazz another night). Who needs to seek out entertainment when we have all this in our hotel?! English was spoken well, but we did have one occasion where a tonic water order came as a gin-and-tonic. No big problem as my husband enjoyed it so much that he specifically ordered such the next day! Restaurant suggestion: Little Italy near the Barri Gotic (Picaso Museo) was great! Went there twice for a midday meal that was wonderful. They also have live jazz at nite, but we were kept entertained with the live music at our hotel instead. Address: REC 30. PG.

Sleep on top of your quilt as the beds are like rocks & either use the blankets or ask for another quilt. The shower is the most stupid design ever seen and you DO get water all over the bathroom so the 2nd one to use shower needs to put down the wet towels from the 1st, that said the safe is free, the mini bar quite cheap and they do meals in your room is you should wish for and the terrace on the 7th floor is wonderful although its in the shade at teatime so a bit chilly but in the summer when it will be hot it will be brilliant to sit up there in the shade. Top Tip don't fall for the breakfast offer of 10 euros its only continental, turn right towards the metro station as you come out of the hotel & just 3/4 doors down is fab bar/cafe where you get fresh cooked bacon & egg, fresh squeezed orange juice & great coffee for 5.75 euros you can also get a nice cake on way back as didn't bother with free ones on offer in hotel as heard were dried up ones from breakfast. Also take a corkscrew with you as there is a spar across road from hotel selling wine 6/7/8 euros a bottle, in hotel its 6 euros a glass & you can take bottle up to sun terrace as bar not manned at this time of year (glasses in room). Another tip buy a 2 day pass on the bus it only costs an extra 6 euro for the extra day & its impossible to see everything in one day as Barcelona is so big, if you want to see la rambles, gothic area, olympic stadium beach & harbour its on the red route which will take you a day, if you want to see la sagrada familia (pay extra 3.5 euros & take lift to top its fantastic), gaudi park & Barcelona football club its on the blue route, to get to the nearest bus stop turn right as come out of hotel, right again at metro stop & continue until get to bullring & massive roundabout, cross over roads to the left & get the bus where you will see the two big columns, (you will also see Moutjuic and the national art gallery from here) this is the red route bus, & starts with a trip up to the olympic stadium, do go up the cable cars & look around the castle at the top, the views of Barcelona are fantastic, the fenecular railway is also up there, dont get off at the national art gallery as you can walk from the hotel & do that when you have used up your 2 day bus pass, if you get off the bus after the full day off hopping on & off at the same place as you got on, walk down the opposite side of street where you will come to a fab chinese which offers a 3 course menu with wine or beer for 10 euro and its delicious. Also if you turn left as come out of hotel door and cross road there is a great pizza place that does 2 freshly made pizza's & a bottle of wine for 25 euros. If you go down the ramblas don't eat on the main street one couple we met had been charged 53 euros for a coffee & a pitta there are plenty of restaurants off main street offering a 3 course meal with wine & coffee for 12.50 euros each, also if you go down the ramblas go in the market & check out the fruit & veg HUGE!! and buy some strawberrys & chocolates they are fantastic & cheap & you can put the strawberrys in the mini bar in your room to chill before eating. If you go to the gothic area and get off by the Cathedral there is a fab sandwhich shop on the corner where you can get coffee & delic chicken baggette for 6 euros and down road (same side as got off bus) are some open air seats also another market but not as good as the one on the ramblas. Toilets are hard to find in Barcelona except in bars & restaurants until we notice a WC sign on what we thought was a bus shelter, you go down some steps as usually in underground car parks you get a key from the attendant but don't recommend doing this on a night. If your wondering where the escalators are they are on the way up to the national art gallery at the top of the moutjuic (big hill) the exhibition starts with artwork found in the pyrenees & removed & exhibited here & its out of this world & well worth going to see, the building itself is also wonderful well worth the walk up the hill.

I guess the thing Villa Emilia lacked was a \"wow\" factor - they are trying to squeeze a lot of hotel into a very small space, the breakfast/restaurant/chill out/ receltion area is small, and whilst Breakfast is pleasant (and continental) enough it is basically the only space they could squeeze two tables next to each other to put bread and cold meats on.

The hotel also has a useful map on their site. Travel time from Terminal 1 was less than 20 minutes and cost 21 Euros Check in was handled fairly well, the girl behind the counter kept us waiting for 3 or 4 minutes with no acknowledgement as she made several phone calls. Once she got to us it was handled fairly quickly and she apologised twice for keeping us waiting. Her English was superb, as is the case with many employees at this hotel We were in room 29, luckily the floral aromas ended at the door. As others have noted, the hotel has a very strong and permeating floral aroma, some might find it a bit too much. The room was free of this though and was immaculately clean and set up well. The air conditioning never worked during our stay, however, though we opened the window when needed. Our view was of a roof and a wall, so the curtains stayed closed. The bed setup is two single beds pressed together, so there can be an annoying separation between the two. The pillows are comfortable, as was the mattress. The bathroom is classy although there is no door to the shower, so you can have a lot of water going on the floor if you're not careful Service was prompt, well handled and everybody I spoke to had a much better level of English than I have of Spanish. Room service was handled promptly in a 10am-2pm window. We opted for the pre-paid breakfast which is 10 Euros instead of 14. Breakfast selection is high in quality if not in quantity. There are 3 or 4 cold cuts, salmon, cheese, cereals, a few types of bread, fruit, cakes and a DIY egg water bath. FYI, 8 minutes plus resting time for a fully cooked boiled egg.... Where the hotel really shines is the location. It's less than 100m from Rocafort Metro station which is on the most useful line, Line 1. It's only 3 stops (5 minutes) to Catalunya, the main square and Las Ramblas. Urquinaona is only one station further and that is the most convenient stop for the Palau de la Musica Catalunya. I really loved the location, on the first night we walked to Las Ramblas and it took 25 minutes, encountering a lot of bars, cafes and restaurants on the way. There is a small mini-marker across the street from the hotel but it is useful only for basics, we stocked up on water and diet coke The Zinc bar on the ground floor was always fairly lively, with a coffee presentation from 5-7pm and live music some nights.

We were at the front of the building and if you opened the windows, you could hear noise, but it's a city hotel so what do you expect to some extent. They have a terrific roofterrace bar option - obviously not for us in Jan but as soon as Spring comes I imagine it's a cracking place to chill out... I did wonder if that made the 6th floor noisey for people.. but I couldn't say for sure. We had a welcome free drink on arrival and there was a bottle of wine in our room. Minibar water wasn't too costly - about 2 euros but there are loads of little markets/shops about where you can pick it up cheaper. Bed was really comfortable but for me, the pillows were dreadful. More like oversized squishy cushions - but each to their own. The staff are really kind and helpful and even put up with my truly dreadful attempts at Spanish - not necessary though as they all speak perfect english. The bar is great and good value and we had music on both the friday and sat night (piano and double base) which was a great touch. OOh and there's free coffee and cake between 5 and 7 - happy days. Also free wifi and there's a couple of free computers to use in the lounge area as well. Bad things? Well as it was January, the heating was on full blast in the hotel and it was unbelievably warm. I completely understand that the Spanish would feel the cold but it was seriously hot. We turned off the heating in our room and had to open the windows. It was too noisey for me to sleep with them open so the room was really hot.

They arranged for the storage of our bags and offered us the first available room. They also printed the wi-fi code for us to use while we waited. We did have to wait about 45 minutes in the comfortable lobby. As with most European hotels, common areas are small at the hotel, but they are well-arranged, comfortable, and stylish. Our room was fairly large (by European standards) and beautifully appointed. The bathroom was very large, and I loved the instantly hot shower with excellent water pressure. The \"king\" bed was actually two twins pushed together, the linens were high quality, the drapes were heavy and could be used to block all light, and the room was quiet. Over our 5-night stay, I had several interactions with the front desk. Each person with whom I spoke was efficient and very helpful, and they all were able to communicate well in English. I also utilized the excellent (but costly) laundry service. Each afternoon (around 4pm, as I recall), there was a complementary \"afternoon break\" with very good coffee and some nondescript pastries. The break area was on the 2nd floor, which had a balcony overlooking the 1st floor and comfortable chairs. I also had Sunday brunch at the small restaurant one morning, and the offering was good, including a great selection of fresh fruit, some nice breads and cheeses, and ham (of course). Each morning, I walked approximately 1 km to my conference near the Placa Espana, and I felt perfectly safe walking by myself in this area. In the evenings, my boyfriend and I walked or took the subway to restaurants, and we also felt safe in this city. One does have to be alert at all times for pickpockets though. (My bag was partially unzipped by a thief on the crowded metro one time, but nothing was taken. I noticed that someone was too close to me and stepped away, but did not notice that the bag (which I carried tightly under my arm) was unzipped until after I got off. The thieves are skilled.)

The lobby was funky, the bar/restaurant was consistently busy at night and the rooms were clean but otherwise unimpressive. We have stayed in several other 4-Star Hotels in Barcelona, including U232 and Barcelona Universal Hotel and found this one to be our least favorite. We didn't quite get the hotel's general \"vibe\" in terms of their target client audience: - The entrance is dominated by the bar/restaurant which creates a consistently busy atmosphere, but the check-in/reception area is sort of tucked off to the side and not particularly inviting for questions. - The rooms are clean, well furnished and quiet in terms of not hearing neighbors but otherwise the decor didn't match the theme of the rest of the property. - The bathroom is a combination of black granite a weird shower (I double-dare you to keep the water inside the shower pan). - Free wifi is a nice touch (something still not offered by all hotels in Europe). Here's where Villa Emilia gets demerits: - The hotel isn't really close to anything: tourist attractions, good/notable local restaurants, etc. It is, however a block from the Roquefort stop on the L3 line, so you can get around this with a multi-day subway ticket, but we still would have preferred closer proximity to things. - We found the front desk staff to be mediocre in service level. With the exception of checking in, and reserving a 5:00 am taxi, they really weren't notably helpful. \"Tatiana\" in particular should find another job - she was simply snotty. - Twice in 6 nights we were woken up by drunk people in the hallway - usually around 3:30 to 4:00 in the morning. This goes back to what clientele Villa Emilia is seeking out: in a 4-star hotel, I expect to be paying to be \"above\" this sort of behavior. Overall, there are worse things to complain about on a vacation. However, there are plenty of centrally located, 4-Star hotels in Barcelona with a better overall ambiance, more mature clientele, and better front-desk staff.

They don't advertise this so not sure if it's part of the service or we just got lucky. Roof top terrace bar is great especially after dark sitting above the street level, there were fleece wraps to use in case it was cold which look like they are laundered and cleaned after each use. Although the terrace area wasn't staffed whenever we used it, there's an intercom to the bar downstairs to order drinks and snacks which worked well only having to wait a few minutes before drinks arrived. Took advantage of 5pm to 7pm free cakes and tea/coffee on the mezzanine floor overlooking the piano bar - nice touch. Only problem we had was the room aircon stopped working, which this time of year wasn't a big issue.

They accommodated our early arrival and got us into a room within 20 min (when we could have been asked to wait for hours for regular check-in). We just had enough time to sit at a lobby table to order drinks and a snack from the classy bar to the left of entrance. (Try the artichoke tapa.) Just past & behind the bar is the sitting area where a lovely breakfast buffet is served in the AM w/wide variety of options. Our breakfast was included in the price of our room, but confirm this upon check-in. Our room was extremely clean and well appointed and the bathroom was quite modern.

Even at the end of Oct it was mild enough for us to enjoy an outdoor drink in this setting before a late dinner. You can call for service to come up from the bar or stop at the bar and take the drinks/food up with you. The evening receptionist was helpful also in calling for dinner reservations and a cab. He can also recommend restaurants close by. We felt very safe in this entire area, but the receptionist asked us not to leave our luggage in the doorway unattended either upon our arrival or departure.

The open top bus tour is fantastic in the city as points of interest are spread around and the hotel gave us a discount for 2 days travel on it...... one stop is only 10 mins walk away so although this hotel isn't right it the busy areas, getting around is easy. Staff were excellent and friendly including the cleaners who were always smiling. It's extremely clean and would definitely recommend to any travellers.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201ca gem of a boutique hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Mark E", "ReviewID": "UR117629179", "Content": "Perfecto!

The chef Varim at ilia made a special dinner for us on the night with a complimentry bottle of champagne for our little celebratory group. They also catered for our little grandaughter who is 3 years old and has a very limited taste in food, The menu for dinner at other times ( we did eat out many times) was good although there was not a great selection to choose from ( this was to be expected as the kitchen is a little small) As for the breakfast menu it was also rather good in that it had a good selection of food available for the morning meal. The rooms were adequate not too big and not too small I liked having the safe in my room and the free internet service as well. IN other words the room was cosy, maybe could have been just a little bigger as we had a bit of difficulty in finding places to put our luggage and 'junk' as one acquires on a holiday. But overall it was quite satisfactory indeed, The bathroom was okay the only complaint i would have had is the water from the shower went over the edge of the shower recess and I had difficulty in drying some or our clothes I had to use the handle of our suitcases to hang washing on, but his was nt a great issue at all as the room was clean indeed and comfortable the bed was also good and cosy. The air conditioning seemed not to work after a certain time in the night and so we had to open the door to the outside to ger a little cooler, which was not a great problem as the fresh air sometimes is better but it would have been good to have the air conditioning on all night if possible. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous at all times especially the cleaners and bar and kitchen and dining staff and I would give them a 9 out of 10 for smiles and politeness and helpfulness. The front desk staff were okay as well but could have been a little more smiles on their faces. The terrace was just magic and indeed we spent many happy evening up there with either drinks or just relaxing and the people there were extremely wonderful and so inviting and they remembered what we liked to drink we did not have to ask for service at any time as they were so great, Thank you to them for their service they were extremely helpful in telling us where to go for reataurants when we did not want to at in the dining room every evening. They were of great assistance as was Varim downstairs. My only complaint was that there was not a small pool on the terrace as this would have been just magical as we sat in the hot sun on most days and this would have been so wonderful. We really liked this small hotel and when we come back to Barcelona we will most certainly stay there if our son has not moved into a bigger apartment.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "PeterSummers", "ReviewID": "UR116734213", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and were very impressed.

We're both students (20 & 21) and wanted to treat ourselves to a nice place to stay and couldn't believe how amazing this place was for the price! Our room was very spacious with a beautiful bathroom. We had everything we needed; we looked right over the the street but you would never have guessed. It was piping hot the whole of our stay but the aircon left the air at a perfect temperature. The hotel is lovely; free coffee from 5 'til 7 was a nice touch (though do remember it is on floor 1 and not in the bar area!). Although we did not eat any breakfast, we did have dinner in Zinc on our first night as we were too tired to hunt somewhere down. We went for a set menu, with salad, chicken and peppers and a chocolate brownie. This sounds normal but it was definitely one of the best meals we ate out there, really delicious and fantastic value, we really couldn't believe our luck. Drinks on the terrace afterwards was a real delight and so peaceful - ideal for any age couple and friends! One word of warning - we were planning on attending the thursday terrace BBQ but failed to book as we didn't realise and ended up trying to find food elsewhere, so remember to book beforehand, it's very popular! A few tips: we got the aerobus from the airport to Placa Espana and managed to find it by walking, so if you're ok on your feet it's not hard to find. We also stayed out late a couple of times, and the metro shut. There are ways of getting back (night buses) but we did walk and get a taxi so plenty of options. We ate alot at the marina so make sure you head there; the best tapas we ate was on a boat at the harbour. The staff were all very helpful and the area is good. We recommend getting a travel card for the metro for your entire stay as we used ours constantly, but seemed to walk far too!

We are so glad that we stayed at Villa Emilia. On arrival, we asked for a room facing the inside as we like peace and quiet at night to sleep. The hotel gladly met our request. We don't think it would really matter if you were at the front or back as we reckon that it would be quiet anyhow. The room was superb. We loved the bathroom and especially the walk-in shower. The water was always piping hot which was ideal when you came back from the beach or after being caught in a thunderstorm!!! The roof terrace is a delight. The staff are really helpful and very friendly and were always ready to help with directions or the best way to get to certain places. The breakfast has loads of variety and even for those who would normally prefer a cooked breakfast, Villa Emilia will make you change your mind. The selection is outstanding and is continually replenished. We had breakfast at 7.30am one morning and at 10.30am another morning and both times there was no difference in the amount of food that was available. We loved the fact that we could boil our own egg in the nifty wee machine. The hotel has cracked it with the complementary coffee, tea and pastries from 5pm to 7pm. We had them every evening but one and we actually missed having what we saw as a treat as it motivates you to come back to the hotel, freshen up and then go out again at night, The one night we missed this, we came back in about 7.30pm and we couldn't be bothered to go out later. The tea and coffee is a great refreshment. Some general tips for you. At the airport terminal we were confused but we got the T10 Multiperson ticket (8.25 Euros for 10 journeys - fabulous value) and took the Renfe train into Passeig de Gracia. Be careful to get out there as another couple of tourists told us that we needed to get out at P de G otherwise we would have been at the other side of Barcelona. From P de G, you can get the Metro Green line to Catalunya and then the Metro Red line to Rocafort and once you get out, you will be close to the hotel but there are several Metro station exits and entrances for Rocafort so just look around you when you exit the station so you get your bearings. The streets have good signs. Going back to the airport was not much easier by Renfe train but to cut a long story short, I would recommend the Aerobus at 5.30Euros per person which leaves from Place Espanya which is about 10 mins walk away or one metro ride away from the hotel. It might be more expensive but a lot less confusing. The hotel seemed to recommend the Aerobus as well but we had a few journeys left on the T10 ticket and decided to use them up. If you like excitement, the train station will indulge you. Towels for the beach - on the rooftop terrace there is a rack filled with large bath towels which you can take with you to the beach. After you are finished, you can return them to a laundry rack on the terrace. Great idea!! Open top bus - must do. We had ticket for 2 days - you get a 2 Euro discount per person if you request the pack at hotel. Great for jumping off and on. Musical fountain only takes place from Wed to Sunday - we missed it as we went on Tuesday night but hey, it is worth your while walking up to the National Art Museum - the view of Barcelona is breathtaking and will be one of those memories you will treasure. Nou Camp - Excellent and fascinating even for a person generally not interested in football - that's me! Las Ramblas - great atmosphere, especially at night. At the bottom end nearest the column, as you walk down just turn to your left and you will encounter a square with loads of restaurants and also the quaintest streets imaginable in the Gothic quarter. Eating out - loads of great places - we ate our anniversary meal at the Port Olimpic in a restaurant called The Taberna Gallega - excellent selection - just beware that potatoes are actually crisps. If you want chips, ask for French Fries. Barcelona is a fabulous place. We are telling you no more - you have to go to find out for yourself. We would highly recommend the Villa Emilia as a central location for all sightseeing. Staff are great, food is fabulous, rooms are terrific - the positive adjectives just keep coming about this hotel. If we go back again to Barcelona, we will definitely stay at the Villa Emilia - thank you so much to the attentiveness of the staff.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel, good staff & good location.\u201d", "Author": "kangarooboy", "ReviewID": "UR116466840", "Content": "We stayed one night before a cruise.

We got a cheaper rate because we paid upfront when we booked (no cancellations/no exchanges). I had requested a quiet room and was not disappointed when I checked in. Room #61 is positioned on the top floor facing the interior, and they were serious when they said it was the most quiet room. The room is not huge, but it's a fair size... really it was everything we could have asked for given the price we paid and the request for a quiet room we made. (that being said, rooms on the 1st floor I would imagine to be incredibly noisy as their doors are facing the \"business centre\" where people are often sitting and there is music from the lobby that could be heard (e.g. a live piano at times). Despite what some people may thing, the location of Villa Emilia is actually very good. I rather be located there than in the busy streets of Las Ramblas. The reason is that many of the Barcelona tourist sites are all over the place, so you will have to travel out at one point. Also I didn't want to be in a tourist hot zone because then I'd just be close to tourist traps... I wanted good local food... and although the immediate surroundings of Villa Emilia don't provide that, if you walk North to Hospital Clinic there are many restaurants that are delicious and at a reasonable price. Breakfast is not included, we just went out down the street to Cafe Garbi (on Les Corts), which was reasonably priced, delicious but the service was just ok. The only negative thing i can say about the hotel is that they use very strong scents in the lobby and the hallways, which I might have been allergic too (itchy eyes).

Espanya and Montjuic. The first night we enjoyed a festive meal on the 7th floor terrace in honour of St Joan: simple dishes made from good materials, lots of wine & Cava, fireworks all around and a DJ playing 60s & 70 music. The room was reasonably sized , well decorated and clean as was the bathroom which has a wet-room type shower. Air-conditioning was effective and silent. The beds were firm, there was a room safe & a minibar (at reasonable prices). The view from this inside room wasn't great but then we don't go to hotels to look out of the windows. The plus side was that there was no noise to be heard - we slept very soundly. Breakfast was a good array of pastries, toast, cereals, juices etc and plenty of coffee or tea but a little pricey at \u20ac14 each. All the staff were friendly & helpful from the moment we arrived through to keeping our bags in their store for 6 hours after we checked out. Bar staff are very good. A small criticism is that the lifts are small & not very fast and the staff tended to commandeer them, even when guests were waiting to use them. Taking evening drinks on the terrace was very pleasant; cocktails @ 10\u20ac; beers and wines 5\u20ac : but the best bit was the early evening coffee, served between 17.00 & 19.00hrs. After a hot day walking round Barcelona's many attractions, I love a cool shower & a coffee. Not a Caf\u00e9 Solo or a ristretto or other poncey offering but a proper big mug of hot coffee to quench my thirst.

I went to celebrate my birthday and this vacation and HOTEL exceeded my expectations. I have to start with the wonderful staff. The front desk were professional, knowledgeable and very warm. They went above and beyond to suggest places to see and how to get there. Cecile and Olivier were outstanding! Now to the ROCKSTARS of our stay. We first met THAIS when she knocked at our door to deliver my complimentary bottle of wine for my birthday. After asking her to wish me a happy birthday (which she did). She treated us like family when we saw her downstairs at the restaurant bar. She always made sure that we were being attended to and also suggested what to eat from the menu (the secreto was awesome). She had a great knowledge about where to go for a great night with the locals. We ended up going to club Mojito on a saturday and i can truly say i was hanging with the locals. She was PHENOMENAL!! That leads me to Vicente (Alexander as i called him) who tends the bar. He always looked happy to be there and was soooo friendly and very sweet. Although he is fairly new. He worked hard and it was just a pleasure to talk to him while we drank our wine at the bar. Sandro was our waiter at the restaurant which we ate twice in. He always had a smile on his face and made sure our \"copas\" were filled. I can go on and on. I told Maria who is the manager that she had a PHENOMENAL team. Our night always started at the roof top. This is where me met AMAURY who i kid you not will always greet you with a smile. I do not know what is it about this place but all of their employees looked happy to be there. He has such a great personality. The last but certainly not the least of the ROCKSTARS IS THE ONE AND ONLY MARIO!!! We met him the first night on the roof top and he served us our first drinks and there was no looking back after that. He is a charming, full of energy and just the sweetest guy we met there. We were always looking for him because he was so much charisma and made us feel like just we had known him for years. MARIO WAS OUR GO TO MAN FOR EVERYTHING. I cannot say enough about this young man. When you stay here make sure you talk to these individuals. I truly believe your stay will be outstanding. The hotel is cozy and very clean. The location is great. We were away from the craziness but close enough to everything. I originally wanted to stay near the Ramblas, but after seeing the location i am soo happy we did not.

Would thoroughly recommend this hotel. My fiancee and I have been wanting to visit Barcelona for some time, and flew with BA from Heathrow. Before booking the Villa Emilia, we spent hours on the internet trying to find \"the perfect hotel\" - somewhere stylish, clean, friendly, good location, reasonably priced, etc, etc.. We had several hotels earmarked, but the Villa Emilia was the cheapest and we are so very pleased we picked it. It's got a certain special vibe that i cant quite explain. We just felt so at home there. The Metro is just a hundred yards or so stroll from the hotel. The hotel is extremely clean, stylish (it appears recently refurbished), very spacious rooms, beautiful \"wet room\" bathrooms, excellent breakfast, friendly staff who are so helpful at helping visitors with days out and how to get there, etc. There is a lovely roof terrace where you can drink and eat, and is a real suntrap in the afternoon.... it is a beautiful and peaceful place to relax after a day's sight seeing and shopping. We did most of our travelling by foot and Metro - the Metro is so simple to use - just like the Tube, but much, much cheaper. We bought a T10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys throughout several days and can be used by multiple people. An absolute bargain for 7.85 euros. We got a taxi from El Prat airport which set us back about 25 euros - it was by far the quickest and easiest way to get to the hotel, plus we got to see a little bit extra of the beautiful city that we wouldnt have otherwise seen. The taxi drivers \"dont spare the horses\" so prepare for a high-speed journey! Great fun though. We were advised to write down the address of our hotel so that the taxi driver would know where to drop us off. We always try to converse in the local language whenever we travel. In our handbook it said that Catalan is the preferred language (which is a variation of spannish), but when we tried to ask for things in Catalan, no-one seemed to understand, so we reverted back to Spannish. But everyone speaks English so there is no problem whatsoever with a language barrier. There is so much to do in this city, Barceloneta, Port Vell, Las Ramblas, Parc Guell, Sagrada Familia, and the Gothic Quarter were some of our favourites - shopping is excellent. The Zara and Mango stores (i thought) were quite a bit cheaper than the UK branches. If time allows, try out La Boqueria market just off of Las Ramblas... fresh meat, fish, fruit, etc in abundance. Despite warnings of pick pockets, etc, we both felt extremely safe wandering around at night in the tourist areas. The Placa Del Reil is a great place to visit for restaurants at night time. It is located in the Gothic Quarter. Me and my fiancee can't wait to return to Barcelona very soon, and next time we go there we wont be spending hours trawling the internet for the \"perfect hotel\"...we've already found it in the Villa Emilia.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cDidn't want to leave!\u201d", "Author": "helena928", "ReviewID": "UR103631067", "Content": "Since I rely on Trip Advisor so much, I thought it was only fair to give back and to write about our fabulous stay at the Villa Emilia.

When we were checking in there was a girl in the hotel lobby screaming and hysterically crying, clearly having some kind of a panic attack. She was creating quite a disturbance and since there was a queue at the reception desk we had no choice just to awkwardly stand next to her and look at our shoes. The concierge did nothing to calm her down or to reassure us, he just rolled his eyes as wait staff brought her a cup of tea and tried to find out what the problem was. She got up and went running out of the hotel sobbing and screaming but then ten minutes later she was back, inexplicably sitting in the lobby again, moaning and hyperventilating. My husband and I looked at eachother and wondered why no one was doing anything about this. We then asked the concierge where a certain restaurant was---its a very popular one rated in the top 5 on Trip Advisor. We forgot to bring the address and needed help. Well the concierge said he never heard of it and changed the subject. He could have offered to google it for us or to look it up or to ask another employee but he didn't because it didn't matter to him. So we looked it up ourselves and mapped out a route and got lost a few times on the way, all the while wondering why the concierge didn't just help us in the first place. When we returned we asked him where we should park our car. He vaguely gestured at the road outside and said there was a car park there that had an agreement with the hotel. We asked him the name of it and he didn't know. When we came back after parking our car we showed him the ticket from the car park and said 'Is this the one you were talking about? Did we park in the right car park?' and he didn't know. We were given a room above the bar where the loud piano music and talking could easily be heard, and the wailing of the hysterical girl in the lobby was perfectly audible as well. The room itself was unremarkable in every way. It could have been an airport Marriott or any other average hotel. The toiletries were cheap and minimal, the bed was uncomfortable, and the whole experience was so disappointing. The only nice thing I have to say about this hotel is that the bath towels are big and fluffy. As we were checking out the next day another couple were checking in and we heard a different concierge inform them that there was a free happy hour in the hotel with drinks and food provided between 5pm and 7pm. The guy who checked us in never mentioned this to us so we missed it.

Emilia is bustling, and has a very friendly and active cafe/bar scene on the first floor which is nice for a solo traveler like me. Live piano on several evenings each week. Good drinks and food. Good socializing location. The room was smaller than the ABaC, but that was to be expected. Very clean. Comfortable bed. No bath, but good shower with adjustable head. Plenty of storage space. Small, but functional flat screen TV. The key is the location. NOT in the busy Rambla area, this is just three short stops from the Rambla area on the FREQUENT subway. It is in more of a neighborhood of Barcelona rather than in the tourist area. So the cafe and restaurants nearby are more local fare, and not \"just\" for tourists -- which I found very nice. It was still a little cool in March, so the patio on the rooftop was never very busy. But I used it a lot. Very comfortable seating, nice neighborhood views, clean and enjoyable. I expect that in April and May and summer, it is more heavily used, and again a good place to meet other travelers and socialize. I am a rock climber and found a nearby rock gym, which was nice. And several outdoor adventure gear stores within two blocks in various directions. The area seemed very safe at night, and although Barcelona has a reputation for pick pockets, if you are careful about your money and valuables, you should have no problems. The staff was friendly, helping make a dinner reservation, find my way, get a cab, and recommend night clubs. I was able to check in early, which was very helpful. Overall, I would strongly recommend this option UNLESS you really want to be in a big luxury hotel, or you really want to be in the city center. Remember, Emilia is close enough to the city center that I often walked in, which took about 15 or 20 minutes. No pool.

Breakfast is fine albeit a little boring after 4 mornings of the same fare. The only main issue we had was the bed. Firstly, the 'pillows' were 2 mini cushions which caused an uncomfortable night's sleep for both my fianc\u00e9 and I. Also, we had booked a double bed which turned out to be 2 single beds pushed together. This added to the overall uncomfortableness of the sleeping experience with either one of us alternatively falling into the chasm in the middle! On our first morning there, the handle of the door fell off into our hands. We informed reception but it was never fixed and the receptionist did not seem that interested. Also, to repeat what a previous reviewer mentioned, the sliding bathroom door does not close all the way so there is little privacy. It wasn't a bad hotel at all and it's ideal for short stays.

The hotel is clean and it is centrally located, but those are the only two good things I can say for it. Here were the problems. 1: The beds were extremely uncomfortable. Though the mattress was fine, the pillows were little square fru-fru things whose sole purpose was to be decorative. They were terribly useless and caused us both to have massive headaches. 2: The rooms were adequately sized, but the bathroom doors were designed very poorly. They did not close all the way- ON PURPOSE! There was no privacy whatsoever. 3: The hotel had very poor noise control. The windows did not block out street noise at all and the walls were very thin. We could hear any and all hall noise. This became an especially big problem during the early mornings when the staff would set up to clean the halls. They would prop the elevators open, causing a Beep Beep Beep noise that would continue uninterrupted for about a half an hour. What a miserable way to be awakened! 4: The staff was incredibly rude. When we asked if there was a fan for the room, as it was both very hot and noisy, both of which could be alleviated by a fan, the staff person said \"I don't know what your problem is. It's cold outside. Why are you hot?\" The staff's rudeness was not a language issue, either, as I speak Spanish fluently. They simply were unkind and unhelpful. 5: The restaurant was terrible and overpriced. The food was not good, poorly cooked and very expensive. 6: They charged us twice. We prepaid for our stay when we booked. However, the hotel had no record of this. Rather than trying to work with us to resolve the problem, the staff was rude and wasn't willing to work with us. We were more than willing to pay again, with the understanding that we would resolve the issue with our credit card company. The staff simply said \"there's nothing to resolve. You haven't paid yet. You must pay.\" For us, the issue wasn't whether we were willing to pay, rather, we were treated like criminals for a clerical error on their part. Overall, we were very disappointed.

Entering the hotel, you'll find the reception on the right and the bar located comfortable on the left. Enjoyed the tapas and some fine wines, served by the glass, of course. Attention was given to details. Small things like candle lights, nice carpets, fine music and cozy chairs. Plus a piano, with yes, a pianist. In short, It felt like we owned our own luxery home (with staff) in Barcelona. You should certainly stay here when you visit Barcelona.

We had a fantastic time! The hotel only has 50 or so rooms and is what I would describe as a boutique hotel - tastefully decorated, comfortable and with just the right amount of luxury and intrigue. We had a room on the 6th floor and it was spotlessly clean, tasteful decor, and an en-suite with luxurious towels and baths products. My husband had secretly arranged for some flowers and a card to be put in the room for when we arrived and then that evening the hotel brought us up a free bottle of wine to drink in the room. The metro is about 2 minutes walk so perfect for getting around Barcelona and the hotel were great at recommending places to eat. We had breakfast the first morning in the hotel but that is quite expensive at 13 euros/person so the other mornings we went to a small cafe/boulangerie just round the corner from the hotel. The bar in the lobby is great especially in the evening when we would come back after our dinner and have a coffee which was the cheapest in town. For 1.10 euros we had a coffee served with glass of fresh orange juice and a chocolate and for an extra euro we got a shot of brandy in the coffee as well! Another lovely treat was the free tea/coffee/cakes in the hotel lobby between 5-7pm - great after a hard days shopping/sight seeing. We brought our car and were able to park it at a secure car park 1 minutes walk from the hotel and plus we got a discount by saying we were staying at Villa Emilia. So all in all I would definitely recommend this hotel. The only minor thing I would have liked would have been coffee/tea making facilities in the room as I do love a cup of tea in bed in the morning!", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "salisbury", "Title": "\u201cLove Barca, loved this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Babnye", "ReviewID": "UR85296324", "Content": "We stayed at the Villa Emilia for three nights with our two children.

They were also happy to confirm our room number in writing, something which some hotels find very difficult. We had two room which were facing each other on the sixth floor and there was an outside door in the hallway which could be shut, allowing the two rooms to be kept as one (although one minor niggle was that there was no way to keep the room doors opened). The rooms were spotless and cleaned thoroughly every day \u2013 and I am VERY fussy! They were comfortable and had a good selection of tv channels. Breakfast was great and the staff friendly and helpful. The afternoon coffee, with pastries, was a nice treat and a welcome break after sightseeing. There were limited smaller size meals (or tapas) which was a little disappointing as it would have made it easier for us to eat with children. But the terrace was beautiful and the mojitos very good. I really liked the location. Close enough to everything, but far enough away for peace in the evening. You can get to Placa Catalunya in 5-10 mins on the very regular buses (metro tickets can be used on the buses too \u2013 just punch ticket in slot as you get on). If you get a T-10 (from the ticket machines in the Metro stations \u2013which have a language selecetion) you can share it and use it for 10 journeys. Children don\u2019t pay. You can jump on the Metro at the end of road and get anywhere too. It took us, with a 4 and a 7 year old, 40 minutes to get to Camp Nou by tube \u2013 also note you do not have to pay for children to have tickets for a game if they are young and are prepared to share a seat (although seats were available for them too when we got there). You can also buy tickets on the day from the ground at Club rather than agency prices (unless it is a Madrid game or another really big match I guess).

I told him my group would arrive around 4 PM. Arriving around 5:30, a young, Argentinian lady named \"JULIA\" \"welcomed\" us with the following sentence: \"...name? ohh, I was about to cancel your reservation...wrong phone number, wrong credit card number, nothing was right.\" Can't you at least say HI??? I mean even if you walk in a supermarket you receive a Hello! This is a hotel, a business. If you have a staff so impolite, trust me, your business will not last for long. Apparently, I was the person who made a mistake when \"FERNANDO\" took down my information wrong (he was in a rush when talking with me on the phone!!!). I asked for her manager after the rooms were--unwillingly, i should say--sorted out. All of a sudden, a mature lady to the right of \"JULIA\" said in an arrogant manner \"I'm the proprietor.\" That is when I had nothing to say... 2) COMPLIMENTARY COFFEE AT FIRST FLOOR What a joke! An embarrassment! Imagine a group of 8 businessmen going to the first floor and encountering empty trays and no coffee or tea! I mean, sometimes its better not to offer something. 3) AVOID ROOMS ON THE FIRST FLOOR They are really inconvenient.

Make sure you ask for a Wifi User and password if your bringing a laptop etc as they will have it printed out for you, wifi access is free and available throughout the buliding (even the terrace on the top floor). Funnily enough we were put in a Queen bedroom suite (room 66 on the 6th floor) which was right in front of the elevator, initially i was worried about noise of people coming in and out the lift but soon realized it actually benefited us in reaching our room quicker. Upon entering the room I had a look around to see if any of tripadvisor reviews were accurate and to my surprise most of them were. The room was extremely clean and very welcoming.. in the bathroom there were about 4 large towels and one floor towel, complementary soap and shampoo, fresh rolls of tissue and even a hair dryer! most importantly it was extremely clean. In the main room there was a safe (big enough to fit my laptop, passports, phones, glasses etc) built in a cupboard and out of site which was good. Just underneath that was a mini fridge, keep in mind that these drinks cost extra. Lighting could have been better as there's no ceiling light but the lights smartly placed around the room were more then sufficient to our needs. There was a single chair which was comfy and this bench type chair on the side which was cool. View from the balcony was top notch. The bed was one big double bed with 1 mattress which I was very happy about as I've been in many hotels before hand which just use 2 singles pushed together. The tv had a few channels showing quite a few american programs such as House and Bones etc. I have to say that service here is extremely good with staff being very friendly, an example is when my gf accidentally locked our safe and forgot the code. One call to reception, a staff came and assisted us and solved our problem all within 5minutes. The terrace upstairs was very nicely designed with a great view and a bar, great place to lay around being lazy. The Included breakfast was good with fresh food and a good selection to choose from but for those who decide not to have breakfast here can easily walk around and find little bakery shops at nearly every corner which provide a cheaper alternative. There's free tea and coffee every afternoon with rolls and croissants which was perfect for winding down after a long day out. Dinner here was pretty good with different daily special 4 course meals available at a set price although very pricey. (btw there's an awesome little kebab shop across the street that must be tried). Overall this hotel simply put is awesome with a lot of attention put into details. Definitely recommended. If your visiting for the first time you should get a Tour bus as its very good. If your staying for longer a T10 metro ticket should be enough. Glad i didnt get a barcelona card as i dont think i would have used it at all. The discount aint worth it and you wont have enough time to visit all the museum's unless u stay longer then 7days, tour bus ad t10 should take you to all the places you need to go.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGood Location, Great Service and Rooftop Bar\u201d", "Author": "MMCPT", "ReviewID": "UR78872547", "Content": "Enjoyed our stay at hotel on the 6th floor.

The lobby of the hotel is very beautifully decorated with a modern touch, staff was comprised of mainly young people ready to greet us and take care of our reservation. We received our double bedroom as soon as we arrived and it was all I hoped it would be, modern, spotless clean, comfy, with free wi-fi, flat screen tv and overlooking the street corner which was quite a quiet one because we slept very well. We didn't get our luggage until the next 24hs and all the time the staff was eager to help us in any way..lending us their phone to call the airline with no charge to our room. Hotel didn't include breakfast so can't comment on their food although we did stop by the mezzanine for a coffee and biscuits placed next to their computer center. The hotel has a very nice top floor with a balcony lounge area where you can sit and relax enjoying a nice cocktail at night. The location is actually quite good to visit Barcelona. You can practically walk to the magic fountain and discover Montjuic or just take the Metro which is less than two blocks away and use it to go anywhere in the city as it is so easy and convenient.

The hotel is about 10mins walk away from Pla\u00e7a Espa\u00f1a Aerobus stop. The Aerobus (A1) takes approx 25mins to reach Pla\u00e7a Espa\u00f1a stop from Barcelona El Prat Airport and costs EUR 5.05 per ticket (roundtrip ticket costs EUR 8.75 and it's valid for 9 days). Per email from the hotel, a taxi from El Prat airport will cost approx EUR 30 - 35 depending on traffic and which day of the week (taxi rates differ between weekdays and weekends). Taxi will take approx 20-30mins. Or the hotel can arrange for a luxury car for you, which will cost EUR 75 - 85. The hotel is located in a quieter area of Barcelona, away from the hustle and bustle of La Ramblas (but only few metro stops away). There is a small grocery shop diagonally opposite the hotel which you can purchase water/drinks/snacks. The room is cosy but not claustrophobic. The room was also very clean. The bathroom tiles are all black, but it's brightly lit so it's not a problem. They use ~H2O+ brand (http://www.h2oplus.com) amenities but only offer shower gel, shampoo and body lotion. They do not provide other essential amenities (e.g. toothbrush, toothpaste, cotton pads, shower cap, etc) so best to pack them with you or maybe they will be provided upon request. The water pressure is good. The only complaint is that while the shower looks cool and modern, it floods 1/3 of the bathroom floor after a shower. I know these boutique hotels often have modern and sleek designs, but it also should be functional. They should have better designs for the shower. We requested for a double bed, but they gave us two single beds pushed together and the beds tend to separate during the course of the night. Not very comfortable if someone is sleeping near the middle. Not sure if they have proper double beds at the hotel. The beds are quite hard, so if anyone prefers a soft bed, beware! As the air-conditioner is quite cool (you cannot turn the temp higher than 25\u00b0C) I requested for an extra blanket, but they told me they do not have any spare blankets. Normally they will take one from another room, but since the hotel was operating at full capacity, they could not offer me another blanket. I think this is quite ridiculous, how could a hotel not have spare blankets? They also do not have coffee/tea making facilities in the room. There were not many English channels on TV, so if you like relaxing and watching TV in the room, best to bring your laptop and download some movies. The reception staff were courteous and helpful. They helped to make restaurant bookings, print maps of places we wanted to visit and suggested areas to go for dinner if you did not have a specific restaurant in mind. They all spoke good English. We had dinner at the hotel one night and the food was really good. The prices were not too expensive and if you are too tired to go out after a day of sightseeing and shopping, it would be a good idea to stay in and enjoy dinner at Zinc. As there are usually only a few tables occupied, the ambience is very relaxing. If you like to chill out, they also have a roof-top terrace upstairs with lounge music. I chose this hotel after extensive research on Trip Advisor and apart from several minor faults, this is a good choice for Barcelona at this price (\u00a399 on Sat in Aug 2010 and \u00a379 on Sun & Mon in Aug 2010 + \u00a37 taxes & service fees per night - booked via Expedia). If you are looking for a more centrally located hotel, try looking at Murmuri (also mentioned in the Luxe City Guides - http://www.luxecityguides.com), I was deciding between Murmuri and Villa Emilia. I chose Villa Emilia in the end as there seemed to be more positive comments on Trip Advisor and also because they provided free wi-fi (this should be standard in all hotels!).", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel and great roof terrace\u201d", "Author": "EJH79", "ReviewID": "UR77399155", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights in August 2010.

Location of the hotel is just a few tube stops away (takes about 10 mins) from the main drag (La Rambla etc), then just a tiny stroll past some nice supermarkets to the hotel. It is perfect - away from the hustle and bustle and a little cheaper too. The room we had was very clean comfy and inviting- beds were fresh, soft - excellent quality linen, the bathroom was immaculate, ample space. There was a fridge and the toiletries supplied were luxury - the same as what they use in their spa!! When it came to our departure day, we made the most of sightseeing and the manager personally allowed us to hang out in the upstairs loft - free afternoon tea each day. We also were offered a glass of bubble`s! The upstairs bar is very sleek and a great place to wiund down with a drink after a long day of walking.

This was our second stay here. Firstly as a couple, and now returning with our 4 children - ranging from 14 - 6. We had 2 rooms, though not next to each other, they were on the same floor. Each room had a very comfortable 'put you up' bed in. There was still plenty of space in each room. One room had a bath and shower, the other just a shower. Why Hotel Villa Emilia works for us.....location - it is no more than 2 minutes from the Metro (Rockfort) - We used the Metro all the time. Safe, clean and efficient (our 6 and 10 year old boys were invited to ride in the cab of one!!). The Metro will get you where you want quickly enough at a reasonable price. Breakfast included in the price - a good hearty breakfast with all the continental favourites (delicious pastries, jams, yogurts, cheeses, hams, soft boiled eggs, fruit salad, plus cereals, toast and any type of coffee you like - just ask at the kitchen). Internet Access - to check flights, look at restaurant reviews, kids to keep up with Facebook! (and with our extended stay due to the volcano, schools sending homework by email!). Happy Hour - which was 2 hours, where free coffee, water and pastries were available late afternoon. Friendly and helpful staff - we managed a late check out, and luggage store with no problem, homework was printed off at the hotel printer, The bar was reasonably priced. It felt a safe, friendly place to be after a day of touring the city. I would recommend it to anyone who was visiting Barcelona, just remember you are not in the thick of the city, so plan your dining out, as there are some lovely restaurants around - they just need a little searching. We found a great Chinese buffet and a lovely Indian restaurant very near by. There is also a supermarket only 1 minute away and a 'corner shop' opposite the hotel entrance. Other notes are - the complimentary shower gel and shampoo are lovely, no need to pack your own. The hairdryer is not that strong. There is very little English speaking TV in the rooms - and if you have children just be careful what they are watching, as there are some adult programs during the day! The rooms were really warm, and we struggled a little to keep them cool, hotel staff advised they were still on their 'winter setting'. The Roof top bar was having some work done on it, but I expect this has been completed by now. We caught the Aerobus from the airport - after much debating on the cost of a taxi - 120 Euro return we decided to catch the bus. Which worked fantastically well - At 5 Euros pp each way - and they didn't charge for our youngest two. The drop off is a 10 minute walk to the hotel, or one metro ride. We only took hand luggage and the children managed fine pulling their cases behind them.

There are two computers with internet access and a sitting area with 4 or 5 tables in this space. There is also a comfortable sitting area on the roof with views of the nearby area. We stayed on the 6th floor. The room and bathroom was very clean, modern, smartly decorated and efficient. The wood floors unfortunately create some noise when moving furniture or when the lightweight beds get nudged. The beds are too hard, uncomfortable and unstable for my liking. Can you find something better in Barcelona, maybe. Barcelona is a noisy city that is somewhat contained by the modernity of the hotel. The problem many people in the hotel encountered was that the rooms were very warm and needed ventilation at night. To open the door style windows meant serious noise all night long from scooters, ambulances (there were several per night), and garbage trucks. We found ourselves opening and closing the windows several times each night to get some fresh air. There is also some room to room noise, some voices and banging cabinetry. The location is not optimum for shoppers or sightseers but is three blocks to the Aerobus stop to and from the airport and one block to the metro. There are many restaurants in the area and if you like to walk a city like I do, the location is central to many points of interest and therefore not a problem to get to by walking or metro.

When we called Front desk to ask how can we put the AC on, they explained that the entire hotel is not able to use it since we are in winter mode. Secondly on New Years Eve we wanted to have a drink in the lobby at 9pm before heading to the restaurant. There were around 6 employees just standing there waiting for their guests. When we asked for a drink they seemed distraught. Someone from the front desk came to explain to us that the bar is closed and can only focus on the restaurant. On the way back from the restaurant at 1am, we wanted to see if we could get a last drink. We were also told no. We found it quite ridiculous. Instead the staff went out to smoke. Is it really that hard to multi task ? My friends dryer was not working, she called FD and they told her they could only change it for her tomorrow. We had bfast during our stay at the hotel. The coffee looked funny (more water than coffee) during the 2 days we were there. When we brought it to their attention they seemed annoyed. Instead we asked for coffee made by the expresso machine.

Substantial chocolate floor to ceiling drapes could be pulled across the windows at night, completely blocking the lights and noise. We had no trouble sleeping until 10am several mornings. We requested and received a Twin room, which consisted of two twin beds adjacent to each other, but made up separately. This was quite comfortable for two people not wanting to share a single bed. The bathroom was clean and spacious. I was given a password to connect to the wireless network which worked in our room throughout our stay. The entire staff was very helpful and pleasant at all times. We did not opt for the hotel breakfast, but we did have coffee in our room several times, which was delivered promptly. After a day of sightseeing we would stop by the Zinc Bar for a cava, and the bartenders could not have been friendlier. It was warm enough in the evening to enjoy the cozy rooftop bar. We checked out the night before leaving, asking for a wakeup call at 7:30, coffee at 8, and a taxi at 8:30. All were delivered with precision. The hotel is located in a nice residential part of the city, just a block away from the Rocafort metro stop and a 10 minute walk from Plaza Cataluna. I guess it depends on what you are looking for, but I personally felt more at ease staying in this friendly neighborhood of young professionals walking their dogs and old couples strolling arm in arm to the Tango Club or out for some Tapas than in the midst of the tourist district where one is told to constantly be on guard for thieves. Most days we enjoyed the walk into town and back. It rained on our last day so we took the Metro into the Barri Gotic, which took less than 10 minutes. We walked to and ate at several nice restaurants in the neighborhood, including La Clara which is right around the corner on Gran Via Corts Catalanes and La Flauta which is 8 blocks away on Carrer D'Aribau (or 2 blocks from the Universitat metro stop). We tried to get in to the \"hot spot\" tapas bar Inopia which is 5 blocks away on the intersection of Rocafort and Tamarit, but they were no longer seating people when we arrived at 10:45pm. I would not hesitate to recommend this wonderful hotel to anybody looking for a great place to stay away from the crowds but convenient to everything. I will definitely choose it again when I return to Barcelona!", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glendale, California", "Title": "\u201cLOVED Villa Emilia\u201d", "Author": "macchiozabka", "ReviewID": "UR47716321", "Content": "i tend to prefer boutique hotels over larger corporate hotels because of the more personal service and the attention to detail. hotel villa emilia did not disappoint. the room was immaculate and the bed & linens were extremely comfortable. the decor is very modern and tastefully done. we had drinks one night on the beautiful rooftop terrace (best mojitos), don't miss it. the only downside (which isn't a big deal) was there was no internet/wifi access in the rooms, but villa emilia made up for it with free internet service in their business center.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cLove it, Love it, Love it!!!!\u201d", "Author": "GAB1981", "ReviewID": "UR47436912", "Content": "Visited Barcelona in September and stayed at Hotel Villa Emilia for 4 Nights.

They provide coffee, tea and pastries between 5 and 7pm, and they have an amazing rooftop bar where you can grab a drink and snack before you head out to dinner. Rooms - The rooms are nicely decorated, very clean, and a decent size. The beds were also surprisingly comfortable. And we had doors that opened to a mini balcony which provided us with some fresh air which was nice. The bathrooms were modern, but I have two complaints. 1) There is no door on the shower so water tended to get everywhere and 2) There is a sliding door to the bathroom that doesn't do much to control noise, so you can hear EVERYTHING your travel partner does in the bathroom. Location - We tend to walk everywhere and while it was only a 20-30 min walk to La Rambla, it was still a bit farther than i would have liked. Especially since the area around the hotel didn't have too much going on. But there are a couple of metro stations closeby and you can easily take a cab for very little money to where you want to go.

The hotel is very well appointed - modern and very well decorated throughout. A particular feature is the roof terrace which manages to provide a peaceful oasis in the middle of the bustling city. The bar on the terrace is staffed in the evenings but there is an intercom to the bar main bar downstairs and the staff are excellent - taking orders and arriving with drinks very quickly. Another nice touch is the provision of free tea/coffee and small pastries between five and seven in the evenings on the first floor lounge. Breakfast, whilst not extensive, is of a very high standard including the usual continental fare but with the best coffee I have drunk abroad in addition to white wine or Cava. We didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfasts, preferring to choose from the vast variety of small cafes/bistros/restaurants/bars all easily available. If you can't find somewhere to suit your tastes in Barcelona then stay at home and eat ready prepared supermarket food! Our favourite was the boat in Port Vell serving drinks and tapas (even though the meat balls lasted well into the following day!) The Villa Emilia staff we found to be very friendly and helpful. Some spoke only a limited amount of English (but why should they speak more as they speak Catalan as well as Spanish which is more than most people can manage). They are very patient and the reception staff speak English very well indeed. The whole place is sparklingly clean and appears to be very well cared for with no chipped and scuffed paintwork to be found. The bed was a little on the hard side of firm and there was only just sufficient clothes storage space. The bathroom was very well designed and the quality of the towels was very good.

We were on the 6th floor, the rooms were cleaned every day and done well , sound proofing seemed excellent as was the Air Con which worked well. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and as with most places you get out what you put in. The food from the restaurant was probably the best we had in Barcelona, and provided at exceptional value. So in terms of the hotel i really can't fault it. It terms of location then it depends on what you want as its not directly on top of the tourist attractions it being located a few minutes up the road from Rocafort Metro. That has its advantages as its fairly well located to some of the interesting places away from the Town Center such as Monjuic , However its going to take 15 - 20 Mins, to get to the Metro and then on to areas such as the Ramblas , Gothic Quarter or the Port areas.

First of all, thanks for all the comments previously posted here, they were extremely helpful. Overall the hotel is stylish, clean, spacious, quiet and new. Everything was good - couple of things worth mentioning: We had no problem with the water pressure in the shower, it worked very well, probably fixed since the last complaints were filed. We also had no problem with the air-con, which as we understand, were only turned on in summer (mid june onwards). The air-con was centrally controlled, and I have doubts as to whether the individual adjustment of temperature in the room had any impact. But that wasn't a problem as the air-con was certainly cool enough for the summers. We asked for a room facing the back of the building, and had no problem with noise at all (even though I admit I am particularly sensitive to noise). There're only 3 of those rooms on each floor, so be sure you asked for one beforehand if you want a quiet night's sleep. There's a roof terrace on the 7th floor, so not sure if rooms on the 6/F would be affected by noise from the terrace if there are parties (our room was on 5/F which had no problem with that). But the terrace is closed from 1 AM onwards so again that shouldn\u2019t be a problem as you're unlikely to sleep earlier than 1 AM in spain anyway. Cold breakfast was sumptuous and delicious. Location is great, we had a 3-day travel pass, and it took us everywhere around barcelona from the hotel through metro (nearest stop from hotel is Rocafort, 3 min walk) in short time (to the main tourist areas just a few stops away, very convenient). It's not situated at the most touristy areas like La Ramblas but that's a plus for us, as we want a quiet room - and in any case, the hotel is just a short distance from all the tourist destinations by metro. Staff at the counter was helpful and speaks fluent english. The room has a working safe deposit box, highly recommend you use it for holding valuable documents before roaming around barcelona. The design of the room makes it very warm - warm lighting, the light coloured and wooden furniture, the wooden floor. The H2O toiletries were very soothing, esp the shower gel. The lobby is stylishly designed, hip. There are two computers which you can use for free, again that\u2019s a bonus. The minor drawbacks- there is no glass pane or curtain that prevents water from flooding into the bathroom floor when you shower. But that was a minor problem, compared to all the other great things about the hotel. Also, most rooms are twin-bedded rather than with double beds, and all rooms facing the back are with twin beds. Also, warning re all hotels in spain - no kettle is provided. No parking spaces. To and from airport - around 30 euros taxi.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex", "Title": "\u201cAdored this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "steph246", "ReviewID": "UR34131760", "Content": "A beautifully elegant yet 'cool' hotel with perpetually happy and helpful staff.

The hotel was absolutely brilliant. We were really impressed with how modern and stylish it was and our room (No. 68) was clean and spacious. Also our bed was a double as opposed to two singles pushed together which you often get in hotels. The service was excellent, with all staff being kind and friendly towards us.

It's not cheap at 13 Euros each but the choice was excellent: cheese, salmon, meats, fresh fruit, cereals, yoghurts, various types of gorgeous fresh bread, pastries, eggs, a selection of wonderful preserves, juices - and a glass or two of cava! Things did run out but the staff were very helpful and at no time did we feel there wasn't enough. It was just the perfect way to start a day. A special mention must be made of the selection of teas on offer as they were absolutely delicious and so different from anything I've had before. There is a bar and small restaurant area on the ground floor. Prices for drinks are cheap compared to the UK, around 4 Euros for a glass of decent Rioja. On the first floor mezzanine is what the hotel calls its business area with free internet access and complimentary coffee/tea and pastries between 5 and 7 each evening.

The front desk attendant showed us to our room and using his master key he opened up our room and then left us w/o a key. He promised he'd see what he could do, but after 15 minutes waiting in our room, we never heard from him. The room key is NEEDED to activate the lights and power, so this didn't do us any good. That meant we had to shower in the dark and my wife could not use her hair dryer. Upon leaving i checked with the front desk when i could have a key to my room and they said it would be around 3pm. I also had to correct them before leaving... they assigned us one room and gave us a notecard with a room number on it, but they put us in a different room on the same floor. While we were gone, i didn't want them letting someone else into our room b/c of a mismatch. We left for lunch and came back later in the afternoon to get ready for dinner. While my wife was getting ready, i asked the front desk if they could give me access to the free Wi Fi. But they didn'y know how to set it ip on my Mac. In the US, my Mac just finds wireless network available, you select it, and enter the password... i guess their process was different. So unable to use my laptop, i used their computers in their business center. But all their computers were set up in Italian. I asked the front desk attendant if she could show me how to change the lanugage on the cpu, but she didn't know how to do that either.

We spent three nights at Emilia before taking a cruise. This is a great little hotel. The rooms, while not large by U.S. standards are beautiful with a very contemporary style. The tile and marble bathroom was one of the most interesting designs I've seen. You absolutely don't want to miss the outdoor, rooftop bar and sitting area. Terrific views of the city and they serve some very nice spanish wines. This hotel is a little farther away from the La Rambla and other tourist sites so it's a bit more quiet but the metro station is just around the corner so you are never more than ten to twenty minutes from most of the must see spots in Barcelona. The metro is inexpensive and very easy to use. We used the metro to get from the Barcelona airport to the hotel. The connections were easy but be aware, their are stairs to negotiate with your bags are many of the metro stations. The staff at Emilia was very friendly and helpful with the exception on one fellow at the front desk. We only saw him one time during our stay. The lobby bar and small restaurant is very contemporary and stylish but it comes with a price. It's very expensive. There's a great little bakery/pastry shop just a few doors away for coffee and pastry as well as lunch items. If you are interested in the hotel, you might watch the \"specials\" link on their website. We were lucky enough to book a package that included the buffet breakfast which was very good. The items are typical of a European breakfast so don't expect to find scarmbled eggs and hashbrowns. In a city with a lot of hotels, I think this one is a great find. It's only been open a couple of years so some of the travel guides don't list it. Finally, we found a great, reasonably priced restaurant just about three blocks away on the Grand Via.

Location wise, we found the hotel just that little bit out of the way although it was a quite, safe neighbourhood and the hotel was close to a metro stop. We wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to travel and be in the heart of things - and that by no way means staying on the La Ramblas! As we spent 10 days in Barcelona we had the opportunity to stay at 2 other hotels - one in the Barri Gothic and the standout hotel - Hotel Granados 83, in the Eixample district - a fabulous hotel in a wonderful neighbourhood within easy reach to all the main attractions, and if you enjoy good food, you'll find some of the best (not necessarily expensive) restaurants in Barcelona within easy walking distance. .", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cHighlight of our Europe tour\u201d", "Author": "TheRoadtoMajastres", "ReviewID": "UR17586189", "Content": "Excellent hotel.

The only drawback to our room was the bathroom had a sliding door that didn't quite close all the way. So you had best be comfortable with each other -- or use the restrooms in the basement, which were also very tasteful. The room had a safe, which is nice. We never ate at the hotel, but we had coffee there and it was lovely coffee -- perfect, in fact. There is also a very nice open-air lounge on the roof.

All the reviews I have read on Trip Advisor have been entirely accurate. The rooms are a good size and quiet, with everything you'd expect. The air con worked like a dream. The breakfast is lovely (wine included if early boozing is your thing). The staff were very friendly and accommodated all my requests. The roof terrace is another major plus point which serves great drinks for only a few euros. It was so attractive that we met many locals up there too. One point i would mention is that it is a good 20 minute walk into the main tourist areas which if your not a good walker could be difficult. However, there is a metro stop (Rocafort) less than 50 metres from the Hotel so you can get anywhere in the city in no time at all. We used the metro all the time and found it really easy to use and quick (get a T-10 card as it's really good value and more than one person can use it at a time). We didn't notice any crime issues at all on the metro or in the city as a whole, in fact it felt much safer than any other city i've been to, even late at night. If your travelling from the airport to the hotel the airport bus stops at placa espanya and urgell metro stop both of which are only four blocks either side of the hotel so unless you've got some seriously heavy baggage this is by far the cheapest and easiest option. Tickets cost 4.10 euros compared to at least 25 euros for a taxi.

It's located on a small quiet square just off the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, a main avenue that cuts across the city. A very clean room with a designer look, it had a flat screen TV and a large and comfortable bed.The room had a safe and mini-bar. The bathroom, with black slate tiles and white fittings, was spotless, with a very good power shower. Hairdryer provided and good quality shampoo. The hotel is well worth its 4 star rating. Breakfast, if you have it, is continental buffet style - not the biggest I've seen but personally, adequate with sufficient choice. The hotel is away from the main tourist area. There's a metro station (Rocafort) at the end of the street (approx 50 metres) with good access across the city. It is a 20 minute walk from the hotel to Place de Catalunya (5 minutes on metro), one of the city's main squares. Off this square runs the well known but noisy (and sometimes tacky) street La Rambla. Ten minutes walk in the other direction is Place Espana from where you can get a train to the mountain-top monastery of Monsterrat (easy to reach and not to be missed). Place Espana is also one of the stops for the tourist buses that travel the city on three separate loops (buy a two day ticket -26 euros - there's much to see and the city is large). Could not see many restaurants immediately around the hotel - mainly cafes, but there are probably some in other streets. The hotel does have a restaurant on the ground floor (didn't eat there) and a bar. There's also a rooftop terrace bar (very nice on a warm summer evening).

I assume that the rooms facing the back of the hotel are completely quiet. Very unusual for city hotels: we could not hear a thing from next door. The bath was also modern and simple. The only minor complaint we had was that the maid was really saving on toiletries. On Sunday, there was only one staff attending to the breakfast buffet, so they had troubles filling back the plates. On the following days the service was excellent. The selection is continental/European, so people from the US may miss their rich breakfast. The hotel is not in the heart of the city, which is good. It is not a rip-off and it is quiet. During the day we moved around by metro - one of the best services we have seen in the world.

We didn't want to be in the heart of the city with all the noise and hustle of the areas such as the Ramblas. This hotel is in the perfect location: quiet area with local shops and restaurants. A 20 minute walk to the Placa Catalunya and a 10 minute walk from the A1 airport bus from Placa d'Espana. The Rocafort train station is just down the block. We walked everywhere from the location of this property - even to the beaches of the Barceloneta in just over an hour (or you could be there in less than 15 minutes with the easy metro) The hotel played wonderful music the 6 days we were there. Very relaxing music, appropriate music no matter what country you are coming from. You could listen to the music on the roof terrace, on one their comfortable couches, drinking a glass of CAVA. (which we did every night after being out all day). So relaxing and peaceful. And at 3.50 euros a glass of Cava (Spanish champagne), it's a bargain. They even have a live piano player by the lobby bar (who was great!) Rooms are modern, VERY quiet (we heard no noises from other rooms the 6 nights we were there). Flat panel TV with a couple of stations in English, one in French, German, Spanish and some with subtitles. You control the temp of the room, they have windows that open that are soundproofed when closed. We faced the back and had no outdoor noise disturbances. Room was an adequate size for 2 people. I read in one review about the square shapes of their pillows. I had a concern with that being I have neck problems. Best sleep I had in 6 nights. Don't let the shape of the pillows be of any concern. Breakfast was from 7:30 am till 11:00. Teas, coffee, hard boiled eggs, cheeses, hams, cereals, yogurt, salami, fresh fruit, fresh orange and grapefruit juices, assorted pastries and fresh bread Afternoons from 5:00-7:00 they put out coffee and teas and some snacks. One computer for free internet use. Staff: unbelievably friendly, helpful and really make an effort to make your experience special. The Catalan people are genuinely wonderful and EVERY staff person there made our stay even more special. I got sick one day, and the woman behind the desk researched a place for me to see a doctor. First thing she asked me the next day was if I was better and if I found the doctor's office. I'm mentioning this only because it shows the quality of the staff. All in all, we were so glad we picked the Villa Emilla. We had walked by other hotels that we were thinking of staying at and realized we would not have been happier staying at those other properties (basically because of the location or price) If you want a quiet, wonderful place to come back to after being out all day, this is the place. If you are a big walker, you can walk to anywhere from the hotel. If you're not a walker, having the train station a block away can get you anywhere from 2 minutes to 15 minutes. Bus to Parc Guell (a must if you love Gaudi, took 30 minutes) My advice: stay away from hotels on the Gran Via, Las Rablas, and any of the big placa's if you're sensitive to noise. Drink the cava at the Hotel Villa Emilia. We loved it so much, we bought a bottle to take home (you cannot buy that brand at duty free in PRAT) nor did I find it at any liquor store.

The first evening, my Aunt experienced a fall and by the time we got back to the hotel she was faint and decided to go to the hospital. Nothing serious, just too much travel. She returned to the hotel very late in the evening so no food was available at the hotel. Without even being asked to, a staff member went to a nearby cafe and brought her back soup and bread! The hotel is very near the Metro which is easy to use and takes you all over the city. We were always happy to return to the hotel as it was such a warm and inviting place to be.

I booked through lastminute.com & managed to book 4 nights for the bargain price of \u00a3285... that worked out at only \u00a3142.50 each for my friend & I so obviously we were very pleased we'd found a bargain! We flew with Ryanair to Girona airport & got the Barcelona Bus into the city. It was all very easy except that we came out of the wrong exit of the bus station & got a bit lost trying to find the metro stop! We discovered later that if we had just turned left instead of right we would've found a metro stop in about 30 seconds!! Once we found the metro it was very simple to reach the Villa Emilia... Rocafort metro on the red line is about 200m from the hotel entrance. On arriving at the hotel, my friend thought the hotel was actually a swanky bar before we walked past the entrance & realised it was our hotel... needless to say we were very impressed with the overall appearance of the place. The staff were very friendly throughout the duration of our stay & spoke very good english. The room was lovely & the maids ensured that it was spotless every day when we returned from a long day of sight-seeing. The Villa Emilia is about a 10-15 minute walk from Placa Catalunya & La Rambla where the real tourist centre is. We found lots of nice restaurants in the area, although the nightlife wasn't to our taste... maybe we were looking in the wrong places but the hotel bar was definately our preferred location after eating out in the city..... especially since draft beer was only 2 euros a glass!! A bargain price considering the posh appearance of the hotel! Another thing to note is that on the thursday, friday & saturday night the hotel had a piano player playing live music in the bar, which made for a very nice, relaxing atmosphere. The villa emilia definately made our stay in Barcelona wonderful! Oh and a final point.... the bathroom was lush!! The toiletries were even gorgeous...

The staff were very helpful and friendly. The location is superb and metro travel is very cheap. We also walked around the local area and had some very reasonable and tasty meals in the surrounding area. The deli next door is super. We really recommend the Turistica bus as well - buy for 2 days - almost the same cost as one - and we spent half the day riding around looking where we wanted to go back to for the rest of the trip. it is worthwhile waiting to get on the roof top - in the end it was very quick even though the queues seemed very long, but if sunny make sure you have a hat! We loved all about Gaudi and even the queues went down very quickly so don't be put off by them. Park Gaudi great, we also did one organised trip through the tourist bureau and went to a vineyard, the monastery (wonderful views) and then short trip to Sitges. We were exhaused at the end of the 5 days, and still had loads to see. There is free internet access - but only one computer - so the downside of this was that there was a family with 2 teenage children staying who were constantly on 'myface'/'youtube' or similar - and they did not follow the concept that if people are waiting you limit your access to 30 minutes......Our only disappointment was the breakfast. After reading other reviews I used the Spainbookers web-site to book 3 nights for the price of 2, although we stayed 4 nights in total.When booking through spainbookers I booked and paid for the breakfast to be included, but when we got to the hotel they said this was not an option unless you book through the hotel's own web-site. Unfortunately, when booking through spainboookers your receipt only confirms the booking and not what was included and so although we had paid for the breakfast - which was very nice - we had to pay again. We did ask to speak to the manager - who we met with the next day - but he again said they did not include breakfast through e-bookers but did give us a free drink at the bar.

The check-in was smooth, the staff was friendly. The room was, as expected, quite minimalist. Very spacious room with two single beds, what really charmed me was a box in which sample perfumes from Bulgari and two mini bottles of martini on the desk as a compliment for the guest. The bathroom was very clean and there's a very good tub (if you are used to the shallow American-style tub, this hotel's tub is going to be a treat). They provide one big bath towel and a mid-size one, if you like using the small washcloth-sized towel, bring your own. I decided to book with Expedia, although the hotel website also had a good deal that included their renowned buffet breakfast with Cava. I went for the Room-only deal with the Expedia because I wanted to expolre the breakfast scene in the neighborhood, and it was going to be cheaper to do so. The buffet breakfast at the hotel looked very nice (and indeed you can help yourself to glasses of Cava in the morning, what a treat), but it does not start until 7:30. We got up at around six (jet-lag?) and got pretty hungry so we went to look for breakfast in the neighborhood. There's a bakery between the hotel and the Metro Station Rocafort, called Pan something (sorry lost the exact name), but you'll see locals flocking to this bakery from about 6:30 so you won't miss it. Their pastries are very big, and they obviously used high quality wheat. Their sandwiches (with omelettes and jamon) were so good we went back every morning for more. You need to queue a little because there are loyal fans from the neighborhood claiming their morning fix of their pastries with cafe con leche. Back to the room. The TV, like in many European hotels, many channels didn't have any sound, or if at all, only very faint sound. The hotel staff didn't know how to fix it, so we were not able to watch too much TV, which is not very necessary anyway given you are in Barcelona. The only thing about the room is that because it is rather generically minimalist, it may remind many from the UK of a generic \"luxury flats\" in any city in England. It did certainly remind me of my previous flat. In other words, it did not feel very Spanish or Catalan, but it was comforting in a way, to have guaranteed cleanliness and convenience of modern flat living. I may try to stay in a place with a little stronger character next time, but I might also end up choosing Villa Emilia again because for this good price, I don't know if you can get much better service of comfort.

My main gripe was with my room, even though I had requested a room on one of the higher floors we were put into a room on the first floor , the first floor is a mezzanine overlooking the lobby and bar area ie there is no wall so therefore from inside the room we could hear the noise of people in the bar, piano playing until 1.00am and the night porter having conversations with people coming in from their nights out, also in the morning you could hear the staff getting the bar set up for breakfast. I did ask to be moved to another room but apparently the hotel was full so no joy. So my advice is request that you dont get allocated rooms 10,11 or 12 .

Room was nicely decorated and very chic, but bathroom extractor fan didnt work leaving the bathroom a bit smelly and if reading this Hotel Villa Emilia, please change the type and content of bleach used in bathroom and towels, its very strong smelling, and the 2 single beds joined together is a no no (especially with the easy slipage apart on a wooden floor).

The toiletteries were very limited (no shower cap for misuss, no cotton buds etc etc), no alarm clock (or clock even), not a single English TV/news/music channel (although that might be a plus point to get out and see the city for longer). No kettle or complimentry water (would be nice not to have to pay 3 euros every time for the water in the minibar, also would be nice for the maid not to remove a 3/4 full bottle of paid for water left on the desk and restock the minibar with a new bottle (which would have to be paid for again) every time we get back to room at night.
