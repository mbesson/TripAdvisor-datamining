I might mention that it was 3pm in the afternoon and not breakfast time. We did go to the dining room where there were stacks of dirty dishes that looked like they had been there for some time. When he still could not find anyone we asked if he would show us to our cabin. The blankets and bedspread were on the floor. He apologized that the room wasn't ready and would send for someone to put sheets on the bed right away. I just know that the same blanket and bedspread that was on the floor was going to end up back on the bed. When we decided that this cabin was not acceptable we were shown others. One had a live bird flying around in it. None were much better than the first. We decided to stay in the main part of the hotel. There was a rooster that started crowing way before sunrise and it went on and on. It was kind of like a bad snooze alarm. We were asked if we had any dietary restrictions for breakfast the night prior yet when we got up that morning there were no signs of anyone in the kitchen and those same stacks of dirty dishes were still there. We had to call and leave a voicemail for someone to come so we could check out since we never even really had checked in. Finally the owner came and took our credit card.

Home Ranch is very well described on its website so be sure you review their site fully if deciding to stay there. It's not for everyone but for those who are fine with something more rustic, it's just great. It's particular nice for families with young kids because the \"rooms\" (i.e. the little cabins) have small kitchens and eating areas, animals to visit and feed, lots of grounds to roam around, and 2 pools (1 heated). Your stay comes w/ breakfast, which is typically a hot carb of some type (waffle, pancake), an egg dish, a gluten-free hot dish, homemade muffins, oatmeal, cold cereal, plain yogurt, organic bread (for toast), jams, nut butter, coffee, juice. We did not take advantage of their dinner because of the price: $22 for adult and $16 for kids. There's no way our 4 year old would eat $16 worth of food (and the inn-keepers seem pretty firm about the price). One major caution: there were 2 roosters living there while we were there and they woke by sunrise every morning (in fact 1 seemed to crow virtually all night).

John met us at the desk after I called from the office available phone and we lucked out. REALLY LUCKED OUT. It was Monday night and we were told we could stay till Friday if we needed to, which was perfect! Home base in the Napa Valley for... Very inexpensive! At time of writing, the rustic cabin we had was $69 per night for the two of us, in a cabin with three beds. And a toilet and sink. Other than that, there are other washrooms around, and summer-camp-style showers as well as swimming pool, fire place, tennis court, lawn area for games, sulphur pools, and the LOOKOUT which I discovered last night. I spent two evenings out there, quite late, and looking out over the ridge valley was incredible with no other sounds other than the odd night bird or passing plane (very very verrrrry few and far between) Nothing but a couple crickets and not even much of anything for breeze. Other nice touches are THE HOSTS John and Suzanne and the breakfast included in the price, the animals, and the sheer RELAXATION of it all. I have no problem with the rustic cabin accommodations. Be advised before you arrive, it isn't for everyone, isn't for anyone who only ever stays in \"fancy hotels\". They are \"cabins in the woods\", they just happen to have electricity, WI-FI (! Ranch/cabins with wifi????) which--be advised--tends to fade out/disconnect a fair bit, and no air conditioning. The main lodge area is very throwback-style and authentic!

The food was basic but good and wholesome, just what we needed after a couple days of hiking and running amuck...perfect! It is as if this is their home and all doors are open for us to read and relax in the dining/living area, tons of interesting books and just a homy comfortable enviromnment.

The current proprieters are John and Susan. John's grandfather build the lodge, and the depth of connection to the land and local community is clearly very strong. Here are a few things that really impressed me about the stay: - I came with a friend who left with the car early in the morning. John was kind enough to offer a ride into town. This meant a bit of meandering as I followed the morning chores of an active ranch until John was ready for a run into town to buy eggs. I got to: - In the meantime, I joined Susan as she rescued endangered salamanders. The salamander population apparently has been declining, and they discovered a small nest as they were uncovering the pool for the spring. I joined Susan to release them into the local creek, which involved a bit of a hike through their mountain forest as she narrated the ecological history of the area. On the way, we saw wild orchids and she mentioned a 34ft old-growth redwood just down the way. At one point, John's grandfather served french toast in the woods to get guests to explore the really excellent hiking on the property. You can still walk the french toast trail today. - As we were driving to town, I heard John talk about how they respond as the town's firefighters (they are!) to news of a blaze--pools provide good water sources, by the way--then coordinate with air-borne planes to contain fires which can spread rapidly in dry seasons. - We stayed in a rustic cabin which was perfectly clean and sweet. $70 for a night can sleep 5 people (4 beds, one of which was a queen). Excellent deal. - Around dusk, we walked ot a lookout over the valley, and you could hear no human-generated noise at all. Just wind rustling and birds. Pretty incredible. - The home-made preserves at breakfast were really excellent: the sour plum sauce poured over freshly made waffles and spiced apple butter over oatmeal were particularly notable.

Affordable adjoined rooms in the heart of Wine Country with access to hiking trails and beautiful scenery. The rooms are sparsely decorated and the beds are similar to what one would expect at summer camp a little saggy and lumpy. The toilet handle needed an occasional jiggle and one didn't want to look too hard for cobwebs and the like. Although the facility probably would pass regulatory standards, maintenance in general was below average. What the property lacks in creature comforts, it makes up for in access to nature, a small collection of farm animals, beautiful mountain top views and trails down to a creek bed among old growth redwoods. In the evenings, we drove a short way to Calistoga for our evening meals.The breakfast was adequate served in a dining room reminiscent of camp. We had many opportunities for laughter and bliss! This is a very friendly Mom & Pop place oozing in down home ambiance without pretense. The pace is informal and encourages one to appreciate natural beauty presented in a setting reminiscent of a bygone era.", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "santa cruz", "Title": "\u201cgreat rustic get-away\u201d", "Author": "cruzerdad", "ReviewID": "UR7547364", "Content": "Old school charm at affordable prices. Close to downtown Calistoga but a whole different world away. I loved the canyons and the lake and being able to have my dog with me was a big plus. The pools were refreshing and the staff was wonderful. The scones for breakfast were the best! Not fancy but just what I was looking for. The other review was not of the normal accommodations but of one of the rustic cabins. The lodge rooms and the winterized cabins are quite nice and very comfortable.", "Date": "May 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Garden Grove, CA", "Title": "\u201cNature lover's paradise\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1107560", "Content": "Rustic! Loved hiking well marked trails, very hilly, deep woods with sun drenched meadows. Deep canyons with glorious volcanic bed streams. Large redwoods in canyons, even a petrified redwood in the streambed. Natural sulfer spring tub in the woods. Enjoyed the warm swimming pool in the a.m. and late evening to loosen up tired muscles. The larger pool is cool and refreshing after a long hike and the lake is a delight! The hosts are a delightful couple. This ranch has been in the family since early 1900's. If you are lucky enough to be there when a group is there, you can get 3 meals a day, otherwise, breakfast only. Some cabins have kitchenettes. Cook is creative and talented. Lots of other activities available on site and nearby. This is heaven for the real nature lover. Their pets include horses, a jersey cow, goats, chickens, ducks. A resident wild raven rides on the back of one of the horses. Wildflowers were amazing in late June.
