It was a family vacation with my husband and 2 adult single children. They were staying only part of 12 days and we needed something that would serve us for that time but be in our budget. This was what we were looking for. It was close to Union square, Chinatown, and a cable car ride to Fishermans wharf. We had a queen suite which gave us 2 queen beds that were very comfortable and a double pull out sofa bed. In reality the walk in closets were b ig enough that my son, who wanted more privacy and quiet, took the sofa cushions and slept in one of the closets. It would have been big enough to get a crib in that space also. The kitchenette was really nice and good for snacks even though we ate out most of the time. The free breakfast was adequate and the granola was the best. All of the rooms were close to the elevator. I used the laundry in the basement which was safe and just off the elevator. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We were able to print our airline tickets with no charge and there was a computer for public use. The WIFI worked well for us. We never heard other residents and the rooms were quiet. As others have said it is at the top of a hill on all sides but it seemed to get easier as the week went on. We bought a weekly transit pass which included the cable cars and because of this used the cable as a source of transportation. Chinatown is a walk from the hotel going downhill but we always took the California cable car back going uphill from Chinatown and where we got off the hill went down one block to the hotel from there. The Powell cable car is 1 block downhill. We took the Bart from the airport to the Embarcadaro stop because there was a cab stand close. In looking back the Powell stop would have worked as well. We took a cab from there to the hotel. On the way back I found a coupon in a visitor book for the San Francisco City Shuttle. The cost going back was $11/person which worked out well. They picked us up in front of the hotel and were on time. The cost with this shuttle from the airport would have been $16 for the first person and $12 for each person after the first.

Often, when the kids are tired, we order in pizza,Asian, or Italian food, and have our own wine, soft drinks, and desserts out of our kitchen. It saves a fortune over a 9 day vacation. It saves a ton of time, while visiting the city. You can make yourself a full, hot breakfast/lunch/dinner, or store and reheat leftovers from area restaurants. We and make hot brownies and ice cream for an evening TV snack. There is a kitchen table, too, so the kids don't have to eat in bed.

Think it was about $30 plus per day, so adds up if you are there for a while. My advice would be to only have a car when you are doing day trips out of the city as you don't really need one for all the central stuff as the cable cars do the job well plus you get to take in the atmosphere.

The price was good, much cheaper than the places we'd been staying on previous visits to San Francisco, but the place was a bit worn around the edges, though clean. Since it's a suite, there's plenty of room, but the bedroom area is a bit small for a king size bed; there was only a foot or two to get around it, which was difficult at night. The carpet in the living room had small holes in places. We didn't use the kitchen, but it was nice to have. The bathroom was tiny but had good lighting. The towels and bed linens were very tacky, poor quality. The pillows were like big rocks which I found almost impossible to use comfortably. There was no temperature control in the room, other than the window. We had a room on the same floor as the breakfast room, so it was a good thing we were getting up early anyway. The continental breakfast was decent, especially since it's rare in the city to have one included in the price of the room. Free internet and a nice flat screen TV in the living room were also a plus (though we didn't watch TV). We were shocked that there were quite a few steep stairs to get to the tiny lobby and then some more stairs to get to the level where the elevator was (and where our room was). When we mentioned the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, they said there was an elevator up from street level. I guess it was around the corner on the ramp to the parking lot, but you really had to know about it in advance. That still wouldn't have gotten you to the lobby without stairs. We just took the stairs, but it was annoying when we had luggage. If you plan to use public transportation, which we did, be aware that this hotel is on Nob Hill. We walked from the Powell Street muni station. The hotel is way uphill from there (probably 8 blocks or so); the last 2 blocks are almost vertical. For old legs like ours, going downhill toward the station may even have been harder than uphill. We didn't see a bus that we could transfer to that came anywhere near it, but I suppose there might have been. Of course, the cable car does go straight up Powell (about a block from the hotel), but that's $5 a ride which seems excessive. (The cable car is something you should do once, just to say you have, but otherwise it's way overpriced.) In summary, I wasn't offended by the place, but not in love with it either.

One reason I chose this hotel was that it was one of the few in San Francisco that offered 2 queen beds (who knew!), in a good location for a reasonable price. As many other reviewers have stated, we weren't sure what to expect based on previous reviewers experiences. We arrived very late at night and found the young man at the front desk to be very pleasant and accommodating, even offering to help us carry our luggage and providing extra towels upon request. We were pleasantly surprised to find that our 12th floor room, while rather dated looking, was very clean and spacious, with ample room for our considerable luggage. The room had a dining table, a small sitting area and a kitchenette with a stove and fridge. We had a decent view of the city skyline, which was nice when it was not shrouded in fog. Beds are a bit uncomfortable, but not a huge deal. My only real complaint was that the walls are a bit on the thin side and we could hear the kids in the neighbouring room screaming and running around. Those guests who are not light sleepers should not find this a problem. The complimentary breakfast, while not deluxe, was fine. Bagels, toast, cereal and pastries, as well as bananas and apples were available. Coffee, tea and a variety of juices were also on hand. The room that the breakfast is served in is VERY tiny, with about 8 small tables, so it was very crowded each morning. Most people seemed to take their food and go back to their rooms. Again, this worked for our purposes and kept us going until noon. The ladies who served breakfast were quite friendly, although seemed a bit overwhelmed by the volume of guests bombarding them each morning. I would probably be as well! The Nob Hill location made an excellent base for exploring San Francisco. We loved being able to walk everywhere or hop on the Powell Street trolley (1/2 block away). One tip to future guests-unless you take the trolley early in the morning, you may not be able to get on it due to heavy volumes of people. However, it is only a 10-15 minute walk to Union Square, and a 25-30 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf. Walking to the Wharf takes you through Chinatown, which offers scenic views of the Bay Bridge. We found the area to be very safe at all times of the day, and were happy to find several convenience stores and a Walgreen's only blocks away for any last minute items needed.

The actual area is very nice and felt very pleasant and safe to walk around in.

Large, comfy bed and a little kitchen area as well. Very clean and well-maintained. No complaints there.

(Best advice is to take the cable car - you should get a SF Muni pass, which lets you gives you unlimited trips on the cable cars and most buses around SF).

As there was a conference in town, all hotels in SF had inflated prices so I booked this hotel purely with my budget in mind. The 20% tripadvisor discount was accepted without fuss at check-in and my bill reflected the revised room rate. As others have stated, the hotel is on top of Nob Hill and despite considering myself of a reasonable fitness the walk up from Union Square after a night of eating and drinking can be a challenge. That said, the walk does at least help burn a few calories..... The hotel itself was fine. Previous stops on our trip had included Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas and a Hyatt so we knew this would be a step down in luxury. We were not too disappointed however as the size of the room and the views made up for the older (in some places a little shabby) appearance. Everything was very clean though. No air con, but there was a fan in one of the cupboards as well as a safe and an ironing board. The self service launderette in the basement was handy for us, and cheap at approx $1.50 per wash. We checked out the breakfast room on the first morning but nothing looked too appetising to us so we got a coffee to go and never went back. It always looked pretty busy when we passed on subsequent days though so perhaps we were just a little picky. The Hotel parking was convenient with direct access from Pine Street. It is a little pricey at $35 a day but that seems to be the norm for SF. It was easy to get in and out and although the car park is small I never had difficulty getting a space. Driving around SF is a unique experience with the hills, fog, cable cars and one way systems but I\u2019m glad I had a car to do some exploring outside of the city. We hired bikes from Blazing Saddles just a few blocks away (down the hill) on Mason and cycled across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito, and then on to Tiburon which I would recommend.

Great value and, at 3 blocks from Chinatown, Union Square and all kinds of public transportation - a great location! Need to be a bit of a hill-climber! The other thing I want to mention is about the city of San Francisco itself. It has come upon hard times and it shows. The cable car conductors were randomly surly and the bartender at the Buena Vista Cafe was barely civil - both unheard of in times past - and the local Walgreens put $ 6.99 cans of coffee behind glass because of the frequent robberies (the grab-and-run kind).

We stayed in a 1 bedroom family suite. Positives: This hotel is in a great location, just a couple of blocks from Union Square, a block from China Town, and less than a block from the famous cable cars. It provides a complimentary continental breakfast that is more than adequate (though space is limited in the dining room \u2013 see below), as well as free computer access for guests. The 1 bedroom family suite was fairly spacious \u2013 providing 2 queen beds + a sofa bed, a full kitchen and lounge room. The room was tidy and quite well laid out, with plenty of room for a family of 5. The porters were friendly and helpful. Negatives: As a place where we essentially came home to sleep at night, it was more than adequate. But it lacked a bit of character and the front desk staff lacked any sense of enthusiasm for their job. By this I mean that, when asked questions, the front desk staff gave answers, but didn\u2019t go out of their way to offer suggestions or provide other useful information. As a guest, I sometimes got the feeling that I was imposing on their time by asking them for advice. Our room\u2019s kitchen included a kettle and a coffee machine \u2013 but no coffee, sugar or milk to put in it. I called the front desk at 9pm one evening to see whether they could send up some coffee, but was told that the room staff were all gone for the night, but that a message would be left for them to deliver some in the morning. Next evening, still no coffee, etc \u2013 so another call to the front desk was required. I admit this is a minor issue, but for me it reflected the staff\u2019s attitude towards guests \u2013 one of being willing just to do what was required, as long as it didn\u2019t require too much effort. My only other criticism relates to the breakfast room \u2013 it was very small for such a large hotel. While the breakfast was definitely adequate with plenty of options from which to choose, the breakfast room consisted of just 4 tables, meaning it was usually crowded and every morning, with many guests (including us on one occasion) having to take their breakfast back to their room to eat.

We asked for a rollaway bed in advance, which wasn't in the room when we got there, but since I checked before we got to the room, we brought it up with us. There was a nice little kitchen area with fridge, microwave, toaster, coffeemaker, stove and sink. Absolutely no food of any kind in the kitchen, though. No condiments, salt, pepper, anything. The bathroom was small, but everything worked fine. The bathroom had two doors, one connecting to the bedroom and one in the hallway. LOTS of closet space. There is a free continental breakfast provided--cereals, fruit, donuts. pastries, coffee and juice. You can bring your food on a tray up to your room. There are a few small and overpriced grocery stores around, but it's not too bad, and the selection is pretty decent. Our 18th floor room faced south. The windows open, and we left them open at night to enjoy the fresh air and the sounds of the city. The hotel is a block away from the cable car line and 2 blocks away via a very steep hill from the #30 and #45 Muni stop. It's also a few blocks away (via steep hills) from Union Square. The staff was very helpful, though it would have been nice if they stocked the front desk with stamps. We had postcards to send, and the last thing we wanted to do was take time from our trip to go to a post office to buy stamps. My only complaint was that the room could have used another lamp especially in the area near the kitchen. And my usual issue with all hotels: it had wifi Internet access, but I found the connection to be a little slow. I'm not surprised--that's often the case. This is not a fancy hotel.

The apartment was absolutely huge! We had much more space than we could have possibly needed, but that was a good thing. We were on the 5th floor which didn't have much by way of views but aparently the 19th floor has fantastic sweeping views of the city. LOCATION The hotel is located on Pine Street atop Nob Hill. It is about 2 blocks downhill to union square. Getting back up the hill is a bit of an effort. We are quite young and fit and occasionally we would be puffed getting up the hill. So if you are unfit or handicapped, the location may not be the best for you. We walked to fisherman's wharf one day which took us about 40 mins at a brisk pace. We also walked to Coit Tower - that took about 40 minutes also. ROOMS As I said above, we stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment. It had plenty of closet space to hand clothes and store other items. The bedroom was a separate room which was quite large. The bed was king size, however the matress was not firm at all and was quite uncomfortable. The linen was clean, but worn. The sheets were very thin as was the blanket. The quilt also was very worn. I must emphasise however that all linen was clean. There is also a TV in the bedroom. There is a large living room with TV, TV cabinet, 3 seat sofa which folded out to a sofa bed, an arm chair, coffee table, phone table/desk, round glass table with four chairs, an additional 2 decorative chairs. The kitchenette was useful. Only issue we had was with the oven which did not get very hot. After two hours of it being on, it was still not hot enough to cook our christmas roast. To give an example, I had boiled potatoes and then put them in the oven to roast - after 2 hours in the oven they still had not roasted. We ended up having an awful christmas lunch because of that oven! The microwave did a better job of the roast veggies. Also, there were no oven trays - so the oven was practically useless! We had to buy disposable foil oven trays so that we could use the oven. The bathroom is very clean and has everything you need. Toiletries were filled up every day by housekeeping. The bathroom also has a large storage cupboard. It is a little bit pokey and small, but other than that, nothing wrong with it. HEATING/COOLING The room tended to get quite cold and there was no heater. There was an internal themostat thingo, but you couldnt turn it up. It got quite cold in the room. There was no airconditioner too, so this may also be a problem in summer. OTHER The room had an electronic safe which was very useful. Breakfast is complementary and is served daily in a room on the first floor. There is a coffee machine, juice dispenser (orange and guava were served), cereal, pastries and bagels. There were three sets of tables and chairs in the room, however you were able to take a tray up to your room if you didn't want to eat it in the room. There is a computer and printer just off from the reception. This was quite reliable and quick. There are several washing machines and dryers on the ground floor. These are coin operated. We used these twice and found them very new and reliable. There is also a vending machine on this level. Overall, the hotel is very good value for money and one of the only hotels in the city with kitchen facilities. This is the primary reason we picked the hotel since we were staying over christmas. If i went back to san fran i would probably stay closer to union square, but i would consider staying at Grosvenor Suites again. Great value for money and ideal if you have a family since you are able to keep costs down by cooking your own food. There is a small deli on the corner of the block to get groceries from, but it doesnt have a big range. We went to a safeway near Japan town, but we had to catch a taxi back (about 5 minute drive) to the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel if you are handicapped or cannot walk very far.

I recommend taking a taxi or cable car (if you don't have luggage) to get to the hotel since the walk up Powell is steep. Other than that, check-in went smooth. The guy who checked me in was very nice and made sure to book me a room with a view. I got a corner room on the eighth floor with a fantastic view. The room itself was very spacious. There is no air conditioning or heat in the room. It was hot when I arrived, so I opened the sliding glass door. They also have a tall fan in the closet that I used to cool things down. The bed was quite comfortable since I slept very well. It was not very noisy outside unless you open your sliding glass door. But once it was shut, it kept out most of the noise. I mostly heard a few car horns, some sirens, and the ding of the cable car, but it did not wake me up in the middle of the night. The furniture was a bit dated, but decent. The kitchen and bathroom had granite countertops. A few dishes, silverware, and pots and pans were provided, but I only used a plate and knife, which I made sure to wash. The stove/oven was outdated, but I made good use of the oven and it worked well. The bathroom was small, but it served its purpose. I did not like that there was not much counter space in the bathroom and the shower head is pretty low if you are tall. But it worked. The tv was another complaint. Some channels did not show up in the lineup and I had to manually punch those channels into the remote. A few channels were not very clear. The remote itself did not have an on button, only an off button, which I found odd. I had to get up to turn on the tv. Continental breakfast was decent. Nothing fancy. Just juices, coffee, bagels, cereal, etc. A computer is provided for your use, as well as an ATM machine, a laundry room, and snack/drink/ice machines. I did not like going down to the level where the snack machines were. Seemed a bit dark, like in a basement and I felt a little uncomfortable down there. The laundry room is also located on that level. Other than a few minor issues, I would stay here again.

You are 5 minutes away from Sears (for breakfast, even during lunch) and the shopping at Union Sq. and about the same from Chinatown. The wharf is better reached via Cable Car, trolley (from Powell/Market), taxi or bus. It is very doable (no hills) by walking to Chinatown, then through little Italy, but can be long.

We loved being in the middle of everything -- it was very convenient. The views were spectacular -- we had great views of Coit tower and the Transamerica building. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite. It had a nice kitchenette -- full sized refrigerator, stove, microwave oven, all the plates/glasses/utensils you would need. The unit was spacious. In addition to the bedroom and kitchen, there was a living area and a dining area. The rooms could use a little renovating, but it wasn't that bad. We were very happy with them. The continental breakfast was good -- bagels, pastries, donuts, cereal, coffee, juice. The wireless Internet worked great. The parking, while expensive ($35/day), was very easy and convenient.

It was also very quiet within the hotel, the only sounds coming from the street outside, but the corner of Mason and Pine is actually a very quiet bit of Nob Hill.

And then there are some things that are strictly 1 star: chipped paint on window sills that have been repaired with mismatched paint; a crack in the window; tears in the linings of drapes; grimy door and window jambs; piled on grease on the exhaust fan in the kitchenette (so much that I wouldn't use the rangetop); a really suspect bedspread; broken heating covers. If it had not been for the 5 star elements, we would have checked out instantly. Gratefully, Housekeeping did an awesome job with daily cleaning, but really basic, quality maintenance is needed. Another reviewer said that this is not a luxury hotel and that is right on the money. The lovely rooms shown on their website are long term rentals only so be prepared for something less. If the units are maintained as they should be, there is no question that the Grosvernor Suites would be the best deal in town. I guess the bottom line is: would we stay again?

With a young child, it was a nice option to have. The rooms were very spacious - probably the largest room I've stayed in SF. We had a nice territorial view of Nob Hill. Breakfast: The continental breakfast was great and served in a sunny room. There were bagels, pastries, muffins, fruit and cereal. The coffee was standard-issue, but there was a nice selection of juice. The server who oversees the breakfast didn't even mind that we loaded up on goodies and took it to our room. Location: The location was great! Just 3 blocks and we were in the action of Union Square. The cable car stopped just 1/2 block away. However: BE WARNED: The hotel is up on two VERY steep hills. From Union Square you will be huffing and puffing your way up. (Hence Nob HILL). Staff: Friendly. No problems checking in or anything. Misc: My husband is a much picky-er traveler than I am. He was pleased with this place. The only complaint he had is one of our neighbors was cooking something very pungent and the smell wafted into our room.

You must ask for a room on a high floor with a view. It's a MUST!! Cons: -No Wireless Internet (after purchasing a new computer the day before check in I was bummed to find out I couldn't research places in San Fran from my room. There is a complimentary computer in the lobby, but I didn't take advantage of it) -Pillows - They were a little too hard for me, but oh well. -\"Breakfast\" - The woman who runs the breakfast room is a doll, but the choices weren't very healthy --- carb concious people beware --- lots of pastries and muffins!! The muffins, etc.... were fine and actually provided a lot of energy for the walks up and down the huge hills. And one last word of advice.....My partner and I came in from SFO on the Bart and got let out at Union Square. I was told we could not bring luggage on the cable car, so instead of getting a cab....we WALKED up the hill(s) to the hotel. It was trek, but an adventure in itself.

I'm in SF for a fellowship at University of California my mother is travelling with me so we needed a place which was located near my campus (Mission bay) and close to the city's attractions to keep mom occupied. Loads of PROS so i'll start with the CONS CONS: This is NOT a LUXURY hotel as the website describes it to be! the furniture, carpets in the hallway and the general building is tired - its not dirty or smelly - just old fashioned. No marble bathroom or fluffy towels - just basic stuff (which isn't bad). Breakfast is disappointing - bagels, croissants, doughnuts, tea/coffee and thats it (no bread is served). I would've liked a hot option as well - but hey enough to get you going in the morning. The maid cleans the room/changes towels, bedding every week - would be better if it was twice a week. Steep hills of Nob hill - if you have problems walking then consider the fact that this place is at the top of a very steep hill from several directions! PROS: good service - when i booked (over the fone) i requested a room not higher than the 10th floor and not to be next to the lift and when i checked in i got a room on the 7th flr away from the lift. staff at the main desk were very helpful when I asked for directions, bus routes and other city questions. hotel's location couldn't be better - the cable cars are at your doorstep which go to Fisherman's Wharf/China town/Union sq etc. Union Sq. and the big shopping names( Macy's, Niketowm, Banana Republic, Old Navy are walking distance from the hotel. Several Muni bus routes are easily accesible from Stockton which like 5 mins from the hotel. Value for money: We've paid $2600 for a suite for 30 days included in this is a VERY large room with a fully equiped kitchen - stove (electric), microwave, toaster, full size fridge, pots and pans, cutlery enough for 4. Two double beds, A TV, wireless internet, loads of storage space, iron board, iron, a clean good sized bathroom with a bath tub. In the basement they have washing machines and tumbler dryers to use at a nominal price. Conclusion: The place is well located in the heart of SF. Very large clean rooms and helpful staff.

When I called the hotel, Tony was on vacation and John who was overseeing the concierge duties knew nothing about it. John suggested I find a cab.

Booked three months in advance at hotel website. They have a \"rebate\" program for such reservations ($20 first night, $25 each additional night), and it was applied without hassle (I didn't have to even mention it) at check in. We were given a huge two queen, one sofabed room on the sixth floor facing the back of the Mark Hopkins. We asked for a higher room, but none were available (again, the perils of visiting during convention season). The room was worn, though very clean (no signs of bed bugs). The room was noisy. Aside from traffic (windows are single-paned), there was this strange, low-frequency moan/rumble from time to time whose source we were unable to determine. There was so much closet space that it made no sense (not a complaint). Bathroom was small, but manageable. The in-room safe was large enough to hold my 14.1\" 4:3 aspect laptop with plenty of depth to hold other things. I'm not sure a 15\" would fit, and anything larger than 15\" most certainly will not fit. The hotel offers no other secure storage. The first night we noticed the shower head was broken. We reported it to the front desk the next morning and was told it would fixed while we were out. When we returned it that afternoon had not been fixed, and at that point the front desk had maintenance fix it ASAP. Housekeeping was a bit of a mystery. Our room was able to hold at least five adults, but they only gave us two sets of towels per day. We were able to get more as needed, but that should not have been necessary. The breakfast was fine. The bagels, donuts and pastries appeared to have been delivered fresh each morning by a local bakery. Apples were available every morning, but that was it if you're not partial to an entire starch and sugar breakfast. Don't be intimidated by the server. She gave us anything we asked for and never scoffed at additional requests. The coffee was OK. The location was better than I expected. It is one block steep downhill on Mason from the California cable car line, and one block slightly uphill from the Powell lines. We were able to quickly get wherever we wanted using public transportation taking the Powell lines down to Union Square. We had no issues with panhandlers (aggressive or otherwise) near the hotel. The one downside to the location was it largely prevents you from using public transportation to get to or from the airport. The cable car lines don't allow luggage (you may be able to get away with a carry-on on a lightly-loaded car), and the steep uphill climb is murderous (though that didn't stop the five-member Australian family I ran into waiting for a downhill Powell car, so it is possible). We took a cab from San Francisco International Airport and the total was about $39 not including tip. The hotel can also schedule a door-to-door shuttle (not cost effective in our situation). Parking at the hotel was a very tight squeeze. We parked a rental car there for one night and ended up double parking as the car was wider than all outside. There was at least one other parking level with what looked like larger spaces, but I didn't see how I could get our colossal rental in there without damaging it. Street parking was available, but after seeing many touching bumpers and otherwise sandwiched cars I decided against it. There is very cheap weekend parking from Saturday evening through Sunday night at the Sutter Stockton garage (about a four-block walk). The staff, especially Tony (mornings) and Cena (evenings), were always professional and pleasant and were never at a loss for restaurant recommendations. I would have rated my stay 4 stars/circles/whatever if not for the noise and housekeeping towel skimpiness.

As the other reviews have said, the studio room was much more spacious than I had anticipated, and having a kitchen was wonderful! Unlike many \"kitchens\" in hotels, this one had a larger refrigerator (about 3/4 size) and not only a cooktop - but an oven as well! We had fun baking cookies and eating popcorn while watching movies after a fun day of exploring! Great location for heading to Chinatown, Downtown, Union Square, etc. - as mentioned by the other reviews. And as far as the hills - think of the exercise as one way of working off the great food you can eat in SF! Truly - there are wonderful bargain gourmet delights to be had in the City - and with the kitchen you can mix eating in with take-out an eating out. One of the best meals we had was in a small place in Chinatown where they had to hunt for a menu in English. Cheap and extraordinary! While some reviewers worried about their small children and the windows that opened - I guess I view that as more of a parenting issue - or something to avoid if you are worried about it (read hotel reviews ahead of time). On-site parking is terrific (though $29 extra a night w/ in-out rights), and some of it is covered - a bonus if you are there when it is wet! While the spaces are a little tight - it is pretty much standard for SF. There are coffee shops and grocery stores within reasonable walking distance, and access to public transit so you can pretty much explore the city at will. I had forgotten that the hotel offered a cont. breakfast, so finding that out was actually a nice surprise! While it is nothing special, it is certainly sufficient and standard fare. It is also a good way to keep the kids from getting cranky before you head out for the day. For the location and the value for the money - this hotel (and the Ocean Park hotel across from the Zoo) are tops!

The property is centrally located at the top of Nob Hill within a block of the cable car line/public transportation. Taxis to most of the cities neighbourhoods were between $6-$10. As others have commented, though the property bills itself as \"luxury accomodations\" it really is a value-priced apartment/hotel. The hotel's website photos do an accurate job of depicting the decor/style of the hotel. We would definitely recommend this hotel and offer the following comments: What we liked: - Huge corner suite on the 18th floor with panoramic views of the city . . . unlike other major cities, tall buildings did not seem to be as abundant in San Francisco so the views from (higher floors) at this hotel are unique and, unobstructed - Windows that opened. When booking, my major concern was around the lack of air conditioning. This was not an issue as all the windows opened and we were able to get wonderful cross breezes that quickly cooled down the room. - Clean, quiet, suite with separate bedroom, spacious walk-in closets, full living & dining room and small, spotlessly clean functional kitchenette. - very comfortable bed - good size bathroom with adequate counter/storage space - friendly, helpful staff - laundry facilities on-site A few comments about this location in San Francisco: - at the top of a very steep hill as others have mentioned. Though it is \"do-able\", it is definitely a challenge after a long day of sight-seeing! - cable cars were often very, very full (even at 7:30am!) so be prepared to let a few pass before you are able to jump aboard. - taxis in the city seemed few and far between, more so than any other major city we've visited. Not sure if this is typical but it was definitely our experience. On average, we had to wait approx 20mins to get taxis (outside hotel and other areas such as Union Square, North Beach) Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and, wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to others.

Our stay started with finding roaches in the kitchenette of our one-bedroom suite. Staff was very accomodating and moved us immediately, however only a junior suite was available. It was not much smaller and we actually liked the layout better! And no roaches! The room was clean, and had most everything we needed with three small kids. The bathroom was in good enough shape for me to feel comfortable letting the kids use the tub for baths. There was an ironing board & iron in the closet, which came in handy when we got ready for the wedding we were attending. The kitchenette had a sink, stove, refrigerator, and some dishes. I'd recommend bringing a roll of paper towels, and some plastic utensils and paper plates. We found the free breakfast to be hit & miss. Saturday morning my husband went down around 8:30 am and it was slim pickings! But on Sunday I went down at 7:30 and loaded up a tray for the family with muffins, donuts, a toasted bagel & cream cheese, apples, and fruit loops. I also got hot coffee, and apple juice for the kids. BIG WARNING FOR PARENTS: **The rooms have windows that swing open and do not have screens or locks**. We were on the 19th (top) floor and were scared to death that our 2- and 4-year old kids (who love to climb!) would pop open a window and fall out. SCARY!!! We called the front desk to ask about a lock and were told that all the windows in the hotel were like that, and they didn't have locks. One time my 4-year-old disappeared for a moment and my husband and I found him lying on the window sill behind the curtain. We couldn't relax at all and were constantly watching the kids to keep them away from the windows (of course they were super interested in looking out the windows at the tall buildings and ocean!!) and off the window sills.

Nestled among them is the best value in the city, the Grosvenor Suites, 899 Pine Street, San Francisco, CA. We were nervous about our choice for this year\u2019s five-week trip to the city on the hill. The Grosvenor Suites came out of a Craig\u2019s List search and was booked without inspection. It turned out to be a great choice! The studio apartment we booked was roomy and comfortable, with plenty of space for two people to lounge, read and watch cable TV without crowding each other. We had a good view of the Union Square area, the Sir Francis Drake Hotel with its revolving star, and the bay in the distance. The d\u00e9cor was Oriental with Chinese-style furniture, brocaded bedspreads and Japanese screens on the wall. While not upscale, the furnishings were comfortable and stylish. The kitchenette fit a full apartment size refrigerator, stove with oven, plenty of cabinets fully stocked with dishes, pots and pans, coffee maker, toaster and flatware into a space the size of an average closet. We cooked about three times a week and had plenty of utensils. The rest of the suite contained a small bathroom and two large walk-in closets. One of the features provided by the hotel is a daily complimentary continental breakfast, served from 5:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. weekdays and to 11:00 a.m. on weekends. The staff served the bagels, Danish pastries, scones, donuts and muffins with butter, cream cheese and jelly, as requested. The guests helped themselves to juice, coffee and tea to eat either in the breakfast room or take to your own room. The Breakfast was good and very convenient but we did miss fresh fruit and would like to see it added to the menu. The Grosvenor Suites is unique in a very San Franciscan way in the world of extended-stay hotels. They have business and leisure guests on 1 to 3 month stays, daily hotel service that attracts many European travelers, and permanent tenants. We met a lovely lady in her 80\u2019s who\u2019s lived at the Grosvenor since 1973 when she was working as a teacher in the city public school system. We also met a businessman who lived on the 17th floor and maintained an office on the 5th floor to beat the commuting crush in the Bay Area. There was a steady stream of German, French and Italian tourists during our five-week stay. The mix of cultures and occupations gave our trip an additional element of interest and enhanced our experience. Our only complaint was the lack of internet access in our room.

Separate to this was the two bedrooms, once again, large sizes. Unlike many other 2 bed suites i've been to, the master bedroom didn't have an en-suite. Yet, a bathroom was placed neared the 2nd bedroom. It did seem that the layout of the suite was an afterthought, as they had managed to place 4 small store rooms dotted all over the place. On closer inspection, whilst a huge living area is fantastic, that also means lots more to clean for the cleaners. A job certainly not fulfilled. A little note lets you know not to expect your dishes to be cleaned for you, and nor do the bed sheets get changed unless requested (to protect the environment). This can all be forgiven as the value is great, however, un-clean bathrooms? Musky smelling with no ventilation, limescale in the baths, and mould on the taps certainly is worrying.

We were so relieved to come here! It was lovely, the front desk staff were wonderful, the bell staff came to our taxi and took our luggage to our room. The room was huge and very clean, with wonderful views. My one complaint would be that it was just one room - with 3 small children we were hoping for two rooms (ie bedroom and separate living area), which we expected from a \"suite\". I would called this a studio rather than a suite. It was enormous though with a full kitchen cleverly hidden by folding doors. There were two huge walk-in closets (which could be knocked through and made into a bedroom IMO) and a very nice bathroom. There were two double beds in the room and a nice sofa, TV unit and dining table. Even so there was lots of space left. The breakfast was fine though not brilliant. It was mostly pastries etc given out by a member of staff one at a time - you had to ask. We discovered the nicer items were hidden behind the counter and those \"in the know\" asked for them! Very odd. Don't know why it couldn't be self-service - I guess people feel guilty having to ask so eat less! The drinks were self-service though, and there were TVs in the breakfast room, which was an ordinary room basically - but they are so big that the size was adequate. There is a computer next to front desk which guests can use - though it was monopolised by teenagers on instant messenger! Plus there is a guest laundry, though I wouldn't recommend going there alone late at night as it was rather scary - its in a garage-type area. The location of the hotel is great - half a block from a cable car stop (if you can get on one - they were always full when we were there so we had to walk into town and get a streetcar), but its not far and downhill. Later in the day its easier to get a cable car and avoid the hills. We spent most of our time in Fisherman's Wharf, which we much preferred to downtown San Francisco.

Kitchen - as a vegan I prefer having the option to cook my own food.

You can always get the cable car up from Powell and get off near Pine. Bathroom size - This isn't really a bad point in my opinion - yes, the bathroom is certainly small, but who cares with all that living space? It has a bath/shower/sink/toilet which is all you need.. ----- Other than that I thought this was great value for money. Granted, it's not luxury hotel and it lacks the attention to detail that, say, the Orchard Hotel would give you, but then you're not paying that kind of price anyway.

I know we should have known that when we booked through Expedia but I guess we just didn't notice since it was a 3-star hotel. Anyway, no matter, we figured since the last time we were in town (a week prior) the night had been fairly cool and there was no need for A/C.

We realized that the tub stopper lever was broken but if you stepped on it and kept it held down, it would open and the tub would drain (this after being up to my shins in water!). So we ended up showering by standing on one foot with the other foot on the lever to drain the tub! On top of that the toilet didn't stop running the entire stay - so much for our renovated bathroom!

The staff were very helpful and they went out of their way to make our visit comfortable. I was traveling with my entire family including my 9 month old infant. The room was great because it had a kitchen and a separate bedroom which made it so much easier with my daughter. The room was comfortable and clean at an excellent price. You can't beat the location of the hotel. It was very centrally located to everything. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone especially those who are traveling with children.", "Date": "September 1, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grosvenor Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d81809-Reviews-Grosvenor_Suites-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$128 - $467*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">899 Pine Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94108</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515974", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ee/61/e3/grosvenor-suites.jpg"}}
