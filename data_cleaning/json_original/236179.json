I walked to the corso road for shopping, spanish steps, to the vatican, fontana di trevi, piazza Navona...it was so central that i could get to everywhere walking!! I went last July 2010 with my mom and stayed 3 nights at the superior doble room and it was perfect! The entrance can be scary when you arrive for the first time, the lift is noisy etc but when you get to the 2nd floor where is the hotel everything changes! The owner is fantastic, a super nice italian girl that gives you all kind of tips (even the close you must use to enter to churches), breakfast includes croissants =) fruit. I stayed at the superior doble standard room and i recommend it as the price is really good.

The hotel is actually at the second floor of a really old building. I mean, really old. So it's uphills from there. The hotel itself looks really good and if you don't arrive too late (or too early) you'll probably get to know Aurora. Aurora is the receptionist that stays there most of the time and if there's good things to be said about the place, it's all because of her. She will talk to you, help you with any problems you may have at the hotel and even help you with your trip, if you have doubts as to where to go and other things. So, after you meet Aurora you go to the rooms. If you've booked a superior room, you'll probably get to one that looks really good, is not too big, but will give you plenty of confort. If you've booked a standard room, you'll have to go downstairs (and look out for your head, cause the ceiling is really low and i've hit my head there like 5 times\") and you'll see a room that is neither too big or too small, but definitely looks old. My experience with the rooms were not without problem. Both rooms we've booked (my family and I) had the same problem: the shower leaked through the wall, which ended up wetting the floor and giving the room a strong smell of mold. So we decided to talk to Aurora and the immediately changed our rooms to other ones that had no problems (and she also called the plumber, so the rooms are probably fixed by now). The Wi-Fi will work inside the rooms (it worked inside mine, at least) and the breakfast is good - nothing special to it, you may just as well buy something at the supermarket that is really close to the hotel or eat somewhere else. And as far as location goes, this is probably one of the best hotel you can get in rome. Is very central, close to everything, so you won't have to worry about taxis, buses or anything, cause there won't be a huge amount of walking to do to get to anywhere. And if you intend to do some shopping in Rome, it is really close to Via del Corso (one of the main shopping streets) and not a lot of walking to get to the other 2 shopping streets which I forgot the names.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBasic Amenities, BEST location\u201d", "Author": "Cella65", "ReviewID": "UR90923781", "Content": "Quiet, Comfy, Cozy hotel.

Just a smile would have been great. On the other hand, the room was generally ok, hot water took a while to heat up. Fortunately there was an air-con unit too. It looks as though the hotel is going under some renovation, and i've seen from other reviews this has been on going for a while. There were wires exposed from plugs/light switches/holes in the bathroom. Some of the rooms smelt awful and we discovered that the bedroom keys opened all the rooms!!! this was quite disconcerning.

We stayed here on May 24, 2006, and found many of the same problems already listed here. On their own, the problems are all minor, but it was disappointing to find so many of them in a hotel with such a high price (165 euros a night). The hotel is very well located however, near the Spanish Steps and the metro station - we felt we were paying for the location and nothing more. Overall the impression is of a poorly maintained and unprofessional hotel. Upon our arrival, the buzzer at the gate downstairs for the hotel was missing, so it took a few minutes to figure out how else to get in. Once there, we were taken down the same dilapidated, low-ceilinged, makeshift staircase that seems to have been a fixture there for some time. The room itself was tiny, which would have been fine if that was the only problem. Holes in the plaster showed exposed wires and pipes in the ceiling, and the covers to at least 2 light switches were missing, showing the exposed wires behind them. One of the bedside lights was without a lightbulb (the room was already quite dimly lit). While we were accustomed to the thin towels (we found the same ones in other places we stayed in Italy), we were suprised not to find at least a bathmat in the tiny bathroom. As a result the floor got quite slippery. The shower doors were extremely stubborn to close and open, seemingly not quite in their tracks, and the showerhead would not stay fixed in the holder while taking a shower. The toilet seat also did not appear to be firmly attached to the toilet. We felt that the staff were pressuring us to take their arranged taxi upon our arrival at the hotel and departure to the airport, and when we said we would find our own early-morning transportation to the train station and then the airport, the desk concierge was surly, unhelpful and rude about it. Once we had checked out and were downstairs, we found the locked gate at street level would not open, necessitating a run back up the many flights of stairs to ask the concierge to unlock it from his end. Though we only spent a few hours sleeping there, this was the last night of our trip and was definitely not how we had hoped to end what had been a lovely holiday.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cwho comes to rome to sleep?\u201d", "Author": "London_UKJenny", "ReviewID": "UR5043938", "Content": "The location is certainly perfect. The street life was quiet, mercifully. The beds were comfortable, and at least we had our own bathroom.

However, the rooms were tiny; the shower flooded easily, the carpets got wet and smelled (but not as bad as the cat's-pee smell in the hall way and a couple of the other bedrooms the men inour group told us about). With one exception, the staff were generally surly and gave the impression that our presence was an annoyance to them--if we asked for extra towels (which were very thin--like using bedsheets) or a cup of coffee slightly early, they would sort of throw their hands up and say, \"Well, o-KAY, if you really must have it\". They couldn't quite say no, but they didn't like it. It's true we were a big group, with a few people coming and going over the course of the week, but the final bills were confused and unhelpfully divided.

You also get a free map of Rome from the reception. Bathrooms were small (shower cubicles only), still of reasonable size to serve their purpose. Rooms were cleaned daily.

First impressions confirmed our suspicions - the hotel is on the second floor of a slightly delapidated building and the gates can only be opened from the inside. However, once inside our room (room twelve), I almost wept with relief. The bed was big and comfortable, and I liked the high ceiling. The shower took a while to heat up but was fine once it got going, and the toilet worked fine. There was a small balcony with a view onto a courtyard - not especially attractive, but it couldn't have been anywhere but Rome. The towels were thin - but we'd brought our own, and on the last day the staff replaced them with some thicker ones anyway. The bedroom lighting was quite dim, there was exposed wiring on the ceiling and imperfect tiling in the bathroom, which wasn't soundproofed at all, there was no air-con... but for all that we felt cosy in our room which was right at the heart of Rome - the location, down the road from the Spanish Steps, is the best thing about this hotel. Staff were friendly, and coffee at breakfast *was* hot - there was a member of staff making it for us right there. As for the guest whose key was snatched off him on the way out, this seems to be policy at the Marcus: you give your key in when you leave, and when you come back you ring the bell downstairs and they let you in, giving you your key. I'm not sure whether this is common Italian practice but there was always someone on the desk when we came back so the system worked fine. Basically, the Hotel Marcus is a (comparatively) cheap hotel in an outstanding location, where the staff are friendly if you're polite to them.

Fawlty Towers is a good description although I would much rather deal with Basil Fawlty rather than the rude staff at Hotel Marcus! They were very unfriendly and very rude. If we dared to ask for clean towels, toilet paper or the air conditioning remote they would get very angry about this! I do not think it acceptable to have the same towels (only one each) for a whole week!! Our window was tiny because of the bathroom blocking it, and outside the window was not a view, but a big old boiler covering it!! The bed had blood stains on it, and there were wires hanging out of holes in the walls, and faulty sockets. One one occasion a member of staff snatched our room keys off us when we were going out in the evening! Naturally, I snatched them back and he shouted at me very aggressively and literally pushed me out the door! Shocking!! I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, and would certainly not give a two star rating as it was absolutely filthy!

All I can say is my experience there has been positive. So much so that Ive stayed there twice. Once in 1998 and again in 2002. I think you basically get what you pay for. Location was awesome. We were able to walk to alot of the attractions/sites. They were longish walks but this is how we like to travel. I didnt consider my stay \"roughing it\" but of course youre not going to get the amenities you find in a North American hotel. Afterall, this is Rome, you should be out having a blast not in your hotel enjoying the bidet. Perhaps my perceptions/expectations will change with old age. Im 6'2 and could barely squeeze into the shower and yes, the water did get cold quick. But a vacation is what you make of it especially if you choose a budget place like this. No problem with any of the staff at all. I believe this is a family run operation (or at least it was at one time). In 1998, the young guy at the front desk had a long ponytail. In 2002, the same guy was there only with shorter hair ... and unbelievably he remembered me and the names and stories of the different group of people I travelled with in 1998.
