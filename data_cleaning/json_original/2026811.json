On a side note, the Emirates Air stopover program is a great deal. Someone meets you at the airport, drives you to your hotel, and then picks you up for your return to the airport.

We had a problem with the air conditioning in one room, and they immediately moved us to another room. The service in the hotel overall was very good. There is a travel desk in the lobby that can help you make arrangements for tours of the other emirates, or give advice on how to get around in Dubai. The front desk staff was extremely helpful with all of our question. Breakfast is included, and offers a range of western and Indian food. There is a gym in the hotel, and there is a pool in the roof, which is a nice option, considering how hot it can get in Dubai. The location of the hotel is in Bur Dubai, which is in the older section of the city. It's convenient for getting to and from the airport. But if you're looking for a picturesque setting with great shopping malls and fine dining in the area, this may not be the place for you. The hotel is not in the gleaming, brand new section of Dubai. The surrounding neighborhood is clean, but definitely has a more \"local\" feel as opposed to feeling really tourist-y. We liked it, and found some great, inexpensive places to eat in the area. A tip-this hotel used to be called the \"Highland Hotel\" before it became a Howard Johnson, so a few of the cab drivers that we had knew it by that name.
