{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Clean, nice, reasonably price by Responsible owners I was lucky to have found this hotel, as I arrived at Frankfurt with no lodging plans lined up. As i walked out the Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof I first bumped into Frankfurt Hostel; the mainenance there looked pretty horrific (and for my taste, loud, chaotic looking and crowded), and the single room's price there is higher than what i paid later at Muenchner Hof. There were many hotels in the vicinity of the train station, so i just searched on foot. Where Muenchner Hof is located is not a particularly graceful, inviting neighborhood, but that's what made its neat, professional front and lobby made it stand out to me from the the neighborhood. I asked for a non-smoking single room, and received a twin to be used as a single. The furnishings in the room are modern, clean and new-looking; the shower and bathroom are separate, and both are kept very, very nice and clean. The TV works fine, there is a fan and a mini-fridge in the room if you want to store leftover food; the only thing that baffled me for a minute, was the main power switch in the room (that was unlabeled and looked exactly the same as the light switch.). If you shut that down, there was no way to turn on the lights in the room (operated by another swtitch). This made me for a second think that the light switch, fan, fridge don't work; but you just have to figure out which is the main power switch and make sure it's turned on when you walk into the room. Overall my experience made me feel that this hotel is run by very responsible owners; I was very thankful that I found this wonderfully neat and affordable hotel at the last minute. Three minutes' walk from the main station. 40-50 euros/night for single room.", "Date": "Sep 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR750068179", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "GuteReise123"}, {"Content": "Hotel 3 etoiles qui vaut bien ses... deux \u8305toiles; propre mais spartiate   showReview(15580973, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR919343602", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Laute, dreckige Umgebung   showReview(11359137, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR992435202", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Non andarci.   showReview(11332740, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR127918665", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d233995-r19966481-Hotel_Muenchner_Hof-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "233995", "Price": "$143"}}
