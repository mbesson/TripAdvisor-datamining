{"Reviews": [{"Content": "SHOCK  Booked at motel for convenience of proximity to airport due to travel commitments for following day. Based on price I expected that the establishment would not be top class, but was dismayed by the attitude of the Night Manager when I registered a complaint when the shuttle left us stranded at the airport and we had to get a taxi to the motel. the room was about backpacker standard,tiny but reasonably clean with minimal comforts, like no hand towels or toiletries apart from two miniature cakes of soap. Television provided some interest, while in the room,but only for about a quarter of an hour whilst we tried to get a picture that we could watch but alas no success. Breakfast was something to write home about. we were told by reception where and when breakfast was available so duly rolled up for breakfast to be imformed that we had to pay for it despite being booked in for bb ..It seems that reception should have given us vouchers when booking in but again??? Chipped Crockery ,no side plates ,no fresh cutlery for toast spreading ,two clapped out toasters meant standing in a queue if you wanted toast. For food there was a very minimal selection, which I would classify at about Soup Kitchen standard.What more could one say except that in future I will certainly read the reviews before I book accommodation.", "Date": "Nov 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR587525689", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "troubledtrekker"}, {"Content": "Misleading claims This hotel advertises that it offers 5 days complimentary parking and I relied on this claim when I pre-booked and paid for my stay.

We paid $136 for a BB package, at breakfast which was a poor buffet, couple of cereals, canned fruit, scrambled egg, beans and bacon. A rip off even with expensive Sydney prices. Even breakfast was a problem, restaurant was run seperate from motel and new restaurant owner argued the fact that our package inc breakfast, wanted to charge us another $10. Had to visit reception again to clear that up. Actually reception was the best part of the place, pleasant. My wife and I have stayed ast hotels, motels, inns in many parts of the world.

Rooms were very small and basic and while to some it may be a cheap place, comparing it to the 4.5 star Hotel in Bangkok where we stayed for less then half price of here per night well you know who's been had. Breakfast was nearly non existant, long wait on bacon and hot water which I know is trivial but really they could not get it together and the resturant was in no way busy. On check out they tried to charge 1 adult and 1 child in our group for breakfast they did not even turn up for.

We were not due to fly out until 2.30pm but left the Motor inn at 8.30am and opted to sit and wait at the airport instead of here.Can not really compliment this place.

We stayed at the IBIS last year which cost $250.00 and although the foyer was better the rooms were just as cramped. GIven that our purpose was to have a bed for the night and somewhere to park our car for the week, this place was ok. I have actually just booked another night in November prior to a flight. For $169.00 we get a bed for the night and 7 nights parking. The seven nights parking at the airport is $109.00 so for $60.00 we are getting a bed for two adults and one child, $20.00 per person.The Mecure across the road quoted $263.00 for the same package., and the Holiday Inn quoted $289.00 My advice to cope with staying at this place is that there is a great playground and park adjacent which was great for my five year old, and contrary to the reports on this site there is a great sailing club about 5 mins walk, overlooking the river where the beer is cold and the food is excellent and well-priced. So my plan is to use the $94.00 I saved by not staying at the Mecure on a nice meal and a few beers to give me the courage needed to return to the hotel. The room we stayed in was small, but no smaller than the IBIS. We went to bed late, got up and showered and left on the shuttle at 5.30am.

Reported this to manager who fiddled and said drip would stop. wrong! Also complained abt suspicious stains on sheets. Manager said they were oil stains from the washing machine??

I booked through a web site, can't remember which. I swore the room I booked said it was a two room superior family suite. When we got there, very tired, we were shocked! It was a room the size of a Motel Six with a queen sized bed, two twin beds and a pull out couch in the same room! You can imagine my dismay when I confronted the front desk, whom was already closing up at eleven o'clock, and they said they did not have any two bedrooms. Mind you we paid 205.00 AUD!!! The place was barren, there were 'no' elevators! We had seven pieces of luggage and they kind of just shrugged off the fact there was no easy way to get it upstairs. There were no restaurant's anywhere in sight either. The ony benefit was that the airport was across the street, but we didn't get there fast because they had so many people and so much luggage that they didn't load until the time we were scheduled to go, and the dumb little pieces of paper saying we paid. We only were there to sleep and it was our last night or we would have left on the spot. Don't say here unless you like an overpriced Motel Six!!", "Date": "Jun 22, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR425789905", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "steffylew"}, {"Content": "This Place is a Dump The travel info. service at Sydney Airport referred us to this dump.

I'm sure the agent at the airport received her nice commission. The room smelled stale  mildewey. The room's furnishings were old and tattered. The fan in the bathroom sounded like a jet engine.

Ended up taking a taxi, and having to pay the driver $15.00 after he had a (fairly justified) tantrum about the short distance. There was no comment from the hotel about the wrong number, but the fare eliminated the price difference between this and the better places and put us in a resentful kind of mood. Keep that in mind when reading this review. The rooms at this hotel were very small - a twin barely fits two single beds and a small table. The television was cheap and tiny, the channels badly tuned in, and there was only minimal cable. However, the room windows opened, which was a definite plus. I bought a amke shift junk food dinner from the 7-11 at a local service station, as there was nothing else open in the entire area. Breakfast was very limited in scope, and expensive, and the waiter looked at me like I was an alien when I asked if they had skim milk. My advice is to take a walk over to the Mecure - it can't be any worse. All that said, however, I'm well aware that I was paying only $120.00 a night in a city were standard rooms are routinely over the $200.00 mark. With that in mind, this motel really isn't that bad. It also has some advantages. We flew out at 5pm the next day, and they willingly stored our bags, and allowed us to catch the shuttle back to the airport \u9225?a far easier task that catching the shuttle from the airport! The staff were also pleasant enough, especially given that they were clearly rushed off their feet. Comfy seats are provided for people waiting for the shuttle. I wouldn't exactly recommend this motel. However, in fairness it fills it's role as a dormitory hotel, close to the airport and suitable for people who are going places and don't intend to linger. Depending on the price of the competition \u9225?and do check! - it may not be all that bad a place a stay.", "Date": "Aug 29, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR656680399", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Carlydria"}, {"Content": "Not very good Shuttle was fine, rooms clean and small.
