The wireless internet functioned well, so there was no problem with that any time a day. The bathroom and equipment was lovely, which was a positive surprise for me. The breakfast (which was included in the price 110 euro/night) was delicious, but the restaurant was very cold, very much too cold actually. But I learned to dress warm for breakfast. There was a nice gym in the basement, with instructors (!), and they were so \"cute\", and brought dry towels and good advices all the time. A glass of wine in the bar was really expensive, but it wasn't easy to get wine at the restaurants we ate in, so we became regulars for one glass in the bar every night...... (one glass of wine was about the same price as a full diner in town) The hotel is located in the finacial part of the city, so it took loathes of time to go in to the old citycenter, but it took very much time to move anywhere in this town.

Our room was on the 9th floor with a big nice bed. The room and the bath room was very clear. The hotel stuff was helpful and proffesional (I guess they have be when Divan City is a business hotel).
