The hotel is located in a very quiet area and we had asked to be put in the annex, behind the courtyard which is notably quieter anyway and we weren't disappointed. The room was small but lovely with nice furnishings and a lovely power shower in the bathroom. A hairdryer was provided but was pretty ineffective so I would suggest you take your own. There was an ironing board and iron in the wardrobe and a 'free' safe. The only complaint I would have about the annex is that there's no lift and although only 2 floors high, it's still a bit of a drag having to haul luggage up 2 flights of stairs. The rooms were kept clean and the staff were friendly on reception. The reception and dining areas were immaculate. We didn't use the room service for food so can't comment on that but the breakfasts were ok - typical continental style with croissants in abundance and meats and bread. No full English though, only boiled eggs which you had to boil yourself. We tried the tea but it wasn't very nice so stuck to coffee. The staff in the dining room weren't at all friendly and only one spoke some English. We got the feeling they didn't particularly like us (tourists). Paris is lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed our trip, visiting all the usual touristy attractions. The hotel is conveniently placed (about 5-7 minute walk) to nearest metro and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone looking for a long weekend break just off the beaten track.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Drayton", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Value\u201d", "Author": "smcooper77", "ReviewID": "UR126063104", "Content": "I stayed her quite awhile ago, with my daughters.

The hotel is in quite a narrow one-way street. The neighbourhood is very lovely with predominantly Haussmanian architecture, some shops and bistros and pretty public gardens. The metro, which is clean and feels safe, is a 5 minute walk but be prepared for a bit of a struggle to buy your tickets from the machine as it's not easy... Back to the hotel. The reception staff were nothing but helpful and friendly and offered advice about the metro and taxis when I asked. The lounge and reception area is very stylishly decorated and is modern and clean. There is a very pretty courtyard at the back of the hotel, with tables and chairs and well kept borders with several trees, including a fig tree. The breakfast room is, again, modern and clean but maybe lacking the same charm as elsewhere - that being said the food is great; variety of cheeses and meats, eggs to boil yourself (you take an egg timer from the table), yoghurts, pastries and breads. There's a machine than makes fresh orange juice as you wait which was very popular. The waiting staff will bring you tea/coffee and are lovely, too. Our room was on the 5th floor at the front. We heard only a little noise on the Saturday night (people coming out of nearby bars), and the bin men and deliveries in the early morning. It didn't bother us, but if you want even more peace and quiet a room at the back would be more suitable. That our room was at the front was fabulous as we could see straight into the gorgeous apartments over the road! The bedroom was small, as we expected, but it was clean and pretty and quiet. There is no air-con but there are HUGE windows with external mechanical shutters if you want an additional sense of security and darkness at night (not that we used them).

The hotel is located close to 2 metro lines which can take you directly to tourist locations in Paris. It is also in walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe. We enjoyed the breakfast ( it is 15 euro per person per day). Kind of expensive for what you get but the freshly squeeze orange juice was delicious. Breakfast staff were very friendly as well! We travelled with another couple and their baby and staff got a play pen and bath toys ready for the baby at no additionaly charge! There are many restaurants, bakeries and a grocery store that are very close! Highly recommend checking out the bakeries!! There is also a little courtyard in the back to enjoy your breakfast. All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to couples or singles.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't fault it\u201d", "Author": "missmeg1", "ReviewID": "UR102765022", "Content": "Had a lovely experience at this hotel.

We only had a couple of problems with noise. We had a room on the second floor of the hotel, facing the street, and some people in the apartment block opposite had a very loud party on Saturday night which went on until about 4 in the morning (the person on reception that night called the police, and said this happens every Saturday). Also beware that the hotel does not have air-conditioing. This would probably be fine throughout most of the year, but it was uncomfortably hot in July, and the heat made it very diffiicult to sleep.

The hotel room was nice, clean, cozy and at the quiet corner of the street. The cons: there was no air-conditioning in our room. Thankfully our room was located in the back building where street noise was absolutely non-existent. I personally have a hard time sleeping without any sort of fan or air-conditioning so I was an uncomfortable sleeper at night! For those who are used to no air-conditioning, u shud be fine. Just make sure you ask for a room NOT on the 1st floor and be as far away from the main street (if you get a room with no air-conditioning). Second problem we had was the lack of an elevator -- our room was on the 3rd floor and the staircase to our room was VERY narrow. Only 1 person with a medium-sized suitcase can fit at a time on the staircase. It was annoying to have to carry the luggage upstairs by urself. However the BIG plus of this hotel is the breakfast - it is awesome!!! So make sure you get up on time to take advantage of that! The hotel is a good 15-20 min walk from Champs Elysees & a 10-min walk from the closest metro stop. You might as well stroll down to Champs Elysees. Hotel location is safe! We booked our trip through EuropeanDestinations.com. It's an awesome service - they did a wonderful job of putting together our 21-day itinerary. They knew we were 2 girls traveling alone so they made sure to book us hotels which were safe and this hotel is certainly a safe one for girls traveling alone by themselves. As far as good eating places go, there are some really tasty Mediterranean delis & cafes a few blocks from the hotel on the street of McDonalds. Just ask the hotel staff where McD's is & a few steps down you'll begin to spot see them. Paris was an awesome city overall!!! I will certainly go back there again. Don't miss visiting Notre Dame and the surrounding area. Sacre Ceour is another hot spot - beautiful view of Paris. Its also a 15-min walk from Moulin Rouge.

But the Magellan hotel performed an authorization check on my credit card when I booked the room and placed an authorization hold on 50EUR from my credit card account. This amount was on hold for 30days so I couldn't use that money. I considered this to be an abuse because they could have performed that card authorization check by only blocking me 1EUR from my account.

We couldn't figure out how to use the AC in the room, thankfully the weather was quite cool most days, so there wasn't a real need to use it. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. They took care of making reservations to a show for us and looked after confirming our shuttle to the airport. They gave us helpful tips on taking the metro and train to various sights. As mentioned in other reviews of this hotel, it is not in the best location. Therefore, be prepared to take the metro and train everywhere. The metro and train station is about a 5min walk from the hotel, station Perrier. We did eat dinner near the hotel two nights, the best area for restaurants is near the Perrier metro station - there's a really good pizza place called San Remos. Otherwise I would recommend eating before going back to the hotel. Overall this is a nice place to stay. I would recommend it to others as long as they are prepared to take the metro a lot.

The hotel is set out from the main hub of Paris but very accessible by metro via Pereire, which is about 5-10 min walk away. The hotel is spotlessly clean and our first impression when walking into the hotel reception was a very good one. Equally, the room/bathroom was faultless, albeit relatively small. We were situated on the 4th floor, over the reception area and street and this proved to be very quiet (except for the Monday morning when the dust carts are out early and because we had our french doors open to our balcony). The room is equipped with kettle, flat screen TV with approx 14 channels and hairdrier. Hanging space for clothing was minimal. The shower is very good (which is always important to us). The bar/lounge in the hotel is smart and a good place to unwind with friends after a busy day. Half pint beer approx 3 Euros. The drinks vending machine is ideal though for water in particular with a bottle @ 1 Euro. There is a garden which is a great bonus for a Paris hotel and a lovely place to sit with a beer if the weather is kind. Breakfast is served 7-10am and continental. It was a perfect way to start the day with the usual coffee, tea, juices, milk, various cereals, croissants, bread, jam, fruit etc and on a help yourself basis. We had breakfast around 9 each day and it was relatively busy then. Last day we were there for 7.30 and it was much quieter. From CDG airport we had paid for a train and 3 day metro pass which cost 38.50 Euros (approx \u00a330) and the metro proved tobe a great purchase, essential. The only problem is that it lasted Fri, Sat, Sun but not Monday to get back. The only time we felt let down by the hotel was when reception advised a taxi to CDG would be around 45 euros so the 4 of us agreed to do this. Having tried to book it for Mon morning (the night before), we were told it could only be booked 15 mins before our departure time, which we did. However, at the time of departure they announced that the cost was 68 euros and that there was a 20 euro deposit to pay the hotel?? We did not see the driver take any deposit, just the extra 48 euros, so had to assume the hotel took 20E as an \"arrangement fee\" which we thought was naughty. Overall great break. Top trips done, Louvre, Sacre Coeur, Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower at night seen from Trocadero. Not so good, Saint Chappelle, queues in day at Eiffel. Great local restaurant Bistro Du 17eme at Avenue de Villiers just off the roundabout at Pereire metro. Aperitif, 3 courses, dessert and bottle of wine between two for 36 euros per person.

We had no problem checking in as soon as we arrived and although as expected our room was small, it was well laid out. The breakfast was the same each day - but it was great. Try to go early as once certain items run out, they don't refresh them. Our room was always clean and the staff was lovely and helpful. The hotel is 2 a two minute walk from the closest subway station and 10 minute walk from the Arc/ Champs area. We didn't have a lot of luck with the restaurants near the hotel, so eat before you head back for the night. As the hotel is in a residential area, there isn't a real night life, so if that is what you are looking for, this hotel isn't the best choice. As others have mentioned, this hotel is very hard to find, so have a map with you if you are taking a cab from the airport, as the taxi driver may not know where it is or email the hotel asking for instructions from the closet metro station. When you get to the hotel, ask for the free map they have behind the desk and have them circle the location of the hotel. The street is so small, that you wouldn't find it otherwise.

Breakfast can be taken in the hotel or in the lovely little garden courtyard which is a bonus to have in a city hotel.

We also discovered the short walk to the metro station Pereire which took us on the yellow line to all the major attractions very inexpensively. The trains are quite tatty really and each trip we were approached by beggars which we chose to ignore so we walked back most days. It is a long walk from the Notre Dame but well worth it along the river Seine. There does seem to be a poor choice of good restaurants nearby and they are very expensive.

We looked into buying tickets for two days on the tourist buses but worked out these were expensive in comparison to the metro plus the buses stopped after approx 6pm. We found taking the metro was much cheaper and faster so would recommend this to everyone! One place we highly recommend is Versailles which was excellent.
