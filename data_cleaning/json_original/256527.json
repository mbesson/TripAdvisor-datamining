Check-in was prompt and our room clean, spacious and well-appointed. The beds were comfortable and roomy enough to sleep 4. The only criticism I could make of the room - was that the bathroom was a little on the small size. Staff were prompt in notifying us of the arrival of our luggage which went astray at the airport on arrival in Sydney. Breakfast was pleasant and there was a reasonable assortment of food to cater for all tastes. The hotel has retained it's old charm and character, which was nice.

It was such a pain to pay for the cost of an extra room simply because we had an infant with us.

Having spent three days in Singapore (Marina Mandarin - a hotel of the highest standards) we were looking forward to our three days in Sydney before the cruise. Knowing that RCCI only ever book the basic rooms we contacted the Menzies before-hand and upgraded our room to a Superior Park View Room. This cost us an extra \u00c2\u00a350 per night. The reservations clerk was very helpful and we arrived in Sydney with high hopes. On opening our room door, our hopes were dashed. The room was dark, small and uncomfortable. There is no in room safe (none in any of the rooms). The 'park view' was a joke - sort of side on view of a small section of a small grass area (hardly a park). It was badly in need of refurbishment - old fashioned furniture and fittings, small bathroom with a toilet that would not flush. On complaining we upgraded to a junior suite (at an extra \u00c2\u00a350 per night over and above the extra we had already paid). This is really two rooms with a view of the train station immediatley over the road from the hotel. A reasonable size sitting area (internet point at a cost) mini bar and bathroom in one room and bedroom, mini bar and bathroom adjoining. Again badly in need of refurbishment but at least it was of a reasonable (not good) standard and we made do for the three days. We had booked breakfast (at AU$19 per person - special price). The first morning we had to queue outside the dining room and when we were allocated a place there was no table and we were offered a seat in the corridor. They ran out of cups - had to use paper ones - the food was not replenished and was of a very poor standard. So much so that we bought provisions to have in our room and thereby 'saved' the AU$38 it would have cost us for the final breakfast on the Saturday morning. The location is great - 10 minutes walk from the Opera House or the Bridge and in very easy rach of the magnificent botanical gardens. This is the only plus factor for what must once have been a superb hotel but has been left to fester and is in dire need of a refurbishment to bring it up to 21st century standards.

The only low points if I had to pick out the negatives was that the hairdryer barely wheezed warm air, and that the room lighting is slightly inadequate, making the room quite dim even with the lights on. Great location for access to the ferries and The Rocks as it is a 5 minute walk away. The hotel is situated immediately opposite Wynyard station, so you can save a bit of cash taking the train from the airport instead of a cab. We didn't have any problems with noise from the street as we were on the 12th floor, but the walls are quite thin, so do take note. The staff were hard to get hold of, but when you do get service, they are very warm and extremely helpful.

Lobby is dated. On getting to the floor, there are a fair amount of carpet stains in the corridor. As has been commented on here, the rooms are dated, but clean.

It's the little details like this that makes a great hotel stand out from the crowd. I didn't feel like I was special, or even appreciated, but more just another part of the staff's daily routine they had to deal with. Bad again. And where were the smiles? Ok, so I am comparing my stay to my many visits to Thailand where I always feel welcome and appreciated. That's terrible that I feel more welcome in another country rather than my own. The room was ok. Clean, smelt ok, nice king sized bed. Sorry, back to the negaitves again: lousy thin pillows. Actually would rate them the worst I've ever had to sleep on. So thin it was almost like it wasn't even there--apart from the lumps all the way through. There were no bathrobes or coathangers or slippers anywhere I could find. The bathroom was on the tiny side, although it did have a basin, toilet, and a bath even a midget would find small. And then there was the noise. Yep, that night we could hear other people flushing toilets and also people having showers. Luckily for me I sleep with earplugs so when I went to sleep I didn't hear any more noise. The only other thing worth mentioning was the elevators. They were posssessed. Each time we went up or down, it decided to take us to the lower level first. Very odd. Oh, and as I left, and said good morning to the guy on the door, who briefly glanced up from his morning news paper to mumble a greating back. Talking of back.

Other positives include internet access in rooms and in the main lobby (I used my own wireless modem but understand that internet WiFi access in the lobby area is free for the first 30 minutes after you login) - though I really feel internet should be free these days in keeping with the increasing trend in overseas hotels; car parking is available under the hotel and is mid-range cost at $45 for 24 hours (my experience is that overnight car parking in hotels in the CBD ranges between $35 and $55 at present). The downsides are that this is an older hotel and feels a bit dated (not dirty/not unkempt just a bit dated); there is no safe in your room (at least not in the double room I had this time); the walls seem a bit thin and at times I could hear guests in other rooms.

I only have a few complaints about this hotel. First, not all of the keycards worked! I shared a room with two other people and somehow, my key decided not to work during the 4 night stay. That wasn't a huge problem though. What bothered me was the fact that the shower leaked!!! After a day of confusion and soaked clothes, I had to put towels over the shower head to keep it from leaking! Hopefully that got fixed. Lastly, the walls were REALLY THIN.

I stayed two days and was unfortunate enough to have to change rooms after the first night of my stay. One room was in the south wing and the other in the north wing, so I will quickly review both wings. The south wing looked magnificent. The bathroom was neat and tidy and the room was what you would expect from a four star hotel. I found the tv difficult to use, but worked it out eventually. The problem with the room was that the air-conditioning wasn't working. This meant that the room was really really stuffy. My partner had trouble sleeping and I found it difficult. The bed was standard and I couldn't complain. Overall, the first room would rate 3/5, 4 if the air-con was working. Because of the air con problems, which made sleeping difficult, my partner and I requested a room transfer. The valet who moved our bags said that the air-con in the north wing was better and easier to work. While this was the case, it's a shame the rest of the room wasn't up to scratch. It was clearly the older section of the hotel and was incredibly run down, you could see it from the carpeting in the halls. The bathroom was disgusting, the grouting was mouldy, the toilet and bath/shower were disgusting. The room was oddly set-up, with the tv on a bracket that made viewing almost impossible. The bed was also deplorable. It was the oldest bed I've ever seen and needed to be thrown in the skip!! Basically, if you lay in the middle, the bed sagged so bad, you fell about 50 cms lower than the level the bed!! This made it impossible to sleep!! Overall, I would give the room 0/5!! It also should be noted that when moving, my partner and I left some stuff we had put in the mini-bar in the room, which was then thrown out on us, which was quiet disappointing. Other basic notes in the hotel: Service: Besides throwing out our stiff in the mini-bar, quite good. It took them a while to decided to move us to the second room, but I can't fault them otherwise. Value: Paid about $150 a night, so not bad, but if I had spend both nights in the north wing, would have been very disappointed. Cleanliness: South wing was great, so was the lobby and the bar. North wing ... don't go there!! In fact, the lobby was impressive, really nice and well kept. It looks amazing!! In the lobby they had free wi fi, it was only about 30 mins, but was quite nice to get some time to check my e-mails for free. Location: Close to Wynard station, like 1 min walk thru the station. This makes the hotel close to the rocks and Pitt Street Mall, which is what my partner and I go to Sydney for. On the whole, I may go back, but only if I could be guaranteed a room in the south wing, the north wing was terrible and def wouldn't go back. On the whole, the hotel had some ups and some downs, but mostly downs.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAGAIN, ANOTHER late entry/missed travel stay for a review.\u201d", "Author": "NQTropics", "ReviewID": "UR117011811", "Content": "THE MENZIES, ON WYNYARD PARK.

Complex facilities include bars, quiet lounge. Restaurants, Gift shop and news agency. Internet den as such. They have a lot of tour package tourists here, so it was crowded. If you want to take ride to anywhere there are busses out the front and the Train station across the road. Below that you have a supermarket and takeaways. Local pubs also nearby. In two words, Handy Accommodation. Get the feel of this review yet? Room: Junior Suite 1 King Bed. Master stroke here. Forget the official website pictures; the room (Our booking) is not how it is. The windows are dirty small portholes to the busy street below. The overlooking park reference is overstated. They have made two standard rooms into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by connecting them. Two identical bathrooms with shover over bath. One side has a lounge and TV, the other the bed and a TV. Not a Suite in my experience as there is no flow or feeling to the space. The musty smell was bad, as mentioned with corridors. One bathroom toilet had duct tape holding the cistern pipe to the pedestal. Not that I check for these things it was too obvious to miss. Minbar and Tea/coffee etc as a usual in most hotels. Two lots of hanging space. Funny about that! Rate: Used Accor Advantage Plus. One free breakfast diner one paid. Room AU 320.00, second night AU 350.00.

We were granted an early check-in by the hotel staff due to a 6:30 a.m. arrival in Sydney. We stayed in a double double room in the north wing of the hotel with a view of the adjacent office building next door. While the room was okay for our needs, it was definitely starting to show its age. Some of the furnishings in the room were a little worn and looking a bit aged. The beds were comfortable, but were on rolling casters. Every time we sat on the beds, they moved 6 inches. I found this kind of odd and annoying at the same time. While the hotel itself was average, the best thing about this hotel is the location. The hotel is a 10-minute walk to either Circular Quay or Darling Harbour - two of Sydney's main attractions. The rear of the hotel is also on George Street which is a main thoroughfare through downtown. There are plenty of shopping and eating venues on George Street to choose from. During our stay at The Menzies, there were several large groups of high school aged kids staying at the hotel. The kids were getting pretty loud in the lobby area and even on our hotel room floor. It didn't get to the point of getting out of control, but there were a lot of kids running about the hotel during our stay. We found the train station very convenient for getting breakfast, coffee, and snacks. There is a Coles Market in the train station which was very handy in getting snacks and drinks for the kids. Overall, The Menzies is an average hotel in an excellent location. While the rooms could be a little nicer, I WOULD stay at The Menzies again. One big negative is the wi-fi situation. I was told by the staff that wi-fi was available free of charge in the hotel lobby for each guest for 30 minutes in a 24 - hour period. The wi-fi was fair at best, and was really only available for approximately 20 minutes each session before it timed out. We had a pleasant stay at The Menzies, and an unbelievable time in Sydney.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington", "Title": "\u201cWorn around the edges\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR116455311", "Content": "I booked this hotel on wotif.com and expected a park view.

Instead, we went downstairs to Sporters Bar & Grill for a more casual meal and a couple of cold beers. We walked in at 7:45, and they told us they were closed. We ended up at the fancier restaurant, where mains are in the $35 range. By the way, when I checked in, I asked the desk clerk how late Sporters was open that night, and she said they were open \"late\". I guess 7:45 is late in some people's eyes. If you stay, don't count on Sporters being open. I have no idea what their hours are, you just never know when they're open. The following Saturday, we wanted to stop in for a beer, and they were not even open at all on Saturday. I'm not sure how you can call yourself a \"bar & grill\" and be closed at 7:45 on a Thursday, and not open at all on Saturday.

Firstly we were given a room looking out onto a central area which was horrific. We couldn't even see the sky. It felt like it was night time when it was a sunny day. We were booked in for 5 nights, so the next morning I asked to be shifted to a room on the outside of the hotel. The girl as the front desk eventually did so but only after huffing and puffing about it like it was a major inconvience to her. This room was better in so far as it had some light coming in the window, but the beds were so worn that I could feel the springs coming through the mattress when I sat or laid down. The fan in the bathroom didn't work, so every time you used the shower you had a sauna and a fogged up mirror. The lampshade on the desk was loose and the fridge in our first room didn't keep our milk or drinks cold!! I requested a spirits glass from reception, as they only provide wine glasses, but it took 2 hours for it to arrive at our room. The desk chair was covered in what looked like dry spilt milk and was so disgusting I wouldn't even sit on it!! I asked for it to be replaced with a clean one, but it took me to ask 3 different people to eventually get a so called \"clean\" one (it was actually almost as firthy as the previous one). The third person I dealt with over the chair was a front desk male who was so extremely rude and condescending to me that I was almost in tears. It was like it was too much trouble for him, like he had better things to do with his time. I just don't know how he even has a job there as he was just sooo rude!!! The whole hotel was full of American high school kids who had no respect for other guests. They would run up and down the passages, sit in the hallways, press every button in the lifts so the lifts took forever to go up and down and hogged all the facilities!! Lastly to cap it all off, for the last 3 nights we had trouble with a group of young people who came home late (4am, 3am, 2am) and then yelled in the hallway, slammed their door continuously and played loud music!! Your typical nightmare when you are sightseeing all day and are exhausted. The girl who checked us in was extremely nice and even asked us the next day when she saw us how our room was. The concierges were lovely, opening the door for you and helping you with your bags down the steps. And lastly the location was quite good. But despite all this I will never, never, never stay at the Menzies again and I would definately not recommend it to anyone (not even my daughter's high school!!!)", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood location, comfy room, good food\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR115383707", "Content": "We were in the Sydney CBD for shopping and show, the Menzies Hotel is a very central location to all the major shops and transport connections, train, bus & ferries were just a short walk.

Perhaps the hotel charges at a four star rates and hope people don't complain. The heater sent to our room as an interim measure broke down after a minute of use. We were moved to a large room in the North wing which was better in terms of AC but lacked in cleanliness. There was a half smoked cigarette balanced on the hairdryer in the bathroom. The hairdryer itself refused to work after the first use. All of this was exacerbated when we arrived at the Restaurant for dinner. After specifically inquiring with the concierge if we needed to book and being told no, we were turned away as there were no tables available until after 8.30pm. The breakfast buffet was adequate but crowded. It was difficult to eat anything, as soon as the food was placed it was devoured in minutes by the waiting hordes facilitating another long wait before it was replaced. The elevators were grubby, in one we saw a stash of cigars and cigarettes stored in the recess for the lights.

The room was fine, TV has lots of channels, internet costs $25 per day which is highway robbery in my opinion. We had an issue with a bug on our last night. The night manager handled the situation very well and came up personally to see it. He offered us another room to sleep in and we wouldnt have to move our things. He also compensated us fairly by comping some room service. We stayed Easter/Anzac weekend so all of the hotels were expensive, so I cant relate to the value. However, a big nice breakfast was included. The breakfast buffet was among the best Ive been to at a hotel. Im sure it wont disappoint.

It is close to just about everything. The staff was congenial and did their best to satisfy the challenges that we encountered. Now the negatives. Internet was $25 per day and parking $40 per day. The bathroom is tiny, the tub is elevated and at 6\"3\" my head hit the lowered ceiling in the shower. There were no fire sprinklers in our bedroom and the daily housekeeping was sketchy with old glasses left and very little attention to detail. On our second of four days we had a couple walk in on us with a key given out at the front desk. My wife was just exiting the tiny batroom after having taken a shower. It was the second room that this poor couple had been given a key to with the room being already occupied. Of course when the front desk gave this couple keys to our room it locked out our keys which we unfortunately discovered after going to the pool. The front desk should have realized this (can you say training?) and delivered new keys as soon as the mistake was realized. When I went and reported this I was told that our account showed us as being booked for four days and that they didn't understand how this happened. On our third day we started to get on one of the elevators and the couple inside hurridly got out stating that the elevator had dropped a bit and then would not move. Its door finally opened after they had set off the elevators alarm. We decide to not repeat thier misfortune and pressed the button for another lift. All this did was re-open the doors on the faulty elevator time and again. At this point we all decided to walk down a flight of stairs to see if we could access a lift on another floor. Vey bad move. Once you enter the stairwell there is no way to re-enter any of the lower or upper floors as the doors are locked preventing re-entry to any of the floors. We walked down eleven flights of stairs (with a bad back mind you) only to reach the bottom and a sign stating that the exit door was alarmed and not to be used unless there was a fire. We were now trapped in the stairweel with no phone or any instructions on how to get out. We opened the fire exit and sure enough the loudest alarm I have ever heard sounded. We later were told that the doors on each floor only open in case of a fire. One would think that there might be some notice of such or at least a phone in case someone were to be stuck like us. Can you imagine a child opening the door and then being stuck. The next day before we departed we got on another elevator (not the one that was malfunctioning the day before) and when the doors closed it dropped a bit and then proceded to go up, not down. As soon as it stopped and the doors opened we hastily exited. We did take our chances on a different lift as we did not want to repeat the stairwell fiasco. We awoke on our final day with an invoice under our door requesting payment for the four days when the entire stay had been pre-paid in advance. As I said the hotel is idally located but with all of the challnges we encountered, faulty elevators, no fire spriklers, tiny bathroom, six foot three inch tub to ceiling shower, the stairwell of no return and double billing I just have no way of believing that The Menzies is any more than a three star hotel at best.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cairns", "Title": "\u201cone bad night ; 2 good nights\u201d", "Author": "baroncairns Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR103975392", "Content": "checked in late and was \" upgraded \" to room 604 where i had the worst night's sleep that i have had in any 4 star hotel in australia ; this was due to the whistling noise that occurred internally within the walls of the room every 10 minutes or so ; i am not sure if this was a water pipes noise or a railway related noise ; i should have relocated that night but i was too tired after travelling ; i asked to relocate at 5am the next morning and the hotel to its credit promptly relocated me to room 522 ; this room was quiet internally and the remaining 2 nights of my stay were fine ; i cannot believe that the hotel has not received complaints about room 604 before ( or even the whole 04 series of rooms ) so this problem should have been fixed before ; if not at least the hotel cleaning staff must also hear the same sound which i heard consistently all night on my first night ( 31/3/11 ) and should heve reported it before guests had to put up with it ; a pity as the hotel is really well located being near the wynyard park exit for wynyard station and in a handy part of town .", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kadina", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Position, great service\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR103694788", "Content": "Your hotel is in a fantastic postition, so convenient to walk everywhere or use the wonderfyul train service you have in sydney.

Gal #2 and I have our travel patter pretty well down pat. She has a extensive background in public relations and publishing and I, Gal #1, have been a chef since starting an apprenticeship at fourteen. I have been a chef for lets just say more decades than I care to admit, yelling \"away on table 4\" and chefing in over 30 countries. When we travel we triple check that my wheelchair, as an equal paying customer can use everything you an able bodied person can. Then as Vegans we call and check with the kitchen and Gal #2, my main squeeze gives their ads, promotions and bling the Madison Ave once over to make sure we weren't buying into something there isn't. Well we were promised full access to the pool and jacuzzi and were told that \"even the piano bar you can roll right up to\" and when asked \"is their a disabled toilet with every bar, restaurant and outlet we were confidantly assured this was the case.\" After all this research, we arrive at some very early time like 6 am after 2 hours on a Virgin Blue (I think blue is lying to her mom as her virginity along with her tarnish was lost years ago). I asked at check-in where the pool was and I was told through the arch, simply swipe the card and enjoy. So we went to our room, changed, came down in our bathing suits and opened the pool door, To what wonderful surprise for this wheelchair bound weary traveller, a staircase and no other entry. Strike one Mr. Menzie. After that debacle we go for breakfast and explain first to the \"catering manager\" what Vegan means because he thought it was a chinese food. The chef, only to get when requesting tomatos cut in half and grilled with sauteed mushrooms, then waiting 40 minutes a bowl of tomato and mushroom pure arrived! Strike 2! Bottom of the ninth, bases loaded so we call the manager (the same one who didn't know his own pool had stairs) and another 45 minutes we get a passable breakfast. At that stage all I wanted was my COFFEE! On their menu it stated \"a mug of espresso\" or any other coffee or hot chocolate was $5.20. The bill came and because of the stuff up the food was comped. However, the coffee which was meant to be $5.20 x2 was charged at $20. When we showed the mistake, my spouse was given so much attitude this writer, who has been a qualified lip reader for 30 years read the word \"b###h\" on the lips of the staff as we left . We were only there for 24 hours and the start was terrible and if we thought it couldn't get worse when, as nature eventually calls, I asked where the nearest disabled convenience was. I was then told the only one was in the basement so we went down there. Apparently this high end hotel thought disabled people would be ok using a restroom complete with water damaged sagging ceilings, paint hanging like stalagmites, and a hole literally punched in the wall and hadn't been cleaned since Sir Robert was in office. The only saving grace was the evening meal. As planned, it was a chefs table arrangement where we left the final test to the chef to attempt a hail mary play and they did. The Peter Lehman 2007 was exceptional, the beat salad was mind blowing and the Verdura Griglio was a memory to keep. So, Mr. Menzies, every great Prime Minister listened to their advisors so we suggest you put the entire house staff in a room with the building plans and the evening restaurant staff and don't leave until you know your own building like the back of your hand. Lets also make sure the breakfast staff have been body snatched and posessed by the amazing evening crew. Would I ever stay there again? Sadly no! Nevertheless, I would eat at the restaurant anytime and recommend it. Mr. Menzies, stop spinning in your grave, your name wasn't irreparabely tarnished, just a little around the edges.

You can get a deal on the web for around $280 a night for a standard room with no breakfast. However, there are plenty of breafast options over the street at the Wynard station for around $8 for eggs, bacon and toast with tea and coffee included. The hotel location is very good and within walking distance to the water - bay area and this is a big plus and its what you are paying for. The underground train station (Wynard station is right across the road and the city buses are in the same street which is handy. Plenty of taxis around should you need one. Check in time was 2pm although I suspect the hotel may have been able to get us in a bit earlier if we had arrived before this time. Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. We had a standard room on the 12th floor with no particular view except another building but that was no drama, who looks out the window anyway? Our room was smallish but not too small, it had a comfortable queen size bed, a good wall mounted tv and a functional bathroom with shower and bath tub combined. The air con worked well and the temperature was just right for us. Many hotels are too hot - this hotel has got it right . The room was very clean and quiet with no street noise although our neighbours next door were able to be heard coming and going later at night although we were not really disturbed by this. There is a selection of free magazines to read in the room and this is a nice touch.Mini bar has the usual high priced drinks, water (from Fiji) at $7.50 a large bottle- but Sydney tap water is fine so you don't need that..... How about Aussie bottled water guys? Expect to pay $12.90 for a half bottle of wine and around $4-$6 for snacks from the mini bar, all about standard price these days wherever you stay. An ironing board and tea and coffee making facilities was a big plus. I was disappointed there was no in room safe. Safe deposit facilities are available, free of charge at reception although these days a small safe is pretty much standard fare at most places. Dining facilities are good with a coffee and wine bar on the ground floor, a breakfast restaurant and a a la carte dinner estaurant. There are plenty of other eating places closeby if you don't want to eat in. Room serice is available 11am -11pm and has a good choice of food with prices similar to most restaurants in the vicinity (eg mains around $35 or club sandwich for around $22 and wine from $29 to $40 a large bottle. We enjoyed our stay at this place. Its a genuine 4 star hotel. With good facilities and a gym and pool. For room comfort I think 7.5/10, front desk staff and concierge 8/10. Cleanliness 8.5/10. Overall value for money 7/10... I marked this down a little because I really think Sydney hotels are overpriced . Would I stay again? Yes, its a nice comfortable hotel with good roooms and friendly, helpful staff.

The day after the wedding we travelled from Victoria to NSW and the first place we went to was the lobby bar which was closed at 5pm. Slight annoyance, but at this stage it was not a big deal. Check-in was fairly quick, but there was no personality whatsoever. The hallway carpet reeked of mildew on all our floors (7,8,11). The bathrooms were tiny even comparable to the toilets of a small airplane. To my disbelief, there was a hole in our bedsheet which I paid an upgrade fee for a larger bed. After a huge day of sightseeing our group was excited to the idea of having a swim in the heated indoor pool. Again, to our disbelief the poor was out of service not to be available until another month. This information did not appear on the website where I had read 'heated indoor swimming pool'. Sadly, the disappointment did not stop there... On the last night of our 2 night stay we came back to the hotel at 11pm without any issue. I went downstairs to get some fresh air and upon my return I had first hand experience on what happens when the door keycard reader battery goes flat. I had to go back downstairs and was given a new keycard although I had explained that there were no lights on the reader. I had to return back downstairs and was asked to wait for the duty manager to come up and open the door to my hotel. Without a doubt, this has been THE only bad...no...extremely disappointing experience with an Accor hotel.

After a long day at work I returned to the The Menzies Hotel, which is conveniently located off York Street, at the top end of the Sydney CBD, close to my office. My room was on the 7th floor. As soon as I exited the elevator my colleague and I noticed a strong damp / musty smell permeating through the hallway. I was worried my room would have the same foul odour, but I was pleased to find my room clean and odour free. The bathroom was small with old fittings, the bed was too soft and the view onto an adjacent concrete wall, uninspiring, but the room served its purpose for a night's stay on business. My real problem with the hotel began at 11pm. Having worked late I arrived back to my room and ordered room service from the limited and very unhealthy late-night menu. I dialed the room service extension three times, each time there was no answer. I then called reception three times, again no answer. I then dialed for the concierge, surprise, no answer, so finally I dialed for the bellboy and my call was received and he took my order. The food arrived 20 minutes later. The gentleman delivering the food came into my room and instantly got distracted by the television and started watching the program. After a cough to grab his attention, he refocused on his job and passed me the receipt and then walked out of my room failing to close the door! After a good night's sleep [the room was quiet] I went to check out at 8.30am. Being unsatisfied with the hotel's service l I opted for an online survey to be emailed to me.

The northern wing seems to be more recent, with south the wing that holds the lobby. I prefer the northern wing, though the rooms were similar. The windows open in the rooms so I was able to have fresh air, and the lack of screens surely made no difference on the 10th floor in December. The pool is average and usually empty. The pool changing/shower room not so great, almost want to walk wet through the lobby and shower in my room.

Fortunately there were some good cafes nearby--an italian one iat the back of the nearby arcade and the Organic Cafe right down the street. The hotel lobby looked tired and past its hay day. There was no way of telling the difference between the bell boys and the concierge as they were dressed in the same manner. When you asked one a question, it was obvious who was who because the bell boys didn't know much at all. Unfortunately, the concierge wasn't around often. The in-room internet charges were ludicrous but they offer 30 minutes of free wireless in the lobby every 24 hours. (There is a great convenience shop down the road towards the south on the corner on York that offers good inexpensive internet service.)

The room they gave me last weekend was a horrible, dark room facing the back. One wall had 4 locked cupboards where I guess an airconditioning vent or something was. It was dirty & horrible. I asked them to move me which they did but they looked at me as if I was from another planet when I told them what the problem was. The next room was better. But the cupboard that the fridge was in was dirty. The bathroom door on the inside was revolting with finger marks & what looked like makeup fingerprints. Really no excuse for this. All it needs is some spray & wipe. I would have called housekeeping to complain but was getting late & only staying one night so I cleaned it as best myself with some soap & facewasher. The corner where the table fitted in - the wall was dusty with dirty marks. Again all it needs is some spray & wipe. There was an upholstered chair at the desk & was falling apart front & back you could see where the material was coming away from the chair & all the tiny nails exposed. There's no excuse for this. Its just bad maintenance & cleaning. The bed was clean & comfortable. The bathroom otherwise clean. I've not had such bad rooms here before so I guess I've jusy been lucky in the past.

The only supposition I have is that if you treat people with contempt and disrespect then that is what you usually receive in turn. Yes the hotel is a little older and less modern that some of the others in Sydney but our standard King double was clean, spacious and well stocked of facilities. The bed was reasonably comfortable (much more so than some I have slept in throughout Europe) and actually was a King rather than two singles joined together as is the practice of some hotels. The only blip in our stay was that on arrival to our room we found a single rollaway bed in the middle of the room but as soon as I reported this to the desk it was removed within 5 minutes. We did not try breakfast at the hotel as I usually like to try various cafes in the city I'm staying in, but we did try room service which was prompt, tasty and good portion sizes (not too large or small).

A few days into the stay the lifts completely stopped working for a few hours and you were not permitted to take the stairs because they are for emergencies only. Guests were stuck in their rooms for at least 2 hours if not more. The full breakfast offered is expensive and unoriginal.

The room: If I could've taken the bed and pillows home with me, I would have! I enjoyed a wonderful sleep and wish I'd stayed longer than one night. The room was clean and comfortable with modern decor. I wasn't in long enough to be 'offended' by the view of the next building, a garden-view room would've been wasted on me as I've never spent much time looking at the view from an inner CBD hotel room and I can't understand why guests can be so indignant that their view was of another building. I imagine it would be a different story if the hotel was located next to the sea, harbour, or mountain but it's inner CBD and no one is in their hotel room for long. Quiet, clean, and ultra comfortable...what more could you want? The atmosphere: A lovely, welcoming foyer that was enhanced by the grand piano on Friday night. What a lovely surprise that was! How many hotels afford their guests such a charming treat these days? Enjoying a glass of vino as the piano played while the frantic pace continued outside, was utterly spectacular. The Menzies has such an inviting atmosphere, I can't imagine anyone feeling uncomfortable. The business centre: Though this trip was for leisure I frequently visit Sydney for business. I was impressed on a personal and business level by the business centre that's available. Firstly, there's more than one computer/internet terminal set up in an internet cafe style but privately partitioned. Very impressed by the set-up because it's a cheaper alternative than paying for the Accor internet connection. Other: I wasn't there long enough to enjoy the gym or other amenities but I would LOVE to organise a function there. Shame I look after Brisbane events and not Sydney's ;) Would I stay there again?

I was offered either paying for the late checkout charge $20 per hour or the standard room rate $299 if i want to keep my room till 6pm. This is ridiculous and unrealistic that I have to pay for a lot more than my original daily rate if I want to keep my room for a few hours more. I would have chosen the other 5 stars hotel if i'm paying for $299. 7. Piano Bar was under staff, therefore, I did not receive any table service.

As we had some bags we decided to take the latter offer. When we parked right in front of the hotel we had to carry all our bags inside ourselves as the porters just looked on like we weren't even there. I went up to him and he said sorry they don't valet from the hotel and we have to go to the lane. I didn't even bother arguing. On check in the receptionist was good and checked us in quickly and gave us clear instructions to get to the room. We entered the room and were literally shocked.

Pathetic. I can't get over how bad the room was. The bathroom even was so old. So we decided to go down and get some food. The restaurant apparently isn't open at that time. Then we go and ask a porter if the bar and bistro is serving food. He said sorry but no where in the hotel is food being served at this hour apart from room service (3pm). Just in case we went down to the bar to ask and she told us that the restaurant on the reception level sell food all day. So why did the porter tell us that they don't? Anyway the food wasn't too bad but the service was pretty bad. All night while trying to sleep thing was creeping and crawling and making noise. Couldn't fall asleep.

Firstly, a funny \"light-switch-type\" button to flush the toilet- god knows how the cleaners could ever give that a decent clean. The shower ceiling would suit a midget, if you were 6\", you would be crouching down; and the bath tub has a plastic-feel to it - it didnt look very clean, but thats due to the polymer-type surface. Also beware when entering the bathroom of the 1 inch thick granite tiles as you can easily stub your toes. I was impressed with the room service and helpful concierge.

My room had a terrible smell and bathroom unclean to make it worse the dust was thick on all surfaces so I was glad I had my own drinking cup with me because their glasses were dirty and the area around it. Went down stairs to ask for another room and was told booked out which it was not and I had to have my room or I could leave. leave and go where at 5pm at night so I went back to my room. That night was kept awake by a party in the room next door 702 and though I asked them to quiten down alittle the languge I recieved back only made them go louder and my room was rocking. I went to reception four times that night and they did nothing except till me it was Friday night and I should expect this. left early in the morning for a day out and was told thats the one that moaned about the party as I walked out so I made sure i stayed out the whole day as i was nervous to go back. That night the door would not open with the card so up and down the lifts i went to try and make it work again the staff were very aggressive in nature and then told me it was my fault by this time I felt a victim and all I wanted was a shower after a long and happy day out. This is not the end though the party came back that night and even louder than before and again no help from the staff who even laughed at me this time. Four in the moring is no laughing matter.

The worst part about our room was the noise - we could hear the plumbing of our entire floor each time someone in another room flushed a toilet or turned on a tap or shower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very frustrating at early hours of the morning being woken up by this!! Also full breakfast was $35 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most expensive I have ever come across in a hotel!! The only good thing I can say about this hotel is its location.

Evidently, that hasn't sunk in with him, however, since my experience at The Menzies was similar to others who've written here. We just got back from Australia yesterday. We spent 5 nights at the Menzies (room 623). The internet charge others have mentioned here is still in place. They wanted $30 per day to hook up with their wireless. Are they insane???? Who in their right mind would pay such a exorbitant rate. For $8 per hour you can use their computers (they have four available), but they don't offer a printer of any kind. When it came time to print our boarding passes for the flight home, we were out of luck. We had 2 adults staying in the room. The Menzies afforded us 1 water glass, 1 wash cloth and 2 bath towels for the two of us! On our second day there we spoke with the housekeeper and asked that the room be set up for two people. She assured us it would be taken care of. Not so, however. Toward the end of our stay, she simply didn't leave any wash cloths at all. We were forced to use the bath mat as a hand towel. Can you imagine? The coffee/tea bar was a wonderful convenience. The Menzies provided two cups and saucers and a variety of tea and coffee. The only problem was that the cups and saucers were never replaced with new sterilized ones. The housekeeper simply rinsed the cups out in the bathroom each day and set them back on the coffee bar. That's just gross! Makes me wonder if she rinsed them out the day we left and placed them on the coffee bar for the next guest. Our room included breakfast each day. The first day we were delighted with the offering. By the second day, however, we realized it was exactly the same as the day before. By the third day, you can imagine, breakfast was downright boring. Each day they served watery scrambled eggs, tasteless sausages, two types of bacon, soggy potatoes and sauteed mushrooms with spinach. Everyday it was exactly the same. The selection of sweet breads was limited. Fresh fruit consisted of canned pineapple chunks, diced melon and watermelon wedges. The granola was some kind of bran flakes with raisins tossed in. We never saw a pastry all week. It certainly wouldn't have taken much creativity on the part of the kitchen to vary the breakfast offerings, but like in other areas of this hotel, they just don't seem to be interested in \"going the extra mile\" for their guests. There were two phones in the room, but only the one on the desk worked. The other was just the alarm clock. Our TV set was horrible the first day and the remote didn't work either. After complaining, they eventually replaced the old dinosaur set with a flat screen. There is no safe in the room for your valuables, so protect your passports while you are in the Menzies. This hotel \"recycles\" their room keys (card type), but reuses them so often that they don't work since the magnetic strips are all scratched. We turned our keys in after the second day and had them replaced. The woman at the front desk told me to protect the card so it wouldn't get scratched. Can you imagine someone saying that to a guest? With the Sheraton, Hilton and Four Seasons in the immediate area, I will definitely opt for one of them on my next visit to Sydney.", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery happy with The Menzies!\u201d", "Author": "barrattt", "ReviewID": "UR35435612", "Content": "We stayed at the Menzies for 2 nights on a roadtrip going to Qld.

You have the option to buy a number of hours of access that you may use over the course of your stay; however, 10 hours of access will cost you $66! Now, it gets even better. For this price you would expect to be able to work and access email from your room. Maybe, maybe not. The higher your floor, the less signal strength you have. On the 11th floor, signal strength was very low and often dropped completely. Apparently, up on the 14th floor there is no coverage at all. As I already said, for the price they charge I should be able to work anywhere in the hotel without fear of being dropped. The restaurant and bar are very overpriced.

First impressions were excellent. The bellman spotted us emerging from Wynyard Station with our bags, directly across Carrington Street from the hotel, and darted across the road to help us in. The lobby was large, comfortable, and opulent, with panelling and leather sofas everywhere. Check-in was speedy and friendly. That was the peak of the Menzies experience. Our third-floor room with two double beds was large but furnished with tired, dinged fixtures. No bureau drawers, no phone book, fridge empty (although hotel literature makes reference to \"your minibar\"). Corded phone by the bed not hooked up (although a second desk phone worked). Pathetic little TV, a 13\" flat screen mounted too far from the beds for viewing; volume limited to three choices, mute, too loud, and earsplitting, and reception was poor. The view from the room was non-existent, looking out onto a \"light court\" (air shaft) that put one in mind of the correctional system. Be aware that if you are given a room in the Menzies' North Wing you have a 50% chance of ending up admiring the \"light court.\" And this after I had written in advance asking for a room with a view -- it was perhaps punishment for booking an inexpensive Expedia rate. Windows could not be opened. Room and corridor decor say 1980s throughout. HVAC worked very well. Housekeeping was erratic and oddly stingy. We were allocated one facecloth for a room capable of sleeping four; when I left a note asking for a second, the maid replied with a note of her own saying I'd have to ring the housekeeping manager and make a special request. Dirty glasses were left in place for days. Room service continental breakfast is $25, but you can nip across the street to the bakery in the foyer of the Wynyard railway station and get delicious fresh-made croissant and muffins for $1.50 apiece. Lobby bar closed inexplicably at 530pm on Saturday afternoon, just when one wants a drink. Clientele swarming the lobby was mainly backpackers and teenagers, mostly American, on coordinated youth tours, plus some airline crews on layover; not many business travelers or older people about, suggesting that The Menzies is marketing heavily to the discount trade. Checkout took about 30 minutes owing to long lines and a clerk shortage. Cannot top the location with the train across Carrington Street and The Rocks, GPO, Pitt Street shopping and Darling Harbour all less than 10 minutes away. But one can spend a little more for a somewhat nicer, more consistent service experience, and my son and I agree that's what we'll do next time.

The beds were poorly made - EVERYTHING is tucked in so that when you pull the sheet back everything comes away. Very poor lighting. I went down to request a room change and was told that that was the room I had paid for! (I prepaid 6 nights at $140/night online) If I had seen the room I would never have stayed. Swimming pool has a scum stain around the rim. Fitness facilities tired and grimy. Finally 24 hours later, I begged a room change after tracking down the Assistant Manager after 35 minutes and 3 calls to the hotel from an outside line and dealing with the automated telephone system, which then diverted to the assistant manager's mobile phone. I requested that the details of the room change NOT be mentioned to my 21 y.o. autistic son - and just to present him with the key and the new room details. He ignored my request and this caused untold discomfort to my son. Room service is hopeless! A minimum of 30 minutes delay. I requested extra towels at 9.30pm and checked with hotel operator 40 minutes because housekeeping weren't answering the phone, and was told that housekeeping had gone home before bringing me the towels. I wanted to run a bath - the plug was too small. Another 40 minute wait for housekeeping/room service. More mold. Lots more mold. By now it's very late. The TVs are very small and cannot be seen from the bed. you have to STAND in front of them. Housekeeping told me there was no clothes brush! I insisted that the concierge send someone across the road to Coles and buy one - after all it is supposed to be a 4 star hotel ... Yesterday the room clean was badly done - again. the beds were pulled up but the floor was not vacuumed, nor were the surfaces wiped. Sticky hot chocolate was still on the desk as was the cup from the night before. The mirrors in the room are still filthy. I HATE THE PLACE. I WASTED A FORTUNE ON IT! I wish i never stayed there!

The location is pretty much in the middle of everything, right next to bus and trains and about a five minute walk to circular quay and the shops on George and Pitt St. A couple of tips, the coffee across the road at the entry to Wynyard station, think the cafe was called the Frisky Goat, well worth it. Coffee was excellent (genovese beans - very good), and some lovely fresh food. There is a cool bar on the corner of Carrington and Wynyard St, it's a little expensive but pretty hip (televisions in the hand basin of the womens toilet hip).

Greeted on arrival by a very helpful concierge who took our bags before we even got indoors. We were allowed access to room an hour early, helped with sightseeing recommendations, map and more. All staff were friendly and genuinely helpful. Room was clean, value for money (standard room), lookout onto small park was nice, a little noise being beside a busy bus and train station and sirens at night but not enough to annoy. Should have remembered to ask for a room away from lift though, as recommended on here, as people can be very noisey when returning to rooms at 3am. Easy walking distance to shopping district (hotel is in business/financial sector), walk to The Rocks area, Ferry/Circular Quay, walk to Darling Harbour. We did not eat at hotel Friday night but visited the Sports Bar (open to public) on our return at 10pm which had a karaoke evening running. Saturday, breakfast was good, plenty of food. On returning to late Saturday night we asked for dinner at 10pm and although restaurant was about to close we were able to eat. The food was really good, prices high though ($35 main) with need to buy veg/salad seperately and small meals. We needed desert which made for a large dinner cost (would have been way too high without Accor Card). Big thanks to our dinner hostess (Joey) who was very friendly and helpful. Staff did not know this was a special meal (anniversary) yet we receieved wonderful service, just a little rushed but it was rather late at night. Sadly a serious problem at breakfast Sunday morning. First bite of food (poached egg with spinach) my husband bit onto something hard which was a piece of broken glass. He was shocked and scared as this could have been very serious had he swolled it or bit harder, cutting mouth or breaking a tooth etc. I approached the Host and he called out the Chef (I think) but no action was taken. The remaining similar food items were not removed from the serving table. On our checkout (queues as it was 10am but fast moving and an easy process) we complained again and asked for breakfast not to charged to our account as we had not eaten as we were both shaken by the experience. The young lady on reception accepted this well. Our bags were stored without extra charge for a few hours so we could sightsee until leaving. On return home I emailed the hotel as I felt the broken glass in egg was a serious lapse and not adequately dealt with as remaining food was not removed. I had to email a second time four days later before I received a reply which basically agreed with my statements. There was no apology. I really hope that staff were spoken to about this as we feel we were very lucky that my husband was not injured. We were flying back to N.Z that night. In all other ways we loved our stay.

Apart from the king bed there was a two seat sofa and coffee table, writing bureau and built-in wardrobe. The bathroom was large and recently renovated. One must remember this is a longstanding inner Sydney Hotel, so is not a modern construction. Refurbishment can only achieve so much. The room was very quiet and there was no extraneous noise. The breakfast buffet in the Carrington Restaurant was varied and adequate but not spectacular. The dinner menu in the Parkside Restaurant was tasty and well presented but expensive. Main meals ($35+) came with no vegetables, which are served as side dishes for a significant additional cost. Use of the attractive pool, sauna, spa and gym facilities was complimentary. We were very happy with all aspects of our stay at the Menzies. However without the benefit of the discounts associated with my Accor membership, we would have found the full cost of accommodation and dining very pricey and not good value for money. Still, on my family's experience utilising two rooms, I happily recommend the Menzies.

Hotel lobby is very nice, however I found the rest of the hotel was fairly average, what I would consider a 3 star. Our room was large but fairly plain. We had no problem with any noise from other rooms as the previous review had mentioned. The beds in our room were not very good, one felt like it was completely worn out, way too soft. There is a well equipped exercise room on the main floor,( air conditioning didn't work so it was much too hot for me) There is also a pool next door, dimly lit and no windows but if you want to swim it's there!

In line with some of the other reviewers here, the rooms probably have seen better days. The bathrooms badly need an upgrade, and the wallpaper in some rooms is fraying and needs replacing. Bedroom windows are filthy, but this is not unique to The Menzies as the city is still under water restruictions. It is evident that some upgrades are under way - rooms now feature flat screen TV's for example, and decor in the communal areas seems to be refreshed. Those minor gripes are more than liveable with. Personally, I find the beds in this hotel amongst the most comfortable of any I have slept in anywhere. The bed linen is clean and crisp, as are the towels in the bathroom. I find the staff at the hotel very friendly as well - check in and out was very efficient, bell staff were friendly and efficient (don't think I had to open the door of the hotel once, so efficient were the bell staff in ensuring they opened it for me!), and the members of the management team I encountered were extremely polite and friendly. I didn't sample the hotel restaurant on this occasion. Unless breakfast is included in the room rate, I object to the price any city centre hotel charges for breakfast - there are plenty of nearby cafes offering freshly cooked breakfasts for a fraction of the price. I did sample a few drinks from One Four, the lobby bar, and again service was good, price reasonable, and location in the lobby great for people watching. The location of this hotel is great. It's 10 minutes walk to Circular Quay, 10 minutes to Darling Harbour, and is located adjacent to Wynard bus terminal and railway station (conveniently on the airport line).

Although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve rated this property as three stars above, this is one of those times when I really wish that Trip Advisor allowed for half stars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in my mind, the Menzies was a solid three-and-a-half star hotel. As has been mentioned here many times before, the Menzies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 most appealing quality is its location. The hotel is located directly across from Wynyard Station, although we never once used the station because everything else we wanted to access within Sydney was also within walking distance of the Menzies. Circular Quay and The Rocks were only about a ten-minute walk up George Street, and the Kings Wharf area of Darling Harbour was even closer, only about three blocks away. Central Station was about a 25-minute walk for easy access to all of the suburban and intercity trains. The Menzies lobby was nicely done, and the common areas on the first floor (the restaurant and piano bar) were charming albeit a bit worn. We took a quick peek into the pool/Jacuzzi area but never used those facilities. Our room was an even-numbered room on the seventh floor of the south wing. The view was directly into the windows of an office building, as others have described. We were initially assigned an odd- numbered room on the third floor with a view across to Wynyard Station, but we relocated to a room with a single queen bed instead of two twin beds (we were going to just push the twin beds together, but they were on wheels; according to other couples with whom we spoke, we made the right choice, as the twins kept rolling apart in the middle of the night when they tried pushing them together). So for those who care about the view from your room, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest requesting an odd-numbered room! For us, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter because we spent almost no time in our room. Our room was plain but clean and of an adequate size. There was no in-room safe. The small closet included quite a few hangers, but drawer space was limited. There was a minibar in the room that proved useful for chilling some wine picked up in the Hunter Valley (a corkscrew was also provided in the room), and the small table with two chairs offered some extra space to spread out. The bathroom was somewhat small but did offer a full-size shower and a decent amount of counter and shelf space for toiletries. Of note, I understand that the north wing rooms have been renovated, so perhaps they are of a higher caliber than what we found in the south wing. I have two big complaints about our room. The first is that the air conditioning was quite ineffective. I tend to like it rather warm and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much above 70 degrees outside, and even I was a bit uncomfortable trying to sleep, so I imagine that the Menzies rooms could be quite unpleasant for someone who prefers cooler temperatures and/or who visits during the heat of summer. My other complaint pertains to the sensitivity of the smoke detectors. In multiple places throughout the room, warnings were posted that taking a shower with the bathroom door open would cause the smoke alarm to go off due to the steam. On our first night at the Menzies, we were awoken around 10:30 pm by the fire alarm (normally not a big deal, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d gone to bed at 9 pm because of jet lag!). Subsequent announcements were made that it was a false alarm. No one would tell us for sure that it had been caused by the combination of poor bathroom ventilation and overly sensitive smoke detectors, but that was the going theory\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We stayed at the Menzies as part of a package deal through Smartours, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really comment specifically as to the value of our stay. However, at $1399 per person for three nights in Tahiti, five nights in Sydney, all transfers, breakfast every morning, and roundtrip flights from LAX, I KNOW the Menzies portion of our trip cost was well below rack rates! For those considering purchasing the $30 buffet breakfast, I would suggest looking elsewhere. We ate the breakfast every morning because it was part of our package, but some of the food was not of the best quality, and the selection was limited and did not change from day to day. With the Menzies being so ideally located, there are MANY other breakfast options to choose from in the area. Internet access is available in the rooms, but I believe the charge was $12 per day. We instead opted to use the computers in the business center on the ground floor. These computers were coin-operated; cost was $2 per 15 minutes of internet access. The Menzies also offered a small alcove filled with tourist brochures. The concierge was kind enough to book a tour for us so we did not need to make the call from our room. Overall, the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. I would not hesitate to stay at the Menzies again if I found that it was part of a package that seemed like a good value.

We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly cramped, but no one would call the room and bath spacious. The room and bathroom were spotless. The bed was big enough and comfortable.

The coffee they do have, like espresso, latte and cappuccino, costs something like three to five dollars a cup and there are no free refills. The room had wireless internet, but it cost something like twenty dollars a day to use. There were about four computers on the ground floor in a separate computer room. They were coin operated and cost two dollars every fifteen minutes. The front desk cheerfully provided change when needed (I never saw a change machine in Australia). You can print for an additional per page charge. There are no nearby internet cafes that I found. I did find the internet in a convenience store several blocks away, but they were charging two dollars for fifteen minutes as well. To our surprise, there was no telephone book in the room. We like to use the yellow pages to look for restaurants, book stores, internet cafes, etc. So its absence was an inconvenience and the Menzies, Sydney was the only hotel where we stayed in Australia that did not have one. There was a telephone in the room. Sydney reminded us of New York or maybe Toronto. We always felt right at home everywhere we went in Australia. The Menzies, Sydney is on a street called Carrington, which is something like a service road for buses and taxis off of the main street of York. The hotel is across from the street from a metro light rail station. The good news is that catching a bus, train or taxi is easy there. The train station has a nice variety of carry out food and small shops, which stay open later than most of the rest of the shops in the area. The bad news is that all the buses and trains coming and going is noisy at all hours. Our room was on the eleventh floor and it still rumbled constantly with the passing underground trains and the din of passing traffic. I guess it is the price that must be paid for such a central location. The hotel is located right in downtown Sydney (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CBD\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153central business district\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, they call it). It is only a short block from George Street, which is the most important street through downtown Sydney. Our guide told us that it is the only street in Sydney, of any length, that never changes its name as it goes along. There are many nice shops in the area, but most close at 6:00 PM. The area is very much in the commercial business district and the nearby stores and restaurants cater mostly to the people who work there during the day. As a result, the nearby restaurants cater mostly to the lunch trade and not to the supper trade. In fact, little in the area close to the hotel does cater much to tourists, unlike the areas bordering the harbor. There is a Seven Eleven a few doors away from the hotel and the train station right across the street has a wealth of shops to pick up beverages, snacks and light meals. However, to my surprise, the prices in the hotel shop were actually somewhat less than the Seven Eleven, but somewhat more than in the shops in the train station across the street. The restaurants close to the hotel offered mostly a sandwich menu and, if they had tables at all, most were small, rickety and in a cramped space. We never did find a good sit down supper restaurant near the hotel. The hotel restaurant is good, but pricey. However, its prices turned out to be about what our guide book said other upscale restaurants were charging in Sydney. We ate there the first night. It was as elegant and the service was as attentive and prompt as the rest of the hotel. The food was good and was, by far, the best we ate in Sydney. However, it costs about $35 a person to eat there. Our tab for two was $68. While the Australian dollar is worth slightly less than an American dollar, by the time you pay the conversion fees, it is pretty much the same. The hotel had a breakfast buffet for $23 continental and a full hot breakfast for $29.50, which we did not try. It is not elegant dining, but you can get a hot breakfast in the train station and several other places close to the hotel in the $10 range. The breakfast restaurant we liked the best was the Caffe Capri, which was located at the head on the escalator on the far end of the Menzies Arcade. The entrance to the Menzies Arcade is right next door to the hotel. There were sit down tables and prompt, friendly table service. A delicious omelette with a choice of three ingredients and hot toast were $10.90. Predictably, they did not offer any of that \"ditch water\" American coffee. What they had was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long black\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd coffee for $2.80, which the waitress described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mild\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd espresso. I drank it, but I have to say that it was way too strong for my American taste. Taxi fares in Sydney are by meter. There is no point in asking in advance how much it costs to go somewhere, since it depends on time and traffic. The hotel is some four blocks from the Circular Quay (pronounced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Key\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). It cost about a $13 cab fare to get there. However, it not an impossible walk, since it is about a 15 minute walk back to the hotel. From the Circular Quay, you get a good view of both the ever famous Sydney Opera House and the ever famous Harbor Bridge. There are quite a few restaurants in this harbor area, that they call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Rocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That is also the place where you can catch a harbor cruise. We bought tickets to do the cruise with Matilda Cruises, which is associated somehow with Captain Cook Cruises, which has a Grey Lines Tours logo on it. I would not call Matilda a well run company. We bought the ticket at 3:00 PM and they told us the cruise would leave at 3:15. The first inkling of a problem was when the guy waiting on the bench next to us started to complain bitterly that he could not get on a boat. When the boat arrived, he did get on, muttering with loud exasperation, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153finally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When they looked at our ticket, they said our boat did not leave until 3:30. No time at all was marked on the ticket. At 3:30 a boat pulled in, sat there for a few minutes and then pulled out without picking up anyone. I went back to the Matilda ticket booth. The lady on duty looked at my ticket and said it was for the next day (no date was marked on it either) and could we come back tomorrow, which made me wonder why they had sold it to us. When I said we could not, she reluctantly wrote on the ticket that we could use it at 4:30 that afternoon, on a boat that would arrive at 4:15. The boat had not arrived at 4:30. So I went back to the Matilda ticket boot, which had closed. However, it had a sign to go to the nearby Captain Cook ticket booth. The lady there said the boat was just running late. It arrived about 4:40. However, when we went to board, the person taking the tickets started telling us that we needed to take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the next boat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I pointed out to him that our ticket specifically said it was for 4:30. After much discussion, he finally let us on with great reluctance and scowling. After all that, I have to say that we were very disappointed with the cruise. The boat was filthy. The windows were so salt covered and dirty that you could hardly see out through the glare on the salt and dirt coating. The sun was so low in the sky by that time in the late afternoon, that we could not see out of one side of the boat, even had those filthy windows on that side been spotless. The really scary thing, however, was that the announcer said over and over again on that trip that it was the last trip of the day, which made us wonder which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153next boat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they had tried to make us wait for. I have to say that other people did get on that boat with no problem, so it is a mystery to me why some people would have so many problems while others did not. Check out time Menzies, Sydney is officially 10:30, but they readily agreed to let us stay till noon at no charge, which was a great convenience. We greatly appreciated that. Of course, no hotel is perfect. So, despite our various quibbles about its shortcomings, we did enjoy our stay at the Menzies, Sydney very much and would gladly stay there again.

And a 10-15 minute walk the other way to Darling Harbour to watch the sunset and eat fresh seafood - but beware, this is expensive, even compared to London prices.

Unfortunately for us, the Menzies was the closest hotel to where we needed to go.

Surprised at the cheap rates for a 4 star hotel, the surprise was all ours when we saw our free upgrade to the 'Connor Suite' on the 14th floor. It was like stepping into a time machine and stepping out in 1971! We went back down to ask if there was anything else available and upon seeing our alternatives, we decided to stick with what we'd been given. The room was dated and grubby. Upon examining the 'kitchenette' I found rubbish placed in the cupboards, obviously too high for housekeeping to see or reach. The carpet was tatty, the walls grubby. The curtains needed washing and as this was a non smoking room, had a number of cigarette burns in them...perhaps a sign of when they last were cleaned. Our son required a roll away bed and after heading out we returned to find it...tattered and torn on one corner. One t.v required a technician to recieve a decent picture, and our king sized bed was fitted with a the bead head of a double bed. The view from the room was over a dingy park where I watched drunks and homeless people settle down for the evening. The hotel's restaurant, touted as something special was nothing more than average. Our garlic bread arrived without garlic, my $35 lamb rack, tough and chewy. The wine list however was good. Than goodness our Accor card got us 33% off the $200 bill (for 2 adults and one child)! The next morning saw us at the buffet breakfast. It was o.k and whilst the staff were pleasant, they could have spent more time cleaning the mess the last people who sat at our table left on the seats. When checking out, we were asked how we'd enjoyed our meal the night before. Our lack of excitement was met with stoney silence.

I booked this from the lastminute.com website as it was a \"secret\" 4* hotel in central Sydney at AUD99 a night. The location is definitely fantastic, right opposite Wynyard Station, two blocks from Pitt St and about a ten minute walk to Circular Quay and the Rocks. The reception area is certainly wonderful as are all the other public areas (except for Sporters Bar - if you hate karaoke don't go there!). The staff are also fantastic. Everyone had a smile on their faces and nothing was too much trouble. Once you go up to your floor though the scenery changes a bit! The hallways are very drab and in desparate need of a paint. Our first room was a queen bedded room on the back of the building so the view was of an office building. If you were staying on your own for a couple of nights it would have been quite okay. However there was nothing to put your bag on so we put everything on the floor and with two big suitcases it certainly cut down the room. My husband quickly decided this wasn't going to be the room for us and went down to reception and for $20 a night we were upgraded to a room on the front of the building with a king size bed. This room was a little bit bigger but still very tired looking with dinged furniture and a grey trim everywhere. There are two chairs in the room, one for the desk and the other a very uncomfortable bucket chair. So, sitting on the bed was the most comfortable option and I'm really not a fan of that. The bathroom was very small and if you are over six foot be prepared to not be able to stand up properly in the shower/bath as the roof is lower over that part of the room. I guess it was functional though. The air-conditioning was a disaster. It just didn't seem to work at all and we ended up switching it off and opening the window. Luckily it wasn't too noisy outside as it was a weekend. I don't know if I would be able to cope with being there in summer. We did have breakfast at the hotel one morning. It was AUD29.50 for a full buffet which had a great selection. Down at Circular Quay there are quite a few restaurants that do breakfast in the morning.

It's right in the middle of everything you need. Located across the street from Wynard Station, it's a quick trip 12 minutes by train to and from the airport. On George Street one block behind the hotel, you'll find an American Express Foreign Exchange Office where if you're an AmEx card holder, you can write personal checks and cash them in to the local currency with no commission charge. If you can figure it out, you can walk via the passage way from the hotel to George street. Located in the Wynard Station on the 2nd level you'll find a supermarket. On the 2nd & 3rd floor of Wynyard station you'll also find numerous pastry shops where you can pick something up for breakfast, or perhaps something for a picnic. On the 1st or bottom floor, you'll find starbucks, Hungry Jack (aka Burger King) or Mc Donalds. Back to the hotel. The room itself was efficient. I used all the space that was available. Since I was in Sydney for a week, I contacted the front desk to have them remove the contents of the mini bar so I could fill it with stuff from the supermarket next door. I picked up a 5 Gal jug of water. Unfortunately upon departure, I think the hotel charged me for the contents of the Minibar, which is why a charge of 137AUD showed up. I'm trying to resolve that now. The air conditioning in the room works well. While it's not a strong flow, it's constant. So if you leave it on, eventually it will get cool on a hot day, even hilly at night. I think that Australians have a better sense of energy efficiency then in the US. The bathroom takes a little getting use to, especially the placement and size of the toilet (look for the button on the wall to flush), and the lack of a full shower door. Water temperature, pressure and control are all fine. There are multiple restaurants located in the hotel, but did you really fly more then 10 hours just to eat in the hotel? Get out there and find some great restaurants they do exists, and are only a short walk away. Our room was facing the bus stop, Wynyard station and on a low floor, but it was very quite at night.

The location of the hotel is superb (right on the edge of The Rocks / CBD) and we comfortably walked from here to just about everywhere (pubs in The Rocks area, ferries at the Circular Quay, restaurants in Darling Harbour). Conveniently, the Wynyard train station is literally at the doorstep of the hotel. We took a direct rail link to the airport (only 17 minutes from this station) and it couldn't have been easier (We definitely recommend this - no traffic to contend with and there is regular train service.) As a bonus, the Wynyard station has a small underground shopping mall, including a Cole's grocery store where we were able to purchase drinks and snacks. Of course, there are also plenty of other convenient coffee shops, etc. right up on the ground level. You can cut through an arcade next to the hotel and right onto George Street, a main thoroughfare. Our room, labeled a \"Deluxe Executive\" room was on the 11th floor of the hotel with a view of Wynyard Park far below. The bathroom was a little bit dated with occasionally noisy pipes, but still nice - a marble vanity with plenty of space to spread our toiletries out. The room was spacious and included a flat-screen TV and an arm chair & ottoman. The bed was heavenly - the best bed we had during our stay in Australia - perfect for sleeping away the jet lag. During our stay we took a dip in the indoor hotel pool and spa one night and enjoyed this. Its a small indoor pool, but for an inner-city hotel we thought it was a great addition. There is also a sauna. The check-in staff were friendly and helpful with maps and information as well as the concierge (a rotating staff of concierges were available during our stay). The concierge accepted our bags from Qantas (they arrived the day after we did) and had them placed in our room while we were out touring. One of the concierges also booked a Hunter Valley wine tour for us.

There were also coffee/tea making facilities and a minibar, although i had to request for the latter to be re-stocked when I used anything. Overall impression is that the hotel is a bit \"tired\" although the public/communal areas are generally well-maintained. On the plus side: - I have to agree with other reviewers in that the position is great, particularaly if you're travelling on business and want to take advantage of limited opportunities to explore some of Sydney. - Lots of local shops, bars, restaurants. However, please note that this part of town, in my experience, largely closes down on Saturday and Sunday. In that case you will have a ten or fifteen minute walk to find eating and drinking. - The first floor cocktail bar has live entertainment on Thurs/Fri every week. - Compared to hotels in many other countries, it did seem to offer accommodation that is good value for money. On the not-so-good side: - Staff were patchy. The person serving me at check-in (I admit I'm not after my best after a 24 hour flight) was less than welcoming and even off-hand. However, most other staff couldn't have been more helpful. - Lots of large tourist coach parties coming and going during the week. These seemed to be either school children or senior citizens. The real problem with this is that they all descend for breakfast at the same time, so you can have trouble getting a seat. It also seemed to me that the school parties were all booked onto the same floor, which I could imagine could be noisy if you happen to be on the floor below (I wasn't, so can't speak with authority on this). - Limited choice of TV channels - You need a wireless-capable laptop to access the internet from your room. - The bar is very expensive, although, unlike some other reviewers, I did not think that the full breakfast was untoward. - The interconnecting doors between rooms are not well sound-insulated. Even when people were talking at a normal level, it was quite possible to hear next door's conversation in my room. If their TV was turned up loud, then it was really distracting. This is not ideal if you are jet-lagged nor, I would imagine, is it something that you would want if travelling with your partner. - The city council decided to dig up the road a block or so from the hotel. What's the problem with that? Nothing in principle, but they started sometime around one o'clock in the morning for two consecutive days. Overall, it was a pretty average stay.
