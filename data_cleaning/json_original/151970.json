A true rarity in Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "ViajeroIndiana", "ReviewID": "UR128240193", "Content": "Though many people come to Puerto Rico (and with good reason) to enjoy the island's beautiful beaches, to meander through the cobblestone streets of Old San Juan, and to enjoy the great shopping, food, and nightlife, they often forego the option of a relaxing mountain retreat. This is unfortunate because Puerto Rico is, above all, a mountainous island, and some of the most beautiful towns and most breathtaking scenery can be found in the island's interior and along its winding rural byways. I have been going to Puerto Rico at least two time per year for more than 15 years and have spent many unforgettable days in the mountains -- driving (often getting lost), hiking, visiting small towns, touring coffee plantations, etc. However, until this year I had never really enjoyed a Puerto Rican mountain retreat -- that is, I hadn't gone to the mountains with the expressed purpose of doing nothing but relaxing. It was with this in mind that my wife and I decided to spend two nights at Casa Grande with out two children (ages 9 and 6) a couple of months ago. What a great experience. I agree with those who have noted that this amazing place is a bit hard to find, but if you follow the advice of the hotel staff and many of the reviewers on Trip Advisor and head out with plenty of time and an adventurous spirit, the trip there will be very rewarding. Take your time and don't stress out if you get a bit lost. You'll find it. Also, if you do your homework and ask for detailed directions, you should have no problem getting there from either San Juan or Ponce . . . from Utuado it is really quite easy, and the roads are not nearly as bad as some reviewers claim. Now, if you try to come at night or during a torrential downpour, expect a rather unpleasant and difficult journey. The rooms at Casa Grande are simple, but extremely clean and quite spacious (see my pics). We stayed in room 11 and room 12 was unoccupied so we really enjoyed having a double balcony, so to speak. The balconies with hammocks and chairs are perfect places to sit and read a book, have a glass of wine, or to simply listen to the sounds of nature. The grounds are meticulously kept and are great fun for the kids to explore. Don't forget to bring a flashlight so you can find cuoquis (those cute little Puerto Rican frogs that you hear all the time but almost never see) nestled among the exuberant tropical vegetation. We also really loved the pool and spent a good amount of time sitting there and reading while our kids enjoyed a dip in the chilly water. The views from most of the rooms and all of the Hotel's common areas (especially the pool) are really quite incredible, so if you forget to bring a book, you can just stare off into the distance and breath in the fresh mountain air. I loved the fact that the rooms had no TVs. On the one hand this really cuts down on noise, but on the other it encourages guests to stay outside or to just relax -- something that most of us don't do enough these days. We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experiences: two dinners and two breakfasts. Even though the service was a bit slow, as some of the more negative reviewers are quick to point out, this is not at all unusual in the Caribbean (and I don't mean this in a derogatory way). It is actually something I have grown to appreciate quite a bit. You are in the mountains and have nothing to do but relax . . . what's the big rush!? And besides, the food was very good over all and excellent in some cases, and always well worth the wait. Dining on the terrace at night with the impossibly clear, star-filled sky was just amazing, and eating breakfast there was truly delightful. Get up early and sit down before the sun comes over the mountains -- sip your coffee and enjoy nature at its finest: a cacophony of tropical birds, tree frogs, roosters, etc. announces the coming of every new day. Casa Grande is a bit out of the way, to be sure, but its relative isolation adds so much to the place's charm. In any case, if you do want to use it as a base for your adventures, you can get almost anywhere on the island in a couple of hours, and there are many places much closer that are totally worth visiting. Just ask the hotel staff for suggestions. When I return (and I hope it is soon) I will do what I did last time -- sit around and relax.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat retreat, dificult to get there.\u201d", "Author": "eldavid51", "ReviewID": "UR127896552", "Content": "Great place.

I have to qualify my statements, however, by saying that I did not do enough research on the location. If you are the type of traveler who is content to stay on site and enjoy what the retreat has prepared for you then this is for you. If not, I would consider shortening my stay. My husband and I would probably have been happy with a one-night stay because we couldn't get anywhere during the day. We like to explore and sightsee but Puerto Rico's mountain roads are not exactly reliable; some come to an end for construction after you've been driving on them for 20 minutes and there is no detour.

I have mixed feeling about our stay at Case Grande Mountain Retreat. The view from the main building is truly amazing. It's a lush mountain side facing you. Early in the morning as the sun rises and starts to crest the mountain, the sunlight begins to bath certain spots on the mountain side making for a great scene! That is truly a nice experience! The food in the main dining area was better than anticipated, fairly priced and portions were good. No one went to bed hungry. Especially if you order one of their rice dishes such as Chicken and rice. The dining on the patio of the main building was also relaxing and enjoyable. The wait staff was also very nice and aimed to please. The food and staff really made our stay more enjoyable. The other positive point I want to share is that at night there was a very nice breeze that create a wonderful sound in the surrounding trees and helped cool the room that made for good sleep. So why only 3 stars?? The rooms are REALLY basic, the location is WAY OUT of the way, and location didn't support tourists well. Let's start with the room. It was very basic and furniture and beds were simple low-end pieces. The lighting in the room was a simple bare bulb and a second reading light over one of the beds. The walls are rather thin and you CAN HEAR your neighboring guests quite clearly. So if you can hear them...they can hear you. We were fortunate that the visitors around us were generally quiet. But it was uncomfortable to hear them going to the bathroom. The cost to stay here was over $130 a night, that's not cheap. In my opinion, it's too much for the accommodations. There are no added amenities for that room rate either. Yoga is offered every morning and taught by the owner of the location. But at an added cost of $12 a class per person. I think it should be included in the room rate and not an added cost. There is no gym, if you chose not to take the morning class. There is an outdoor pool, that is billed as a \"fresh water pool\" . It's roughly 30'x15' and rather deep on one end at 8'. But it's heavily chlorinated. So not sure about the whole \"fresh water\" pitch. The location is a SOLID 45 minute drive AFTER you get off the main highway (26). It's a narrow, local mountain road and a good part of it is WHITE KNUCKLE driving as locals scream down the mountain and around blind corners in the middle of the road!! So if you are coming from San Juan, it's a solid 2.5 to 3 hour drive EACH WAY. The last portion of the drive had us wondering if we were lost and worrying what had we gotten ourselves into. The roads are not well maintained and hitting one of the many huge pothole could easily happen and would put a real damper on your vacation. If you are coming from Aquadilla, it's a short ride but a fair amount of stop and go lights before you get to the highway portion and THEN the 45 minute daredevil climb up the mountain road. The Casa Grande Mountain Retreat is also not isolated. It's neighbors are lower income homes nested on the sides of the mountain. So you see a fair amount of poverty on the drive up. The other real issue that I did read here but couldn't quite comprehend is that the road that takes you to Casa Grande continues just below the resort and about a 3 miles up ahead is some sort of water plant. Early each morning, large trucks would rumble by and constantly honk their horns as they drove by. It was rather noisy and disruptive. Definitely broke the calm of the night. My guess is the drive honks as he may be approaching a blind bend in the road and letting oncoming cars, pedestrians know he was there. Believe me, they don't slow down. They fly up and down these road like Rally car drivers and will ride you tail. Not fun! To take full advantage of the area, you need to hire an adventure guide. You need to plan that prior to your arrival. We looked into a few and found that they wanted $109 for a 4 hour tour that included zip-lines and repelling and some kayaking. It was a bit high for us as we had done these activities already outside of San Juan and also on a recent trip to Costa Rica. So we just wanted to hike on our own. There's a short trail that starts on the property. It's a short 20 minute loop. It's decent and enjoyable. The office person told us of another more difficult trail down the road. We couldn't find it. The trail wasn't marked as \"a trail\" but by a \"thrown-out couch\" which we missed. So outside of the pool, the morning Yoga class and the short trail, there's not a whole lot to do on the property. One of their staff leads a 3 hour hike for $25 a person but you need to book it at least a day in advance. We missed on that as we first tried to hike on our own ans when we realized that we could find the trails, the staff person was committed for the day. Understandable but a bummer. The bottom line for my family and me was as we drove away we all felt it was generally pleasant, very basic and the food was good but too far out of the way from the rest of the island's destinations. We all agreed a similar experience with better hiking and more food options are available near or by El Yunque Rainforest, much closer to San Juan and Luquillo Beaches. The Case Grande Retreat is the idea of transplanted retired New Yorker looking to have a place he can draw an income from, do something he enjoys (Yoga) and sustain a certain lifestyle without out of pocket expense. I think we'd all like to do something like that. Clearly the location gives a few locals an income and may draw tourist dollars to the area that would otherwise never get anywhere near here. So if you are looking to relax, get away from the heavily congested tourist and city destinations, don't like the ocean, like to drive twisty mountain roads like a rally car driver and want to travel the road 'less traveled'...this may be a place you'll enjoy. We will not do it again on a return trip to Puerto Rico and would tell our friends, \"It's OK but not worth the drive.\"", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Keerbergen, Belgium", "Title": "\u201caway from it all\u201d", "Author": "Travelman-Tx", "ReviewID": "UR126234665", "Content": "Simple rooms without TV or phone but with a concert of wild animals at night, in an incredible green scenery.

The little houses are situated in a very calm and beautiful area, very far away from everything.

If you like to take a rest for a while this hotel is your thing. Please note that for the nearest town, Utuado, you will have to drive 30 minutes. Therefore Casa Grande is not a good base for exploring Puerto Rico. You will have to drive a long time time to get out of the mountains (I went to Ponce and St German, very nice but I had to drive a long time). The resort is difficult to find. I am good in navigation but for the first time in my life I had to ask the way. The route is explained very clearly on the site of the hotel but due to the long distances I was sometimes in doubt whether I was on the right road or not. Take the first exit to Utuado, after the Mc Donalds turn left, this is road 111. Follow this road for a long time and take road 140 (along the lake), after road 613 continue straight on, after a while you will have the turn 612. The only comment I have about the resort is that the staff of the restaurant and reception (there was a angry guest when I arrived) are laid back. Every night I had to ask for my drink twice and the waitresses are not very interested in taking your order. It irritated more guests as I heard others speaking about it.

The property was immaculate and beautifully designed, the landscaping exceptional with many varieties of plants identified, the pool sparkling clean (see my photos) and delicious to swim in. At the main house, the dining area, small bar, large veranda for dining or relaxing and an open patio for same were lovely with marvelous views of the mountain greenery. There are several multi-unit chalets on the property designed with admirable simplicity. Our room faced the pool, had a little porch with a hammock, was clean, comfortable and sufficiently equipped. The breakfast and dinner offerings were of good wholesome quality with meats, seafoods, vegetarian choices, fresh fruits and vegetables. I think it is not a place for people like sunsetkeysusie who need infinity pools, hot tubs, etc., but a good place for people of the more contemplative sort. There is an early morning yoga session, trails for walks in the woods, pleasant areas for reading, writing, conversing, bird-watching. The twisting mountain road one must travel to get there just adds to the aerie-like feeling of lofty seclusion. It is true that a nearby road with infrequently passing traffic detracts from that. It is also true that the walls are thin, but once you understand that voices are lowered and there was a general feeling of respect.

You can sit out on the balcony or hang in a hammock, you can sit in the common eating area, or lounge by the pool. In the afternoon the clouds come over the mountain and you can watch and listen to the rain fall. The cons: being that it's on a mountain side, you can hear all manner of noise from any nearby housing, and also from the few cars going up and down the road. Wednesday night is evangelical night, so we were subjected to loud speaker preaching and hallelulia singing for quite a while as the car with the mounted speakers made its way up the mountain. This was not very retreat-like. The sounds of nature were few and far between; no symphony of coquis here. We were fortunate to not have neighbors in our cabin, but it was obvious that sound carries easily from one guest accommodation to another. The trek from the car is up some steep steps which is hard for less mobile guests. The worst part is the remoteness of the place in terms of not having food choices. The restaurant there was great, and the chef really good, and I'm glad because there was no where else to eat! They only served breakfast and dinner, so you really needed to have your own food for lunch. I found this inconvenient if you didn't want to make the trek all the way to Utuado. I think we were hard up because it was holiday week and places were closed. No meals were included in the price. I didn't find Casa Grande idyllic enough for the inconvenience of the location.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naperville, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cVery Relaxing\u201d", "Author": "KatieTravels89", "ReviewID": "UR122620402", "Content": "We recently stayed here as part of a trip around Puerto Rico.

Waking up every morning to a view of the clouds rolling over the mountains like a magnificent waterfall was one of the most sublime experiences I have ever had, and I have traveled the world. The gorgeously landscaped grounds are stunning and, at the time we were there, the orange trees around the property were dripping with fruit. The salt water pool is such a wonderful change from over-chlorinated pools at other resorts which I have visited and it was a refreshing treat in the hot afternoons. Chef Mike created truly delicious meals that were saturated with flavour, made with the freshest of ingredients, and are very healthy to boot. It was a wonderful culinary experience that enhanced the surroundings even more. The accommodations are simple and basic, so if you are used to high-end, five star spots and are not comfortable with anything less, this is not the place for you.

We chose to schedule meals after they had left due to noise level. The privacy and solitude that is advertised is severely tempered by the proximity of neighbors. Thin walls allowed us to hear clear snoring, coughing, velcro opening, and other things we really didn't want to know about.

Table clothes on the table, proper napkins, flowers and descent cutlery would not go a miss. A choice of vegetables and a more professional approach is recommended. Let's hope the proprietor reads this so I can see some changes at my next visit.

The wonderful hum of the coqui was frequently drowned out with the popping springs on our horribly uncomfortable mattress and the noises of snoring through the flimsy walls that separated us from the room adjacent to ours. The next morning was no better- frigid showers, overpriced breakfasts, and approximately 4 hours of jack hammering at the freshwater pool. When asked where we could explore off the resort, the resort owner's only advice was to pay an additional sum to get a guided tour of the area. Sadly, while the resort has the makings of greatness (the staff, the pool, the mountains, the well labeled flora and nature trail), it falls far short of expectations.

However, he was extremely helpful in getting us there that night and we kept in touch every 20 minutes so that he knew if we were on the right track. Because it was dark I made a few errors in driving, but the owner was patient and got us there safely. I really appreciated this. The next day, we woke up to the sounds of the coquis, some roosters and the sound of some cars traveling past the inn. The sound of cars did not bother me much, maybe because I was too busy gazing out the window in awe of my surroundings. Since we did not see much of the landscape the night before, this view was an amazing thing to wake up to. It had finished raining and the sun was shining. We decided to check out the menu in the cafe. I ordered the vegan breakfast with \"eggs\" and potato, which was delicious. My mom ordered the yogurt parfait, and we shared the fresh fruit platter, which was mouthwatering. We then drove south for the day in search of the beach at Guanica. The trip was a little longer than expected, but definitely worth it. However, if I were to go back to la Casa, I would plan to stay at the inn without leaving for a few days as this is a perfect place for solid, healthy relaxation. Upon returning to the inn that night, we spent some time at the cafe having a drink and reading. Our sleep experience was very comfortable. We did need to use repellant and did wake up with some bites, but this is to be expected in a more rustic inn. Our room was very clean and simple (just what we wanted) with a ceiling fan.

That's the best way to describe our stay. My husband and I stayed here for two nights on our honeymoon across PR. This was definitely a highlight. I gave it a 5 based on MY experience. The hotel would be considered a 3 to real US standards set by the hospitality industry, not hotel website standards The drive there is nowhere near as bad as I've read here. Yes they are windy but I've seen worse in PR. It's a beautiful drive, enjoy the sites along the way. Tip though, if you put in the address you can find it, but you need to leave out the KM marker. You take the 10, then to the 111 to 111R and 111 again. If you stay on the one 111 it turns into some rural streets, so go with the R. Then it's the 140 I believe and the 162, which you can't miss. Best bet is follow the directions from the hotel but keep a map handy. We arrived slightly before check in and were given a room early. We were in room #3. The view was ok, you could see the mountains from the hammock. The views throughout the property are absolutely beautiful. Our room was very nice. No ac, no tv, no clock - perfect! It is very humid in this area. Luckily we packed all our clothes in plastic ziplock bags so we always had a fresh outfit to wear. At night it is cool so there is no need for AC. My husband is always warm and even he was fine. The fan is right above the bed. There are screens on the windows too, so no creepy crawlers. I miss falling asleep to the sound of the coqui. As for 'thin walls'... not really. I think what people hear is just the noise from outside. Windows are open all the time in all rooms so you hear the other rooms. I was sort of able to hear house cleaners cleaning the bathroom backing onto ours but noticed most of the sound was amplified by the window. The food here... I can't even write something good enough! Absolutely everything was beyond expectations. The only thing I would have not ordered was the greek salad. It was fine, but it wasn't a greek salad and when you taste the other food, its nothing special in comparison. It's very reasonably priced too. There is WiFi at the restaurant, and a book share by the cute bar. I can't describe how much we loved this place.

It is tucked away up in the mountains. Getting to it is a challenge but if you simply follow the provided directions and stick to it you will be fine. We have driven to other similar resorts in S. America and have had worse driving experiences so no complaints on that score. We had also visited the Arecibo Observatory before coming to the hotel so we had to improvise with help from the locals and it still worked out okay. I had my first jarring experience as I checked in as I observed the person at the registration treat two other quests very rudely. This happened in the first 10 minutes of arriving and I never quite got over that sour experience. I think the employee's name is Carmen and was rude unintentionally because her style is naturally gruff. The rooms are basic but adequate. Each room has a balcony with a hammock. There are 2 rooms per cabin and noise travels easily between the walls. Rooms closer to the road are exposed to sounds from the passing traffic (which are surprisingly frequent for the supposedly secluded location). We were in room 19 and the first night the noise of the traffic was non-stop, with the headlights arcing in our room....this being a \"mountain retreat\" we did not think that our room would be so close to the street. When I asked to be moved, they said they did not have any open rooms, although I did see some unoccupied units. Oh, and the water in the shower is always lukewarm, this being OK if the weather is mild, but when we were there there were heavy downpours and and a hot shower would've helped! There is a small sized pool which was good to use. The food is alright but I would recommend you have your meals outside at smaller local eateries where you get more authentic local food and much better prices. But you will need to plan your day because you don't want to be going in/out too often. We suffered from mosquito bites on most evenings and had to use mosquito repellent often. The owner and staff are friendly and helpful. But I got the distinct sense that they were understaffed and could use more help. It is a small operation and can become inefficient quickly. When I needed extra towels I got them by hunting down anyone..a waiter or the registration person but when I needed it most (on a day of heavy rain) they were inexplicably out of extra towels due to apparent laundry problems. A big downside is their driveway up to the registration which you may need to use at least once or maybe twice to unload/load (especially useful in inclement weather). The parking lot is at street level. But this driveway up to the hotel is very narrow and can only accommodate one car at a time. Our first time up, we encountered another car coming down and we had to back out all the way to let them pass. A simple system to alert someone that there is a car already in the road would be helpful. There was also an air of condescension in the tone of the owner/employees if you asked them a question about activities. It seemed like they looked down on people who did not come there to \"simply relax\" or do yoga. The ideal visitor to this retreat is a couple in grunge attire who carry a glazed and distant look and can sit around all day doing nothing :-) (not that it is a bad thing, just saying). We passed by some other local accommodations including cabins by the lake that I thought would be much more fun, interesting to stay at and get in/out of. Parador Villas Sotomayor in Adjuntas is also an interesting place to stay or to visit for horseback riding. Downtown Adjuntas is worth a short visit. I am not adding any comments about weather or road conditions that the retreat has no control over but they can detract from the experience. I would say that overall I felt that it was a good relaxing experience but this place seemed to highly over-rated by clever marketing (as evidenced by all the articles and certificates posted in the tiny registration area). Perhaps over time, some of the kinks can be worked out to make it a more interesting experience (though not for me).", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York, USA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful, rustic mountain lodge\u201d", "Author": "TravelGuru1000", "ReviewID": "UR91154614", "Content": "Casa Grande is located in a beautiful mountainous area in Central Puerto Rico.

This was a lucky accident on our part. The retreat is off the beaten path and in a remote location but, we were able to find it. It provided us reasonably easy access to the places and things we wanted to see. It's hard to describe the surroundings of Casa Grande because it seems almost dream-like in it's serenity. Most people couldn't fathom living (or staying) in this kind of setting. You are literally tucked away in the mountains, with wild grapefruits, bananas and yucca growing outside your cabin door. When you wake up in the morning and watch sunrise, you witness a dreamscape emerge from the mountains as the morning fog burns off by the heat of the sun. The lodgings are rustic yet clean and well maintained. The shower was hot and refreshing. There is no air conditioning, this refers to their green thinking. I actually didn't miss the air conditioning, powerful fans cool the room enough to be comfortable. My only request for the lodging would be for the fans to be adjustable, they were all or nothing. The food was delicious. I will say that twice. The food was delicious. All meals are served family style, this can be a somewhat unforgiving way to serve food, especially if you are a foodie. It does not present the food in it's best light but, I still thoroughly enjoyed the cuisine. I got to experience local cuisines that were either new to me or presented in an unfamiliar or new style. For the most part the dishes were savory, well thought out, well prepared and flavorful. Local fruits and vegetables were incorporated into each dish. Simple old standards (like oatmeal) were prepared in a way or with ingredients that made them sing. Vegetarian options were available with each meal, some breakfasts did not include meat options. Though I eat meat, this is fine. Overall the Casa Grande Mountain Retreat was a terrific place to stay. I would certainly go back and stay with them again.

Rooms have no luxuries; certainly no TV, A/C (not needed, really), nor radio, but are tidy and nice, with hot water and ceiling fan. Birds serve as your alarm in the mornings,--which can be a little chilly-- and coquis serenade you at night. Breakfast was great and so was dinner.

We were personally served by chef Mike Mahon, who was very nice and attentive. Yes, the walls in the rooms are thin and you can hear your neighbors or people outside... but hey, the rooms ARE made to resemble local countryside wooden cottages. Fortunately, guests were very considered and kept the noise levels down...something the staff also reinforces. The pool is small, but also kept very clean, and the water was refreshing; not too cold as locals would expect. Indeed there is not much to do other than RELAX during your stay here.

You can do yoga in the mornings (optional), walk around the paths, or adventure out and get to know the local kiosks (chinchorros) and eat some local food or fritters and turnovers.

For each and every visit we continue to be entranced by the natural and peaceful beauty of our surroundings and warmly embraced by the lovely team at Casa Grande. Casa Grande is simple and rustic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a place that easily transports guests away from the hustle and bustle of urban life. On our first visit the lack of a/c, tv, radio and phone in the rooms made me wonder what the accommodations would be like, but after the first night, we instantly fell in love with the peace and tranquillity that Casa Grande offers, in part due to the absence of those very same modern-day intrusions mentioned before (although for those who have lap tops wireless internet access is now available at the restaurant). The clean, simple, functional wooden cabins provide guests with a cosy, peaceful haven, each with a private balcony which makes bird watching an easy past time to enjoy at this location. The private bathrooms are clean, fully functioning with great hot & cold water pressure and efficiently outfitted with fixtures that contribute to their eco-friendly status. The landscaping is filled with carefully nurtured mountain-side gardens and fruit trees, complete with a reflection water feature near the main building and its own waterfall (in the rainy season). The property is thoughtfully dotted with wooden benches for quiet respite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all created under the guidance of owner/operator Steve Weingarten. It is the landscaping of the property which blends naturally into it surroundings that contributes greatly to the tranquillity and peacefulness that guests can escape to. Casa Grande continues to evolve in a most beautiful, thoughtful and serene manner and the latest development that adds positively to our experience is the addition of Chef Mike to the Casa Grande team. What a coup! The cuisine at Casa Grande\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Restaurant cannot be topped anywhere close in the region. The menu is a wonderful blend of new and local cuisine with superb attention to flavour and even a dash of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchealthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in preparation which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t detract from the finish. On previous visits we would consider discovering new places to eat as part of exploring the countryside, but with Chef Mike, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a delight to return to Casa Grande at the end of a day for a wonderfully prepared meal. Both the Chicken Florentine and Churrasco were the best we ever had \u00e2\u20ac\u201c way to go Chef Mike, Ilia prepared a lovely dinner for us. Breakfast is equally delightful with such creations as coconut pancakes and open-faced spinach & home made cheese omelettes.

From the wind through the valley, the broad wings of fern trees rose and fell. A mile down the road, a colony of white egrets was embedded in the thickly grown trees on the far side of the river.

Open to the hills that rise up around it, the location is filled with constantly changing light from sunrise to nightfall... Night, especially after rain, is a whole fabric of sounds, crickets and tiny frogs (coquies). Bats clear the night air of insects, and I discovered island fireflies that do not flash, but stay lit... And yes, there are tiny lizards that pause and scoot past outside, as you enter or leave your cabin.

The grounds are beautiful and serene, and we were so excited for our night's stay there. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there. Our cabin was relatively bare, and I suppose we should have read the website closer because we were rather dismayed to find that all rooms are cooled only by ceiling fans and the mountain breeze. Also, because the resort's m.o. is a place to unplug and getaway, there are no televisions and also no internet. Not a deal-breaker, but just want to give everyone a fair warning about what you'll be getting. Every cabin has it's own deck with a hammock, which is very appealing, but unfortunately relatively useless during mosquito season as we were ravaged by bugs as soon as we stepped outside. We found we could also not keep our shutters open on our windows because several of them had rather large holes in the screens so mosquitos kept getting into our cabin. So, unfortunately, we weren't able to profit from any mountain breezes and because the power kept going out during the night, our overhead fan would intermittently stop working which meant our room was rather humid and unpleasant. We tried to read, but the lights appeared to attract more bugs, because along with the mosquitos, we kept finding many other bugs crawling over our sheets while the lights were on. Moreover, if you're not really into nature, this just isn't the place for you because several lizards crept into our room under the door and camped out with us during the night. There is also a main road right beneath the retreat which several noisy trucks drive by on, so don't expect a night that is punctuated solely by the sounds of wildlife. All in all, this didn't provide for a restful, relaxing night of sleep! We also had the misfortune of visiting the retreat while a large group on a yoga retreat were there. This meant there wasn't much privacy, and we were placed next to a noisy family that we could hear well into the night (and who didn't realize they didn't need to slam their door every time they left their cabin). Normally we wouldn't be bothered by a large group being at the resort, but unfortunately this impacted the menu at the restaurant that evening. We were offered the vegetarian buffet with the option of a side-portion of meat which we decided to do since dining options aren't abundant in that area. This was a mistake. The buffet was TERRIBLE. It consisted of a gluey tortilla soup (black bean with soggy tortilla strips in it), a green salad, falafel, and white rice, plus cake made from a boxed-mix for dessert. Insipid at best (and by far the worst food we ate while in Puerto Rico), the true insult came when we wound up paying $40 (for two people) for this meal. If you do stay here, do yourself a favor and eat anywhere else! As others have mentioned, the staff didn't feel very welcoming, and didn't really offer us any suggestions of attractions or activities to take part in while in the area. We left feeling like we had paid an awful lot of money for an ok view (the views must be better if you get a cabin higher up the mountain), but not much else. It was kind of like camping in a wooden tent, which may be what some crave but didn't do it for us and we really felt we didn't get an experience worth what we paid. Perhaps if you went during a time when it wasn't quite so hot and buggy you would better enjoy yourself, but for us, this was the low point of our time in Puerto Rico.

When we climbed down again to the reception area, he was horrified and apolgetic, and then sent us (climbing further) to an isolated room at the back end (peaceful). There was a dead, decomposing lizard on the bed. We had to go back to the reception and get new bedding. He offered to move us AGAIN but we were already unpacked. A different guest, who became our friend, thought the owner was downright surly, but I wouldn't go that far. The dinner food was good, except, there at the ecolodge, they had none of their salads available. I could have chosen tofu for a vegetarian dish. Had kebobs instead. In the morning breakfast isn't served until 8 am (impossible if you have an appointment at the caves or ziplining) and the waitress was sluggish and drowsy. The good stuff -- there's a small clean pool. The setting woudl be hard to beat with a view of the rainforest and river below, and the frogs and flowers all around you. Not so easy to find in the dark. Get a very good driving road map. The rooms were extremely basic, but clean enough (except ours unfortunately), with high ceilings and individual lanais.

Whether it was luck or divine guidance, I'm sure we found one of the best places for destination weddings in the world! It was perfect. The setting is jaw-droppingly gorgeous, with many hikes and things to do without ever leaving the resort. It was isolated enough that we felt secluded, but not so much that our guests got lost. We had a wide range of people attend, from older family with health problems, to children, to people with terminal fear of jungle spiders, and they all loved it. Everybody loved it. I really could not recommend it enough. The food is simply the best- wholesome, healthy, and most importantly delicious, and chef Mike was great about people with food allergies. Steve is very helpful and really knows how to make you feel at home. He helped us arrange the cake, flowers, negotiations, everything. There was even a major storm the day before that knocked the power out- but we didn't notice because they were prepared with a generator. Two concerns our guests had about Casa Grande were the lack of AC and the distance from the airport. By the end of the trip, everyone was thrilled with the experience, I didn't hear a single complaint. Temperature was not a problem, we even got a bit cold at night! It does get warm in the day, but the pool is always there and no one seemed to mind, even people from much colder climates. The location is out of the way (purposefully so) but that's part of the charm. Distances in the mountains can be deceptive, so do allow time if you decide to visit any far off areas.

The grounds are especially beautiful and there are a couple of nature trails but we were unable to use them because it rained the entire three days we were there. We had to walk across a little bridge to get our cabin and it was a little frightening because the boards were \"spongy\", i.e. it felt like they were about to rot through. The room itself was a little on the shabby side. On the plus side it looked like they had recently replaced the sink and toilet in the bathroom. On the negative side, no air conditioning means dampness and maybe our experience was worse because it rained everyday, but all of our clothes, even the clean ones were always damp. They had installed some, what looked like new, wire bins to keep your belongings in to deal with that problem I guess, but it didn't work for us. Our room had two double beds which were both pushed up against the wall so whoever had to sleep on the inside had to crawl over the other person if they had to go to the bathroom in the night. The room had very poor lighting so reading after dark was not an option. It appears the place is run on a shoestring - - they couldn't even come up with a cold bottle of water for me.

The service in the restaurant wasn't very good either. when I picked up my fork to eat, I noticed it had dried food on it and the waiter never came back to check on us so I ate my eggs with my spoon. My experience may be colored by all the rain while we were there - - nothing to do and traveling anywhere was challenging due to the roads and isolation, but I did notice a sign saying that if you booked more than one night and left early, you would still be charged for the nights that you booked.

Each room also had a hammock, which my friend and I had to take turns on. It was so relaxing to just lay there and read. We had some lizard guests each night, which we thought was funny.

Everyone who works there seems to be happy. Everyone is willing to take time to do what ever you need to make your stay more comfortable. The ladies at the desk learned quickly enough that I like lots of towels and ice. Even though this is a very Green establish, they never once gave me any reason to feel that they did not approve of my need for clean towels and ice. I was always helped with a smile. Having said that they were all wonderful, I would like to say that Rose, who manned the desk and gave us great suggestions and Jose who did a number of jobs at Casa Grande and was always our waiter at dinner were especially appreciated. We took the meal plan because we did not want to drive the mountain roads after dinner in the dark. This was a good decision. The food was quite good and on the first evening it seemed there was a good variety. In fact there is a good variety if you stay one of two nights. We were there four nights and I did get tired of always having the same hot vegetable and the same fish choices. The food was quite tasty and if you are going to eat there, it is far less expensive to buy the plan. Having said that, I would say the cost is reasonable in either case. There is a lovely swimming pool fed by mountain streams. My few warnings: We needed to climb 33 steps every time we went to our room. There was another flight from the parking lot to the main area. You are, after all, in mountains. If you are not physically capable of doing this please be sure to check if there is any other way you can be accommodated. I did not see ramps or elevators. In his need to be Green the owner got a little carried away. Of course he eliminates some waste by encouraging reusing linens, not offering air conditioning and such. But the fact that the room and bathroom were very poorly lit drove me to distraction. There are very few lights and those that are there must have a very low wattage. There are two reading lights mounted on the wall over the bed and they do a good job of lighting the way to read. But they do not light any other part of the room. The one light over the mirror was almost useless. Fortunately, when I left I recovered my sight. We had a great room which looked out towards the mountains. We could watch the mountains peeking above some clouds. It seemed to me that some rooms facing the other way had a lesser view.

You will hear every noise, conversation and bodily function of guests in several adjacent cabins. Other guests told us they used ear plugs because they read the Trip Advisor reviews in advance. (Really, after all of the complaints about this problem the owner should address this) 2. There are no blankets on the beds or in the room (the night we were there it was freezing and miserably damp) 3. Despite prominently displayed framed magazine articles describing gourmet vegetarian food the only dinner offering was a buffet with cheap puffy white bread, very very bland lukewarm spaghetti, unimaginative stir-fried caulifower, something akin to Hamburger Helper and rice. Any elementary school cafeteria could do as well. The cost of the buffet was about $40 for 2. Breakfast was a buffet of hard boiled egg and toast or oatmeal with an anemic fruit tray of a few tiny orange slices and pineapple. Coffee, tea and juice. $18 for 2. If you stay at Casa Grande I suggest you eat at Rancho Marina on nearby Lago Dos Bocas. 4. The on-ground walk was a disappointment - narrow, twisting and slippery with no view. Don't bother. 5. The cabins are very near a road\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsirens, boom boxes and road noise are surprisingly frequent for such a remote area. They do die down at night. 6. The walkways are run down and make a depressing entrance to your room. It was the worst stay and the worst food we had in 10 days in Puerto Rico. What was positive? The pool is very clean and nicely situated, a bit chilly but refreshing after a walk. The rooms are spartan but have some nice photos for decoration and wire baskets to store things.The view from dining deck is lovey and there are many interesting plants on the grounds.

Let me start by saying every other review is right -- it is a gorgeous location with a nice pool, good food and, yes, a hammock on your deck. Now, let me share some things that no one told us. Part of the rustic retreat experience was no air conditioning, just big fans in the room (which we knew about before we got there). The temperature wasn't an issue, even in tropical Puerto Rico. However, the open windows had a few side effects that bear thought... The romantic portion of our trip ended since everyone could hear everything that was going on in every room. Oh, and I can't forget the roosters. They start crowing around 3:45 a.m. and continue throughout the rest of the early morning hours. Each bungalow nestled in the hills (sounds gorgeous, no?) is divided into 4 rooms. The walls were THIN. I mean, THIN. I mean my husband was up the first night listening to the man snoring in the other room. I was up the third night listening to the guy watching Family Guy on his computer (no tv's). Since the front desk was closed already, we had to go to the room and ask them to turn it off. Speaking of the front desk, I must admit that I never got a real friendly vibe. With only 20 rooms, I really thought it would be a more personable experience, but it wasn't. Also, on our bill at checkout, we had incorrect charges on it. They took them off, but we had to repeat over and over that we didn't incur the charge. Lastly, I'd like to discuss meals. It is fortunate that their meals were good, because they are up a narrow, winding mountain road. At sundown, it is dark, pitch black. We've driven all over the world and were very happy to know that we didn't have to go find somewhere to eat and drive on the winding, dark roads. Definitely do the meal plan if you decide to stay. If you do end up in the area, I strongly, strongly suggest you go see Batey Ziplines. Jorge is a very cool guy who has an extremely fun (and safe) adult playground of ziplines, rapelling, hiking, etc. You know it's an interesting day when you are happy that the challenge you are facing is \"just\" a zipline.

Don' get me wrong you have to pay attention and honk your horn when going around corners, but it was not that bad. Don't let the other reviews scare you. Once you arrive at the Casa Grande, you will see that the drive there was worth it. The views are stunning and both my husband and I both think it is one of the most gorgeous views we have ever experienced. We stayed in room 16 which has two full sized beds and was on the lower level of the hillside retreat. You could hear the road below occasionally, but it was not a big deal. Our room had a lovely looking bathroom that was beyond my expectations, two fairly comfortable beds, a ceiling fan and a porch hammock. The room does not have windows, but screens that have slats you can close for more privacy. Having read the reviews prior to coming here my husband and I were expecting to hear the people in the next room breathing, but that did not happen. You could hear coughing and some hushed talking, but again, not deal breakers. We ordered the inclusive package which I would recommend. It included dinner and breakfast. The day that we were there, there was a buffet for both dinner and breakfast. The people that did not have the all inclusive package had an 18% gratuity added to their meals which they seemed a bit annoyed by. The gratuity charge is charged for drinks not included in the food package, but was not a big deal for us. Food was so-so, but trust me you don't exactly want to go driving around at night searching for food, it's much nicer to just stay put. We did, however, bring snacks with us though which I would recommend. There is a Walgreens to stop at right before you get on the smaller roads to the retreat, I think it's at the end of Rt. 10, so getting some provisions to hold you over would be helpful if you're the snacky type like us. The retreat did have internet access and it worked pretty well from the porch/reception area. One minor gripe was that some of the walkways needed some paint/love, but other than that no real complaints.

The place is so quiet that you feel you have to whisper, which is a good thing cause it makes you relax even more, but at night you get to hear people having sex, snoring etc ,and not people from the room next door , people from the next building!!!, and there is no lunch, something should be provided, at least have a vendor machine to get some snacks or water bottles, if you are thirsty after 9 pm you will remain like that untill 8 pm in the morning, i didnt have the chance to meet Steve ( the owner) , but come on Steve!!! get some noise reduction material in the cabins, so people can enjoy some privacy ,i really beleive is possible, i was lucky i was the only one in my cabin i didnt have any guest next to my room, but i can imagine how bad would it be since i could hear the guest from the next cabin.

She chose Puerto Rico. A member of my Rotary Club takes students on geological and history tours in the Caribbean, so I asked him for his recommendation - he unhesitatingly recommended Casa Grande. It sounded just what I was looking for - my grown children are into hiking and outdoors, not the nite-club scene of San Juan. I made contact via internet and was amazed to find that the four of us could stay in adjoining rooms for a week at the same price I would pay for a single for two nights in most any metropolitan area. The owner corresponded and responded quickly each time I had a question. This is a retreat ... and that was what attracted me to the place. No phones ... no television ... not internet connection in the rooms - everything I needed to DIS-connect from the rest of the world. If you are looking for nightlife and want to touch-base with work and the rest of the world ... pick another place. This is a retreat. The location is fantastic - wondrous - words fail to convey the beauty of the place. Once off of Route 10, the road to Casa Grande is a two-lane road that twists and turns around the mountains. Caution in driving is a necessity. But the very road itself tells you that you are stepping away from the mainstream. We had no trouble locating the place, even though it was difficult to keep our eyes on the road ahead with the incredible views of mountains and valleys all around us. Casa Grande is a collection of cottages arranged up the mountainside. Each cottage contains four rooms - each with small porch and hammock. Ours was the cottage farthest up the mountain - one room on the mountain side and one room overlooking the valley. The mountain-side room was just that - you felt that you were in a tree-house on the mountain. Lush vegetation and jungle came within ten feet of the building. The valley side opening to an incredible view - this is a very narrow valley, so you are looking across to jungle that barely shows signs of human intervention. Sunrises and sunsets were breathtaking. The grounds are landscaped with trees, shrubs and flowers from throughout the tropical world - each labeled with the name and native location. We ate most of our meals at the restaurant. The food was delicious, presented beautifully. At first the wait staff seemed professionally distant, but the moment we warmed to them and engage in conversation, they warmed and responded. We laughed together, got recommendations of sites to visit, arranged for the bar tender to take us on a guided hike right from the resort and along a stream into the jungle where we swam in a pool beneath a wonderful water-fall. One disappointment was that, as an early riser, there was no coffee machine in the room, and coffee wasn't available at the restaurant until about 7. On the other hand, at the end of the day, the bar-tender graciously prepared a pitcher of their home-made san gria and allowed us to take it back to our rooms and the small patio area adjacent to our cottage entrance. The resort has a yoga center, and we started each day with a one-hour yoga class directed by the resort owner. He was gracious in accommodating those with little to no experience with yoga, but also challenged those with advanced skills. Woud I go back to Casa Grande? --- in a heartbeat.

This Inn has been voted best \"green\" in numerous times, so the soap is eco-friendly and they don't provide shampoo. Likewise towels are thin, and no extra blankets provided. We live in San Juan, so I brought my nap blanket, which came very handy around 2am. The balcony - so (wonderfully) deceptive! This simple balcony and hammock will take hold of you and you will find yourself napping quite a lot. It's great! We had cabin # 8, which is the most private. It has a lovely giant fern outside the balcony next to the hammock. Awesome. Food was nice. Local cuisine. They don't serve lunch, so make sure to plan activities ahead of time. Morning yoga classes offered daily. When we were there a lovely young girl offered a number of spa treatments and massages, very nice when you're in such a relaxing location!

My friend and I paid almost $14.00 just for coffee one morning during a lesser busy day of our stay. I have never stayed anywhere where they literally charge you for every cup of coffee, especially when the cups are miniature size, so of course you are going to drink more than one cup. The next day we noticed a buffet with all you can drink coffee. When we confronted the front desk upon checkout about the coffee issue, no attempt was made whatsoever to remove or reduce the charges for coffee on our total bill. Since I am in the travel industry I stay all of the world in different types of habitats but I have never been charged $14.00 for my coffee consumption, especially in a locale that grows coffee. While the only dinner that we had on-site had great service, I cannot say the same for the breakfast. Their was one particular female server who obviously did not want to be there for whatever reason and it showed. The only words she said to me during the entire week was an inquiry about my laptop. Of course, I kept my laptop with me during the entire week out of fear it would disappear. Then there's the phone service. There is absolutely no phone service available. Your cell phone won't work and they won't let you use the only landline available. They will however allow you to use an local cell phone which also seems to have the same lack of coverage but at a rate of 2.00 for the first minute and then an additional fee for each minute thereafter. Since this phone didn't have any better coverage than our own, we chose against it. Then there's the wireless internet that is limited. When we booked this room, we were told that each room had wireless service. Upon arrival, we found that the only true location for wireless was the restaurant, lobby and pool area. This was very inconvenient, especially since there was no phone coverage. I'm not big on talking on the phone, but when you're trying to make appointments for outings such as fishing, boating, rock-climbing or any other local adventures, you need to have some sort of phone coverage. The first night we were there, I noticed no hot water. So the next morning, we made sure we were the first to shower so that we weren't forced to take cold showers. Overall, I found that there were indeed other hotels that we could have stayed but were not listed on travel sites, so I am taking every initiative to make sure these other locations are listed so no one feels that Casa Grande is their only option. We certainly felt this way when it came to the restaurant. We found numerous restaurants that offered much better service and a broader menu. One of our favorites was lakeside in Utuado called Rancho Marina which is run by Vivian and Harry. They offered great service and a very nice setting as well as a great menu.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Draper, Utah", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, Remote, Quaint, Loud\u201d", "Author": "metamer6", "ReviewID": "UR27353681", "Content": "Disclaimer: My wife and I were put in a room right above the road, which means every 2-3 hours, when a car raced by, it was very noise. I imagine other rooms would yield a better experience than ours. If you stay here, try very much to get a room away from the road! I think 3 1/2 stars is more accurate, but I'll have to settle for three. My wife and I are not too picky. We pretty much keep to ourselves and don't require much attention in terms of service and we certainly don't demand 'fancy' accommodations. I really like the location of Casa Grande, it really is in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by lush rain forest. The roads are extremely windy in the area, but I thought it was fun (in our rental car :) If you like to sit around and look at the rainforest and read a book, do yoga or maybe go on some hikes, then this place will be great for you. My wife and I stayed here two nights and went to Arecibo Observatory (which was cool) and Rio Camuy (which was also cool). Other than that there is nothing to do around here. The closest town, Utuado, is also small with nothing to do. You can pretty much plan on eating at the restaurant in the hotel, unless you want to adventure to Utuado and dig something up (probably 20 or so minutes away by car). The service was slow and carefree (as they say in Fiji: \"no hurries, no worries\"). We thought the food was decent though, and slightly overpriced. The room was basically like a Motel 6 (hey you're in the middle of the rainforest), but the windows aren't covered in glass, only a screen for insects and shutters that close to block light. That means if you are in the room next to the road, any cars driving by are VERY loud, and I'm a moderately heavy sleeper. Also the walls are super thin, so be prepared to hear everything that your neighbors are doing, as well as their screaming children. Maybe bring some Ambien. In Sum: I liked the location (I think rainforests are cool) I would like the room if it was away from the road The service was poor, but that's just a Puerto Rico thing, so deal with it I would probably recommend it to a friend just for the one of a kind experience. Just get a room away from the road! Also be prepared with what you want to do all day in advance, you will need to entertain yourself here.

We really enjoyed our stay there and would come back, without a doubt. The sounds at night are wonderful; something we'd expect to hear only on a National Geographic special. The room was clean and pleasant, and the hammock on the little balcony was a very nice touch. Staff were friendly and helpful, and arrived to tidy up our room every day. The breakfast was very good. The dinner menu was a little limited, but also good and, again, we very much enjoyed the setting in the evening. Another nice touch was Toupinou (sp?), the proprietor's very friendly dog who greeted us and other guests, was great with our 1 1/2 year old son, and even saw us off. We concur with other reviewers that the cabin walls are thin. There are four units per cabin, and I'm sure our neighbors heard our son complaining one morning. We certainly heard one of our neighbors \"doin' it\"; however, they also caused the entire cabin to shake, which was a little unsettling at first. Ultimately, neither the noise nor the motion were a big deal. The road to the Casa Grande was winding and narrow, but more fun than frightening even when we were arriving after dark. Just drive slowly, as appropriate, and do not be afraid to announce your presence at blind corners by beeping your horn (the local residents certainly do). We only have a couple comments regarding ways our stay could have been improved just a little. First, because the first evening we were there it was a little chilly (for Puerto Rico), it would have been nice to have access to an extra blanket for the bed. Second, in addition to the offer to prepare sandwiches for the guests, offering recommendations to guests for additional lunch options in the area for when they are out and about.

More on this later. An \"I Survived Getting to the CGMR\" badge should be awarded to all guests for completing the near death-defying, white knuckled drive up here. I found the drive to be fun for about the first 10 minutes. Hint...there was one confusing turn getting to the CGMR. Take the low road. Stayed one night in room #4. Front Desk service outstanding. Found room spartan, but clean, airy, and comfortable. Gorgeous, well maintained gardens. Incredible views of lush, jungle mountainsides. Good views of mountains from only a few rooms. Request rooms #4 or #5. This will cost you $5-10 more but worth it as this is by far the best feature of the CGMR. Small porch allows for a relaxing, meditative, experience for views. Hammock on porch more of a hindrance than convenience and should be detatchable from one end so it can be stowed up in porch rafters. Spring Fed onsite pool was refreshing to me. Too cold for wife. Now for the food and service at the restaurant. Horrible. Maybe they just had two bad days, we ordered the wrong things, or it was just the luck of the draw. First off you should understand that my wife and I felt trapped here for meals. I saw no other place for meals within proximity to CGMR. I'd advise you to eat at one of the route 10 roadside vendors on the way to here (about 30 min. out from CGMR...we did as I had a sneaky suspicion that the food was going to be below average) or bring your own food and grill/prepare for yourself (if this is allowable). We tried to enjoy Dinner /Breakfast at the CGMR restaurant. Dinner started with the fried combo. appetizer ( I think they are all fried) the only decent thing was the fried cheese. I had Mahi-Mahi, Wife had Salmon. Both specials. Nothing special about them. Both fish dishes were overcooked , dry, hard, and tasteless. This, after I specifically made a point of telling waitress not to overcook fish...twice) Each bite of my Mahi-Mahi could have been used as a sling shot projectile to kill chickens with. Waitress inattentive and indifferent. Never asked about meal. Breakfast. Ordered fresh fruit plate and the yougurt with raisins and walnuts. Tough to screw up yogurt. They didn't. Fresh Fruit? Wouldn't you expect, especially in PR, a sizeable and delicious plate of fruit? Not here. What arrived was a smallish single layered plate consisting of 1 thinly sliced banana, rindy, seedy, inedible grapefruit wedges and about 10 tiny pieces of an orange colored substance that was tasteless. One last note that the CGMR probably can't control but still annoying. This place bills itself as a QUIET, secluded retreat. It's really not as secluded as they would lead you to believe. I settled into the porch to relax after our disaster dinner to have a Manhattan and smoke a cigar. Within minutes a radio blared form a dwelling 20 feet below the resort. This lasted for an hour until 8:30PM. I wouldn't have minded if music was playing, but the radio seemed to be playing the calling/anouncing of a horse race. Because of the negatives the CGMR rates a 1 1/2 out of 5 to me. I'll give it a 2 because my wife is incredibly forgiving and there are no half ratings here.

If you want something plush, look elsewhere. However, our room was clean, the tiled bathroom nice, and the feeling of being somewhere truly different pervaded. Our room faced the mountains and we greatly enjoyed our private porch and hammock where we spent time reading and taking in the sounds of nature. Each night we fell asleep to the chorus of the coquis chirping away. If you're even vaguely interested in yoga - take Steve's morning class. It's special time spent reflecting and limbering up for either lazing about or heading out hiking. He is a gentle and kind instructor and makes the class accessible for all skill levels. The only slight downside I found was that I would have liked Casa Grande's menu to reflect a bit more Puerto Rican culture - though I understand that in choosing a limited number of items one much try to appeal to as many tastes as possible. Herbed chicken and spaghetti are pretty safe. On the upside the little indoor/outdoor cafe area is absolutely charming and a great place to while away some time drinking coffee and watching the wind blow. Personally I wouldn't recommend Casa Grande for small children unless they are the kind that are good at entertaining themselves. It's a quiet place and unruly children would rather disrupt the tranquility and most likely be unhappy themselves.

Overall, I would say that it is great place to base some hiking or an interesting night away from the beaches, but do not expect any frills or a good night sleep if you have neighbors.", "Date": "January 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautifully isolated, but spartan rooms\u201d", "Author": "zsazsa77", "ReviewID": "UR3506821", "Content": "My husband & I stayed here for 1 night during our Puerto Rican honeymoon, on our way to Areceibo. It is VERY difficult to reach, as all the roads, though well-paved are windy nonstop as you go through the mountains. (Anyone who is sensitive to carsickness, be forewarned!) The setting of the resort, once you get there, is gorgeous. Surrounded by lush green mountains on all sides, the sound of nature is the only thing you'll hear at night (the coquis are very vocal!). The rooms are a bit summer camp-ish, with just the basics and are a bit small. But the hammock on the balcony is a nice touch. We had wanted to do the AM yoga class, but the week that we were there, the rain had washed out the road in front of the yoga instructor's house, so there was no yoga. I thought the food at Jungle Jane's was fine, especially as there is literally no place else to eat anywhere close by. The coffee there was very good. If you want to get away from it all (and are prepared for spartan accommodations), bring your bug spray and enjoy the views!", "Date": "May 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautifull view, not so good room's\u201d", "Author": "tragaldavas", "ReviewID": "UR3504945", "Content": "The view's are breath taking.
