{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Enjoyed our stay We travelled to Japan early September to spend three weeks touring with my son who has lived there for three years. Having put an itinerary together, our first stop was Tokyo, where we had decided to base ourselves for six nights, allowing time to explore Tokyo itself and the surrounding area.I read lots of hotel reviews on tripadvisor before booking our accommodation for the trip and the Hotel Parkside in Ueno seemed a good candidate.We arrived from the airport on the Friday evening and were pleasantly surprised at how easy it had been to travel in; caught the Keisei Line directly to Ueno and then only 5 minutes walk to the hotel., well located facing onto Ueno Park.We had reserved a non-smoking twin room (double rooms seem to be a rarity in Japan); check in was very simple and the reception staff spoke English and were very helpful.Our room was on the 8th floor at the front of the hotel with views over Ueno Park. The room was a good size and had most of the amenities you required. The wardrobe space was on the small side (not designed for staying more than a couple of nights?) and only took a few things that really needed to be hung whilst the rest remained in the luggage bags. The bathroom was a decent size (having read reviews about small Japanese bathrooms) with a shower over the bath.There are three restaurants in the hotel although we didn't use them, prefering to eat out for all our meals including breakfast.The only minor gripe was availability of Internet; if you had your own laptop then internet connection in the room was free 24x7, otherwise it was available through a TV/keyboard set up with the first 30 minutes in every 24 hours free after which you needed to buy a pre-pay card (covered Internet and Pay TV channels) for 1000 yen per night - a bit expensive.We paid 15,500 yen per night for the twin room which we thought was good value for a city hotel, in an excellent location for travelling around Tokyo (Ueno is on the JR loop line) and also the surrounding area (can catch the Shinkansen from Ueno).We would definately stay at the Hotel Parkside again if visiting Tokyo.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR142848302", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "basilbones"}, {"Content": "Great Location and Price       View of Ueno Park from our room", "Date": "Jul 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR634944207", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SeattleCrazyhair"}, {"Content": "Subarashi !! Subarashi means great or fantastic in Japanese.That would sum up this hotel in a nutshell. The hotel was very clean everywhere throughout. The rooms were spotlessly clean, I was very impressed. The beds were comfortable, you had a TV and computer with keyboard in the rooms too. It was a high-quality flat screen TV, which served also as a computer. In the bathrooms, the toilet was supermodern: it was a toilet, bidet and a cleanser for your private parts, all in one. I had never seen anything like it ever. As a nice touch, the hotel offered high quality body soap and shampoo/conditioner by Shiseido in the bathroom, that was nice. You can also control the temperature of your room, to your liking. Also, there is a tea-kettle along with free tea samples in the room, and also fresh kimonos with obi (sash) and towelling slippers for the guest. None of the channels on the TV were in English, only Japanese. But it was fun to watch Japanese TV and watch their expressions, etc. Interesting it was.My room faced towards the front of the hotel, looking towards Shinobazu Pond. Nice view, and don't forget to bring your camera and get a few pix of it.I used one of the on-premise restaurants once for the buffet breakfast, called the Italian Trattoria. It was okay, not bad, but not really great. My opinion only: if you reserve a room here, don't bother getting your meals included in your reservation. I am glad that I did not. You can try them out once or so, and just pay regular price, which is reasonable. There are many shops, restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries, grocery stores in the immediate area, so you have more than amply choice for food and drink! The staff at the hotel was friendly on check in and check out both. Some of the staff have limited English, but they tried to speak English and they were helpful. It also gave me a chance to use my limited Japanese with them: I learned a few key words and phrases from Lonely Planets Japanese Phrase Book.I did not see any swimming pool or whirlpool on the premises. The hotel is in a good location, just a few blocks from the Keisei Train Station, which is also beside the Ueno Station. Very convenient. (The Uneo Station handles trains and subways both and the Keisei Station has direct trains to Narita Airport.) There are quite a few homeless people hanging around the outer hallways and corridors of the train stations, but they did not present any problem. So don't worry about that. All in all, the hotel is really great, highly recommended. When I was making my reservation on line, they were very prompt and helpful. They went out of their way to get me a non smoking room, which I requested. They even held my room (reservation) without a credit card. Not many hotels do that nowadays.So, this is a nice place to stay for sure. It is not too expensive, very reasonably priced. I paid 10,900 Yen per night for my room, which was one double bed and private bath of course.The hotel is in the district of Ueno, in Tokyo. It is a good area, and subways are everywhere, so nothing is inconvenient.", "Date": "Jul 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR185107529", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "HumnaHumna"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel Second time in Tokyo. Stayed 3 nights in a 5th floor superior room (the L shaped type), which can be checked on hotel's good web site. Therefore reasonable room and very well planned bathroom with best of both western and Japanese features - what we now call a wet room with small but very deep bath for saoking. Ask for room on higher floors and facing park - very pleasant and no noise. Easy access from JR or Keisei (1 minute walk nearer) stations with ease of access to Narita airport. Keisei also has helpful tourist booth who can tell you how to get to airport by cheapest route etc and for info on say getting to Nikko (highly recommended) a beautiful small cultural town 2 hours ride from Tokyo and can be done as a day trip. Did not breakfast in hotel but a lighter meal in one of many pastry shops/station nearby. Ate in both the hotel's Italian and Chinese restaurants and had a drink in the well placed top floor bar. Food good all round and reasonably priced although bar a bit pricey. Behind the hotel there is a maze of good restaurants of all mainly Japanese type at fair prices. Ueno park (across the road) and zoo are fine for a walk and the metro gives easy access to all districts and hotel does not feel out of the centre. Hotel seems to be continually busy and proably need to book well in advance. Our dealings over the internet with them were excellent and they were very obliging. Only down side is the already commented upon charge for TV/internet at Y1000 - but the free 30 minutes seem enough if you just want to check mail. We paid Y18000 for the better room exc breakfast.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR355347201", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "fco"}, {"Content": "convenient and clean This is very convenient if you arrive on a late evening flight. It's just one direct train (Keisei Skyliner) to Ueno and a 10min walk to the hotel. Make sure you print out the hotel map to ensure you walk in the right direction. On our return journey to Narita airport, we took the 7.07am skyliner direct to Terminal 1. Although our initial reservation tickets were for 7.57am, they allowed us to change as were arrived at the station so early. You can get the schedule booklets at the Skyliner station. Also the Tourist Information counter is also located at this station - get your english brochures etc to make your sightseeing so much easier.After checking in, we managed to have lunch at one of the outlets along the road leading to the hotel - you grill your own beef. Nice affordable tasty lunch.Most of the 3 nights we ate at the Italian restaurant at Park Side. The food was better than we expected - pretty authentic. Enjoyed the minestrone soup, mushroom pizza, pizza with 4 kinds of cheese (not heavy going because of the light crust). The seafood spaghetti was thankfully not heavily dunked with sauce and had the right al dente bite to it.As for the meats, we thought the lamb was wonderful. The few pieces were just nice for one person if you arent famished. The beef dish was average.This restaurant is so convenient if you are too lazy to walk out and prefer to have an early night. In case you are wondering why we went all the way to japan and ended up eating italian- it's because we stayed at 3 ryokans during our 2 week holiday and had lots and lots of fine japanese cuisine. So having italian was a nice alternative. One thing I noticed about japan, the french and italian food tastes good! To them, it's always an art when it comes to cooking at the restaurants.Hotel reception was helpful with queries and our rooms were very clean. Our Twin bedroom  one double room faced the pond - nice big window view. The outside temperature was only about 19degrees but sometimes the room aircon was changed to warm air. So no need for warm clothes inside.Comfortable and larger than Toyoko Inn rooms or Star Shinjuku. On the whole, bigger than most business budget hotels.Just type hotel parkside ueno on google and you should be able to locate the hotel's nice informative website - there's an option for the english version when the japanese page opens up. I emailed them directly  they were prompt and helpful with their replies.The hotel is within walking distance to a lot of places. There's a convenience store across the small alley if you walk out the exit on the LEFT of the reception. The main exit is to the right of the reception, next to the italian restaurant. For a change from the museums and park, try taking a stroll amongst all the shops at the Ameyokocho area. (look up your tourist brochure). You have to walk to MacD and cross the big roads to the other side.Lots of shops lined up (something like a bazaar) - they opened till quite late on sunday till 10pm but on weekdays it's earlier. You can get lots of stuff here, from cheap budget to pricier items. Joshua bought a good pair of boots in one of those small shops when his present one gave way. There was a very nice upmarket store called THE SUIT COMPANY amongst all these little shops - nice business shoes and jackets. The store seemed out of place and the first thought was - oh must be expensive. Not so bad as the stylish business shoes were around USD125-160. Joshua managed to get a nice stylish jacket (looks like leather) for USD180.The JR train station is a 3 min walk from the Skyliner station and has quite a large shopping mall. Do try the soft icecream at one of the shops there, lots of flavours with the icecream nicely sandwiched between two round wafers. It's beside the Andersen's pastry cafe (which is great for a continental breakfast) - that's near the entrance to the train ticket gates. There's also a Reservation Office in the mall for JR trains if you want to book your Shinkansen or Limited Express seats in advance. The great part about Ueno is it's convenient location for travelling by trains. But first do your homework on the subways and train routes before you go to japan. It can be pretty mind boggling.", "Date": "Nov 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR274828766", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "traveljet"}, {"Content": "Excellent if you need to be near Ueno Park Excellent place to stay if you are going to museums in Ueno Park.

There is some great restaurants nearby. It's a 5 minute walk to the Metro and Keisei Line. It's great if your catching the train from Narita as you only have to catch one train to Ueno then walk from the station.The rooms were a reasonable size for Tokyo and renovated in traditional Japanese styling. Service was always helpful and friendly although not all the staff spoke fluent English.The only Con's of this place would be the Tv and Pay TV (1000 Yen extra) which is only in Japanese, and the Futon beds on the floor were a little uncomfortable. There are Western Style rooms available.Overall I'd recommend this Hotel if you want to be close to all the main attractions in Tokyo, and like to stay in new and comfortable surroundings.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR722591173", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Excellent choix   showReview(19893841, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR152555593", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Lepseudodispo"}, {"Content": "Park Side Ueno Tokyo - Great value for money       Vista dal letto", "Date": "Aug 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR557682864", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Matutes"}, {"Content": "tr\u732bs bon rapport qualit\u8305 prix   showReview(14243349, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR462532805", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "aoel"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066461-d593788-r20655946-Hotel_Parkside-Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "593788", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
