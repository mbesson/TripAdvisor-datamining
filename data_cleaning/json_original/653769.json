The rooms are ok, the pool is nice, but the customer service is so completely atrocious as to put off the least requiring of travelers (we've stayed in rooms for less than 3 dollars in the depths of rural India that were more worthy of support than this place). Also, from having read some of the other reviews (unfortunately after our stay there) I guess we were lucky to have nothing stolen. We found their customer service to be so completely appalling, however, that rather than spend a couple more days here we've decided to move on immediately. We'd originally been going to stay at one of the numerous accommodations nearby recommended by Lonely Planet (Hotel Sorga, Mimpi Bungalows etc) but as they were all full, we had our heavy backpacks on, and Hotel New Arena looked decent from the outside, so we decided to stay there instead. Probably should have been tipped off by the fact that they refuse to give a decent room price for less than three nights, but as we were staying 3 nights anyway it didn't bother us too much. The staff were completely and utterly atrocious. From our very first dealings with them, where they were belligerent and unhelpful, through to the end of our stay, they were unfailingly rude  inattentive. As the breakfast tickets were handed out by the front desk each day, it meant having to deal with them and their general nastiness every morning. One night we called the front desk to see if they'd be willing to patch through an international call. They were, and did. We were surprised but pleased. The next morning we attempted to receive a second call. Our caller was told they could not be put through because our line wasn't set up. After a completely futile phone conversation with the office staff I went down to reception to try to sort it out in person. They claimed there was no connection to our room for international calls. When told of my phone call the evening before, they denied all knowledge and claimed vehemently that no such call had been made (obviously untrue). Now, apparently, the only way I would be able to receive a phone call to our room would be to put down a hefty deposit (more than a night's stay) so that they could 'connect' the line. Under duress, they eventually admitted that the deposit would be returned if we didn't make any calls out from our 'newly connected' phone, but this was only after severe interrogation. We're not picky about where we sleep, a decent bed is usually all we need, if that. To have a management this unhelpful (and apparently untrustworthy) is completely appalling, especially in a tourist mecca like Kuta Beach. Please don't support this staff, and instead help support one of the numerous other hotels here where staff work hard  with respect.", "Date": "Jul 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR271256190", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "IndieBackpacker"}, {"Content": "First they stole our money, then they kicked us out ! The hotel looked nice and the price was right. But the first day we went to the swimming pool in the morning and left our wallet in the room. The cleaning boy asks us, on our way down, if we want our room cleaned; we said no. We come back two or three hours later and the money in the wallet is gone. We went to the reception to report the theft. The security and manager became very agressive and started screaming at us. They said we had lost the money. Where is your money? We answered we didn't know because it was stolen. If u don't know where your money is, you LOST it! You are a liar! Nobody was in your room because you asked yourself not to clean it ! So it must have been black magic! That was the explanation the manager and so-called owner of the hotel kept on screaming at us. They even pushed us and refused to look at our faces during the conversation.The day after we were in a restaurant around the corner when the security guy from the New Arena hotel arrives at the restaurant on his motobike and says we immediately have to go to the hotel. There they said our room was double booked and that we had to go. Immediatly or we had to pay for the minutes over the 12o clock check out time. We travelled for 6 months and had not one crazy experience like this... what a way to run a hotel, one big joke.

I spoke to reception about it and was laughed at by their security agent. He referred me to their Rules and Regulations and more specifically the part that says not to leave valuables in the room. The money was in a pair of shorts both times and someone would have had to physically go through them to get the money. This did not seem to matter. I also presented front desk with a note that was left under my door from an unknown source telling me that indeed someone in housekeeping had taken money from me. This was in the evening and I had already paid for that night so I stayed again that night. The next morning I received a phone call from someone telling me that housekeeping would be in my room again that day and that I should be careful. I have no idea who phoned me but at this point I had had enough.Upon checkout they would not let me leave until security checked my room. Apparently I was under suspicion for something now.

Worst Place in Bali Erico, IndonesiaNov 2006, I stayed here with my big family in 3 rooms around swimming pool.Firstly we thought that this hotel was nice and cheap. The rooms was just renovated although the swimming pool was very uncleaned. We planned to stay here for a week and we paid in advance for the first 2 days. If we satisfied stay in this hotel, we just extend and pay for the next day.But after a night our happy vacation became a worst experience because of their management. We felt that being stayed here was full of terror.This hotel managed by a family ,a 50 years old husband and wife who looked like a witch and a 20 years old daugter, came from another island (not balinese people). They told that they are the owner of this hotel. (I still don't believe it)They always watching all of our activities in this hotel. They shouted angrily when my 1 years old played the hotel trolley. (the steel trolley won't be broken by a baby, right). On second day, early in the morning the hotel staff knocked out my rooms and asked me if I want to extend for more day, I must paid soon. I said to him that I have right to stayed there until next day because I already paid for 2 days.(what kind of procedure they have, It's very disturbing).On the third day, again the hotel stuff knocked my door early in the morning and asked for payment if I want to extend. (The hotel management can't stop disturbing me). Then I and my family decided to checked out and find another hotel. Suddenly the owner come and said that if I don't want to extend I must check out before 12.00, more than that even just a minute , I must pay for 1 day full. (Oh God please forgive them because they don't know how to run hospitality business)When we checked out we saw a couple of Japanese looked angry in front office, they already paid for 7 days in advance, after first 3 days they want to move to another hotel but the hotel management didn't want to refund their money.(Even I have very bad experience here, but I still lucky, didn't lose money too)I'm sorry if my English is bad.", "Date": "May 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR651698726", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "e_hiero"}, {"Content": "Not-So-Great Hotel in a great location Location: The New Arena is very centrally located. It is a very close walk to the beach as well as shopping areas. Accommodations: I started my stay in a standard room ($20.00 a night). The room was very small as well as smelly and dirty. The shower had bugs in it and there was mold on the shower curtain. There were holes in the floor and the window (of my first floor room) would not lock. I upgraded to a deluxe room for an extra 10.00 a night. This was much better. Staff: The staff was not very helpful. The owner/manager did not want to give a guest staying in a standard room a 2nd roll of toilet paper even after she said she had been sick. Apparently, standard rooms only get 1 roll of toilet paper a day. He finally gave in and gave the girl the toilet paper (after much begging). They also tried to charge my friend 2 extra nights for a room she did not stay in. She initially had 2 rooms for a few days then her family all moved into the same room. The staff didn't understand that they had checked out of the first room (even though they turned in the key and said they only wanted to keep 1 room), so they were charged for 2 extra nights. The whole situation was completely outrageous.
