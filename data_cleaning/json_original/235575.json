We read the reviews for Hotel Lenox on tripadvisor and the Hotel did not disappoint. We stayed for three nights and at the time Paris was bitterly cold, staying below freezing for pretty much the entire stay. We love the Eurostar experience and the link up they have with this Hotel made the trip extremely good value. We left Kent on the morning of the 6th Feb, the journey was delayed very slightly due to the extreme weather conditions. Arriving in Paris at Gare Du Nord we made our way to the Metro and purchased 4 tickets to Vavin, good value on the Metro with a one way ticket at 1.70 euros each. The metro stop, Vavin, is only around 100 metres from The Hotel, the time on the tube is about twenty minutes and the trains are very frequent, you never have to wait for more than a few minutes. On arrival at the Hotel we were earlier than the usual check in time by about 2 hours but the efficient lady on reception informed that one room was ready and the other would soon be ready so we dumped our cases in the available room and went off to explore Paris. The Hotel is in a great location on the south side of Paris, its a long walk down to the Seine and the city centre but there is so much to see along the way. The Hotel is surrounded by very good eateries and bars, we were spolit for choice and some very good food during our stay. We did not take up the option of breakfast at the hotel but found a nice sandwich bar just down the road that served great coffee, pastries, paninis and superb cakes. Our room was very nice, clean comfortable, warm and quite well appointed, we did pay for the club rooms when booking on the eurostar website because we had read that generally rooms are very small in Paris hotels. Most afternoons after sightseeing we did take advantage of the hotel bar, a good selection of drinks, clean and comfortable surroundings. We duly filled out the honesty bar forms. Most evenings we would meet in the bar before departing to a local restaurant. In all a good hotel in a good location, we loved Paris and would like to return one day but not during the middle of winter.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield", "Title": "\u201cWould go back\u201d", "Author": "Loopylalaland", "ReviewID": "UR126037845", "Content": "Good little hotel, rooms small but perfectly formed.

We travelled with Eurostar and this was one of the options. Having read all the positive reviews, I booked two nights at the Lenox Montparnasse and was really pleased I did. The Hotel is just off the Montparnasse Boulevard and we took the metro to the Vavin stop. We arrived slightly early for check-in, but we were warmly greeted by the receptionist. There were several others checking in, so she addressed us all in English. She jokingly said that people were coming in waves of languages, making life easier. Our room wasn't quite ready, so we waited in the lounge and offered tea and coffee. Ten minutes later, we were given a key, WiFi access for two devices and breakfast options (which we didn't take). We had also been upgraded to larger room too! The room itself was clean with tea making facilities, nice bathroom and street side view. The television had films on demand for free. I really cannot say how much I was impressed with the service and the hotel. We had never been to France before and we were made to feel so welcome. They appreciated us speaking French, but spoke in English. It was very well located and landed up walking everywhere rather than using the metro.

I found this hotel by accident as it came up as an option when I was booking the Eurostar & after checking it out on here we decided that it looked like a lovely hotel & booked ourselves in for a club room with a special offer where we got breakfast for free. We turned up on Wednesday about 10am as we were on an early Eurostar trip, this was 4 hours earlier than normal check in. The previous occupants had just checked out of their room so we were asked to return in an hour to allow housekeeping to ensure it was cleaned & ready for us, we left our suitcase in their luggage room & went off for a bit of a wonder around the neighbourhood. We accidentally came across the Montparnasse tower which we didn't realise was so close to the hotel & decided to go to the top & look. There was also a little market on the way back to the hotel & we found a Metro station on Line 6 which was about 5 mins walk from the hotel, along with the Line 4 Metro station that we had originally got off at which was about 3 minutes in the other direction-wonderfully located for getting around Paris. In the same road as the hotel there was a cheese shop, plenty of restaurants & pubs, a couple of souvenir shops, wine shop, 2 mini market/supermarket shops & 2 bakeries plus a tobacconist just round the corner along with a whole range of everything you could ever need! Once we were checked in we took our things upstairs & unpacked and got settled in, we were on the 2nd floor overlooking the courtyard at the back and found that it was a decent size room & good sized bathroom but the bath was quite small, more than adequate for a holiday though! There are a few reviews that say the rooms were too small, well my boyfriend & I are both bigger than average & we had no problems with the room size, the bed was lovely to sleep in too! The room was very clean, thoroughly cleaned & clean towels each day too. Also had a little safe in the wardrobe which was ideal for us to leave a few bits in while we were out & about for the day! The only downside was that the bath screen didn't really go far enough back when having a shower as we always ended up with a bit of a puddle but was nothing a towel on the floor couldn't solve. It was also a fairly warm room & we couldn't seem to get the air con to make it cooler so we opened the window instead & it was fine other than around 6 am when the building behind us must have been having deliveries & it was quite loud but I was already awake by then & my boyfriend slept through the noise! Free WiFi codes were given to us when we arrived & mine was no problem, my boyfriends didn't work 1st time so he went down to reception & they sorted him out a new log in code etc. We were also told that if we wanted to print we could do so free of charge down to the printer by reception, also the films were free which was lovely as it allowed us to lay & watch them late in the evening after our days out without having to spend a fortune to do so! The staff on the front desk were very helpful & spoke good English which was good as my French is a bit rusty & my boyfriend doesn't know anything other than the 3 essentials I got him to remember, please, thanks and sorry! The breakfast was great too, lovely range of food for my boyfriend to fill up on before a long day out & about, typical continental buffet breakfast really-bacon, sausages, scrambled egg, cheeses, ham, salami, cereal, milk, yoghurt, orange juice, grapefruit juice, rolls, toast, croissants, pain on chocolate/raisin chocolate milk, tea, coffee, jams, marmalade, fruit, mustard & ketchup, everything you could need really! They also had their honesty bar & free tea/coffee in the afternoon/evening but we didn't use this as we weren't in the hotel much during the day. I would definitely recommend this hotel & will hopefully be returning in the future as it was exactly what we wanted and was so central that it made getting a bit really easy!", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cTres bien\u201d", "Author": "Eric M", "ReviewID": "UR125568345", "Content": "Spent 7 great nights at Lenox Montparnasse.

It became a little noisy late and in the early morning with street cleaning, but we were used to the noise since we live in Austin. Rue Delambre sits between Boulevard Montparnasse and Edgar Quinet and La Gaite. It was an easy walk to several nice bistros, cafes and around the corner from Creperie Josselin (a dynamite crepe restaurant). Delambre has a few cafes and two boucheries that had some tasty pastries.

The front desk staff is cheerful and professional and speaks some English. We chose the club room, which was newly renovated and opened out onto a quiet courtyard. While the room was quite cramped (as I always expect in Paris), the bathroom was particularly spacious and bright with fancy shabby chic fixtures and toiletries from Provence. It even had a bathtub. Perhaps it was due to the low season, but we got a fantastic deal of 150 euros a night, which included the hotel's generous breakfast buffet for two and a half bottle of excellent champagne (the real deal--not sparkling wine). Wifi is free throughout the hotel (just get a code at the front desk) and non-alocholic beverages in the mini bar are all-you-can-drink for 6 euros.

Rooms The rooms are small, but that's common in Europe.The bathroom was a pretty good size though. The bed was comfortable. The TV offered free movies...a nice perk when taking a rest from all your walking around Paris. The walls seem to be pretty thin, as we could hear conversations from neighboring rooms. We never struggled sleeping though. Despite being on a street, the street noise is minimal. The only time we noticed it was early in the morning a couple days when some louder trucks would make some deliveries nearby. If we were spending a lot of time in the room, we would probably start to feel cramped. But, when you are in Paris, you shouldn't be hanging out in the room that much. The room was just what it needed to be. Staff Every staff member spoke English and was incredibly helpful. We asked for a restaurant recommendation, they gave us a business card of a restaurant very close to the hotel-and it was the best meal we had on our vacation! They ask for you to leave the room key at the front desk every time you leave the hotel. This wasn't a problem and probably prevented us from losing the key somewhere in Paris. Breakfast At first, the breakfast seems expensive. They charge 9 euros for coffee, orange juice, and a croissant. You would think you could find something cheaper in the area, but we struggled to find anything comparable. The full buffet breakfast is twice as much and probably not worth it. But this smaller, Parisian breakfast is convenient. Honesty Bar In the afternoon and evening, they put out a variety of drinks (wine, beer, liquor, etc.). It's up to you to serve yourself, write down what you had, and then leave the paper with the front desk. There are definitely cheaper bar options nearby; however, this was another nice convenience that we used once or twice. Internet The wifi service is very spotty. When it does work, it is slow. But it's enough to allow you to check your email, etc. There is a computer hooked up to a printer in the lobby that was also convenient. The Look Every area of the hotel was clean and pleasing to look at. From the seating area in the lobby to the hallways and rooms, it is a nice looking place. The elevator is tiny (3 person max). To get our luggage upstairs, we had to make a couple trips on the elevator. Location This is probably the biggest selling point of the hotel. Montparnasse is a great area to be in. It has a lot going on without the seediness of other areas. Two metro stops on two different lines were less than 5 minutes away from the hotel. This made for easy access to all the sights of Paris, the RER trains, etc. There are a ton of great restaurants in the area- La Coupole, Le Parc Aux Cerfs are both must haves.

At check-in, my husband and I were met by a very kind and accommodating desk clerk, then spent the rest of the week wondering where she went. Out of the four clerks we encountered at the Lenox, she seemed to be the only one who wasn't merely tolerating us. Our experiences with the other three included rolling eyes when we reported a blown circuit in our room (it was my fault, to be fair - but I tried contritely to explain what happened); a complete inability by one clerk to give any comment at all on the food at the Italian restaurant directly across the street from the hotel (it is excellent, by the way); a harumph when we accidentally left our key in the room at checkout (this hotel requires you to give your key to the front desk every time you leave the hotel), even though the same desk clerk was absent when we returned the night before and we had to wait for approximately 10 minutes to get into our room, and the same guy failed to call a cab for our early morning departure, even though we asked him to do so the night before. We are not high-maintenance travelers and always try to be polite (we both have imperfect but improving French), so were disappointed by the attitude, particularly given that we have never run into it during our stays at other hotels in Paris. All other amenities at this hotel are commendable. Rooms are not that small in comparison to others we have stayed in in the city, french doors open to street with noise that was not enough to keep us up at night (when doors closed), the room and bathroom were impeccably clean, and the bed comfortable. Internet was sketchy and cable TV reception was intermittent (but really who cares - we were in Paris). The hotel location is outstanding. It sits within a block in each direction between two metro stops, is walkable to most Left Bank attractions including stores and Luxembourg gardens, sports a grocery store, bakeries and wine and cheese shops on the same street, and is surrounded by excellent cafes and restaurants. All in all, the Lenox is a good hotel and we had a wonderful stay in Paris, but sadly it was not enhanced by 3/4 of the front desk staff.

I had emailed ahead of time concerned about booking excursions and they were very helpful with getting me all the information and booking those ahead of time.

The hotel is in a very good location near to three metro stops (Vavin, Edgar Quinet and Montparnasse Bienvenue) and many bars, restaurants, bakeries and two supermarkets. You can see the Montparnasse tower if you have a street view - it's that close! The hotel is in a lovely old building and is decorated in a contemporary style, we booked a club room and it was not the largest room in the world but it was fine, a queen bed, desk, colour tv, safe, fridge/mini bar (they didn't mind you putting your own food and drink in it), chair, stool and wardrobe. Other guests have commented on how small the rooms are and I would imagine that a standard size room would be small, my advice would be to book either a club or junior suite (if you can stretch to it). The bathroom was quite small but had a shower, bath tub and loo. One thing I would say is that the room was cleaned to a very high standard every day and was spotless. French windows opened onto a balcony, lovely on a warm evening with a glass of wine watching the world go by. Free WiFi and also when we were there, free films in your room. We had a street view room and it was quite noisy early morning when the bin men arrived, the double glazing shut a lot of noise out but if you are a light sleeper than ask for a courtyard room. The maids also began work quite early and it wasn't too easy to have a lie in - but hey you are in Paris so get up! The staff on the front desk were without exception wonderful, all spoke good English - but give French a try as it is really appreciated. On our next to last day, they organised an early morning wake up call (4.15am), a private taxi to the airport and printed out my boarding passes for me. If you want a boutique hotel experience then give this hotel a try, for the price, location and experience it is really worth the money.

My boyfriend was looking for a good location for a low price, so without squatting in some youth hostel (and we are certainly not youths) we went for a moderately priced niceish hotel. Of course, this is Paris, so moderately priced is still pricey. Our room was tiny. Full sized (not quite Queen) bed took up most of it with a tv and small desk near the window. Bathroom is small with a tiny shower as well (not as small as some I've used in the UK). Comfort-wise, I am very pleased. The bed, though a bit on the soft side, was very cozy. We had four pillows all of different type (hard, soft, but all synthetic) to choose from. The room has an electric forced-air heat and cooling system which made for nice overall room comfort. We were right in front of the elevator but I never really had much complaints about noise. The most noise came from outside late at night but died down around midnight, thankfully. Noise in the morning started around 7 but Sunday was very quiet. Apparently there is a noise ordinance in Paris, which makes me happy. No loud thumping music from nearby clubs to worry about. There is a bar-restaurant downstairs if you are desparate, but at 9eur for 1 croissant, coffee and juice, don't bother. We just went to the plethora of surrounding cafes and got breakfast there. They also have sort of an honor system for what you take from the bar (drink wise), write a note on what you took, to be added to your bill. Didn't indulge but I'm not sure this is the wisest thing for a business. Anyway, about the internet. If you are here on business and need constantly good wireless, DO NOT stay here. I don't know what it is about hotels but I've rarely had a consistent connection and this was one of the worst. If you plan at all to visit non-French sites, be prepared for the connection time to be so long that it is timed-out. French sites, not at all kidding, are usually fine. The wireless connection at times would drop without warning or would be supposedly connected with no actual internet access. Otherwise, when it worked it was fast. For instance while I was writing this review, the internet decided it was too tired to connect again to this website, despite Google for instance working fine. The bathroom could have used a bleaching and lime de-scaling.

I never had an issue, however, it was always in the back of my mind every time I left the hotel. In addition, I would not recommend the buffet breakfast offered by the hotel. We opted to eat it on the day we were leaving because it was convenient, however, it was expensive and the selection was poor. I just was not impressed by the meal. The location is superb, just a few steps from the Vavin metro stop. The street has a couple of boulangeries (bakeries), as well as a charcuterie (butcher), a poissonerie (fish) and a small grocery store, which made it very easy to pick something up to eat quickly. At the intersection where the Vavin metro stop is located, there are numerous restaurants. I highly recommend Les Fondus de la Raclette down Boulevard Raspail just a little bit. If you've never had Raclette before, it is absolutely delicious. We were given a room on the street side and while there were some noise issues, it was not nearly as bad to me as some reviewers say it is. Especially with the window closed, you could rarely hear any of the street noise, and we were only 3 floors up. Overall, the hotel was fabulous and I would definitely stay there again. The location was very convenient to the Metro, which is all you need in Paris to get around. Highly recommended!", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cNothing much to say, just very good!!\u201d", "Author": "basvince", "ReviewID": "UR106869152", "Content": "Well what can i say about hotel lenox montparnasse? Nothing in particular, its just a very good hotel! We stayed at the hotel for a short honeymoon trip to paris. First of all, the receptionists are all very kind and very helpfull. We asked if it was possible to get a room at the back of the hotel. It wasn't a problem and we got an upgrade automatically. Dont expect large rooms in paris! Ours was spacious enough and a complete and very clean bathroom with even a bidet! The bed was small but very comfortable and enough pillows available. The room was equipped with a very silent airconditioning, but we didn't use it because it was possible to leave the window open (it was that quiet!). Wifi and pay TV was included and worked very good! One of the very strong points of the hotel is its location. In a quiet street just between 2 metrolines with a station at every end of the street. Around the corners you find the area of montparnasse which is a very nice and safe area with lots of good restaurants. Within 5 minutes walking distance you'll find montparnasse graveyard, the catacombes, tour montparnasse and jardin the luxembourg. There is a breakfast buffet offered at the hotel. I can't review the quality of it, but it looked very nice. There are 2 very good pastrie bakeries in the street so we had breakfast there. The hotelbar has a unique formula. You can get your own drink from the bar and write down every consumption. You can use the hotelbar till 2 am!

There are numerous businesses that have trucks unload beginning very early in the morning with the CINEMA lights turning BRIGHTLY on at 6 am after having been off only a few hours.. In addition there appears to be a TRASH CAN Processing Plant next to the CINEMA. SO, on trash days, the receptacles were NOISILY emptied in and out of the doors which NOISILY opened pre-dawn hours across the street. Trucks servicing the businesses were backed up on the street prior to 7 am. I counted 5 Police cars with Sirens that used this Street as a cross through to their destination. My room, was on the second floor. When I arrived, the central air conditioning that they advertised as a feature was not working. The room smelled musty and I ended up buying flowers as the front desk said the air conditioning wasn't working. The carpet in my bedroom, seemed vacuumed, but not cleaned. There were two towels which were stained or dirty and appeared to be left over from the previous occupants of the room. The towels were not replaced everyday and the tile in the bathroom floor was cracked...If I paid $40 per night, this is what I could have expected and lived with.

We appreciated very much the hotel bar, where you can enjoy a very good breakfast: it's well-appointed, with a small lounge, where you can relax after a day of work, or, like us, after a day spent walking to see the city; a soft music helps to create a relaxing atmosphere. The offer for the breakfast is wide and diversified, but we appreciated the possibility to have a light breakfast, composed by a hot drink (cappuccino, tea, ...) and a croissant, like we are used to have and with a lower cost.

Though the hotel rooms are quite small by North American standards, the site is a tranquil safe harbour, extremely clean and with all the amenities you might need. Plus the staff speak great English and are only too happy to help you with directions, restaurant reservations, taxis, you name it. I'm definitely returning when I come back to Paris. Here are some more specific thoughts: - very small hotel, only 50 or so rooms, nestled in a narrow street - fantastic location -- there are boulangeries on either side, a supermarket (Franprix), tons of restaurants at either end of the street, nearby metro and a train station (Gare Montparnasse, which you can use to get to Versailles in 25 mins). In fact, each day we made a point to just set out walking from the hotel into Paris, e.g. the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower. Everything is easy to get to. - rooms are quite small, but very clean, with flat-screen TV (they even included free movies for us), free Wi-Fi, and an excellent bathroom. We were in a room that had a kind of balcony fire escape, but it was perfect because we used it to store flats of soda and beer (we were there in January). - the vibe of the hotel is like a city mansion -- it has a big central carpeted staircase and a teeny elevator, and you never hear any noise from outside. Sometimes the odd ambient noise from other guests, but nothing too distressing. - they offer a breakfast each day, served in a very nice, cute restaurant-bar, about 15 euros for a full spread (you can get a cheaper one, just juice and pastry, but we preferred the bigger breakfast). Didn't get breakfast every day, but when we did it was great (and the lady who manages the area is lovely). As I said, there are pastry shops a stone's throw away, so you can always get a pain au chocolat there and walk it off LOL. We also occasionally bought baguettes and ham/cheese in the market for a nice impromptu and hugely satisfying lunch. - if you're a drinker, the bar is an honor bar ... you just mark down what you drink, as though it were a mini-bar. - Montparnasse Cemetary is right around the corner if you want a quick tourist fix (e.g. the graves of Samuel Beckett, Jean Seberg, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir etc.) When going to a big city, I'm used to getting scammed by \"value\" hotels. This place was a refreshing reminder that there are decent establishments still out there.

We really weren't disappointed when we stayed at the hotel for a few days in January 2011. Our hotel room was situated on the third floor- it wasn't a particularly big room but it was certainly a comfortable size and had a pretty balcony; the room was was nicely decorated, had a large (and ridiculously comfortable) bed, and was impeccably clean. There was also a welcome folder in the room which gave you lots of information about the hotel etc., as well as things like a map of the metro and train lines which we found very useful! The room also had a safe, a mini bar, tea and coffee making facilities, and a TV which also incorporated free internet. I loved the area where the hotel is situated- it is on a fairly quiet street in Montparnasse. It's a nice area with lots of little cafes and bistros which really come to life in the evenings, as well as a range of boutique styled shops. The metro stations are really close to the hotel as well- the most convenient we found to be the Edgar Quinet station at the top of the road. We never had breakfast at the hotel because it's quite expensive- we preferred to go and try different places nearby. There is a lot of choice nearby if you want to try something different. I think that it is the staff that really makes this hotel stand out as fantastic because they are all so helpful and friendly. Every single member of staff at the hotel really strives to go the extra mile to help you- one even helped us to find a vegetarian restaurant nearby the hotel. Their standard of English is very good and they really make you feel welcome.

It's not a massive hotel and the street it's on is not particularly beautiful by Parisien standards. However, it's in a vibrant-enough spot with lots of bars, restaurants, cafe's, creperies etc. nearby and a supermarket three doors down. It's within a couple of minutes walk of three Metro stations for easy access to most of the city and the Paris metro is a doddle, so definitely use it!! It's also only about 10 mins walk to both the entrance to the Catacombs and the Montparnasse Tower (stunning views over Paris). So overall, a pretty decent location. The room we had was small-ish, but absolutely comfortable for me and my partner and I wasn't exactly expecting anything massive considering it's Paris! The room was extremely tidy, clean and well maintained with a nice bathroom. The bed was very comfy and we both slept really well during our stay. There was a bit of occasional noise from the road outside, but really nothing significant at all. The staff were extremely nice and friendly throughout and all spoke good English (although we were trying our best to speak to them in French as much as possible!). There was free WIFI which seemed to work OK and all TV (including the pay-per-view movies) was free throughout our stay (I'm not sure if that's normal or something they did especially over the new year period). The honesty bar was great and it was really nice to help ourselves to a drink or two in the evening or just before going out somewhere. Breakfast was not included and a full breakfast was a little pricey at 15 euros, but these prices were pretty common for food throughout Paris to be honest and at least you could eat as much as you wanted and set yourself up for the day. You could easily go to one of the local cafe's and find a cheaper breakfast option anyway if you wanted. I spoke to another couple who were staying in a hotel around the corner and they had been very disappointed with their cramped rooms and been forced to upgrade to a suite. They'd also paid more than at the Lenox, so I felt pretty chuffed with my hotel choice! In summary, the Lenox Montparnasse is good value, very clean, staff are friendly and the location is pretty decent too. I'd definitely recommend it and would stay there again there for sure.

I ve seen some of the reviews saying that everything is very small- yes it is!!! But in Paris everything is small. I guess if you want to have something big, you should go in Las Vegas. We felt great here and everybody were so friendly to us! Location was great, so we were very close to the most of things to see in Paris. When we talk about food, we can say that the breakfast was great, way bigger then we expected it to be. For sure, when we get back to Paris, we will stay here again.

Hotel Lenox Montparnasse was our first hotel and I was super excited about it after reading the reviews on TA, as well as looking at pictures of the hotel. When we arrived, the staff were very helpful and gave us our room right away. Our room was beautiful and full of character, small but very clean. We had room 34 facing the street w/ a beautiful window w/ Romeo & Juliet balcony. The one BIG negative, in my opinion, was that the bathroom was TINY. If you weigh more than 150lbs, I don't think that you will fit in the shower. That wouldn't have mattered that much, but then I noticed disgusting mold all over the shower. I was completely grossed out as we paid $200/night to stay here and I would expect a little more for that kind of money. However, this was my first trip to Paris, so maybe I had unrealistic expectations. The shower curtain is stingy and there is no way to stop the floor from getting wet. Maybe we just got the short end of the stick. We didn't bother complaining b/c we were worried that we would get something worse &, overall, how much time do you spend in the shower on vacation anyway? If you are a light sleeper, be aware that the walls are pretty thin so hopefully you won't get a noisy neighbor. Also, the staff were very friendly but I asked about where to exchange currency and the lady at the front desk had no idea. I thought that that would be a fairly common question that tourists might ask, but I guess not. However, the location is great w/ 2 train stations very close by, Vavin to the right and Edgar Quinet to the Left. There were tons of places to eat right next to the hotel. Breakfast was $12euro per person @ the hotel, but we never had it as there are 2 bakeries on the same block where you can buy a croissant for $1Eu.

Although the festival was fantastic, by 6am we were freezing and tired and decided to go to the Lenox (where we'd stored our bags the previous day) to see if we could get a room! When we arrived there wasn't any rooms left however the guy at reception couldn't be more helpful and said we could have a coffee and rest in breakfast room and he'd try to get us into our room early. After a couple hours sleep in the breakfast room we were ready to go again and even though we couldn't get into the room early it didn't matter because by 9am we were warm and rested so spent the morning walking around the markets until we checked in at 1pm (still an hour early). The room (room 56) was very spacious with private balcony, large bathroom (with bath) and huge double bed. The receptionist explained that all movies on the tv were free - even though we didn't come to Paris to watch movies, when sightseeing from 9am-5pm it was nice to sleep or watch a movie for a couple hours before going out in the evenings. We had breakfast included in our room so took full advantage of the eggs,sausages, bacon, bread, croissants, cereals and fruit salad which filled us up until well into the afternoon. Also coffee is served every afternoon in the breakfast room which is nice after a full day of walking. Rue Delambre has a supermarket, cheese shop, bakery, butchers and several restaurants. At either end is Vavin metro and Edgar Quinet metro as well as Gare Montparnasse a couple minutes walk.

The only complaints - albeit minimal is that the TV and cable had issues both nights we were there - the 1st night the movie was almost unviewable - the second the service kept going out and then locking up the TV - Sebastin had to reset it and I had to reset twice after that. Also one strange requirement that I had never encountered before is that you were required to leave your key at the front desk upon leaving. I was told that it was so the chamber service would know if they could clean your room - I was uncomfortable with this as all your possessions are in the room and your only real proof that you are a guest is the possession of the room key - but alas nothing to worry about and it turned out to be a delightful hotel stay indeed.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in a Great Location\u201d", "Author": "eneumeyer", "ReviewID": "UR77798936", "Content": "We went to Paris for two weeks for our honeymoon in August. We picked this hotel because of the high recommendations on this site. We weren't let down at all! Cleanliness - Pretty standard, housekeeping did a very good job, the place was always immaculate. Location - Probably one of the best points. It is right near Montparnasse tower, numerous restaurants, and the Vavin metro station. The Montparnasse train station is also a 10-15min walk away which is where the Air France coach bus stops from CDG Airport, and Orly. The bus was more expensive to take than the RER line from the airport, but much more relaxing than the busy train with a connection. Rooms - I would give this place five stars if they were just a bit bigger. I understand that hotels in Paris and Europe are smaller than North America, and I've traveled all over Europe. When we first came to Paris for our first week, the room was perfect. It was a queen bed, with a fairly large bathroom. No complaints at all. We then went to the Czech Republic for a few days to visit family. When we returned, we had a much smaller room with a double bed. I must have accidentally booked the smaller room on expedia. The room was tiny which was ok, but the bathroom was much too small. In the shower if I really had to make sure that I didn't swing around and hit the shower handle to burn or freeze myself! I'm also a very slim guy, so I can't imagine how it would be for bigger people. This is no fault to the hotel at all, it's as advertised, but if I were you, I would spend a bit more Euros and book the larger room with the queen bed. It's way better! Service - The service was so good! The staff was always smiling and friendly. Our flight from Vancouver came in early in the morning, and we arrived at the hotel at around 10am, looking like zombies! We really wanted a quick nap before we headed out to see the sights. I wasn't sure if this would work since normally you have to check in to hotels in the afternoon. The front desk clerk, Sebastian, saw that we were tired and had the room made up right away, within the hour. We were so thankful! The service here was so much better than the \"stereotypical\" French service we had at the CDG airport hotel later in our trip. Value - Everything seemed fair, the honesty bar in the room was expensive, but that's to be expected at a hotel. I'm not sure why so many people rave about the bar at the hotel, it's nice but I find it expensive. Go out to the numerous bars and cafes that are right down the street for better prices and ambiance! Overall though, I felt I got my money's worth with this hotel. Sleep Quality - Good, much better in the queen bed than the double bed, make sure to book it if you are going with a spouse / partner! Overall this hotel was great.

During our stay we traveled around Paris & I would suggest that Montparnasse is one of the better areas. All the other reviewers have identified so many positives about this place which I would whole heartedly support, it is difficult to identify any faults with it. The reception service was great, Julia was our favourite on reception always happy and very courteous, her English was very good, but also she was very understanding, but encouraging when I was making a poor attempt at French! We were in room 59, the bathroom was large and had a lovely big window to the courtyard. The rooms are not huge, but we were there for 7 nights and did not at any point feel claustrophobic in any way. Any issues were dealt with immediately, the shower head was not working well the first morning, I advised Julia on reception and it was sorted by the lunch time. We forgot a converter plug and ask at reception where we could get one from and Julia once again came up with the goods by providing one for a returnable deposit of 10 euros. There were about 8 or 9 english very recent blockbuster films that were free on the televisions and could be paused at any time, also internet was available on the TV and we were also able to log on to the wireless network with my husbands IPad after receiving a code from the reception. There are tea and coffee making facilities and a safe in the room. The breakfast was great and although appear very expensive, are on a par to much of Paris. There is also free tea and coffee in the afternoon in the bar, with biscuits. Paris of course is very expensive, be aware that you could be looking at 4 or 5 euros for half a pint of lager, although some of the bars do happy hours, so worth looking out for. We were prepared for the expense and therefore it was not actually too much of a shock. Some the highlights and must do's of the area are * Montparnasse tour- view of whole of paris from roof top of 56 floor building. * Catacombs, by Montparnasse cemetery. Tunnels with 6 million Parisian bones in from 18th Century! Jardin du Luxembourg- 10 min walk max from hotel, lovely gardens, palace, band stand with live bands in the band stand, lots of chairs around to sit down on, lots of birds, lots of opportunity for people watching! We spent nearly every afternoon down there, eating a baguette and reading a book! Metro links excellent, Vavin and Edgar Quinet at either ends of Rue Delambre the street the hotel is on. FYI We bought a five day pass for the metro, these can be found on the net etc, but if you are buying a ticket to travel on the metro on daily basis, you only need to buy one ticket which costs about 1Euro 70cents for the whole of the journey even if you swap metro lines, the ticket is used in effect to get into the station from the outside, if that makes sense and once you leave the metro, it is obsolete. You can also purchase a book of 10 on these tickets. One downside of Paris, although I think it is common of many capital cities, there were lots of beggars....it was quite sad, but weirdly, you kind of get use to it after a while! Final thing, we went from 25th July to 1st August, a few shops and restaurants were closed when we arrived due to holidays and were not reopening until Sept, there were not that many so it did not affect us too much, but the day we left a lot more closed and I think that probably would have had an impact, so I would suggest if possible you avoid the month of August.

I was traveling with my teenage son, and we spent 8 nights. The folks at the front desk were always helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. I'd visited Paris several years ago, and also had been to London and Athens, so had an idea what to expect when it comes to European hotels -- smaller rooms, limited amenities. But the Lenox was top notch. The room was neat, clean, and met our needs. When in Paris, you're not going to spend hours hanging around the hotel. But when we were there, we were comfortable and taken care of. The TV was the computer monitor, and that worked just fine. You also could connect to the internet thru the computer, but that was a bit sketchy at times. It's always a great perk now to have free wireless in the room. We were given a code when we checked in, and it ran out after 7 days. There was no problem in getting a new code for the extra day and a half. They also had a public computer in the lobby that was helpful. The location was perfect -- right between a pair of Metro stops (Edgar Quinet and Vavin) within steps. Montparnasse is a bustling neighborhood, and we never lacked finding anything. There was a grocery store steps down the block, and a couple of pastry shops to choose from. We mostly ate in the neighborhood -- Italian, Chinese, and a couple of cafes. No complaints on any front. And altho the area was bustling, it was quiet at night despite having a theater right across the street. We made trips to the French Open, Versailles, and also to the beaches of Normandy. Again, having the two Metro lines so close made trips to those various different direction very convenient. I'm trying to think of some complaints ... but would be hard-pressed. Again, you don't spend much time in the room, but at night we clicked on the TV, and I have to say that the channel selections for Americans is VERY limited. CNN Intl., and BBC was about it. Would be nice to have some sort of ESPN or something off the satellite that shows any kind of American programming. As for food ... perhaps if they offered some sort of Continental breakfast? Few hotels do, it would seem. They did offer something for several Euros, but we hit the pastry shops instead. Also, there was an honor bar fridge, so we cleared out some of the stuff in there and filled it with our purchases from the grocery store down the block -- juice, water, snacks. If you're an American and want the taste of America, there was a Starbucks and a McDonald's in the neighborhood.

It also had a very adequate bathroom with a nice tub and a rolling cart with shelves on which to put all your toiletries. It looked exactly like the picture on their website so no surprises. The room had a view of a rooftop and a courtyard which was behind the hotel. I found it to be quiet but I always sleep with earplugs and my husband could sleep through anything! The air conditioning worked great which was a real plus since it was very hot while we were there. What was very nice about the hotel was the lounge downstairs. Since the rooms are pretty small it was nice to be able to go there and relax with a book or just a cup of coffee or glass of wine with nice jazz music in the background. They have an honesty bar now, no bartender, and you can just make your own drink and let them know what you drank. Easy and no waiting! Tea and coffee are free. As far as the breakfasts go - we thought they were a bit expensive,(15.5 euros for the full breakfast) but soon learned the real advantage was a very big breakfast (eggs, cheeses, meats, yogurt, fresh juices, several bread choices etc.) was not over priced and also since it was all ready to go you could really save some time if you wanted to get to the Louvre when it opened! If you go to the cafes for breakfast it can sometimes take over an hour to get coffee and a croissant and cost almost as much in the end. We loved the cafes, but saved them for the afternoon when our feet were tired and we really needed a rest. A few other niceties were the free internet, the friendly, helpful staff, and the great location if you're looking for a fun vibrant area close to LOTS of cafes and little restaurants. Be aware though that those little restaurants often don't even open until 8 pm. It was also located close to all the modes of transportation, metro, train, and buses. One last item - it was my husband's birthday while we were there and our friends called the hotel and arranged for them to buy us a very nice bottle of wine for our room and when we returned from sight seeing for the day it was waiting in our room with two wine glasses on a nice silver tray with a corkscrew and nice note.

It's a fine little hotel that provided everything we wanted and needed at a reasonable price. The staff is incredibly helpful (Sebastian especially) and the Lenox is located in a charming neighborhood with many cafes and restaurants and excellent access to several Metro lines as well as the RER trains. The hotel is nicely appointed and well managed, although by no means palatial. We toured the City all day and our room provided a clean and quiet respite when we returned in the evenings. We only slept and showered in our room -- didn't spend much time there since we came to see Paris. Of course, the rooms are smaller than what Americans are accustomed to, but when you go to Europe you need to leave your New World assumptions behind. (Cities, streets are buildings that are 300 to 400 years old tend to be smaller than our suburban sprawls that were built for the automobile.) We did not experience any problems with noise from other rooms or from the outside. A few tips that I wish I had known before going. 1.) A grocery store (FranPrix) is located 40 paces to your right as you walk out the hotel. You can buy a six pack of Heineken in bottles for less than the cost of one beer at a cafe; they also carry a nice selection of wine, cheese, fresh-baked bread and fresh fruit. So buy a picnic lunch and enjoy it in the nearby Luxembourg gardens. 2.) Buy a packet of ten Metro tickets at the window (About $14 US). The ticket machines didn't always work for us. (There is a setting for English instructions, but it's hard to find; plus not all the machines appear to work with a US credit card) Metro is cheap and easy way to get around, and there are three different lines within a few blocks of the Lenox Hotel. Learn the system on your first day; then go where you want to go. (Skip the tourista buses, particularly if you only have a few days in Paris.) 3.) Spend some time strolling around the Montparnasse neighborhood. There are many excellent cafes and restaurants. Sushi (there are a few places nearby) was about the only meal we found that was less expensive in Paris than in the US. Around the corner on Montparnasse Blvd. is Le Relais de l'Entrec\u00c3\u00b4te which serves a delicious steak with an excellent \"secret sauce\" and the best french fries you have ever tasted. (Also a good value because a second helping is included.) 4.) It is said that the Montparnasse Tower offers the best views of Paris because you don't have to look at the Monparnasse Tower. It's very expensive to go to the observation floor, but a waiter told us you can go the bar (a floor or two below) and order a drink and still get the same views. All things considered, I would highly recommend the Hotel Lenox if you are looking for a clean, comfortable hotel in a nice Parisian neighborhood at a reasonable price. (Yes, there are a few negative reviews on TripAdvisor, but they strike me as rather whiny.)

Alas we did not have time to sample any of the drinks available at the well stocked honesty bar (yes, such things do still exist) but the same room in the hotel was superbly presented the following morning for breakfast. The 15 Euro breakfast option included eggs, bacon and sausage along with a variety of cold meats, cheese, fruits and exquisite croissants and breads. Fresh orange or grapefruit juice and the usual tea, coffee or chocolate added the finishing touches. Again, the staff were charming and helpful. Complimentary afternoon tea and cookies might be a temptation if you want to relax for a while. The location is ideal for heading off to see the big sights of Paris but is also better than most if you want to mingle with the Parisiennes and enjoy some caf\u00c3\u00a9 culture. The Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de la Place at the end of the road was one our favourites and came as a recommendation from the hotel. The Wednesday morning also saw a good market selling fresh fruits and vegetables, trinkets, clothes and bags. Turn left out of the hotel and head towards the Edgar Quinet Metro, just two minutes walk along Rue Delambre. Other reviews extol the vast range of cafes, bistros and other shops all within a short walk and you will surely find whatever you are looking for.

The hotel is fine, well located, fair rates (in comparison to other similar hotels in Paris), and clean. All staff members speak English and some of them speak also Spanish. They all were very kind. There is a bar in which you can have a breakfast from 7 to 11 am (15 euro per person per day is expensive but similar to other hotels), and a small business center. There are no more facilities in the hotel. Rooms are small but comfortable: a table with a chair, a coffee maker, a small fridge and safe. Housekeeping is very good indeed. Check-in and check-out processes were quick and easy. There are lot of caf\u00c3\u00a9s, a Franprix supermarket, several restaurants, patisseries and boulangeries very close to the hotel.

For most of the attractions you will need the Metro, but taking a train at Vavin (1 minute) or Edgar Quinet (3 minutes) metro stations you will go wherever you want. The TV system includes Internet and offer new movies (free!) but it really did not work properly and nobody fixed the problem during the whole week.

I tried to add 1 night to my stay the day before I arrived -- and found that the rate had gone up to almost 200 USD/night. For that rate, I might try to stay somewhere else. But, then again, Paris is not expensive in May and when I booked I might have gotten the Winter rate. The hotel very nicely added my extra night at the lower rate! (I booked through expedia) The wireless internet connection in my room on the 5th floor was outstanding. If you are looking for a big hotel room, you might want to stay elsewhere. In Paris, that means either paying a LOT of money or staying in a less-desirable neighborhood. I stayed in Les 3 Poussins last year -- the rooms there are much bigger, but I didn't like the neighborhood so much. The room there even had a small kitchen. I cannot comment on the breakfast, only to say that it is 15 Euros.... so I went to the bakery 4 doors down and the grocery store 2 doors down to make my own breakfast.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cThe perfect hotel\u201d", "Author": "Berg2010", "ReviewID": "UR66070849", "Content": "We loved the Lenox Montparnasse!

The site is spotless, the street has little traffic and there are a countless good bars/restaurants and historical sites within walking distance and/or easy Metro access. I'm not a Parisian building expert, but I suspect this hotel was once adapted from an apartment house. Whoever did this conversion did a remarkable job. The lobby/bar areas have marble floors and trendy/modern finishes. The hotel is charming, comfortable and cozy. We stayed here 2 days. We opted for an upgrade at check-in to a suite; room 54. One thing to note about room 54 is that the toilet is in a separate area from the sink and bathtub. Since there is no sink in this toilet room, it requires that you go to the sink/bathtub room to wash your hands; nothing too horrible, but certainly something to note. The room has above-average wall-to-wall carpeting and the bathroom areas have marble floors and walls and new plumbing fixtures. The suite itself is about the size of a standard U.S. room with a nice balcony overlooking the street in front of the hotel. Our suite had a fireplace, which I'm sure was once functional but is now just a showpiece. It was nonetheless, a nice touch that we both appreciated. Included in the room is free WIFI/internet and movies that we utilized without issue. We did notice that the noise from adjacent rooms was rather high and on occasion we we're awakened by the noise from the early-morning trash pick-up. Most notable was the bathroom noise from the room above ours and the late arrival of guests on our last night. We would characterize the noise issues as being acceptable for a hotel of this type of architecture. The staff was very helpful. We would like to especially note the efficient check-in process and presentation, which was outstanding.

It's on a relatively quiet street that is just off a very-busy street. It is very close to two metro stations (both within a block). The stop you need for most of the sites is the Edgar Quinet and the other one is Vavin. This also makes it easy to take a train from CDG.

They also told us how to get to the places we wanted to get to and arranged for a shuttle to take us to the airport upon our departure (we had enough of the train by the time we left). 3. The rooms/decor/bed were great. The room as fairly small, but I expected much smaller given what I had heard of Paris hotel rooms. I was comfortable in it and I'm used to U.S.-sized rooms. And, it was clean/modern. The free internet was a nice touch. Lastly, it's all non-smoking, which was great. 4. The hotel was a tremendous value. We paid $160 through hotels.com.

Overall my expectations were met. Only two small things were slightly bothersome, which I'll explain after I go through everything we enjoyed. The location is astounding, if you want to be away from the crowds, but want access to everything this is the place. The Metro is right down the street as well as an ATM, a grocery store, a pharmacy, and tons of cafes and bars and pastry shops everywhere. All it takes is a mile walk through the gorgeous Montparnasse area and you're at the Seine right across from the Louvre. A little farther out and you're at Notre Dame Cathedral and very close to the Latin Quarter. The Hotel itself is clean and the lobby and adjoining bar area are smartly decorated and give it a nice little ambience. On arriving we met Fuzia (sp?) and she was courteous and helpful. The rooms are very well maintained and the beds are comfortable. WIFI is free as well as any PPV movies on the TV. Our room faced the street, the terrace doors are from floor to ceiling and open out onto a tiny terrace. So there's ample ventilation and outside light. The bathroom was very clean, the fixtures all seemed fairly new, and there was a combo tub/shower that instead of a shower curtain used a swinging pane of glass that covered about half the tub. A little odd at first, but perfectly fine for us. If you have a hanging toiletry bag, it would help considerably as there is not a lot of counter space. The blow dryer worked well and we requsted an iron several mornings and it was delivered immediately. The elevator is tiny, so if you have large suitcases, you'll probably have to go one at a time! Echoing other reviews here, I'd also skip the relatively expensive breakfast and simply walk down to the main Montparnasse Blvd and hit the Patisserie shop on the corner. We ate ample quiche and pastries here every morning for under 6-8 euros. The turn-down service was IMPECCABLE. We would leave around 7-8 am every morning and come back for a small break around 3-4pm and find a spotless room with fresh towels every day. There is an electronic Do Not Distturb button, which malfunctioned the one day we decided to sleep in haha, and we had to tell them several times \"Non merci!\" The front desked fixed it immediately. One night after midnight our safe wouldn't open and we called the frontdesk, he was there in less than a minute gave us a safe key. Overall, very courteous efficient staff and a very nice clean hotel. One glaring ommission that the staff didn't explain was that there is some heavy construction going on in that section of the rue Delambre. We wake up early and I can sleep through almost anything, but my fiancee is not an easy sleeper and could hear it as early as 4:30am. In addition, you might hear a very loud trash truck. As far as local restaurant recommendations, the information we received was more of a cursory \"Why yes there many of them down the street\" versus a \"Well what exactly are you looking for?\" If you are a foodie, you're obviously going to do the research on your own anyway. If you are very hungry after your long trip to Paris and want something fast, relatively inexpensive and unpretentious, and fresh and good quality. Go to EXKI. It's right around the corner and down Montparnasse blvd a bit. It's kind of like a Panera bread, just eco-friendly and all natural. If I was going to return to Paris and stay in this district, I would stay at the Lenox again in a heart beat.

I have marked lower for sleep quality because the hotel is on a street with a couple of bars and one or two shouters may bother some people.

The front desk was helpful on the many occasions we had cause to speak to the staff there during our stay, and check-in was no exception. Prompt and speedy meant we were quickly up in our room and settling in for the night after a late arrival. The room was on the fourth floor and was an upgrade to a club room (offered to us, not requested). Having stayed in many hotels in recent years, I'm not sure what the upgrade here really offered abover the norm, but having heard poor reviews of other hotels, we were happy with our room. It was very small, but the bathroom was much more spacious than I expected with a small bath in it, which we were glad of after days walking in the freezing temperatures of wintry Paris. The room had free internet access via the television and a wifi keyboard, plus there was a terminal downstairs from which we were able to print boarding passes. Tea and coffee facilities were also provided, plus there was a mini-bar if needed. Downstairs by reception was a lounge, very modern and comfortable in decor, in which breakfast was served at a fairly reasonable rate for hotels (the options start at approx. 8 euros for caf\u00c3\u00a9 complet). We tended to go to a local bakery for pain au chocolat, but did have breakfast one morning and it was fine. Later in the day there is free tea and coffee offered in the lounge, and for evenings an honesty bar is offered. All the usual array of drinks are laid out together with sheets for you to tally up your drinks and hand it in to reception. We were impressed - it really gave us a welcoming feel as the lounge did indeed feel more like home from home. The location in Montparnasse is great - we were on a street with two metro stations, one at each end, and if you are interested in the surrealists, one of them had a studio in one of the rooms of the hotel, and another lived down the street. Two streets up we found a street full of creperie's and about 100 yards from the hotel is the intersection with La Coupole and Le Select, two of the classic art deco cafe's where people have come to watch the world go by for decades. Although Montparnasse is clearly not the place it once was, there are great restaurants and shops and it is very easy to get to anywhere in the city. As we were delayed returning home by the Eurostar fiasco, we spoke to reception about extending our stay and the reception manager did us a deal at the original price for the upgraded room, for which we were grateful as the additional costs of flights home a day later was all hitting the credit card too.

BEDROOM & BATHROOM The bedroom and bathroom were small, but tidy, clean, and attractively decorated. We were able to find a \"Utell promotion\" rate on room with a QUEEN-size bed, which was a huge selling point, since most other hotels only offered double beds or two twins. The queen bed also meant we had a considerably bigger room, based on our observations of the floorplan that was posted on the back of our door to show fire evacuation routes. The bathroom had a full-size shower + bath, which was another big selling point since many Parisian hotel rooms only have a bathtub. Noise from the street and adjacent rooms was not an issue in our third floor room facing the street. We are light sleepers, but did not have any trouble sleeping. LOCATION The hotel was extremely close to two different Metro lines, one of which (the #4 line) went directly to the St. Germaine neighborhood and Ile de la Cite, where Notre Dame cathedral is located (very central location).

The neighborhood is filled with cafes and restaurants, and there is a grocery store a few doors down which came in handy for drinks and snacks. You are in between two metro stops (Vavin - line 4 and Edgar Quinet - line 6) so getting anywhere you want to go is not an issue.

We will return. We stayed here for 4 days to celebrate my wife's 30th birthday. The hotel is located in a lovely quite area close to two Metro stations (Vavin & Edgar Quinet). If you arrive from Charles De Gaulle, then simply jump on the train to Gare du Nord (they leave every 7 minutes or so) and then get on Metro line 4 heading towards Port d'Oleans. When you get off at Vavin the hotel is located 2 minutes walk away on rue Delambre. We purchased a \"Paris Visite\" card which allows you unlimited use of metro, bus and train services within zones 1 - 3 of Paris. These zones are more than adequate for the main tourist sites in Paris, but if you want to go out Versaille or Charles De Gaulle then you will need to buy an additional ticket to cover the travel outside of zone 3. The area around the hotel has numerous restaurants and bistros. We did not take advantage of them as we had already seen other places that we wanted to visit; the guys on reception can recommend ones nearby if you fancy something local to the hotel. The hotel is well maintained and the staff are super friendly and speak fluent english (they are also happy to put up with poor attempts at speaking French!). The rooms are small but perfectly formed. They are very clean and the showers are fantastic - just what you need after walking for miles around the various tourist sites. We did not have any issues with noise in the hotel and our request for a courtroom facing room on the 4th floor was granted without any fuss (I emailed the request to them 4 weeks before arriving). There is an honesty bar system next to reception and the hotel also offers free tea and coffee in the afternoons. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel and I would recommend that people save their holiday money and instead buy coffee and a croissant from one of the many cafes/patisseries near the hotel. For great restaurants I would recommend jumping on line 4 of the Metro and getting off at Saint Germain des-Pres. There are loads of good restaurants within 5 minutes walk and the food quality was a little better than some of the mass tourist joints in the Latin Quarter. Finally, if you want to vist the Louvre or the Tour Eiffel then I would suggest getting there at 09.00. The queues in July and August can be crazy and getting there early will mean you can take in both of these fantastic locations without being crushed by fellow travellers. (If you are reasonably fit and healthy then use the stairs for the first two levels of the Eiffel Tower.

We loved that the blanket was a comforter with a duvet cover, rather than blanket and topsheet which somehow always come apart.

Our son enjoyed the afternoon cookies downstairs, which accompany tea and coffee.

(You can take an unfolded stroller on a Paris bus!) Nearby rue Vavin leading to the Jardin du Luxembourg is also a great shopping street for old and young, crowned by Amorino Gelato before you enter the Jardin.

Be careful if you call for a taxi, they start charging you once the hotel calls so you might be best to flag one out on the street. Montparnasse is a nice area and for what we paid (120 Euro) a night, I believe this was a steal. We went to Willi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wine bar for dinner one night which was very good.

The location is excellent if you are planning to use the metro, but if you are like us and love to walk rather than use the transport, you may find this hotel much further than you wish from the centre and the main attractions (about 45mins walk to the eiffel tower). There are however loads of lovely restaurants, cafes and bars and pretty much all you need in the area. I would also recommend that you visit Montparnasse Cemetery which is pretty and peaceful, and have quite a few celebrity plots - a five min walk from the hotel. The metro's are 2 mins either side of the hotel, depending on where you are going and which line you need. The staff at this hotel were lovely, and friendly and speak good english. Though we speak little french and arrived speaking french the receptionist asked would we like to speak in french or english - we opted for french as we needed to learn more and the receptionist helped us out on this - speaking in english where we were struggling - she was very patient...... The bar was very plush and we liked the decor. The honesty bar was a great idea and to be honest, not much more than the bars and restaurants were. The white wine was a lovely Sancerre and 6\u00e2\u201a\u00ac a glass. If you know your wine then you will know that in the UK a glass of Sancerre in our restaurants and bars would be about \u00c2\u00a36 a glass so I found this normal pricing. The beer however was very expensive, but it was everywhere else also, with a bottle of Budweiser being also 6\u00e2\u201a\u00ac ! There is a computer in the lobby which has free internet access for guests and also there is free internet access in the rooms via the TV which is a little slower but more private. You can also get free internet access in your room if you have your laptop with you. The rooms are small but adequate. We were upgraded to a club room (I think this just means we get a bath in the ensuite). Everything was adequate and shower lovely and powerful and easy to control the temperature. Complementary toiletries were also nice. TV has a range of channels, but limited english speaking ones - unless you find a programme or film that is still in english with french subtitles. But when your in Paris - you wont want to watch much tv! The only compliant was had was the noise. We only stayed one night for a flying visit to Paris, and we had room 10 - first floor next to the lift and facing the back courtyard. We were woken at 6am by a lot of banging and music which seemed to be coming from the within the hotel. We could hear people walking around and music from downstairs, and the lift being used. This is the only thing that put a damper on our trip, as we knew we had a long day ahead. If we had been staying longer we would have asked to change room to maybe one on a higher floor. There is a place to leave your luggage if you need to, but as before, remember the hotel is a bit of a trek from the main attractions, so bear in mind that you will have to travel back to collect your items.

I too, chose this hotel because of the rave reviews on this web-site. Some of the reviews were accurate, and some, not so accurate (in my opinion). Some things criticized, cannot be discounted, especially if they're true. This holds true for the positive things about this hotel, as well. The PROS... -Absolutely Great Location- everything you need is within walking distance, including: Metro, restaurants, bistros, cafes, bakeries, bars, shops, markets in every direction, down every street, and on every corner... you name it, it's there. All in a safe, clean, non-touristy, peaceful, but not secluded neighborhood. No matter where we went in Paris (and we went everywhere), we were glad to be \"home\" in what we felt was the best area of all. -The Hotel Staff was fabulous. Just about everyone spoke English. All were polite and extremely friendly. The room was clean and the beds were appointed with nice linens and spreads, and very comfortable. -The Honesty Bar, although a bit expensive (as are most drinks in Paris), was in a beautiful room (also used for breakfast). Bathroom in my room (Club Room) was quite large and clean... (don't know why Europe uses half glass shower doors) The CONS... -Rooms are tiny (Standard & Club). I know this is Paris, but I've seen larger rooms. I opted for the \"larger\" Club room, which measured approx. 10'X12'... throw in a desk, chair, wardrobe, TV stand, mimi-bar, Queen size bed, 2-night stands, 2 people and luggage; you're talking tight quarters. It took us a half hour to figure out how to arrange everything to fit. Other than the small wardrobe, there's no place to put your clothes, or suitcases. Better travel light. What's crazy is that the bathroom is about half the size of the main room; large, with wasted space that could have been used in the bedroom area. -Bathrooms and some rooms need updating and repair. As some posters have mentioned, there are broken tiles and missing grout. In my room (#59) there was also some damage to the ceiling above my bed. While looking a a Standard room, I notice damage to the mirror frame and damage to the wall. This detracts from the overall level of class of this hotel. -The elevator is Tiny, (as some have posted). There is no way you can fit a wheel chair and 2 people with luggage in there (as some say they have). It's suitable (but tight) for 2, with 2 pieces of luggage. There is only one elevator in the building. -There's no courtyard, as depicted in some posters photos. Yes, there is a courtyard behind the hotel, however, it belongs to another hotel. This was a disappointment for me, because I had anticipated sitting out there with a bottle of wine and eating lunch. Maybe you can get away with it, but I opted to avoid the embarrassment of being asked to leave, so I didn't. Overall, I'd probably return here, mainly because of the location. It's a good Hotel... you are getting what you're paying for, nothing more, nothing less. In saying that, in all honesty, this is not a hotel that deserves a rating of \"5\". If you expect that, you may be somewhat disappointed, as I was. If you want a hotel with a true \"5\" rating, you may have to review more hotels, very carefully and probably pay more money. Also, don't overlook some of the compaints posted by others. They may be true.

As this was mine and my daughter's first trip to Paris, we were not sure where to stay so we really relied on the travel reviews when we chose this hotel. And disappointed we were not! The hotel was wonderful; all the reviews accurately described the rooms, cleanliness, friendliness of staff, location, location, location! As much as you will travel througout Paris to see the museums and attractions, we did not find any nicer spot or areas we would rather be in. The Montparnasse area is loaded with streets and streets of busy cafes, restaurants, shopping and even outdoor markets. It was a great, lively area. We also felt very safe in the area while out and about each evening. My tips: we found it was much cheaper to go out and purchase our own coffee and pastries in the morning, rather than eat at the hotel . As well there is a grocery store (Franprix) just 2 doors away and for even slightly cheaper prices ; and a few short blocks away (Monoprix), were great spots to pickup beverages which could be kept in the room's mini bar fridge. I would not recommend taking the RER train from CDG airport if it is your first time and you have heavy luggage! We made this mistake and we found connecting to the Metro was very difficult since there were MANY stairs! For 16E for two of us I would rather have spent double that to have a shuttle directly to the hotel. IT also took us close to 2 hours which I know was based on lack of knowledge where to go, etc. For those who even pack umbrellas, there is no need. The hotel has a rack complimentary tfor guests right at the front door. Another nice touch by the hotel was the complimentary tea/coffee and biscuits each afternoon. The free internet is another bonus easy to use in room in case you want to bring your own laptop. And finally the comments on the rooms being noisy on the street side.....we did not find this bothered us at all. We liked to have the french doors open and feel alive while in gay Paree.

We arrived in Paris at the Gare du Nord and from there it was about a 15 or 20 minutes ride on the Metro to the Vavin stop, approx. half a block away from the hotel -- very convenient for us as we pack lightly, but heavy packers may want to avoid the Metro, especially at rush hour. It seems like a lot of people have complained about the noise in the hotel room, we had a club room, facing the courtyard and it was very peaceful and quiet. We often left the window cracked to hear the small fountain in the courtyard. IIRC, the Classic room faces the street and is less expensive, if you want a courtyard facing room you must book a Club room. They cost a little more but they are also a little bigger and noise was not an issue for us. If you book far enough in advance (think 2 months) you can get a promotional rate booking through the website. We found it to be a fantastic price for what you get. In regards to location, we found that we could get all over Paris via Metro with a minimum amount of transfers. The Vavin station is half a block in one direction and the Edgar Quinet stop is half a block in the other direction. Many of the places we went were on one of these 2 lines which was marvelously convenient. The staff were very courteous and spoke fluent English. High speed internet and wifi in the room for no extra fee was a great bonus as well.

I would definitely stay there again. Yes, the rooms are on the small side but most rooms in Europe are so get over it. When you're in Paris you should be enjoying the city and not spending a ton of time in the room. I was splitting the cost with a friend so it wasn't that bad but with the exchange rate rooms in Europe are just going to be more expensive. We were in Paris for 6 nights so I preferred paying slightly more for a better stay since we would be there for a longer vacation. I loved the fact that the Hotel had free internet in the room as well as a business center downstairs that you could use. I also loved the fact that there was someone at the desk 24 hours. Not all of the smaller hotels in Paris have this. The location of the Lenox is great. It might be slightly further away from some of the main tourist destinations if you are looking to walk everywhere but it is only a short Metro ride to everything you want to see. There are actually a couple of different metro lines within a very short walk from the hotel which was very convenient. The Hotel is in a great area that is really vibrant and one that I actually prefer over being in the main tourist center. What was really convenient was that the Lenox is within walking distance from one of the stops for the shuttle busses that Air France operates that will take you into the city from the airport. This was really great. Another plus about the Lenox is there are tons of great places to eat and even great shops and boutiques within walking distance from the hotel. On the weekends they run a market a block away from the hotel. On Saturday you can find fresh meat and produce and on Sunday art from local artists. We never ate the breakfast at the Lenox but would rather stop and get coffee and a crepe on the street. I think this is probably a better deal than the breakfast they offer in the hotel. There is also a grocery store on the same block as the hotel if you want to pick up a few munchies for the room. Or you can run across the street to the cheese store and grab some fabulous cheese.

We would particularly like to thank Julia for her hospitality and helpfulness. The hotel has a bar but very different from what you expect - it is an unsupervised honor bar open 7x24 where you can help yourself at will, record your purchases, and then turn the selection card into the front desk. This is the type of atmosphere that this hotel is built on and is very pleasant and easy going. Transportation by subway to any tourist location is extremely easy with two stations within two minutes walking distance from the hotel - the Edgar Quinet and Vavin Stations are right there for your convenience to anywhere you might like to travel. When we arrived in Paris at DeGaulle Airport, we took the Air France Bus to Montparnasse, unloaded at Gare de Montparnasse, and then just walked to the hotel - it was so close that it was not difficult to walk there even with heavy luggage. If anyone reading this should wonder where this hotel is visually, you can always locate it anywhere in Paris by locating the Tour Montparnasse (the tallest black building in Paris) as the hotel is just about a block from this location. The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is non-touristy and quaint with many sidewalk cafes and bakeries which makes for a pleasant walk - I should add that Le Coupole Restaurant is just through an archway across from the hotel which will take you right to the next street next to the restaurant.

There was also free internet access in the reception area at a PC terminal. We only used the honesty bar once, mainly because we were out most of the time and too tired from activities during the day to want a drink on returning to the hotel, but what a pleasant concept! Help yourselves to drink and let reception know what you consumed after you leave. Prices were a bit on the high side (6 Euros for a glass of wine or bottle of beer and 8 Euros for a spirit) but not entirely unreasonable compared to the cost of drinks in most bars and restaurants. Breakfast was also pricey at 17 Euros (I think) but it really isn't necessary to have to pay this much at all, with a boulangerie and Franprix supermarket seconds away from the hotel allowing you to buy goodies to fill you up until lunch time for not much at all. The minibar came in handy for keeping yoghurts etc in for this purpose. The room was small, but what more can one really expect from a 3* hotel near the centre of town? The only downside was, as others have noted, the noise - primarily from bin men, delivery men etc in the mornings . I assume this was largely due to us being in a room that overlooked the street below and might not be so bad in other rooms not overlooking the street. The walls were also very thin and we could hear people turning on taps, flushing toilets and even conversing on occasion.

A nice gentleman by name of Biaggio (though was very tired by then, hope I got that one right!) assured us our preferred room reservation was still intact despite the very late checking-in. Preferred because being fussy travellers, we preferred rooms on higher floors, with a view and away from lifts. Upon arrival (which was very convenient for us as it was only about 300 metres away from Edgar Quintet metro station), Biaggio gave us a warm welcome and check-in was a breeze. Maps, directions and other info were given, without our asking and it was truly appreciated. We were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves upgraded to a more spacious room and were pleased the Hotel remembered it was our honeymoon. The room was spacious with a couch, full length windows that opened out to a huge balcony. Mineral water, a welcome pack consisting of any 6 bottles of soft drinks (costing EUR 6 in total) as well as a coffee making machine were a real treat. The bed was very comfortable and we had plently of space to store our luggage and clothings. We even had a fireplace in our room! Having free wifi was a major boost because we could keep in touch with family and friends from the other side of the world. The hotel also provides free usage of a PC in its lobby as well as free printing services, which we found really useful for next leg of our journey. As for meals, we skipped breakfast because there were so many cafes near the hotel and even a morning market that sells plently of food and local produce. The hotel itself provides free tea and I think some finger food in the afternoon in its bar, called the Honesty Bar. It was a real pity we did not have time to just laze around there. Julia and Karina were also extremely helpful in recommending typical French cruisine around the area and one such place, called Wadja served food that was so delicious, both myself and my wife would definitely go back in the future.

Ask anyone in the area how to get there, or, scope the skyline and it's only a matter of seconds before you find it. Ok, good news or bad news first? You're right, bad. The service. Not as warm and fuzzy as what many of my fellow \"advisors\" experienced, but definitely not horrible. The skinny, dark-haired fellow was particularly aloof. Case in point: early morning desire for Baileys for my coffee prompted me to go to the desk and request an honesty bar ticket (to fill in what drink, how many, etc. Quite convenient to say the least). He looked at me like I was NUTS and reluctantly handed me a ticket. Of course, I bravely snatched the ticket and proceded on my mission. But he made the hunt a little more than uncomfortable. The good news! Everything else! Location, food, night life (literally right across the street, best little bar), metro, taxis, food, location, everything! Loved our room. Bathroom was tollerable. And, as one recent advisor noted, the bed had me in the sweats a few nights as well. Not sure, though, if it was the plastic under-sheet or the champagne. Stay Montparnasse. You will not be dissappointed. We'd def stay again.

I loved the decor, the view, and the bed was heavenly. Both my husband and I have spinal issues and we have never slept in such comfort outside of our home. Cleaning was thorough and courteous.

Scrumptious fruit salad (with canteloupe, pineapple, watermelon...) and just about everything you could think of plus an oh so hospitable lady serving it. You would think you entered her home. It's worth having breakfast at a local cafe if you want more local color, but don't do it if you want to fill up for a long day of walking and have high quality cooking. Breakfasts with eggs (no ham or sausages, no all you can eat and drink, no fruit, though a great croissant) is about 12 to 14 euros, down the street. There's a colourful street market towards the metro station which had produce one day, and local artists' work the next. About the location, I found it perfect.

You may want to visually check out the available suites to find one to your liking. The hotel is on a quiet street, street noise was never a problem. - After arriving at CDG we took the the RER to the Denfert Rochereau stop, transfered to the Metro and got off at the Vavin station. It's a short easy walk to the hotel. The Lenox is almost equidistant between the Vavin and Edgar Quinet stops. There are several nice Brasseries next to the Edgar Quinet station. They're a great place to enjoy a glass of wine and .people watch. - The hotel provides free WiFi. We had great connectivity in our room on the top floor. A real plus if you need to conduct business or check email. The hotel provides a computer next to the reception desk. It has the European keyboard and if you're used to the style used in the USA it will take some getting used to. - The staff was superb. They were always friendly and helpful. Our request to move to a different room was met with a positive attitude and they were most accommodating. - The hotel has an \"Honesty Bar\" in the lobby. What a great idea. Everything was 8\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. A glass of white wine, 8\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, a shot of single malt scotch 8\u00e2\u201a\u00ac.

You never know if you've ordered the wrong thing or if the kitchen was having an off night. It was worth the visit to see, but I can't recommend the food. The Jules Verne restaurant in the Eiffel Tower is quite an experience. Just to give you an idea, the cheapest bottle of wine on the list is 65\u00e2\u201a\u00ac.

Comfy, clean crisp sheets. Nice flat screen TV. Minbar. For Paris, quite a reasonable size - you could swing TWO cats....

I don't think it is exceptional but then you are not paying exceptional prices. It is, however, clean, friendly and has elements of restrained but unmistakeable style which all add up to a very satisfying experience. I was upgraded on arrival, though to be honest I'm not sure what elements comprised an upgrade as the room, though perfectly acceptable and very nicely decorated wasn't anything I wouldn't have expected anyway. However, it had a nice bathroom and good products and as it was at the rear and on 5th floor, it was extremely quiet (apart from the rather early maid service on Sunday morning - she started banging about outside before 8am!) As others have said, the staff are friendly and helpful and were very tolerant of my attempts to communicate in (long-forgotten) schoolgirl French, though clearly their English was far superior to anything my French had ever been! As I was travelling alone, in Paris for the first time and rendezvous-ing with friends living in and staying in different parts of the city, I wanted somewhere convenient for the Metro and also where I would feel safe at night. This was certainly the case - there are 2 metro stations very close by. One of these, Vavin is on the same line as Gare du Nord and as I was travelling by Eurostar and arriving in the evening this was a factor in my choice. It is worth noting that this line is particularly busy - I used it in the day and in the evening, including around midnight on Saturday and it was jam-packed full (and this from a Tube-using Londoner!). The hotel is also within a few minutes walk of a number of other Metro stations so you can easily get about. You can also walk, as I did, into the centre via the Luxembourg Gardens and Ile de Citie in 30-40 minutes. I didn't eat in the hotel at all, so can't comment on the food. However it is worth noting that in the area around nothing seems to open before 10am, so if you want an early breakfast, as I did, you have to go futher afield. Not sure if this is true all year round but it was certainly the case over an early December weekend!

Noise - This is my only real issue with Lenox. Could have been bad luck or whatever, but our room was pretty noisy in the early (early) morning hours (some, not all days...we were here for 7 nights). Sounded like they were doing construction above us (things dropping on the floor, weird \"scraping\" noises, hard to explain), but a/t the front desk there were folks staying in that room. Front desk was willing to intervene if we called while it was happening. Also, garbage trucks every morning around 8am, which wasn't a big deal as we were up around then anyway. 2. We were given an occupied room upon check-in. This was quickly resolved by the front desk and we were given another room with apologies. Overall, I was very pleased with the stay and would recommend it if you're looking for an affordable hotel in a great neighborhood. Having said that, my advice would be to look for 2 star hotels in Paris that offer similar amenities for less $$ (they're out there).

When I arrived a couple of hours later, although I loved the large bath, I had had my heart set on one of the rooms in the front with the little balcony that opened onto the street, witha queen bed, which we had reserved. One word to Catherine, the warm, efficient and wonderful front desk manager, who I must thank for making our stay an enjoyable one, but the rest of the staff was also first rate, quickly moved us to room 36--the perfect room for us! Though the bathroom was a bit tight for both of us, it was fully equipped with a bidet, nice bath tub, and a hand held shower head which was a nice touch. one thing I asked for was face cloths, which they did not supply, only hand towels and two large towels per room. Loved the linens, duvet, and the pillows were fine! The bathroom amenties were very nice high end products, The mini bar which doubled as a fridge for us was great,and the a/c worked well. The room despite the compliants by other travelers posted here, was very quiet, houskeeping was consistent....the breakfast which was included in our orbitz rate was ample and very good. as was the bar, and overall appearance of the hotel and lobby --I loved coming home to the Lenox after long days of sightseeeing. The stores on the street had everything we needed, wine, pharmaceuitical items, even shrimp dumplings, and green tea, when i had a craving. surrounded by great resturants, we skipped the famous ones, and took the front desk's recommendation of Le Parc aux cerfs, which though not the warmest servcie had very good food. But if you are looking for the best meal in the city try Les Bouquinistes...it was truly amazing, though pricey, and this is coming from someone who frequents famous NYC restaurants regularly. And just over the bridge is one of those romantic Seine cruises...The hotel was also close like minutes from the Vavin metro, and the RER....and good shopping...Overall , the Lenox was a great hotel, and Id stay there again.

No storage for suitcases made it even worse. The shower was also uncomfortably small. However, the room was clean, modern and in good condition. The hotel is in a good location. Montparnasse is frequented by many locals during the weekend. As such, you'll find many restaurants, shops and cafes in the area at reasonable prices. Do expect however a good 30 + minute walk to the main sites. I actually discourage taking the Metro. Sure you'll save time but it's a seedy subway system and most of the pleasure of being in Paris is walking around the discovering things you'll never see by being underground. A taxi to the main sites (Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, La Seine, etc.) is a bit less than 10 euros so it's a decent option. The area is safe so don't worry about stumbling in late at night. The staff was courteous but nothing extraordinary. There were some renovations going on so we did get woken up early in the morning. If I had to do it over again, I'd stay in the Saint.Germain area. It's closer to the main sites and has better although more expensive restaurants. If you decide to stay there, I recommend La Rotonde for breakfast. It's a one minute walk away from the hotel and has excellent crepes. In the end, you'll have a fine stay there but don't go in expecting anything great.

Rue Delambre is an active street, with many brasseries, cafes and restaurants, but not busy with traffic as is Rue Montparnasse a few hundred feet away. This made for a peaceful stay. The Metro has stops at either end of the street, a very quick walk and easily managed with baggage. Even Gare Montparnasse, a main train station, is close by and can be managed with baggage as well. The street also has a movie theatre, a small groceteria, wine store, laundromat, fish monger, cheese shop, bakery, delicatessan, internet cafe - the easy makings of a great picnic en route or in your room.

Almost charged me for room service which i didn't have. 3) Would i stay there again... only if i got a good deal on the room. It was nice but i can't really recommend it to others since i found the location f the a little far from the attractions that interested me.

Perhpas that served me well, as I was very pleasantly surprised with the Lenox. First, the staff was most welcoming. We didn't require special treatment (change rooms / directions / etc.) so I cannot comment on the helpfulness of the staff. However, their willingness to please seemed evident. Yes, the rooms are small, but we booked a club room (#311) and it was everything we needed. It was in the back of the hotel away from the elevator, with a cute bathroom and double (queen?) bed. The room was very clean and tidy, and the cleaning staff did a great job each day keeping it that way. Although we didn't have a problem with noise, I can see where others may complain if the neighbors are rowdy (the walls are a little thin, but not too bad). The breakfast was fine, but not really worh the 16EU given all the good choices around the hotel. There is even a grocer 50meters away where you can buy some breakfast food to keep in the mini-bar fridge.

We had read the reviews on this site and got lucky in booking a doubled bed with an ensuite shower (no breakfast) for an unbelievable offer of 95 euros per room per night. Getting to Au Lenox was not difficult at all since the hotel is very close to two metro stops. First they gave us a room and it had quite a smallish bathroom. When we politely asked if it is possible to get a room with a slightly larger bathroom, the hotel staff was very accomodating and changed our room on the spot. Our room was on the top floor over the internal yard of the hotel and it was always very quiet and the windows are very well insulated. The hotel is not big, but very well maintained, cosy and though the rooms are not very big, they have all the necessary comforts. We remember it was so cold in Paris that we used to look forward to go back into the warm reddish hues of the Au Lenox interior.

The hotel is in Rue Delambre, just a few metres off from Rue Montparnasse, but so close to everything..there is a really good boulangerie down Rue DeLambre, a pharmacy and a market. We loved Montparnasse and getting to the centre of Paris was so easy and quick. Rue Montparnasse is so lively, full of good restaurants, creperies and in the evening it was sheer pleasure to stroll the whole avenue. We ate quite often at a turkish restaurant. a few hundred metres round the corner from Rue Delambre in Rue Montparnasse. We did not book breakfast at the hotel because reviews said that it was not good value for money and there are a lot of places in Rue Montparnasse where to go and have breakfast. The reviews were right even though most of the time we ended up having brunch rather than breakfast. ;) We have a lovely 7 night stay in this hotel, and we will surely look for it again shoud we decide to go back to Paris.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location on Paris\u201d", "Author": "Deacon_John", "ReviewID": "UR12445790", "Content": "Excellent hotel in the vibrant district of Montparnasse.

There is a bar in the hotel and breakfast is also served but costs too much in my opinion. We ate breakfast at one of the local cafes for about 1/2 the price. The Metro was at the end of the street and there are lots of bars and restaurants in the area. There is also a supermarket close by which was handy to pick up drinks and snacks.

There is a metro just a half-block away, which is how we did the majority of our traveling in the city. Metro trains come every few minutes and will take you literally anywhere in the city. You can buy a \"carnet\" of tickets, a pack of ten, so that you don't have to buy a new ticket every time. The hotel is off Boulevard du Montparnasse, a street that's filled with restaurants, cafes and bars. Just around the corner from Rue Delambre is Le Select, which serves breakfast late (perfect for Americans suffering from jet lag) and is more affordable than the hotel prices. We didn't order room service, but you could get food delivered to your room anytime according to the menu. In the middle of our stay, we took a side-trip to Germany, and the hotel permitted us to leave our luggage there while we were gone. That was a huge help! In general we found the staff very friendly and helpful, and their English was easy-to-understand. Actually, we rarely used our broken French to communicate. The only time we pulled out our phrase book was in the restaurants, where even the English translations (if you can find a menu that has them) will leave out important details. My husband ordered a beef dish, but the menu failed to mention the beef was raw! One note of caution: If you print out the hotel map to navigate your way to the hotel when you arrive in the city, look at it very closely. We took the RER train from the airport, then a metro to where we thought the hotel was located. The process worked great until we stepped out onto the street, only to realize that the hotel was nowhere to be found. (Street signs are small and fixed on the sides of buildings.) It turns out we were in a completely different neighborhood because we were looking at the hotel logo and not the tiny little arrow pointing to a small street. Another bonus is that there is market on the same street as the hotel, and we bought water there and other food. Just beyond that is a bakery where you can buy delicious sandwiches. Try the \"poulet\" (chicken); that was our favorite. We bought one every morning and took it with us to eat for lunch wherever we were. If you want to explore further than Montparnasse for dinner, try the Latin Quarter. We stumbled on a great little place called \"Odeon\" and loved the food and atmosphere. Also worthwhile is taking a dinner cruise; they're expensive but well worth it for the nighttime city views and unique vantage points.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely little hotel in a nice area\u201d", "Author": "Scrimshaw", "ReviewID": "UR8524916", "Content": "No problems here.

My wife and I spend 5 nights at the hotel. We booked a standard double room with shower directly on the hotel's website. The website was easy to use and the transaction processed smoothly. When we arrived at the hotel, we were upgraded at the same rate to a double room with bath, room 51 on the 5th floor. The sixth room pictured on the room pictures shown on the hotel's website (lavander patterned bedspread and curtains, with white cabinets on either side of the bed) is representative of our room. The room was relatively spacious by Paris standards and was very clean. The daily maid service was excellent. The hotel staff was courteous, helpful and pleasant. They were polite enough to endure our attemped communications in French, but were happy to switch to English as needed. The hotel appears to be frequented by a lot of anglophones from the U.K. and U.S. Our room was on the back side of the hotel and was reasonably quiet. The back side of the hotel faces a large courtyard (a real courtyard, not a large light well) and some of the surrounding buildings are not as tall, meaning that the view from our 5th floor window was more expansive that we would have expected. Also, the room had excellent light, especially in the morning. Our only possible issue with the room was that we did have a smell of cigarette smoke that permeated into the room a couple of nights for awhile, either coming from an adjacent room, the hall or in through the window, but it was not major and did not persist. As reported by others, this hotel is well located. We took the RER train both from and to the Charles de Gaulle airport without incident. The RER station (Port Royal) is an easy 10-12 minute walk down Montparnasse Bourlevard from the hotel. I would not recommend the train if you are carrying a lot of baggage or have large bags. We travelled with a 24\" roller bag and a small backpack each. We put the 24\" roller bags on the overhead racks on the train. Larger bags will not fit on the racks. We did see some travelers on the train with large bags, but clearly they were struggling. As an alternative, we noticed that Air France has a bus stop near the Montparnasse train station (an easy walk from the hotel) with service to the Charles de Gaulle airport. The hotel is also located near several metro stops serving metro lines providing access to many differnent parts of the city. We expected to use the metro a lot, but actually ended up walking everywhere. Also as reported by others, there are a lot of eating establishements (of a variety of price levels) around the hotel. We did not purchase the hotel breakfast, but went out every morning. We especially liked the boulangerie on rue Brea, where rue Brea and rue Vavin converge, on the way to the Jardin du Luxembourg. They have a nice counter facing the street where you can sit and have coffee and something to eat while watching activity on the street. Two espresso drinks, two croissants and two yogurts for a bit over 7 euros. We also found the Vavin Cafe, across the street from the boulangerie, to be a welcoming bistro. We also went to Noura (Lebonese cuisine), near the hotel on Montparnasse Boulevard, one night and found the food excellent. Noura is apparently a chain with multiple restaurant locations in Paris and London. The street on which the hotel is located is not touristy, and does have some nice shops. We especially enjoyed the fromagerie across the street and down a bit toward Montparnasse Boulevard from the hotel.", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "hotelsnob2007", "ReviewID": "UR7629837", "Content": "I booked my two night stay based on the reviews on this site.

Arrived early and although our room wasn't ready the reception staff sent someone to get it ready straight away. We had a room on the front of the hotel (number 33) that was one of the larger ones with a queen size bed. The room was a good size for Paris and was very clean with mini bar, flat screen tv, wardrobe and desk. The bathroom was also very clean and well equipt with a bath/shower, sink, toilet and bidet. The hotel has an underground carpark which we used at a rate of 20 Euros a night, which seems steep but is a much better option that leaving the car on the street due to the amount of traffic wardens and the way the Parisians carelessly squeeze their cars into very small gaps!!! We had breakfast only once in the hotel, not because it wasn't good, because it was but just because we wanted to get out and explore the Parisian cafes. Hotel breakfast was 16 Euros each, which may sound steep but it was all you can eat with croissants, pastries, bread, ham, cheese, sausages, eggs, drinks, cereal, yoghurts and fruit salad, and was very yummy. Definately worth it if you famcy a big brekkie to set yourself up for a day of sight seeing!!! Good value seeing as though typical cafes offered one hot drink, orange juice, one croissant, one piece of french bread, butter, jam and an omlete for 12 Euros. The hotel is in a great location, 2 roads away from the Montparnasse tower, which is definately a must! Great views over Paris including the Eiffel tower. Loads of cafes, bars, restaurants, creperies etc in the streets surrounding the hotel. Our favourite restaurant being the Montparnasse 1900, along the Boulevard Montparnasse, 5 mins walk from the hotel. Had heard about this restaurant and the reception staff were very helpful in ringing to book us a table. Lovely posh french restaurant, wonderful service and atmosphere. About 95 Euros for 2 people (3 courses). Well worth it though, food excellent and even better than Altitude 95 in the Eiffel tower where we also had dinner. Eiffel tower only 30 mins walk from the hotel which is a great way to see the Parisian streets and shops. However, there are two metro stops, one at each end of the road the hotel is in to get you to the further away attractions, eg the Sacre Coeur, which is well worth a visit in the sunshine, however the surrounding area of montmartre appreared dirty and not as expected!!!

We were able to get a great rate of 112 Euros per night for a room with double bed and bath. And even though we were on the second floor (facing the courtyard), we did not have any problems with street noise. Although our room was small, our two large suitcases cramped the room, there was sufficient closet space. The bathroom was much larger than we expected. I didn't find the shower to be exceptionally small like some other people have mentioned. The bathroom looked as though it was recently remodeled. There was always plenty of hot water and the water pressure was strong. There were also nice French bath products. The location of the hotel is great - it is a short walk to several metro stations. The closest metro station to the hotel is Vavin - line 4. You can take this line to get to Notre Dame and Sainte-Chapelle. The Edgar Quinet station is at the other end of the street (line 6) and makes it easy to get to the Eiffel Tower. The Montparnasse station is only a few blocks away and is a big transfer station for many lines. I think someone else may have mentioned this. Upon check-in, you receive a big, heavy brass key. You don't have to worry about carrying a hotel key around with you - you leave the key at the front desk when you leave and pick it up again upon your return. The front desk staff were all friendly, helpful and spoke English well. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel. We went to La Coupole a few times - they have a nice continental breakfast for 8.5 Euros.

We opted for the \"club\" room (number 56) which wasn't a very large room but I would describe it as cute and comfortable, and so was the bathroom, it wasn't very spacious or too small, but it looked new, the shower was excellent and the towels were lovely and soft. The finishing touch to our room was the balcony which had the street view. Neither of us were disturbed by the noise, in fact the little noise we heard added to the charm of the location, being able to watch Parisian life of the surrounding area. And the location of the hotel was better than I had anticipated. Montparnasse has plenty of restaurants and cafes and there was a market at the weekend selling local produce from cheeses to seafood to jewellery. The hotel street itself had plenty to offer...a supermarket, cheese and bakery shops, a wine shop, bars and a pharmacy at one end, cash machines the other. And of course not forgetting the 2 metro lines Vavin and Edgar quintet at either end of the street which in 10 minutes took you to the main tourist sights. Mentioning sights, I would agree, the Montparnasse tower is a definite especially with it being in the area. We did walk from the Eiffel tower back to the hotel on New Years eve night which only took around 30minutes, we just headed in the direction of the Montparnasse tower. With regards to the other services the hotel provided, the bar at night was relaxing offering alcohol or hot drinks, the breakfast was good if a little pricey and then there is the free internet access which was a nice added bonus.

We took 10 minutes to complete a 3 minute walk-reading menus at the restaurants on the right as you walk down Delambre to the hotel.

The breakfast, 15 Euros extra (optional), was a good selection of eggs, meats, pastries, fruit, yogurt, etc., much better than the usual Paris hotel fare. But it's the location that really makes this place. One block (really) from the Vavin stop on the #4 line (which takes you directly to Cite, the stop for Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle) and from the Edgard Quinet stop on the #6 line (which takes you directly to the Eiffel Tower) -- about 7 minutes to each. Or you can easily walk to both places: Notre Dame is 31 minutes at a brisk walk (I timed it) and the Eiffel Tower is a bit closer. On the same block as The Dome (one of the better seafood restaurants in Paris - try the langoustines) and surrounded by the Montparnasse area of wonderful food, particularly seafood; also, about three blocks to the Galleries Lafayette if you want to shop. Nicely appointed, relatively quiet, completely clean, very nice staff. A tourist hotel (read - not luxury) - a perfect hotel for couples on a moderate budget.

When we got there, the recpetionist a young lady - friendly and efficient got our rooms orgainsed despite our early check in. We got the room at a rate of Euro 120 ( relatively steep for a three star hotel - but this is Paris !) This was my wife's first stay in a quaint boutique hotel as she's used to five star hotels in asia. So it was a shock to walk into an extremely small room. Though it was very clean, well painted and smell good. It was on the third floor and facing the lovely fountain in the open area. I specifically asked for a room that was not facing the streets. As we were from tropical warm Singapore we were not used to the cold and it would have been good to have a heating system. Which i only noticed on our last night in the toilte beside the shower. The area is relatively safe - lots of cafe and pastry shops on the street. I discovered the metro ( train station ) was a stone's throw on the left hand side of the hotel. We took a train to the eiffell tour - it was 4-5 stations away. The next morning, with a six hours time difference we got hunger pangs at 5.00 am and decided to check out the breakfast. The man in the reception, was extremely pleasant and helpful. Despite single handedly doing everything he made sure my wife was comfortably seated in the breakfast area and had a hot chocolate. The lady in the kitchen was an equal delight, being in an advance stage of pregnancy she was serving with a smile. I must add that most of them spoke excellent english. I was equally concern as this was our first trip to paris and that i don't land up in some shady hotel. On the contrary , it was a pleasant stay though a short one.

I had tall French doors that opened onto a little patio where I could sit above the street, looking out at the bustle of town, and using the very good high speed wireless internet on my laptop.

The lobby is surprisingly chic and glamorous, considering the low-key neighborhod and price. The hotel is incredibly convenient, with several Metro lines and major avenues nearby, as well as some of the city's most famous artists' cafes, which are literally on the corner. I only had 2 even vaguely complaint-like things to say. The first is that I felt the staff gave the impression that the breakfast in the lobby was complimentary, when in fact it is 15 Euros (that's more than $20 for coffee, eggs and croissants). And secondly, I had the hotel wash my Teeny, tiny bag of delicates, maybe 10 items all together, and it came out to $100 or so. Outrageous. But then, don't do your laundry at a hotel. I will stay here again, and I am sending my parents, who are major world travelers, to stay as well. Overall, better value, elegance and quality and more bang for your buck than I had ever expected.

The place was spotless and the staff was lovely and extremely helpful. We absolutely adored the neighborhood. So much history!

Our favorite thing was to go out the front door, turn left and head down to the cafe for breakfast each morning. There are probably 20 creperies down that way, too. Then we were fortunate to discover Wadja just a few blocks away...extraordinary food. The first night I had a 7-hour-roasted leg of lamb that was the best thing I've had in ages. Modigliani and Giacometti used to eat there (I'm an artist... this info blew me away). Also, was reading Art Buchwald's book I'll Always Have Paris and he mentions Wadja as his favorite restaurant from his days in Paris in the late 40s early 50s.

I booked a double superior room through Expedia and had no trouble at all with the booking. The room that we got was beautiful complete with a bathroom to die for as all Paris bathrooms are tiny as the rule, but not here, we even had a bath. :-) The room came complete with a plasma T.V and the nicest furnishings to make you truly feel that you were in Paris.

The breakfast at \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLenox Montparnasse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was gorgeous, you can tell that the owners only use the finest ingredients in their cooking, this was nice to see, as I have sometimes stayed at places where corners are cut and the breakfast usually suffers with cheap food etc... once again NOT at the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLenox Montparnasse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122... quality and fresh produce only... YUMMY!!! If you have done a lot of looking for Paris hotel as I did then you will have seen numerous comments about Bad breakfasts, NOT here folks it really is excellent and you can have as much as you like in the lovely restaurant. if you want to eat the way the french eat the there is a gorgeous pattisserie only 4 door away from the hotel and also a great supermarket for all your goodies for your room. I felt the only way to see Paris is on foot but if you want to use the metro there is a station at the end of the street again only feet from the hotel door.

The staff is absolutely one of the friendliest staffs I have had the pleasure of dealing with. They do speak english, and one gave us an excellent dining recommendation for our first night there. We just told him what we were looking for, and he handed us a card and told us how to walk there.

I didn't partake in it, but I did ask if I could buy one croissant to which the woman just told me to not worry about a payment. The bedrooms have a self control air conditioner that goes down to about 16C. That's actually a really cool temperature for European standards, so no complaints there. Our french window doors faced the courtyard rather than the street. The street is a quiet side street, so I'm sure those are quiet rooms, but the courtyard has a fountain in it, so when you open the french doors, you can here the fountain trickle. The only thing I could say badly about this hotel, and I hate doing it because the good outweighs the bad (and no hotel is perfect), but the walls are paper thin. In the mornings you can hear a lot of walking around and doors shutting, but I solved this by using the ear plugs virgin atlantic gave me. So, don't let this frighten you away!
