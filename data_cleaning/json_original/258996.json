The rooms are spacious however, the loo is so close to the shower that it's a good thing i am only 1.62cm (5.2\"). The hotel is doing some construction work in its garden so - ask how far along they are before you reserve. However, all mmebers of staff are incredibly friendly. I asked for a quieter room (construction work begins at 7:00) and all they asked was for me to pack my things, when I returned I found they moved me to a larger and, indeed quieter, room. In this room there was no shower but a bathtub and the bathroom was very spacious. There's wifi in the room - ask reception for the PW. Breakfast is very italian - mostly pastry (a good selection) but also cereals . Two machines provide for all your coffee needs. Beware though than the orange juice (regular oranges and blood oranges) is rather an orange drink and I doubt it has ever seen real oranges. Busses into the centre and to the Termini train station are around the corner.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and certainly went out of their way to accommodate our large tour group. One of the hotel managers, Sergio, was especially helpful, and made our stay pleasant. The hotel is located next to a grocery store and a Mc Donald's (aka American embassy). It was a short, safe walk and several of our tour members visited one or both locations. The outside of the hotel is fine. There is a very nice courtyard in an \"L\" shape and many in my group really enjoyed sitting there. I found the rooms adequate. My only complaint is that the walls were thin - I could hear my neighbors in the next room talking (glad I brought my earplugs). Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable, with no odors as described in previous ratings. I had the occasion to enter several of the hotel's rooms since I was a chaperone on our tour group, and I also found the same clean, odor free conditions in those rooms as well (of course it was clean before the kids opened their suitcases!).
