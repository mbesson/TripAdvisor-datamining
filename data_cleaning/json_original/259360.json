Most of the staff was quite nice and helpful. Breakfast (included was sufficient-my biggest problem was the coffe was never hot in the morning) I hate warm coffee. Great location, loved being off Las Ramblas close enough to get there but far enough away fromt he craziness of the street. Metro was an minute walk from the hotel and it was quite nice during the day and the end of the day to sit on the rooftop and look out on the harbor. Bathroom was not great, had trouble with the shower and getting enough towels everyday I had to ask (6 days). Hated asking for ice everyday as well.

We had a Junior Suite which is really two rooms combined with the wall removed. It was very spacious and comfortable. Our adult children (18 and 21) stayed on the pull out sofa which was very comfortable and we also had a single bed brought in. The Hotel was very clean and well maintained and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We were able to book our tickets to most of the attractions that we visited right at the Hotel. We had a room on the second floor toward the back of the Hotel, and the only complaint we had was about the noise that comes from the bar directly under the Hotel. It was very loud until 2:30AM and then it was fine. We asked to be moved and the staff moved us to the fifth floor which helped somewhat with the noise. We quickly got into a rythym of staying up until 2:30AM and sleeping until 9:30AM and then getting on our way by 10:00AM. The Hotel is located a block from the waterfront and you can easily walk to a large number of attractions and restaurants. We spent about 4 full days touring the city on the hop-on, hop-off buses. There are two different routes (green and orange) which take you across the entire city. There is just so much to see and experience. This is the best way to see the city. We hit most of the must-see attractions including: - la Sagrada Familia - Casa Batllo - Palau Guell - Guell Park - L'Eixample District - Picasso Museum - Las Ramblas - Gaudi House Museum - Olympic Stadium - Nou Camp (home of Barcelona Soccer) just to name a few.

We were so excited to escape cold Manhattan for sunny Barcelona and to utilize the terrace, specifically the small pool. We were thrilled with the location of the hotel, steps from the Gothic Quarter and La Rambla. However, the room we were given was very small and lacked character. The only window we had looked out into the dark vestibule of the building. We had hoped for something a little more charming. Since we didn't plan on spending too much time in the room anyhow we headed to the terrace. We were completely disappointed to see that the pool would be out of service the weekend we were there...and not only that, they decided to stain the wooden flooring on the terrace making the entire roof deck area essentially closed. When the main amenities offered by a hotel will be compromised, I don't see why they wouldn't have alerted us before we arrived, in case we wanted to look for a hotel that did have a working pool or terrace.

Or, perhaps Hotel Duquesa should have offered an upgraded to a more comfortable room or a dinner, or something to make up for the inconvenience. We were charged full price and offered no such consolation. On our last day, we asked at the front desk for a recommendation to a good Paella restaurant. The concierge gave a recommendation and said he would call and make us a reservation, and then leave a confirmation of the time on our room voice mail. When we returned we had no message, so we called down to inquire about the reservation. He said we had a reservation at 9pm. Sadly, when we arrived at the restaurant they had no reservation for us. We had to wait over an hour for a table that we were told would be reserved. All and all Hotel Duquesa dropped the ball in many areas, and when we returned home I responded to their inquiry to see how our stay was. I mentioned the flaws, and how I was disappointed to have paid full price to not be able to use the main attractions of the hotel. They apologised and offered nothing further. What is even the point of asking how your customers stay was if you are not going to be responsive to criticism?", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath", "Title": "\u201cWonderful positioning, helpful staff but some odd quirks\u201d", "Author": "Hanna D", "ReviewID": "UR119763884", "Content": "We had a lovely weekend at this hotel and overall were very satisfied. It was wonderfully positioned and we enjoyed having such easy access to the Port Vell and the Ramblas. The roof terrace is a treat so do take time to have a drink at least up there. We booked with the three day offer on the hotel website which was very good value but the first room we were given was rather pokey and disappointing. The staff were very accommodating however and when I asked whether we had been allocated this room because we had benefitted from the offer and explained that we were rather disappointed, they moved us to a much bigger room on the front of the hotel the next day which we much appreciated. The only problem with this room was that we could not open the windows because the noise was deafening because of the huge amount of traffic in front of the hotel and we were so very hot that we had to put the air conditioning on (in late October!). In fact we found that the hotel was generally overheated which might be a plus for some. Another curious observation - in the small room there was a very comfortable massive double bed whereas in the large room, the two single beds pushed together were each barely large enough for a normal sized adult - again odd and this made sleep much less comfortable. The breakfast buffet was great though the coffee was not freshly made odd once again for such a good quality hotel in other ways. That said the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel despite some rather strange quirks.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangor, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing,amazing ,amazing\u201d", "Author": "f00dmama", "ReviewID": "UR119531110", "Content": "We stayed here with friends at the end of september,you know things are going to be good when you get a glass of champagne while you book in.The hotel is situated overlooking the marina and right next to the Gothic quarter,so you are very central yet in a quieter area.

The (two) bathrooms had both shower and bath. Plenty of soaps and good shower gels were provided. In short , a very comfortable room which was well decorated in muted colours. There were two small balconies overlooking the narrow street behind the hotel and there was no view except into the guest hour opposite. I didn't mind that as the bar on the top floor has good views over the harbour which sells food and wine until 0130 hrs. The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming and any questions were well handled and their advice on nearby restaurants reliable. I don't want to put anyone off staying in this hotel which is highly recommend by me, but from my room on the 4th floor you could hear the shouts and screams of the revellers in the nearby bars. Impossible to avoid in reality so bring earplugs like I did and you will sleep very soundly, as I did. Only one minor complaint but at breakfast the scrambled eggs which were cooked at maybe 0700 and left to harden in a warmer were not at all nice. But you could order fried/boiled eggs instead. Otherwise breakfast was good. The hamburger which I ate on the top floor was really good, as was the wine I had with it.

We said we were leaving .He then found a room on the fifth floor (54) but with a double bed.The next day the only room we could change to was on the third floor so we stayed put. The rooms need a bit of a sprucing up although we saw carpet being put in so maybe it's being done. There's no drawer space ,tea/coffee facilities or chocolate on the pillow.On the third day they put a bottle of Cava in the room for our troubles but this was only because we had complained a lot. We went to the Hotel 1898 for a drink as this would have been our second choice. The location was not as good but the level of service and attention to detail totally outshone the Duquesa. The waiter insisted on changing my cocktail when he noticed I wasn't drinking it and there were blankets, patio heaters and free nibbles brought out with our terrace drinks. The staff at the Duquesa had to be tracked down all the time and did the minimum expected only bringing things if asked- for example pool towels and chair cushions for the outdoor seating. Breakfast was included and whilst not much of a choice was OK. Coffee was horrid though and the buffet is set up in a totally awkward corner so you have lots of guests bumping into each other. Having said that the location is the best with the charming bars literally behind the hotel and some fantastic places to eat. There's a place next to Sensqui(?) that has a E16 set dinner menu that is fantastic. I might stay again because of location alone but do make sure you don't pay more than E150 a night because it's not good value.Other guests are all very nice and are a slightly older, well heeled bunch.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable hotel, friendly staff, excellent location\u201d", "Author": "Neil186225", "ReviewID": "UR106352619", "Content": "Harbour view room very comfortable and initial problem with aircon was resolved instantly.

The hotel was lovely, The best location, Right in front of you you have the harbour, which is just in front of the beach, the beach is a 15-20 min walk from the hotel, but well worth it! Much busier beach than we expected too! The reception staff were friendly and the hotel has a real air of class! To the right of the hotel you have 'Las Ramblas' which is just a 5 min walk. It has a huge food market, lots of places to eat and lots of street performers to see! Well worth a look. We took the Barcleona tour bus from just outside the hotel (The right and head to the roundabout) which cost 29 euros for 48 hours - Well worth doing as you get to see the entire city. The views from the duquesa de cardona roof top are amazing - they look right over the harbour and to the beach in the distance, the pool is very small, but cosy and most of our stay the roof terrace wasnt very busy, so having it to yourself is very romantic. The rooms and the hotel are very, very clean, the beds and towels changed daily! Fab service! The bar was quite expensive, so make sure you as for a menu before ordering - The resturant at the roof terrace was always quite busy at lunchtime, we only ate one meal which wasnt very nice - but we saw some meals that looked ok, so possibly worth a shot. The resturant staff seem to work quite hard, but there is a lack of organisation, possibly due to them being understaffed? So as nice as they were, when ordering food/room service expect a wait! We waited 45 minutes for toast and tea one morning, despite being told it would be 10 minutes!! The only other bad thing about this hotel was the noise from the street below, We were unlucky enough to have roadworks from 8am all day, so no chance of opening your balcony door, even without the road works the traffic from the busy road below was loud enough! The noise at night is also quite load, drunk people singin etc.... but when you put the location into persepective, i would easily stay there again despite the noise! We were on the 3rd floor and didnt stay at a weekend mind, so maybe it would be worse if you were lower down and there on a Saturday night?!

I first had a smoking room as I had not specifically asked for it. - Reception staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

It is about a 5 minute walk from the Plaza Colom, where you can pick up the Bus Touristic. This is also the bottom of Las Ramblas. It is about a 10-15 minute walk from Barcoloneta and the beach. The location is a good base for sightseeing - you can easily walk to the marina, beach, Las Ramblas, and even Plaza Catalunya. The metro and Bus Touristic are very close. However - given that the street is very noisy and busy - be very careful about what room you get! Room Location: We had a room facing the street on the 2nd floor. The location of the room was terrible. The noise from the street was heard at all hours of the night, so if you want to get some sleep after sightseeing, book an interior room or a deluxe room on the highest floor (5th floor?). I had to wear ear plugs to get some sleep - and mind you, I have lived in NYC and Washington, DC, so I know what it is like to live in a city. Rooms: The rooms themselves are very spacious (even by US standards). Our room was nice with a real king size bed - not 2 twins pushed together. And the bathroom was large and nice. However, be careful of the A/C. One morning we woke up to the awful smell of cigarrettes, which seemed to be coming through the A/C vents or ducts. Not sure exactly how, but it smelled as if someone was smoking in our room and was pretty disgusting. Rooftop Terrace: The rooftop terrace is nice, especially for a late night drink with a view. The view is nice of the marina and sea but no view of the city. The pool is tiny and not worth it in my opinion. Staff: The reception and hotel staff were friendly. However, they were not very well prepared. We asked about Bus Touristic tickets and they said that they can be purchased at the hotel reception. We went the next morning and apparently the hotel had run out of tickets. This isn't a big deal, since you can buy the tickets on the bus or at an info booth, however, it was just a little annoying.

We were uncertain where to stay since we were traveling with friends who had already booked at the Arts Hotel. Now as we look back on the trip we are glad we stayed at the unpretentious Duquesa and not the snooty Arts. Our friends had such a long walk just to get to our hotel let alone explore the city. We simply walked out of our hotel and quickly turned down an alley and we were off an adventure. Hotel- Although this hotel is nothing fancy, doesn't have a large lobby, or many amenities it is very well situated. It is only blocks from La Rambla, it's at the edge of Barrio Gotico, close to the beach, and near the Born District. The view of the port from the roof-top pool and bar area is not to be missed. Not to mention we were thankful not to be looking just at walls or people's laundry from the roof. Location does matter if you want to escape the hustle of the central part of town. There are tons and tons of little restaurants hidden down all the alleys. That's the best part because is it doesn't take long to find some great food! We found a little gem called Sensi at Carre Ample 26 just a couple blocks from the hotel. The food, wine, and ambience are fantastic!! The staff- Very helpful and they all speak English, but I would certainly do some research for restaurants prior to leaving because the ones they recommend are not good! A little effort and you can find some delightful places very close to the hotel that are not tourist traps. Pool/Bar- The view of all the boats on the port is the best! The pool is tiny and they do not have many loungers so plan a head if this matters to you. We had spent a week laying out in Mallorca so it wasn't a priority for us. The drinks are decent, but the service is a little spotty as you sometimes had to wait for someone to come up from the restaurant. Depending on the drink you order most are around 6 Euros which is a fantastic deal compared to the 16 Euros per drink you pay at the Arts. Yikes! Restaurant- Sorry to say but we never tried it because there are too many yummy places outside the hotel. Rooms- We did not have a \"room with a view\" to say the least. It was facing an interior wall, but I will say it was very quiet- which is a bonus in a noisy city like Barca. **One thing I need to mention as a note of warning if you visit during the summer or anytime during warm weather BEWARE the room you are in might have a horrible smell. We were in room 59 and every afternoon we returned to an absolutely foul odor that permeated the entire room. The hotel is aware of this and even gave us a room deodorizing machine to little avail it still smelled awful. Never mind if that's all I had to complain about cause I wasn't about to let this ruin a fab trip to Barca!!! You don't go to Barcelona to stay in your room. Despite our stinky room (hopefully they will fix this) we will be back to the Duquesa de Cardona in the future. This time I think we'll splurge for bit nicer room though. lol :)", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California USA", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful and lovely hotel across from the Marina and a few blocks to La Rambla.\u201d", "Author": "debdeb7", "ReviewID": "UR28638046", "Content": "The location of this hotel is great if you like the waterfront and Marina view.

We also enjoyed an Irish Pub a few blocks behind the hotel. The rooms were good size for European standards, comfy beds and good size bathrooms. Coffee on the terrace was a fun way to start the day.

Check their website for current deals!\u201d", "Author": "Queen1000", "ReviewID": "UR28162439", "Content": "The Duquesa de Cardona is a pretty 4* hotel in a great location for Barcelona sightseeing. We went in late March for 3 nights, and their website offered rooms at 63 euros per night, including tax. Our room usually goes for over 200 euros per night! Check the Duquesa de Cardona website, not any consolidator, in case you want to change your room/nights - no problem when you reserve directly with the hotel. We changed room types like 3 times! (blush). We finally decided to go with the lowest price, instead of the harbor view. And we were well satisfied. We liked our room, #35, alot. All marble bathroom, separate shower and bath, a little balcony on a narrow street looking onto another building with other courtyard windows, a queen bed, about 12 ft ceilings. The room was narrow, but felt pretty spacious because of the ceilings. Flat screen TV, 2 fluffy bathrobes and slippers, shampoo & body lotion (no hair conditioner). It was quiet at night. It's not as large and grand looking as the website photos seem, but is still a pretty hotel. They have a restaurant (we didn't try it) & room service, either in your room or in the rooftop pool area. The rooftop pool has a stunning view of the harbor and city, a full 180 degrees, and is very nicely decorated with plants, also has the large standing heaters for chilly or rainy nights (it's colder in the north of Spain), which the staff will light for you if you request at the front desk. Since it was March, we often had the rooftop to ourselves at night. It is about a 10 minute walk to the Metro and statue of Christopher Columbus, which is the beginning of Las Ramblas, the famous streets in Barcelona where there is shopping, street entertainers, baby chick selling, shell games, and pickpockets. That's right, I said pickpockets. Thieves are sadly rampant in the tourist areas of Barcelona, which is where the hotel is conveniently located. We were robbed in the Sants metro station by a \"nice\" man asking a question, while his co-hort stole a small suitcase in back of us. The Duquesa de Cardona made an appointment with a police supervisor, after my husband insisted. But we really got nowhere. The hotel staff sadly admitted that petty thievery is a big problem in the 100% tourist areas, like certain metros and Las Ramblas and the quaint Gothic quarter. Unlike Madrid, where we had just visited, there is not a mix of indigenous Spaniards going to work, living in the area, etc - it's just us tourists, so the thieves have easy pickings. My advice: DON'T be nice to any unknown person(s) asking questions or talking to you at all, hold your bag & valuables near, say No, no, and walk on. Although there were 5 or so persons before this incident that asked me perfectly innocent questions, it's not worth getting the one person who doesn't. Thank god our passports weren't in there! My husband overheard another guest in the Duquesa de Cardona also talking about being robbed! And this is only a 40 room hotel. Most persons in the hotel are foreigners, not from Spain, so don't worry about not speaking Spanish, the staff handles English easily, and probably other languages (but I wasn't particularly listening, since I was practicing my Spanish and going into English when I got confused). All the staff really tried hard to please us. When I asked for extra towels, it was brought to the room immediately. The same for room service of hot tea and wine, and I asked for something else to be brought to the room (can't remember what). All was done immediately, you could see how much they want to satisfy you. One of the hotel staff recommended a tapas restaurant to us, Lonja de Tapas, which we went to since it was close by. But it turned out to be expensive (46 euros for drinks & tapas, $61 USD), even though I had specified that we were looking for inexpensive tapas, and even though the hotel had given us a money-off brochure for 2 free drinks. So I wouldn't take the hotel's word for it again on any other restaurants. They wanted to call & make a reservation for us, even though when we got there, the place was empty & actively trying to inveigle people to stop in. So I believe this is just the staff's way of getting free food for themselves later on by way of referrals. We had better luck just looking at menus with good prices as we walked around. The food in Barcelona, at the 5 or so places we visited, was outstanding & creative - different from Madrid - especially if you like aioli which they used to flavor many items (garlic mayonnaise mixture).

We spent way too long looking at hotels on the internet and it's almost impossible unless you already know the layout of where you're heading to. So in my opinion, unless you have 5 star money to spend this hotel is a winner. Just so you read this in the right context, we are a couple in our forties looking for a pleasant couple of days away. Hotel Duquesa de Cardonais is opposite the beach and port and far enough away from Las Ramblas, although only three minutes walk to it, to avoid the hustle bustle when you've had enough. The roof terrace with the fantastic view and plunge pool is very pleasant with food and drink service available. We booked a sea facing room on the 5th floor, good choice, I think the other rooms look over a courtyard. We stayed in a differnet hotel the first night at the other end of the strip which was ok ish and charged 110 euros per room but felt more like someone's house we were staying in. For the extra 30 or 40 euros per night there was no comparisson to the Hotel Duquesa de Cardona, it was like a breath of fresh air after a dissapointing beginning. Just a note to anyone that hasn't been or booked to Barcelona before, book with Easyjet to Barcelona Airport NOT Ryaniar who will tell you that Rues or Reus is the Barcelona airport, well this is as true as London Luton isn't in London! We were dumped 100 km the other side of barcelona with either a taxi journey at 150 euros each way or a 2 hour bus journey for 12 euros each, just what you don't need on a short trip, out travel time ended up at 8 hours each way! Barcelona is huge and unless you do your homework it's easy to miss out on the beautiful buildings and sites. Las Ramblas was a complete let down. My opinion is don't bother with it unless you're into fast food and same shops every 100 yards. We found it a bit un-nerving, to say the least, at night in the side roads leading of it. Walking towards the sea from the hotel you'll come across a few modern Moroccan style restaurants/bars and a beautiful view, much nicer!

You could write your name on the dust. They come around 6 pm to give you a card with tomorrow's weather forecast and a piece of chocolate, but after we complained that service was totally gone. Coincidence? Not sure, but it did not feel like a place that you'd want to pay over 200 euros a night. The reception staff made every effort not to make eye contact, let alone greeting you as you come and go. Bar staff was surprisingly nice, though. It's right by the main road across from marina, so the street noise is there all the time. Non-stop ambulance sirens wake you up several times a night. I could not wait to get back home, and I am the type of person who likes travelling. A lot! In general I didn't find Spanish people very welcoming.

The location of this hotel and the room were good but here are the issues: Booking was a hassle as I e-mailed back and forth with some confusion on their part as to the room we wanted and the rate quoted. It was fine eventually, we got a deluxe room on the 5th floor facing the front. However, three nights into our stay, I noticed my mobile phone missing and told the reception that it was gone. I never took the phone out with me and never used it so it was always in the room. It really could not have been lost or stolen when we were out... But I did not want to be accusatory right up, so I did not say \"the maid stole my phone\". But I did tell them it was missing from my room, could they please let me know if they hear anything. At checkout time, I also noticed the case for my camera missing. I don't know why anyone would take that but there you go... Maybe they wanted a case for their new mobile phone... Anyway I told them in addition to my phone another item was missing from my room. The receptionist told me the note left on my account said I had lost my phone somewhere in the hotel and they'd asked all housekeeping staff and noone had seen it. I said well I did not misplace it, it was in my room. At this point the receptionist panicked and started being quite emotional, telling me I should have told them it was stolen. Perhaps it was a nuance in English that was lost on the Spanish speakers - apparently I should have used the word \"stolen\" but I thought it was clear. Now that it was established that my phone was stolen, what did they do? Did they try and apologize? Try and compensate me in some way? I am afraid not. The receptionist kept talking anf talking in a loud voice about how I should have told them and noone has seen it. I paid my bill and left. By the time I reported my phone missing to the mobile company \u00a380 worth of calls were made in Barcelona. Oh and like another reviewer said, there was also a problem with the taxi. When we took a taxi from the station when we arrived it cost us 5 euros. On the way back to the same place, going exactly the same way, the cost was 12 euros. The meter had been started before we got on the cab and there was also a charge per \"Luggage\". We had one shoulder bag each, smaller than an average carryon - I am not kidding... We did not have any time to fight with this taxi driver because we'd miss our connection to our flight. But it is very unclassy of this hotel to do this with the taxis... All in all, these experiences did not completely ruin our Barcelona trip but we definitely with a bad taste. The theft, the \u00a380 I had to spend for their maid to make calls to her friends, as well as losing a rather expensive mobile phone, plus the taxi scam...

The first one night's stay was in a room on the second floor on the street side. There was traffic noise but we were so tired from our travel that it did not keep us awake. On our return, two weeks later, we were on the second floor at the back of the hotel on the alley side. In both cases, the rooms were very nice and roomy for European standards. However, the alley side has an unusable small balcony and the noise from the neighboring bar and other bars in the area did keep us awake and continued most of the night. We would probably stay at this hotel on a return trip but would ask for a room on the small interior courtyard or higher up street side. The location is perfect for a cruise connection and adjacent to the Gothic Quarter with its easy access to Las Ramblas. The staff was very helpful and spoke very fluent English. I would warn others that the breakfast buffet is expensive at 14 Euros in the hotel for the items provided. I only had coffee our first morning and was charged for the entire buffet. There is a local restaurant with a much cheaper breakfast a couple of doors down as you exit to the left. There is also an American style bar next door that has very reasonable drink prices during happy hour. I think that they may also be a contributor to the late night noise in the alley. We followed a dinner recommendation from a previous reviewer and had dinner at the Sofra 18 Restaurant in the Gothic Quarter and enjoyed the experience very much. Just turn right out of the hotel and take the next right into the alley and it is down a couple of blocks on the left. Good food and reasonable prices. The staff guided us to the Tourist Bus ticket stand at Columbus Circle where we purchased a two day pass for a hop on hop off bus tour of town. This is a great way to get acquainted with the city and to visit tourist sites you choose for one price. The bus ticket includes ear phones for continuous information as you pass through town on the bus. Barcelona is a very clean city and if tourists take basic precautions for pick pockets and petty crime it is a great place to visit.

I went along to have a look and loved the room, but then remembered that it was Merce festival time, and a front -facing room might be noisy. So we stuck with our small dark room which turned out to be blissfully quiet at all times of the day and night, so was probably the right call. That`s the only negative thing I have to say. The location was fantastic with loads of good restaurants nearby. The sun terrace was particularly lovely. It overlooked the harbour and made a great place to watch the Merce fireworks on the Saturday night. Then there was some gentle live music up there - a great way to accompany a glass of local wine.

We were located on the front of the hotel with a very spacious room and huge bathroom. We were worried that it might be noisy as there was a fairly busy road out to the front, however, we were pleasantly surprised. Whilst the road was fairly busy during the day, at night there was little traffic around. Beyond the road was the Port which we could just see through the trees. Our friends had rooms to the rear of the building whilst smaller with no real views, just looking out onto narrow streets with buildings directly opposite, these were very quiet and, although small, were satisfactory. There's a lovely rooftop terrace with plunge pool, sunbeds, bar and views across to the Port. Although the bar on the rooftop wasn't open when we were there, the waiters were more than happy to bring up drinks for us. The staff were pleasant and the hotel was clean. The hotel is in a good location, we were a five minute walk to the beach and in the other direction to Columbus' column. We were also on the famous bus route so we could choose from various stops to get on to the bus. Great hotel, good location, what more could you ask for. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely go back. Lots of places to eat - you can choose from around the Port area - where there are lots of fish restaurants, or walk through the narrow streets into the main town. Recommeded things to do: Try at least one, if not all three, of the bus routes - ticket office at Columbus' Column. There are various options - we did a 2 day ticket for two routes (blue and red, as the green bus does not run in the winter months). You can get on and off as many times as you want and they run every 10-15 minutes so you never have to wait long before another bus arrives. Visited Gaudi's cathedral - a tip for you go to the queue at the rear tower lift as this is much shorter - we queued up for 2 hours to go up the first lift not realising there was a second at the rear! You go up by lift but come down by stairs and there are lots of them so be warned! Don't miss Parc Guell - we had a great afternoon there, but you could spend a whole day there wandering around. Great views too. Definitely worth a visit. The Olympic Stadium and Nou Camp also worth a visit. We were lucky enough to see some of the Team arrive at the Nou Camp when we were there. Wasn't impressed by the Ramblas - very busy but nothing much of interest. Probably want to go to say you've been but other than that don't worry if you miss it - there are better things to see.

The tourist bus is handy however I found it annoying that it only runs in one direction. Personally I like the metro or to use my feet. I would agree with a previous review and advise you to leave out the do not disturb sign as staff can enter the room, and I also found that a bit weird. The hotel is extremely quiet and well sound proofed, no street noise. The roof terrace has a great view of the city, we did not try the pool as it was December and it was very cold there at that time.

For breakfast I would recommend skipping the \u20ac14 breakfast (\u20ac17 for in room), which is nice, at the hotel and grab some freshly baked local food in a store one street behind the hotel and about three blocks towards Las Ramblas. (Apologies for not know the exact address but if you follow your nose you will find it.) A good restaurant for mid day food would have to be Boga restaurant on Carrer Ample, more or less directly behind the hotel, reasonably priced, good service and nice atmosphere.

They happily exchanged money orders for us at better than bank rates and pointed out the very convenient nearby stop for city bus tours.

On arrival the member of staff who checked us in was friendly and spoke excellent English, as did all of them, and we were allocated room 10, on the first floor, which overlooked the main promenade and harbour. This made for beautiful views, however it was very noisy, as can only be expected in cities, and we were awoken by sirens on a number of occasions. The room was spacious and the bathroom was extremely clean and modern. They were cleaned around mid-day every day and we were given chocolates and weather forecasts for the following day in the evening! The only complaint I had about the room was that the bed was two singles pushed together, which kind of killed the romance a little as we were under separate sheets! In the morning our breakfasts were agreeable, with a choice of fruit, bread, cheeses, meats, pastries, cereals in boxes, fried egg on toast, small sausages and thin streaky bacon. Not to be grumbled at but definately not the 'Hot Buffet Breakfast' that we were expecting! And we couldn't fathom how to use the toaster! The location is superb, with La Rambla being 5 minutes away, the Catheral and Picasso Museum (which had a queue a mile long) only 10 to 15 mintues away, and the City Park only 15 to 20 minutes away, which features a superb zoo! Even then we still had a few taxis as they were so cheap, though we found that many supplements were added for unknown reasons! The terrace is simply divine and it is worth staying here simply for the views that you get of the whole of Barcelona while sitting in the pool. On our first day we had the terrace all to ourselves which made for a romantic dip in the pool! The pool's about 3 foot deep and not very long or wide, however it is more than adequate. It's also quite cool, which was perfect for cooling off in after walking around the city all day, however my boyfriend was less than impressed!

The Duquesa is on the Passeig Colom which is along the waterfront and intersects the south end of the Ramblas, a short walk away.

What an excellent trip! We were thoroughly impressed with the hotel and the staff. When we started the process of looking through hotels in Barcelona, we relied heavily on Trip Advisor, and it paid off. The location for this hotel is excellent. It is right on the harbor directly across from the Aquarium, and very, very close to the Barceloneta district, the Born district, and the Gothic quarter. As we read in other reviews, we sprung for the external balcony room on the 5th floor and it was TOTALLY worth the upgrade. The views of the sunrise every morning were breathtaking. Now, if you are not from a metropolitan area, the balcony rooms are definitely exposed to traffice noise, but nothing that will keep you awake. The balcony doors are actually pretty sound-proof. If you're used to city noise, this is nothing out of the ordinary. The room itself was quite large by European standards and the bed was as well, and didn't have that crease in the middle so common in Europe. The bathroom was spacious and clean. Now, other reviews said that there were no doors on the shower. The fact is that the showers have a very modern partial shield, but because the showerhead is a moveable, handheld massage head, you don't have to worry about getting water all over the place. The rooftop veranda was also wonderful. There is a tiny dunking pool there that was very clean, but it was a little too cold weatherwise to partake. However, it offers amazing views of the harbor and is a great place to sip a glass of rioja and read. I can imagine in the summer it would be a phenomenal place to catch some sun. The staff was amazingly friendly and accomodating. Our room was not ready when we arrived early at the hotel, so, because, it is the off-season, they immediately moved us into a ready room so we could shower and unpack after our long flight. They gave great recommendations for restaurants and tapas places. They also were great in telling us just about the history of the hotel and getting us transportation whenever we needed it. On an un-hotel-related note, be sure to check out the Basque tapas places-the Frommers and Streetwise guides don't tell you about these specifically. At most tapas places, you order from a menu for a plate of a particular dish. At a Basque place, it's usually standing only with 20 or so dishes on a long counter. You can take as many or as few of each one as you want. Just ask for a plate and grab them toothpick by toothpick. When you're done, the waiters count your number of used toothpicks and charge you per item. These tapas plus a glass of cava hit the spot! One great place for tapas and a sit-down meal is Art, near the Santa Maria del Mar. As long as you're there, be sure to check out the wine bar, El Vinyo del Senyor directly across from the church. Excellent, especially at night when you can sit outside and people watch. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel so we can't comment on that. But if you don't want to pay 14 Euro for buffet and want a more local experience, try the public markets. For about 6 Euro apiece, you can get bocatas (breakfast sandwiches) or eggs with bacon and fresh oj. Excellent! Plus, you'll see all the locals which is spectacular. All in all, we had an absolutely FABULOUS trip! Be sure to book this hotel; it's a vacation in itself! We would definitely stay there again! On another non-hotel note, be careful if booking flights through Expedia. They booked us on Air France through Paris, connecting to Barcelona. Air France also had its issues, because each of our 4 flights left late and we missed our connections both coming and going because of this. We found out from Air France it was because Expedia booked us on connections with only a 50 minute layover, which is physically impossible to make at Charles DeGaulle Airport, given that you have to go through passport validation, then security, then get to your gate where you have to take a bus to your plane. We called Expedia before our return trip to try to switch to a later connecting flight after we found out from Air France that our current Expedia booking would likely result in another missed transfer. We were on the phone with Expedia on an international call for 45 minutes, only 7 of which did we actually speak to a person. When we asked to switch the time of our connection, they wanted to charge us $200 apiece to rebook. We asked why we would have to pay since the short layover times were their mistake (Expedia is in the travel business so shouldn't they know 50 minutes is impossible at that airport?). Their response was, \"Well, everyone has to be accountable.\" When we refused to pay, they wouldn't help us at all. As predicted, we missed our connecting flight when the Barcelona flight landed late in Paris. I guess we were accountable in the sense that we were foolish enough to trust Expedia to book us properly in the first place. SO, lesson to be learned, make sure you have AT LEAST 90 minutes between connections going through Charles DeGaulle and don't let Expedia tell you any differently.", "Date": "March 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Odiham", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel with wonderful staff\u201d", "Author": "Supercalfragalistic", "ReviewID": "UR6781783", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from Barcelona after staying at this hotel for 4 nights.

Oh and 2 chocolates as well! They even have a pillow menu by the bed where you can choose your type of pillow. Everything else about the hotel was wonderful, a great selection at breakfast and everything was replenished regularly (contrary to other reviews on this site), rooms were clean and stylishly decorated. The hotel is well positioned for everything in the city if you want to escape the hustle and bustle. Numerous restaurants are well witihin a short walking distance. The hotel does reccomend one restaurant 'Agut' which we did not like and would favour El Salon much more highly. Also there is a great tapas bar just round the corner for lunch called Carabello offers 'Champagn' (Cava) and Tapas stood up at the bar like the locals. Plates of succulent Octopus in paprika and fried pimientos (peppers) and 5 glasses of cava came to only 15 euros! One thing worth noting is that the drinks on La Ramblas are very expensive - be warned!! On our last day Mario again looked after our bags whilst we ambled around the city and then on our return waited outside for us to hail a taxi to take us to the airport. I would recommend this hotel to anyone! Not sure if room 43 is any better than any other but definately ask for a Harbour Room view. On the first floor you get a larger balcony but you are closer to street level and as such may be subject to higher noise levels. Overall, a wonderful experience that even the most discerning of traveller will struggle to criticise.", "Date": "February 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "rhldevon", "ReviewID": "UR6781750", "Content": "The Hotel Duquesa de Cardona is a C19 building on the palm-fronted waterfront boulevard overlooking the yacht marina near the heart of the Gothic centre of Barcelona.

It was quite small but comfortable and well appointed. The hotel has a rooftop terrace with a lovely view over the waterfront and with a small pool. Lunches can be served here at extra cost. The hotel's dining room did not serve evening meals so we asked the concierge for a recommendation. As most restaurants in Barcelona do not open until 8 pm and we prefer to eat earlier, he suggested the Restaurant 7 Portes, five minutes walk away. It is open all day and is a Barcelona institution founded in 1836.

It is on the edge of the old town and has an amazing terrace with a great view over the marina and port. The pool is rather small a bit like a large bath rather than a swimming pool, but there are tables and chairs together with loungers, although as it was November we did not use them. The rooms are a good size and air conditioned if it gets too hot. We were lucky to have a room with a view over the Passeig de Colom, which we did not find too noisy unlike some other reviewers. The en suite bathrooms are large and the shower was very good. The breakfast was included in our room booking (14 Euros usually) and was a continental buffet style. We thought that it was a good selection with cold meats, cheeses, bread, fresh fruit, freshly squeezed fruit juices, various pastries and some traditional Spanish touches as well. The best feature however was the friendly staff. They could not do enough for you. An another touch that was a first for us was a card that they sent round the night before telling you what the weather forecast for the next day was meant to be, tehy even gave you a choice of air freshener that the housekeeping staff could offer.

Overall we enjoyed our stay, but there were a few downsides, many of which have been mentioned in previous reviews. Good points: Desk staff very polite and helpful. Called for extra towels and they arrived within minutes. The bathroom was huge, clean and beautiful. The shower had tons of water pressure and hot water. The bed was large and comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. Room and bath was very clean. Less than good points: Room was very small by American standards. Overlooked a cruddy, noisy back street. The noise was very bad until the bars close. The window did not close/seal tightly, which added to the noise level. Sad looking breakfast for 14 euros. Overall, I think if we were going to stay for a longer time, we would look for something different or upgrade to a larger room overlooking the main street. The location is excellent, within walking distance of many things to see and do. The small size of the room was somewhat offset by the high ceilings and the marvelous bathroom. There was one strange thing about the design of the shower...there was no shower curtain or door. Taking a shower basically floods the bathroom.
