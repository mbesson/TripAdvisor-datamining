I must say that I am very disappointed with the hotel. 1. My main complaint, as has been pointed out by a few other reviewers, is that it is not really all that clean. The stained carpets in the hallyway are really bad..just a bad impression if that is the first thing you see everytime you come back to your hotel. The room has not been dusted during my 6 night stay thus far, the bathtub creaks and has 3 lines down the middle that I don't understand. 2. Bath products are very cheap (comes in a big tub that obviously gets refilled for the next guest). They don't offer any lotion either (I usually don't bring any since travel from the US with liquids is a royal pain in the neck) 3. The room smells of smoke even though it was N/S room. I asked the front desk for an air-filter (other Tokyo hotels offer this) and they looked at me like I had 10 heads. 4. Also, there is no iron in the room and you have to request one from the front desk. I asked 3 times on 3 separate days and all 3 times, the answer was I'm sorry,someone is using it at this moment. I went out and bought one, I was here for business after all and needed to iron my blouses.5. I skipped breakfast altogether..it was lame....have had better Japanese breakfast at other hotels 6. I like firm beds, this one was rock hard and the pillows are worse..didn't sleep well at all.Overall, I won't return to this hotel. I'd consider the main Hotel Villa Fontaine right by Roppongi-Itchome train station. It's only an extra $30 or so, much newer and better maintained.The ONLY plus is that it is cheap.", "Date": "Aug 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR626548533", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "nyamse"}, {"Content": "What a let down I was excited to be staying in a new hotel opened June 2008.

On arrival I see it's the old Roppongi Prince Hotel where I have spent many jet lagged sleepless nights, however with Roppongi only a 10 min walk away it was always a good spot. Having been living it up in Akasaka in the New Otani for 4 weeks on my previuos stay it was a come down.Yes the rooms are a fair size and nothing wrong with them.Complimentary breakfast is toast, salad and soup, no knifes only miniscual plastice spreaders.The hallway carpets are filthy,as though people wipe there feet before the enter the room.You can pay extra to cehck in earlier, about $5 and hour and cehck out is 10 am and again you can extend by paying.Just beware if you think you are in a new hotel.", "Date": "Jul 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR550956369", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "movingmusic"}, {"Content": "weird but worth it so this place used to be a branded hotel, but is about to be demolished... it's adminstered by the hotel over the road (that would be a four lane highway, folks, you're not wandering over to shoot the breeze!). you get big rooms by Tokyo standards; very fast, free, internet; a very good price; a fairly good location if you need to be on the fashionable side of Tokyo. you don't get much of a breakfast (it's free, and if you like salad and soy-flavoured salad dressing for breakfast, is great.... otherwise, it's minimal); and taxi drivers will never find it unless you can give directions in Japanese.

The reason I love this hotel is that it is quiet, its location is awesome, its comfortable, and its always cheap. When you search other hotels in Tokyo you're hit with $400 and up for something decent to nice. The Villa Fontaine is basic, but undeniably comfortable, big rooms for Tokyo, clean, SUPER quiet at night (which means great sleep), and usually runs me about $90 a night. The most I have ever paid here is $120 a night.Just a warning to those of you who are used to 4 and 5 star hotels. This is NOT one of them. You may see some stains on the carpet. The bathtub may creak a little, but trust me - I am a very picky, easily dissatisfied traveler, and if you can overlook these types of things, you will love how much money you've saved, and how much sleep you got. If you want plush carpet and beautiful lighting with a gorgeous lobby and a nice LCD television, you wont get it here. What you will get here for only $90 a night (unHEARD of in Tokyo):1) A full desk with free high speed internet (LAN only)2) A large bed that is firm, but a nice down comforter.3) Complete silence in the halls, no room service waking you up in the mornings.4) A full closet with clean and pressed pajamas for you (two sets), slippers (two sets), robes, and shoe accessories.5) A hair dryer and full toiletry kit in the bathroom6) A toilet with bidet for those special moments alone7) A basic shower with removeable hand held nozzel8) a sitting area with a couch and coffee table.9) Large windows with blackout curtains in the morning10) An air system that keeps the room just as you want it.11) A small refrigerator, and tea/utencils12) A very cool lighting setup with dimmers and foot lights13) A contemporary alarm clock and two telephones (one in room one in bathroom)14) Fresh towels every morning even if you do not have the room made up (they hang them on your door)15) A 20 inch television with remote.I would suggest asking for a room that is opposite the elevators on the opposite wall if you are a very light sleeper. The rooms over there are the smaller rooms, but you will have complete silence at night. If you get a room that is to your right as you exit the elevators, you may have to deal with traffic noise at night. The quietest wall, by far, is the one opposite the elevators, across the courtyard.There is a pool, but it seems to be dried up for the winter, and they do not have an in-house restaurant anymore, but they have Domino's Pizza delivery right to your room (no tip required) and several other food delivery options as well.I really love this hotel. Its the place I always stay when I come here, to avoid the insane costs of hotels and have a nice big quiet comfortable room with some stains here and there :)", "Date": "Apr 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR785331469", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "HotelGuru9"}, {"Content": "Roppongi hotel Huge room.

I wasn't asking for much, having stayed in Tokyo before and being accustomed to small rooms and minimal amenities. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the bigger room, and the bed was amazing - with the down pillows and a real down-filled blanket! I was traveling for almost a month in Asia by that point, and in this hotel I had probably the best restful sleep during my whole trip. Staff was exceptionally helpful - they helped me book the Limousine Bus for the airport, and I had only 5 minutes to get to another hotel to catch the bus. The front desk lady called the cab for me, helped me get my luggage into the cab, and phoned the ANA Hotel where the Limo Bus was picking up people to tell them I was on my way! That's going way, way above and beyond the line of duty. When I arrived at ANA, the Limo Bus representative was waiting with a hand-written sign with my name - all that in 5 minutes. I recommended Villa Fontaine Roppongi Annex to my friends, who stayed there in early January 2008 and also loved it.

Rooms as of April 2006 were running about $120 USD per night. Full queen size beds available, rooms look contemporary with ambient lighting and accent walls. Most importantly they are extremely quiet. The walk to the heart of the club scene in Roppongi is a quick 10 minutes up the hill, versus 20 mins from Tokyo Prince. The hotel staff speak English, but facilities are minimal (no gym, no pool, no laundry).And now our experience:The facilities are minimal, but the rooms are quite big for Japanese conditions. And the service is very, very good! The reception and also the staff in the breakfast room are very obliging and helpful! As some reviews for other hotels of this chain have already said, the breakfast is very simple, but they served toasts with butter and jam, tea, coffee, some salad and soup which was sufficient. I really need my coffee in the morning, so it was enough for me. The nearest station was the Roppongi-itchome station of the Namboku line - integrated in the very new building Izumi Garden. Very convenient! Roppongi station of Hibiya line and Tameike-sanno of Ginza-line are in walking distance as well.Besides, it is very close to THE main streets of Roppongi and its nightlife - for the one who likes to be close to that.
