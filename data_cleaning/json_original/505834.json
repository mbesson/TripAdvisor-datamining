{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A salaryman's special... Checked in here after a week in a friend's cramped apartment. The basic economy room with a single bed was very comfy for the price. A chain hotel, it's not overflowing with charm, but more practicality -- a comfortable bed in a small but clean room with a window. I particularly liked that they had a coin-operated washer/dryer on the 2nd floor, which saved me a fortune in laundry charges. Beware before taking a room on the smoking floors -- quite an acrid smell up there. The in-house restaurant also decent. Short walk to some beautiful old temples; subway is about 8-10 minutes on foot. Narita Express bus also right down the street at the Tokyo Prince Hotel -- take a cab, especially with luggage.", "Date": "Apr 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR398914589", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gacman17"}, {"Content": "Definitely recommended if you're looking for an affordable place       A view of the hotel as we walked back", "Date": "Jan 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR620393784", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "linteater"}, {"Content": "Good value for money We stayed in this hotel for New Year's Eve 2007. This hotel is a typical business hotel. Rooms are of average size, average furniture  the bathroom is ordinary. You get what you pay.

Admittedly it's a walk from the metro, but there are three lines all within 10 minutes. You can walk to the Shiedome, Ginza, and Roppongi if you like a stroll. I had a single room in the main block. Facilities were good, service excellent from staff, bed comfortable, traffic a bit noisy but not too bad, breakfast OK, Lan broadband connection worked. I was on a conference rate of 13,000Y all inclusive per night, which was good value for me. We were at another Tokyu hotel in May, so it seems a good reliable chain.", "Date": "Oct 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR427572255", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Briquenay"}, {"Content": "Decent hotel.. but way too far of a walk from the JR Room is fairly decent sized. Price is reasonable. Internet is a dialup connection, not high speed as stated on some websites. A little bit out of the way in terms of getting to the JR station (A good 15 mins walk -- believe me, after a long day in exploring the city, you want a hotel that's close by the JR station). If you're taking the Airport Limousine Bus, it doesn't stop at this hotel (You have to Tokyo Prince Hotel). That's another pain in the neck if you have heavy luggages since you have to get up this pedestrian bridge to get to that hotel. There's a few nice noodle houses nearby as well as convenient stores, but the area nearby kinda shuts down after 10pm. On my next trip, I'll definately pay a few extra bucks to stay at a hotel near a JR station...", "Date": "Jan 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR309702498", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "yusuke6_6"}, {"Content": "Great Tokyo Hotel Pick Tucked into the Shinbashi district of Tokyo, not far from the Tokyo Tower and Zojo-ji temple, this hotel gives you the city without all the hubbub. Staff are courteous, patient and service requests promptly. Rooms are clean, well decorated and you can open the windows if you want fresh air. The attached restaurant serves a very decent breakfast buffet for 1000 yen - didn't try other meals here. TV remote came equipped with an English button, if you'd prefer your incessant CNN news in that language. Bathrooms are small, as are all bathrooms in Japan (except those at expressway reststops), but clean with eco-friendly choices. The area offers many different types of restaurants, from simple lunchrooms to glorious, skyhigh, trendy types with city views. Three subway stations within a ten-minute walk - Toranomon, Onarimon and Shinbashi. Big plus is one shrine and one temple within a four-minute walk. And don't miss the French cheese shop uphill behind the hotel, accessable by the alley.", "Date": "Aug 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR529875479", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "alpetor"}, {"Content": "A pleasant functional hotel A nice hotel with everything you need. The rooms are typical of Japanese hotels at this range, fully functional with all the expected amenities (even a shirt press in the room) but nothing extra. There is a free wireless hotspot in a corner of the lobby tucked away by the vending machines. There are also computers available which charge 100 yen/10 min of internet. The staff is polite and helpful (as in most Japanese hotels) and they speak English and English maps are readily available. The area is quiet, not exciting really but a high class area and a short walk from a small shrine. It is a good 15 minute walk to the JR Shimbashi station but a 7 minute walk to the Kamiyacho and Onarimon Tokyo Metro and Oedo Mita line stations.", "Date": "Jun 16, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR887600989", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Perfetto hotel per divertirsi a Tokyo!   showReview(19643507, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR330012058", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "nettes City-Hotel in guter Lage   showReview(17434676, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR483793758", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Pratique, bien situ\u8305 et service impeccable   showReview(11458807, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR568211611", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gut und preiswert   showReview(11346021, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR221347295", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Emplacement id\u8305al   showReview(11335067, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR871115430", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "bon rapport qualit\u8305 prix   showReview(11346020, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR180910126", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Bon rapport qualit\u8305/prix   showReview(11346019, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR121564632", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d505834-r14960803-Shimbashi_Atagoyama_Tokyu_Inn-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "505834", "Price": "$173"}}
