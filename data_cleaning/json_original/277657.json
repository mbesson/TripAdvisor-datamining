The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean. It was quiet at night. The breakfast was an odd combination of stuff but we liked it. Good quality bread and cheese -- delicious. We were on the \"third floor\" but that was equivalent to the sixth floor in the USA - - at least we walked up six flights of stairs to get there. The elevator was not working while we were there. The room had a nice view but there were some weird things. When you turned on the hot water, you got good pressure for about five seconds and then it went down to a drizzle. You could manipulate it to make it work but it made the shower a bit of a challenge. The shower was odd too. It was just a little depression in the floor and it was hard to contain the water within it. There was no hair dryer in the room. They might have had one at the front desk but that would involve walking down six flights of stairs to get it and walking back up again to dry my hair. I just didn't wash it for three days since letting it dry naturally was not an option - - too cold outside. Although there was ample space for them, there were no towel bars in the bathroom. What do you do with your wet towel? While we were watching staff set the tables in the breakfast room, he dropped a clean spoon on the floor and then proceeded to pick it up and set it at the clean place setting.

I've stayed in better budget hotels in Amsterdam than Hotel Brouwer. While I can imagine the challenges of maintaining a historic structure (while still managing to run a successful business), it felt much more neglected than I anticipated for a budget accommodation. The two best things about staying here: 1. The location: an easy walk from the central train station (5-7 minutes) and in the beautiful, historic Jordaan neighborhood. Easy walking to cafes, tulip market, the canals, and main sights. 2. The breakfast: hot croissants, soft boiled egg, English muffin, and your own pot of french press coffee. However, the breakfast room could use a good, deep clean. What wasn't so great: 1. Beds - uncomfortable 2. Shower - entire bathroom floor flooded while showering. Do not put anything on the floor. 3. Window coverings - the view of the canal was wonderful. However, only two of the four windows had coverings.

I did not like the way the shower and the toilet were laid out but everything worked in there - it just had one of those showers where you had to be careful or else you'll have water all over the bathroom. We didn't really mind this too much but like most traditional Amsterdam canal homes the stair case is very steep.

My room had great views of canals and a laminate floor with a pleasing gradient. Thee was a little urban car and scooter noise at night, and the sound insultation from other rooms wasn't great, though not enough to bother me. 'Budget' would be a fairer description of Hotel Brouwer than 'generous'. The room was adequate, rather than enchanting: details betray the owner's awareness of his profit margin. The reception/breakfast room is attractrively Bohemian. The website omits mention of the 5% tourist tax that's added to the quoted prices. It's a small place run by a small staff. Don't expect a 24-hour service, or to pay with plastic. When I arrived late (as agreed) the night guy answered the door grumpily: the message hadn't reached him. To be fair, he softened in the face of relentless charm. Breakfast doesn't start until 8.30 am, which will frustrate some. But the manager went some way out of his way to ensure I didn't leave hungry when I had to set off before then for a morning flight. And their simple breakfast is more than adequate. The speed of the wifi internet fluctuates eerily; you wouldn't want to rely on it. You could do a lot worse. It felt a little pricey for its standard.

Close to almost everything and especially Centraal Station and all the canal boats. Literally a 3-5 min walk. I was very comfortable there and I stayed in the \"Mesdag\" Room. It was located on the 2nd floor. It had a beautiful view looking out on the canal and as far as your eye could see. It was very cold there and all the canals were pretty much frozen. Breakfast was served from 8am-10am (or 10:30) They pretty much had the same thing each morning and you could know when it was breakfast time, as the entire hotel was intoxicating with the baked items, which consisted of freshly made croissants, something like an English muffin and another like a whole wheat sour dough. With 2 slices of cheese, some butter & jelly and a boiled egg if you liked. Small glass of OJ and coffee or tea. It was delish. I think I ate there about 3 mornings out of the week that I stayed there. They had recommended a few places to eat as well which were also in walking distance. My room had it's own bathroom and it was a single room, but quite cozy :-) The lighting in the bathroom was not great so I was constantly using the light from the bedroom and they had a full length mirror on the back of the bathroom door, so applying make up and dressing was made much easier. Oh the walls are paper thin, so be careful what you do and say :-) You could also use their computer from 8am-8pm which is found in a small area off the dining/lobby area. Their internet access was very, very slow. I used it a couple of times. Wi-fi is also accessible there as well. The managers were quite friendly and very helpful. I settled my bill the night before my leaving as it was an early morning flight, so all I did was leave the key in the room. They also have a lift, just in case u were worried about lugging bags up 3 flight of stairs. It can only take 1 person at a time. It's really small. The only bad experience I had and I don't think it was quite their fault but I was told that they used a particular driver for airport/taxi runs and was told that one would be there by 6:30am and I should be outdoors by no later than 6:20am. I did just that and waited and waited and waited and ......it wasn't until 7am when I saw a light on in the lobby and went and tapped on the window and the gentleman was kind enough to open the door so I could tell him what I wanted. He checked something on the desk and told me that he didnt see anything about a call for a cab. In any event he called one and they finally came about 7:20am. My flight was leaving at 9 and I wasn't sure what check in was going to be like and or security check. By the time I got to the gate was approx 8:40 (Thank goodness) :-) But everything else was perfect.

The owner couple were then living on-site and it seemed well run, although he was verbally uncommunicative and she was rather perfunctory (far from a \"welcoming\" atmosphere). We stayed there again last month - for six nights this time - and in the same room. The owner couple no longer live on-site and they now have a revolving crew of workers, none of whom seems to communicate with anyone else working there (much less, with the owners). The American woman working there was rather *nasty*, which wasn't appreciated. When I made the reservation this time around, I was very explicit in making sure the elevator goes to the top floor (I couldn't remember after several years and the web site description was unclear), because I now have problems with one of my knees and the Brouwer is VERY tall & has many steep/narrow stairs (as is certainly typical of old buildings in Amsterdam's city center [and the reason why we wanted to stay on the top floor is because we didn't feel like listening to creaking floors until late at night when people walked around above us, plus the view is best]). On THREE of our six days there, the elevator didn't work when we attempted to go downstairs! To make matters worse, I was TRAPPED inside the elevator on two of those days (for *several minutes* each time) and it was quite frightening (the elevator is *miniscule*, which is certainly understandable - but \"claustrophobic\" is an understatement when you're trapped inside it). Supposedly the elevator repair people were called each day and supposedly they repaired the elevator each day (certainly on the *third* day, but I wonder about the other two days). On top of all that, the person who was working there on the first two days it happened had the GALL to tell me I shouldn't expect a working elevator and that I should have stayed on a lower floor if it was going to be a problem!!! When I finally managed to \"escape\" from the elevator each time, I had to walk all the way down with severe knee problems (I was also wearing a brace on the problem knee). The breakfast was pretty good, but that's standard for the Netherlands - although it's not so incredible that I would rave about it (however; unlike another reviewer, I thought the coffee was decent).

The one staff person there suggested that we put out bags into the office (which was filthy and covered with dust) and come back at 11AM when our room would be ready. No offer of breakfast or coffee. The Staff person did give us directions to a coffee shop. We picked this supposed hotel on location and our travel date based on time that they had a room available. I was celebrating my 60th birthday and decided to wait along with my friend based on the positive reviews about the hotel. I have no idea who wrote them, but I'll not be fooled again. We refused to wait for 11AM because we were both tired from the long flight and returned at 10AM the room was ready. And what a room. From pictures on Web Sites the rooms appeared large nicely decorated each with a different theme. To our surprise the room was very small, sparsely decorated, no place to hang your clothing, and paper thin walls. A sign on the door stated \"Even when inside the room please use the chain lock for your safety\". We found this disturbing. When given the key we were told that sometimes the front door was locked and we could use the side entrance. The side entrance was facing a street that had numerous \"Coffee Shops\", was the heart of the Red Light District and various unsavory activities going on. If you didn't open the side door wide enough you ran into a huge beam. The noise from the street was loud and always there. The location was one of the reasons we decided on this \"hotel\" overlooking the canal. There were no amenties. No staff person was ever around after breakfast and you couldn't get a cup of coffee or water or room service, the towels were rough and looked old and dingy. Also, because there was no staff around the front door was consistently locked and you had to use the side door. We were going to stay five days as scheduled, but changed hotels instead. We stay here only 2 nights, more than enough. The best thing that can be said about the Hotel Brouwer is that it is not a Hotel. The least that can be said is that it calls itself a Hotel.

I was a bit disappointed when I arrived, but I had been spoiled by a few nights at absolutely gorgeous B&Bs in Belgium and was tired from a train journey. Once I'd had a rest and a walk around the canals I realized that the Brouwer is a good value for the right clientele. It's a very easy walk from Centraal Station and Damrak Street (where there are trams and starting points for bus tours). Also a short walk to the Anne Frankhuis. I didn't think the businesses or people on the street were any scruffier than other streets in the area. My room was on the 3rd floor and I wasn't bothered by street noise. The Brouwer is a reasonably priced small hotel in a historic building. That means the building is old, but my room and bathroom were in good condition. My bathroom was very modern and clean and the radiator in the shower stall was nice to have on a cold morning. My room had a modern television and a nice view of the canal. Breakfast included was very good. Boiled egg, cheese, breakfast breads, butter, jam, juice, coffee/tea. Here's some tips for prospective guests: It's an older hotel with a very tiny lift and steep spiral staircase. Anyone with mobility issues, lots of large luggage, fears of tiny elevators/lifts, etc. should be aware of this. There are maps and a few brochures in the little area near the computer (free use for guests) but you're pretty much on your own for finding tours to take, etc. I walked to Lindbergh tours office on Damrak street and booked my excursions there. I recommend the halfday tour to Marken and Volendam especially. If you need a full-service hotel with tour desk, large lifts, restaurant, etc., this is not the hotel for you. If you're looking for a low-priced hotel with decent location this place is good.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cIf you are American, I would not stay here.\u201d", "Author": "JenniferJK", "ReviewID": "UR38274917", "Content": "We booked a 5 night stay at the hotel in february 2009. Our stay began August 8. When we arrived, the owner was not there, the manager was not there and a maintenance man was left running the place. There are only 8 rooms at this hotel. Seven are modern and the other is a dump. Guess what room we (the americans) got? And remember we reserved six months in advance. Let me tell you a little about this room. You go up an old spiral staircase, and I mean old, steep and wore out wooden spiral staircase that starts from the hotel office. You unlock the door and enter the \"room\" or should I say the bathroom door. Then you have to go up another six or so steep and narrow winding stairs and you come to a bedroom on the right (reasonably ok), then you have to turn left and go up another steep and narrow five steps or so and you come to a room that has an old wooden table and chairs in the middle and a old double size bed built into the room in the corner. The bed (and its enclosure), table, chairs and chest look like they had been resurrected from the middle ages. Worn out would be a complement. The floor was so uneven that we set a bottle of wine on the wood table and it would slide off all by itself! The floor of some sort of stone tile had many broken or missing pieces and was unsightly as well as filthy from all the dirt and crap in the open gapping cracks. Now here is the real clincher. Several boxes of rat poison were set about the floor of the room and I accidently kicked one and rat poison pieces scattered throughout the worn out tile floor. This \"room\" is on three levels with steep and very narrow steps leading to each level. An accident waiting to happen at the least and a major pain in the rear to use. Bathroom (very nice and modern I would add) on the lowest level, a separate bedroom on the second level and the main room (the real dump) on the upper level. All the stairs starting from the office level look like they have been around since before Columbus discovered America. All the stairs are steep, narrow, totally worn out and absolutely filthy. After the first night we asked to be moved to another room, which fortunately the manager accomodated. Had this not been done we would have checked out. In our 30+ years of travel throughout the world, this hotel (this room in particular) ranks as one of the worse. As I said, there are seven modern rooms. From reading other comments about this hotel on this site, the rooms vary tremendously in size, bathroom amenities, etc. And the double rooms are all charged the same rate. So you pay the same rate for the rathole (our first night), the room we stayed in for four nights(reasonably nice) and the better rooms still on the 2nd and 3rd floor. Fair? You decide. Again, we reserved our room six months in advance. I doubt that the rathole was the only one available at that time. The hotel advertises internet (downstairs) and wifi in the rooms. Wifi never worked and the internet computer was down for two of our days. During the day there was no one around if you had any questions or needed assistance. The night before we checked out, at 11 pm we got back to our room and our phone was ringing. It was the manager insisting that we pay up then and not the next morning. We had to leave at 8 am and I guess that was to early for him to be at the hotel. Had he informed us the day before of this condition, I would have just paid him for the stay then. I told the manager he would be paid at 8 am the next morning and if he didn't like it, too bad. He finally after some grumbling agreed. Bottom line is this: Nice location on the canal in the heart of the touristy area, all rooms have view of canal and seven of the rooms are decent I guess. If you make a reservation at this place insist on one of the seven modern rooms and preferably on the second or third floor. Under no circumstances take the room that leads up from the downstairs office. That is the dump. No airconditioning here, so it can be warm and stuffy in the rooms with the windows closed because street noise can get quite loud from all the drunks wandering around until the wee hours of the morning. And did I mention the several piles of human excrement outside the door on the day we left? All in all, I can't recommend this place for the simple reason, in my view the hotel ownership is dis-honest. Anyone should be told about the dump room if that is where they are going to be staying WHEN THEY BOOK. I simply can not get past this.

It's a wonderful old canal house. Staying here made it feel like we were really experiencing life like Amsterdammers! I am most comfortable making reservations directly, rather than through a 3rd party, so I actually called the hotel about 8 months before we left. We originally wanted to stay a week starting April 15th, but they were already completely booked - and even further on into the year. So book early! But they had a cancellation for the first week of April, so we decided to go with that. I had read that the Escher room was the most comfortable, so I decided to reserve that one, and fortunately, that's were the cancellation was. We stayed there for 5 nights, but it was already booked the last night so they moved us to the Van Gogh room. Both rooms were wonderful! I LOVED the huge bathroom in the Escher room. It was very quiet and peaceful. The bathroom had a shower, two sinks, a toilet and a tub. With all the walking you do in Amsterdam, it was wonderful to take a long, hot soak in the tub! The tub was narrow, but is very long and high. I really loved the lay-out of the Van Gogh room. It was also very quiet - we never heard anyone else moving around. The bathroom is smaller - it has one sink, one toilet and a shower (no tub). The room has TONS of windows, which I loved. Both rooms had two twin bed pushed together to make one bed, which was actually kind of nice (hubby tosses a lot). The comforters are thick and cozy to curl up under. The stairs are very narrow and spiral up to the top floor. We always took them going down, but usually took the elevator going up. The elevator is very tiny, but it does the job. It took us a coupla runs to get all my luggage up, which was fine. I was really glad they had an elevator! A lot of canal houses don't, and it was a wonderful convenience. The breakfast were simple but really good. There were croissants, rolls and crumpets with real butter and jam. We had coffee, juice and a variety of teas. There was also sliced cheese (which was wonderful) and soft-boiled eggs. The staff was friendly and helpful. They helped us take up our luggage up to the room (and I brought waaay too much luggage). Also, the day we switched rooms we were gone all day on a tour, and they moved all our luggage for us. That same morning we were leaving really early to go on a tour, and I had gone down to the lobby to check email before we left. While I was waiting for hubby the owner came in carrying a tray of croissants. When she found out we were leaving early she wrapped a couple up for us to take with us. Several times I went down to the main desk to ask for directions or recommendations, and every time they were patient and helpful. On the last day our flight left really early, and the day before they made a taxi restervation for us. (If we'd had less luggage we would've just taken the train from Centraal Station). They made our stay easy and comfortable! We loved the location - on the Singel Canal just a coupla blocks from Centraal Station. It was an easy walk to the Pancake Bakery, Wok to Walk, the Anne Frank House, Centraal Station, the Red Light District and Dam Square (where the Royal Palace, New Church and Madame Tussauds are). We found tons of cafes, stores for shopping, fast food and an ATM that takes foreign bank cards nearby. It is a bit further to go to the main restaurant and shopping street (Leidesplein), the museum district, or the club area (Rembrandtsplein), but it's a short, easy tram or taxi ride. I wish we had gotten the I AMsterdam cards, as you can ride any public transportation with the card. The Hotel Brouwer is the perfect hotel for really soaking up the Amsterdam experience. I love small B&B type places - I feel much more connected to the people and the places we visit, and the Brouwer was exactly what I was looking for and more than I expected. Now, my mom is a little more into convenience and comfort, and I know it wouldn't have been a good fit for her. I think that's where some of the less enthusiastic reviews have come from. If you're more into room service and valets, by all means choose a modern hotel that will help you make the very most of your stay!

I was originally referred to the hotel by the Rick Steves Amsterdam, Brugge, and Brussels guidebook. From there, I visited the hotel's website, and then the listing here on the tripadvisor site. Based on everything I had seen, plus the ridiculously central location, and all of the amazing reviews, I was very excited to stay here...especially for such a great price. This was my first trip to Amsterdam, and I was also traveling solo (I am a 26 year old female). When I initially contacted the hotel, they only had a single room available for one of the 2 nights I was going to be in Amsterdam (everything else was fully booked, and, understandably so after having stayed there). So, figuring that was better than nothing, I chose to reserve that room and make arrangements for the following night at another hotel, but I asked the hotel owner to please let me know if anything became available. I checked back with the hotel about a week later, and there were no single rooms available for my second night (still), but, having explained my situation about traveling alone, etc, the owner graciously offered me a double room for the second night at the single room rate. I was very impressed by that kind of hospitality, and greatly appreciated it. Switching rooms in between was a small price to pay to be able to stay at my #1 choice hotel. I arrived in Amsterdam hours before traditional \"check-in\" time, but they kindly allowed me access to my room to store my luggage so that I could spend time sightseeing while the room was being cleaned and prepared for my stay. The first night, I had a single, en-suite room...I believe it was called the \"Mesdaq\" room. It was small, but perfect. It had a very comfortable twin bed with fresh linens, a down comforter, etc. There was also a nice desk and chair that faced the window. The bathroom was small but functional with a good shower. The room also had a small clothes cabinet, an end-table with a phone, etc. It was simple, but perfect...exactly what I had been expecting, but somehow better once actually there. The view of the Singel Canal from my windows was wonderful! The second day, I moved to and stayed in the double room next door (I think it was the Van Gogh Room). There is only one word to describe this room (after having spent 2 weeks in budget hotels in the UK and France): HUGE! The two twin beds had been moved together to form one large double bed. There was also a nice table and chairs, a clothing cabinet, a larger bathroom than the previous room, and little shelves next to the beds with the phone, alarm clock, etc. The best part of this room, however, was the windows! This room is located on the 3rd (I think) floor of the canal house, and it is on the corner of the canal-side, so there are literally windows along two full walls of this large room. It was simply amazing and afforded simply beautiful views of the canals and streets below. I didn't want to leave! The hotel has a very small elevator which was perfect for getting my luggage up to the rooms. The spiral stairs were very steep, but fun! There was also a computer with internet access down in one of the ground level common rooms which was very useful for checking e-mail quickly, as well as confirming departure information for my flight, etc. Breakfast was served down in the breakfast room and was simple, but very, very good. It consisted of some cheeses, ham, tea, juice, and croissants/rolls. I had the opportunity to speak with the female owner during breakfast (and I cannot remember her name...I am pretty sure it started with a \"J\")....she was very, very nice and helpful. I enjoyed talking to her and learning more about the hotel's history...she is an American ex-pat, and was very friendly. The hotel istelf is very centrally located along the Singel Canal, less than a 10 minute walk to Amsterdam's Centraal Station. I walked/rode a bike everywhere in town and never once felt the need to use one of the trams. Nothing was more than a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel...it was perfect. The hotel does lie on the outer edge of the red light district (the heart of the red light district, however, is about 1/3 mile east of the hotel), but I never once felt unsafe or anything like that. In fact, it added some character to my stay! The next time I am in Amsterdam, I will CERTAINLY stay here again if rooms are available!

In fact, when we arrived in our room, we both remarked how spotless it looked and how clean it smelled. My only complaint is the lack of shower guard that someone else mentioned.

The floors are so slanted (at least in the Van Gogh room) that my roommate and I had to leave after 2 nights of a planned 8-night stay because of her vertigo. There are no TV's or radios and, I know, I know... you don't come to Amsterdam to watch TV, but every so often it is nice to hang out at the hotel. At the Brower, all access to any common area is cut off at 6 p.m. You must go to your room, where there is not even a comfy chair or writing table... just a couple of hard backed chairs and two not-quite-twin sized bed which particularly slide apart (as noted in earlier reviews), especially when the the floor is at a slant. The management is courteous but not particularly friendly--we experienced (and we are fairly kind people in our sixties) very perfunctory, almost New York-rude service.... not the family atmosphere we had been led to expect. There is no wi-fi Internet service, even if you wanted to pay. Bottom line... if you are looking for a basic youth hostel, the Brower is great. If you want a hotel with any amenties... keep on looking. We ended up at a 4-star just down the street for only 10 euros more a night on a great special. Also, and none of the earlier reviews I read mentioned this... the Brower is right next to the red-light district and right next door, there are a couple lovely women displaying their wares -- something families not interested in this part of Amsterdam culture might not all enjoy.

What a special gesture! Of course they charged us for the flowers and cake (to be reembursed by the girlfriend back home), but I have a feeling they didn't make a dime off of it... the charges were so low!

It did have a phone, but no TV (which was fine). Local calls are cheap; calls to European cell phones are not - check before you call! BATHROOM: The shower is basically a third of the bathroom sectioned off by a shower curtain and a small dip in the floor, so it was a little tricky to shower without getting everything wet, but I did it. Otherwise the bathroom was very modern. VIEW: Spectacular. The room faces the intersection of two canals, which are lit up at night.

It is quaint, with a fabulous location, overlooking the canal and smack bang in the middle of the red light district. This being said, I never once felt uneasy or nervous. Forget the chain hotels, this is a perfect example of the authenic experience you want when travelling. The staff are friendly, and the breakfasts were lovely, served in lovely china, in front of the fireplace. The bathroom was small, the rooms are old, and the rooms weren't serviced (we only stayed two nights though), but it didn't matter.

The room is basic, but just what you need when most of the time will be spent walking around Amsterdam. The only complaint is something common in cities and old buildings, it was a bit noisy outside. Unlike most European breakfasts, this one is very filling. As others stated, each person gets 3 types of roll, cheeses, a freshly medium boiled egg, coffee, juice. The people are VERY friendly. We found the hotel easy going and relaxed. The stairs are narrow, but unless you go to a big hotel its going to be the deal in most hotels in the area. There are red lights on the back of the hotel, and two down the block...but really we found the area to be quaint and lovely. If you don't want to see red lights you don't have to do, but it is Amsterdam so thats part of the deal. Definitely walk from Centraal Station, its about 4 blocks on the left of the canal.

I needed a room in Amsterdam at the last minute for just one night and after reading the reviews of the Brouwer on Tripadvisor and checking their web site I called them directly and booked the only room they had available - a double for 75 Euro including breakfast. My whole experience right from the booking call to the lovely relaxed breakfast before I left was excellent. This is probably as close to staying with a Dutch family in their own home as I will get. I was given the 'Mondriaan' room right up at the top of the building - great bright space that would have made a perfect artist studio. Windows onto the Singel canal which was stunning at night when lit up. I think the official rating is 1 star and the facilities strictly reflect that - no TV ( brilliant peace and quiet) and no other usual in-room extras. However the room was neat, clean and furnished almost in a Shaker style. I would love to have been able to spend some more time relaxing in it. Great to have a hotel room which lends itself to reading. The bathroom was spacious with a great 'wet shower' area and also a really good bath. One slight downside in being in the roof was that the plumbing for the building talked to me most of the night - but even with that I got a great night's sleep in a very comfortable bed. The reception area has local paintings and family memorabilia everywhere - this has been a family run place for years and has an interesting history. The dog's bed was beside my table at breakfast although he/she didn't make an appearance. The location is also perfect - a few minutes walk to Centraal Station and sandwiched between the centre of town and the Jordaan district. There are loads of good eating places all within 5 minutes walk - the owner or any of his staff are happy to point you in the right direction. I most definitely would re-visit the Brouwer - in fact I would not now stay anywhere else in Amsterdam - a real find and under \u00c2\u00a350 for a room for two people in the centre of Amsterdam,overlooking a grand canal in a lovely neighbourhood - what else can be said.", "Date": "February 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.

The room was on the top floor with a comanding view of the Singel Canal, bathroom was huge and everything was comfy and clean...ah...just the way I like it! When I booked this time, I asked for the other room on the third floor, which is named Mondriaan. It was set up differently from the Escher room, but it was awesome too! The bathroom was also huge and as usual, totally clean and comfy. I never get tired of the view, either. In fact, we never seem to notice that there is no TV in the room. New Year's Eve in Amsterdam was something that I will never forget. There were fireworks EVERYWHERE. I was worried that we were not close enough to the action on the sleepy Singel, however the action found us! Fireworks were going off in every direction that I could look in! We were totally overwhelmed by how many there were and it lasted for hours! We had such a wonderful time and were completely exhausted when we got back to our hotel! The next morning, when we got up (late), we noticed a note on our door stating that breakfast would be held for an extra hour to accommodate us later sleepers!

I've stayed in A'dam many times but only learned of this place. It is a GREAT value for the money, but don't expect business-class level services. That is not what this place is about. The Hotel Brouwer is about settling back and not rushing. The breakfast doesn't start until 8:30 and is delicious. The coffee, bread basket, eggs and cheese were very tasty and filling. While there is no TV (unless you ask for one but why?), limited phone service, and modest toiletries, the rooms are a good size, the bathrooms are good size and there was a lot of hot water for the shower or tub. The views over the Singel canal are much better than watching TV and you get a friendly family atmosphere that is a throw back 15 years. The non-smoking policy and friendly staff makes it very family friendly. The only warning is that if you come in after 11pm, you are asked not to use the elevator -- this could be difficult if your room is on the top floor unless you are in decent shape. All in all, this place is a winner and I will stay again.", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot good at all and the mouse exists.\u201d", "Author": "Hawker", "ReviewID": "UR3936793", "Content": "This hotel has amazing reviews on this website so I was really looking forward to staying here. I have backpacked around Europe twice now and have stayed in many 1 to 2 star places of similar price. I can only say that this is the second worse place I have ever stayed in (the worst was a half star in florence). As we walked into the room all I could see was a swarm of flies and other assorted insects. They just kept flying around the room. Everytime I came in I killed off most of them but they just kept coming back for the whole three days. There were copious marks on the roof from other people trying to kill these insects. Don't stay here in summer either. It was hot. No fan. I'm from Queensland in Australia so I'm used to the heat and it was still hot. The mouse does exist. We left early in the morning and you have to walk through the kichen to drop your keys off. A mouse scurried over the bench where breakfast is prepared. Disgusting. Also no TV and no TV room. You are there to experience Amsterdam but it's just nice to watch a little TV before bed. Your on holidays. The only good things about this place are the price and location, but surely for an extra couple of dollars its worth staying somewhere else.

Having said all that, the bedrooms were lovely and clean and the beds were quite comfortable, although it was very cold.

We stayed at The Hotel Brouwer on 24th and 25th of July (Fri & Sat) and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I have never visited Amsterdam before but my UK based brother and his fiancee had (4 times) and they believe it to be the best value and best quality hotel they'd visited. Considering they'd stayed at hotels up to twice the price (and none cheaper) they really thought it was great find and one that they will return to. The rooms were clean and comfortable with and authentic Amsterdam charm in a building that is 350 odd years old. You are situated right on one of the inner canals (Singel) with a short walk to the central train station, dam square, the red light district, the park, markets, coffeeshops, pubs, food, anne frank, bike hire etc. Breakfast was served consisting of fresh crumpets, multi-grain roll, crossant eggs, coffee and orange juice and was a great start to the day. We will definitely return to this hotel and recommend it to anyone who wants a good honest value for money hotel with the personal touches from an ower who really cares about the guests. Budget conscious travellers will find this one hard to beat. The location is nice and quiet but close enough to the hot spots that you are not left out of anything. You even get a beautiful view of the canal from your room.

Street noise was not a problem, maybe because we were so high up or maybe because I've heard one too many rock concerts! The tiny (and I mean tiny) elevator is a big plus though the stairs are not as bad as most restored canal houses. Room was spacious and had a very generous private bathroom. Room is a double (by pushing two twin beds together) and they kept separating, especially during heavy exercising ;) Towel allotment is a bit stingy but not a problem.
