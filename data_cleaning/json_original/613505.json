The problems started at cheking in when the receptionist made a mistake on the deposit receipt. Good thing my husband cought it. The place is smelly and damp. The room was tiny. Bathroom shower drain was clogged and the water was all over the bathroom and into the room. After 3 days of our complanes the plumber showed up for 5 min and did not fix it. We changed the room but the shower there was just as bad. There was no shampoo, conditioner, lotion. Planty of condoms from the minibar and business cards from working girls. We left money in the room safe and $20 got stolen (not all of the money). Breacfast was old and cold. The hotel is far from the center and any night life. I did no expect a palace for the price but at least some basics.", "Date": "Sep 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR898042317", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "nutcrackerNY"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d613505-r12194720-Peony_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "613505", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
