{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good value basic hotel I mostly agree with the review by mgan1 in April2007. By Western standards the room was tiny, but quite normal for Tokyo. The same with the price (\u62e270 per room). It was handy to the shopping district (by underground train), and very interesting to explore around the hotel. We hardly saw any other foreigners so we felt we were in authentic Japan! The hotel staff could speak some limited English and tried to be helpful. We got the bus from the airport into town to a nearby big hotel, then took a taxi the rest of the way. A helpful girl at the airport information counter wrote the address in Japanese script so we could show it to the taxi driver. She also helped us choose the correct bus, although actually it is relatively clear from the internet. Taking the bus most of the way, then switching to a taxi seemed the cheapest option as it is a long way from the airport.", "Date": "Jul 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR800720934", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MakeMineAWine"}, {"Content": "The B Sagenjaya The B Sagenjaya is one of the boutique hotels of [--] I stayed there for two nights in a twin room, two twin beds. The hotel is located out of Tokyo two stops on the Den-en Toshi Line that connects to the JR Yamonote line and M and G metro lines. It is just outside the city boundaries. It is very close to Shibuya, two stops away from shopping and teen hang outspots. The hotel is located in a rather bustling neighborhood, more local shops and restaurants. It is fun to explore around the hotel. The B sagenjaya is a little dated in its rooms with a few modern finishes, meaning new lights on the bedstand and new beddings. You get the terry robe and slippers like the other B hotels. But thhe only main problems with the B sagenjaya is their rooms are laid out rather akward. I stayed at the B aksaka which is newer and better than this B hotel. The bathroom in our room seemed like an airplane bathroom with a four foot soaking tub, rather old and akwardly elevated. You literally have to step up and over, to get in the bathroom. This was quite a challenge for myself and my mother. I kept hitting my knee, since it is so small and compact. I believe this to be a problem for safety and access. It would not be handicap accessible. The room furnishings were dated, the pictures of the website did not clearly match this hotel. On the website the rooms looked modern, but clearly in person, they are not. Anyways this hotel is average, it was $10 more per night than the brandnew B Akasaka. Which was not worth the additional $ rate to pay for the Sagenjaya, since the B Akasaka was clearly a better choice. The staff was friendly and accomodating. They will help you navigate the city and print out directions for you. There is a nice Japanese Restaurant outside the hotel next door that we went to. There is a Korean restaurant inside the hotel that also offers a $10 buffet breakfast. I did not try it though. Overall, this hotel lacks some of the B basics in comfort and luxury, it is a B hotel in Basic accomodations. It is conveniently located than the B akasaka hotel. The train is less than a block from this hotel and it is two stops from Shibuya and 4 stops from Harajuku, so I like the location. If you are looking for a basic hotel with a great location friendly staff, and are not too picky about rooms and furnishings then this hotel will suit your needs.", "Date": "Mar 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR277114834", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "mgan1"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066455-d542989-r18463661-The_B_Sangenjaya-Setagaya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "542989", "Price": "$176"}}
