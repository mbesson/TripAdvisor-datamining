We booked this hotel around 2 months prior to our arrival. We thought that we would really splash out to stay somewhere special and memorable for the NY period, and this Hotel would be roughly double per night what we would spend throughout the rest of the trip. We were attracted to the hospitality of this hotel - the prospect of a welcome drink, buffet breakfast and a packed lunch. Location wise the hotel was good for us. We intended to spend NYE at the Eiffel Tower, which was only about 50min walk away. Those wishing to celebrate at the Arc or Champs Elysses had a much shorter work - only a few hundred metres. The Hotel is also very close to Argentine station. The staff were generally very kind and helpful. We had a checkout of 4.30am and this was no problem. We found the room itself to be pretty ordinary. I would put it on par with an average 3 star room. It was fairly small, the shower was fine, but not amazing, the bed was comfortable without being brilliant. The TV was limited in its selection of cable channels (notably no NT1, which has most of the English programs on French TV). The welcome drink was disappointing, a glass of mostly flat champagne. The breakfast was not very good. It was a classical French breakfast, but the food did not seem overly fresh. There were no hot food options. The 'lunch box' is a nice gesture, but again, very average. A 2eu sandwich, a bag of browning apple pieces, a bottle of water, and a packet of crisps. The bottom line is, this is an average place at a rather expensive price (even taking into account that we were there for NYE, a notoriously expensive time, I still believe this hotel is over its odds). I would suggest you take your money to Montmartre, where it will go MUCH further!", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good location and very friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Jose_Luiz_Verta", "ReviewID": "UR122050308", "Content": "I stayed at Hotel B.W.

Reason I booked is the free continental breakfast, free wifi and location. Arrived at Gare de Nord via Eurostar. Easy to reach the nearest Metro station Argentine. Took less than 10 mins to walk to the hotel, the area was safe and had lots of restaurants on the way. Make sure you look at Google street to know which way to go from the Station. Check in is 2pm and we were allowed to go into our room at 2.20pm. They had an elevator so we could transport our suitcases more easily. The Room: The room was typical for Paris, it could fit two large suitcases (Max length 85cm each) +/- shopping and other small bags. However the room was clean, had a TV which is not HD, bathroom was clean and big enough for my needs, The room included two bedside tables and a medium sized desk for a computer and a kettle with coffee/ tea. These are free unlike others who charge a fortune for. They also left a 500ml bottle of water in our room which was nice. The TV had mostly French channels, for those english speaking they had BBC world news and channel 5. The bed was quite comfortable and the air con is a must given the time of the year, this kept the room nice and cool. We had a window which opened out to the street. Bathroom: As others have commented the bathtub has a glass pane which needs to be pushed in before entering, it can also lead to water on the floor. I just used one of the towels on the floor beforehand. Free Wifi: The free Wifi was very useful and meant I could use my laptop and surf the net. However don't expect fibre optic speed, the download speed maximum is around 15kb/s so you can expect the surfing won't be fast but it's fine for my needs. The continental breakfast: This was useful and saved us some money. This included either orange or grapefruit juice. Then you had a selection of baguettes, croissants chocolate versions, Salami, ham, cheese and eggs with a water boiler to do it the way you want. There is also a variety of cereal with milk. To top it off there is a choice of yogurts and a fruit bowl. There is no lunch/dinner served here, however they do give you a packed lunch which consists of a sandwich, bottle of water 500ml and packet of crisps. Make sure you ask for it at the reception. Location: Hotel close to a RER C station and Argentine on Line 1. Both useful for either reaching the centre with line 1 striaght to the Le Louvre and the RER C striaght to the Eifel Tower. It's also one stop away from RER A line which goes striaght to Disneyland. The location of this hotel is very strategic as there's no point in being close to the Gare de Nord as your using it only twice during your trip, wheras your always goining around Paris. For me mostly the west side. Cons: Our first night our next door neighbour was skyping/ talking all night which annoyed us and showed the weakness of this hotel. The walls are thin and people won't be considerate all the time, with slamming doors and talking late at night. You can try and reduce this by getting a room away from the elevator for starters, but other than that you'll have to tell the residents directly as it's more of a problem with them and the hotel aint going to make your walls thicker overnight. However the rest of the time we had a good nights sleep. Just be considerate when you come back late at night. Travellers tips: The Gare du Nord station is very poor in terms of service and efficieny with only two counters open at any one time and the subsequent huge queues as a result with mostly tourists. The automated machines there are only 3 and they don't take notes, I REPEAT they don't take notes which is so stupid compared to the London Tube. When you change money for Euros make sure you get a bag of 1-2 Euro coins or if your feeling frivolous, use your credit card and get ripped off. There are travel card equivalents whIch are charged by zones wise. For example it's better to get a Mobilis zone 1-5 if going to disneyland as it costs the same to get a return ticket anyways, so it's worth getting this as your going to travel elsewhere from Disneyland for dinner for example. Bare in mind Mobilis can only be bought from automated machines not from the unhelpful manned counters. Or you could a pack of 10 single tickets known as 'carnat' tickets which are 20% cheaper if your not travelling enough to get a Travelcard/ Mobillis. The mobilis and other tickets official website is as follows: http://www.transilien.com/web/site/accueil/guide-du-voyageur/billets-tarifs/billets-abonnements/lang/en Check for Eurostar Plus offers on restaurants and other attractions as you might save some money. Beware people flaunting goods at the Eifel tower and other well known tourist sites, their quality is likely poor and you'll get ripped off. Also beware those trying to sell you wrist bracelets at Sacre Coeur, you have been warned.

Nonetheless, there was very little noise from adjoining rooms. The bathroom was EXTREMELY tiny but very clean and perfectly adequate for my needs: there was plenty of hot water, nice soap, and all the shower fixtures seem new and worked flawlessly. The FREE wifi worked very well. The hotel is on a quiet side street so sleep quality is good; beds and pillows are of average comfort. There are many nice restaurants within a very easy stroll. Most importantly, it is an easy walk to several different metro lines and the Arc d'Triomphe. They offer a free drink in the cozy lobby (meaning beer, wine, juices) on arrival. All desk personnel spoke excellent English and were extremely helpful. The one elevator is absolutely miniscule; fits one person and luggage or two people (claims to fit 4). There was no trouser press or other method for pressing clothes; laundry services are expensive (like 5 Euro to wash a pair of ladies' panties). Breakfast is very minimal continental, consisting only of cereals, bread or croissants, coffee, juices, yogurt and some dried fruits. I travel extensively: this is a great basic, clean, comfy, but small hotel for budget travelers. Highly recommend for the leisure traveler, but not for those requiring business support. I would stay here again for leisure, but for business only if other more attractive alternatives were not available. Caution: The glass shower door swings both in and out. Best to swing it in to enter the shower, then reposition it, but MAKE SURE you have it OVER the bathtub.

All travel arrangements had been made when we received another mail from the hotel to say a mistake had occurred and the hotel was actually closed on the dates we had booked. We called central Best Western and, as suspected, the hotel was indeed open (why would it be closed on the busiest weekend of the decade?). After several frantic emails to the hotel and to the booking website, the hotel eventually called to say they could offer another hotel outside Paris city centre. Clearly this was not an acceptable alternative to a hotel by the Arc De Triomphe! As this was only 4 days before the rugby final we were unable to book another hotel and had to cancel our Paris plans. We would not recommend this hotel and , in future, will not book another hotel with the Best Western branding.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cPoor breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Chicago01", "ReviewID": "UR10058153", "Content": "We have just spent three days in this hotel and overall it was O.K., however our breakfast experience was very poor. Especially considering that the breakfast is not included and they charge 13.00 Euros for it . One of the mornings we had to wait for 40 minutes because they did not have clean dishes and when they finally got them there was nothing to eat at the buffet. We had to wait for another 20 minutes for them to refill the buffet. We could get much better breakfast outside of this hotel and quicker too! A TripAdvisor Member.

We spent 4 nights at the Saint Ferdinand Hotel and were most impressed on all aspects of this boutique hotel. Location wise the hotel is several minutes from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees. The staff were extremely helpful and advised on eateries and local amenities. The room we stayed in had obviously just been decorated and was done so very tastefully. There are some very nice restaurants near the hotel, especially 'La Relais de Venise'-well worth a visit if you enjoy steak. Overall, a very pleasant hotel in a super location, wouldn't hesitate to return when next in Paris.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Etoile Saint-Ferdinand", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197514-Reviews-Hotel_Etoile_Saint_Ferdinand-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$185 - $335*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">36, rue Saint Ferdinand</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">17th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75017</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515136", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/84/d3/fc/best-western-etoile-saint.jpg"}}
