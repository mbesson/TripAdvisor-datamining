It was nicely decorated, very clean, and the extras were awesome - the ice cream, the smoothies, happy hour, etc. Not paying for parking was great - I've heard that so many Key West hotels charge up to $20 per day. Derek and \"Ken til Ten\" were great, and helpful (and we loved the lemonade that was always available in the office!) Wolfgang was always there to welcome us when we'd come stumbling back from Duval at night, and was so friendly! Plus, so many places close their pools at a certain time - at the Santa Maria they let you use the pool at any time as long as you are quiet and respectful of other guests, which was awesome. It was nice to be able to relax in the pool after long days of Key-West-Craziness! The location was nice. It was a quiet area, but in a very walkable location.

This trip we booked a one bedroom suite (all rooms at the hotel are 2 bedroom, they just locked the second bedroom and powder room and lower the price). We were placed on the first floor which I was worried about due to what a light sleeper I am. However, this hotel is built like a vault. I did not hear anyone above us (just some very faint footsteps) and nothing from our neighbors on either side. Christy at the front was more than receptive to offer our room early which was super nice. Derek was still just as cheerful and helpful as concierge. Staff here, are....well..... not in your face making sure that your every need it attended to, it is quite like most hotels in NYC where they can't do enough to help you when you ask, however, if you just walk by, they let you be. Pros: End of quiet Duval street, which could be a con to some, but we prefer this end of things. FREE PARKING.... Ice cold AC...so refreshing...and it's central, no noisy units. Full kitchen ( bring your vino and snacks....) washer and dryer...there is something to be said for washing your clothes and packing clean clothes to go home with (you know the chore after coming back and thinking to yourself....the last thing I want to do is go back to work on Monday AND do laundry...bills....shopping...). Peaceful and upscale. The place just reeks tranquility....as soon as you walk through the gate, it's like exhaling for the first time. Plenty of pool chairs this visit, and it was booked solid...so not sure if they got more chairs from our last visit, but it was nice to see. Fresh muffins every morning (yes they are blueberry every day....who cares...) dove Ice Cream in the freezer every night...and more chocolate on the bed. Cons: I really have to nit pick here, because for the peace and quiet of this hotel, it is a 5 star in my book. However, I do always find something to improve upon......A full size coffee maker would be nice, and ditch the powder creamer (use the ones in little plastic cups instead). Internet service is totally sketchy and would frequently go out...I imagine it is the solidness of the buildings and the foliage, so this probably isn't a fair Con... however you can ask for a cord at the front desk. The light on our patio at night went on and there wasn't a switch to turn off, again, this may be an unfair Con, it's probably an insurance issue to make sure that no one trips...but it would be great to sit on the patio at night without the light blasting on you. Some of the kitchen utensils were completely unusable. Corkscrew and scissors needed to be replaced.The room could really use a \"magic sponge\" especially on the walls and the floors in the kitchen and bath. Would do a WORLD of difference.

After being dropped off by my taxi, I walked into the cute lobby on the side of Ambrosia, the Japanese restaurant built into the resort, and I was greeted by a smiling face and some helpful advise. My room was not ready, for I arrived a little early, but my luggage was taken from me and was invited to sit by the pool area to wait for my room. Walking out into the pool area, you get to take in the lush tropical plants and the magically laid out pool area. With a small bar area, with complementary fruit smoothies, wine for a happy hour and towels, overlooking two pools, the view was amazing. The hotel that surrounds the pool area is like a small, upscale village. Extremely warm and inviting! After sitting and soaking up the Key West sun, I was informed that my room was ready. I was delighted to find that my bags had been moved to my room for me. How they got in there, right under my nose, I have no clue. On to the suite, what an amazing place. I wish my living room and kitchen was this nice. A nice flat screen tv with two chairs and a dvd player grace the front left side of the living room and a nice sofa with a coffee table across the room are both tastefully decorated to make the Key West lifestyle. The kitchen area is fully stocked with glasses and plates and has a full stove and dish washer. The refrigerator is built into the counter and came with bottles of water and some wonderful Dove Ice Cream bars. Those are so nice on a warm Key West day. Also, there is a wine refrigerator, which came in handy for some bottles of wine I happen to bring back to the room. Everything was clean and ready to go if I wanted to cook. The bedroom was great! Artfully done, if a lovely TV and the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on in a hotel. I slept like a dream after a hard day of enjoying the pool area or walking along the picaresque streets of Key West. An added bonus is the nightly turn down service. Roll into your room and your bed is ready for you and a little sweet Dove chocolates await you on your pillow! How sweet! The bathroom is great, with dual shower heads and the great glass shower doors that are spotless each evening. Dual sinks in an ultra modern feel. I want this bathroom in my house. Every night when entering through the lobby, Wolfgang welcomed us \"home\". The staff gets to know you and makes you feel like you are home.

He even called a local seafood market to see if they had conk salad. Because of the pool and the service of our concierge, we spent the whole day by the pool, relaxing and soaking in the sun! I have never done that at a hotel, but everything was so warm and inviting! It is one block from the beach, so no need to drag your rental car out of the lot and has some fine dining around the block at Louis' Backyard. Santa Maria Suites is a nice place to get away from it all. It is tucked away at the southern part of the island, less touristy, more resort!

Here's why I would highly recommend this place in a nutshell: *Good location for walking everywhere *Great proximity to a trolley stop *Beautiful suites with two bedrooms, two bathrooms *Free ice cream bars each afternoon (left in your freezer) *Free bottled water all day from the pool area *Free smoothies from the pool area *Access to the nearby beach complimentary *Your choice of sunscreens/suntan lotion to use during your stay Now for the recap! We (my husband and I) were traveling with my inlaws. This was the perfect place for us because we each had our own space with private baths and bedrooms, and yet we shared a living area, a large kitchen with all the amenities you could possibly imagine plus kitchenware if you wanted to cook your own meal, and a couple balconies. I should also add that the bathrooms were great with very modern (the whole place is pretty modern really) fixtures and tiled showers with multiple shower heads. Fun! The only downside was we were on the second floor and it was a LOT of stairs up to our room. My MIL had a hard time with the steps--we should have asked for a ground level room. Our fault. The pool area was very secluded feeling from the rest of KW and the added bonus of free bottled water and smoothies was perfect for us and saved us having to buy it elsewhere. It was great to grab a bottle on our way out to walk Duval Street or head to the beach! The beach is nearby and you can use it for free as part of your room amenities. Otherwise it sounded like the kid was charging people $5 to set up their plastic lawn chairs. The beach was just ok, and the water really yucky looking, but we really didn't go to KW to hang at the beach all day. They also offered us our choice from a large basket of various bottles of suntan/block items. They were all opened and had been used, so I could just pick one and bring it back when we were done. I have never seen this at a hotel before and I thought it was cool. Since we had carry-ons only for the flight, we couldn't bring our big bottles from home... The staff at the hotel was international but understanding them wasn't a problem. We probably asked for three different recommendations from them and they were always very willing to help. All of the recommendations but one were spot on. This hotel is located a block over from the very southern end of Duval Street. We walked everywhere without a problem and loved that it seemed 'quieter' on our end of the island. There was also a trolley stop just across the street which was really convenient for my MIL. The Southernmost Beach Cafe was half a block away so we ate there twice (see my review) and loved that too. Overall I would highly recommend this place. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I thought it was a little pricey for early February but that's Key West I suppose. I was glad we were able to split the cost with the inlaws!", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Northern most Key - Mil-wau-key", "Title": "\u201cUpscale accommodations in paradise!\u201d", "Author": "eyw-mke", "ReviewID": "UR123650596", "Content": "Checking in was a breeze.

I have to say that Derek, the bartender at the pool, goes over and above the call of duty to make you feel welcome and comfortable. He was such a pleasure to talk to. He would fill our glasses with delicious wine, and told us to help ourselves to pita chips and dip. The smoothies are wonderful, with or without alcohol. They give you bottled water, which I think is a plus for a stay in Florida. The weather was perfect for the three days we stayed, which was Nov. 8-11. I liked the peacefulness of the place during the week. You can go as mild or wild as you want when you go on the main street filled with restaurants, bars, shops, etc. It's a fun place, and my familly can't wait to come back. Irish Kevin's was a fun bar. Mallory Square was very nice. Backyard Louie's was delicious. We went to two beaches that were walking distance from our hotel. The small beach, about a block away gave us free chairs, and there's a nice cafe there to eat. There's another public beach about 5 blocks away, a lot bigger, but you have to pay for the chairs.

The kitchen cabinets were spotty with greasy fingerprints, the plates were not so clean, and among 'clean' ones were totally unwashed ones. Yikes! So I washed everything by hand before use as the dishwasher was no good. Hotel delivers muffins and small ice creams every night. Although the muffins were wrapped on plastic, as soon as the muffins were delivered, came also the brownish ant-like insects. Not so nice to have insects climbing all over your muffins, so we never ate a single one. The pool area looks nice and has a tropical vibe. Unfortunately water in pools was quite dirty, seemed brownish. Pools would need cleaning far more often. And, be aware that Santa Maria Suites has no services what one would expect of a luxury hotel.

We didn't book the hotel in advance, since we were not expected to end up in Key West. After a quick check on TripAdvisor, we decided to check out SMS. We were welcomed by Ken, and we were sold after 10 seconds: he was so enthusiastic that we had to stay here. He did show us our room before we decided and that closed the deal :-) SMS is a fairly small property, around the corner of Duval Street. The Duval Street action is a 10-15 minute walk: very convenient! The room we had (a 2 bedroom suite, with one bedroom and bathroom closed) was amazing. Very nice bed and bedroom, luxurious bathroom (with a shower for 2 people), a kitchen I wish I have at home (it even had a wine cooler/fridge), and a small terrace. The room/suite was clean and fresh and could have worked as an apartment (which makes sense, since that was the original destination of SMS). The pools were 15 steps away from our door. They are small but nice. And the pool comes with towels, sunblock, smoothies as many as you want, and in the afternoon wine and snacks. It doesn't get a lot better!

We were on the second floor so there was a set of stairs to get to the suuite. Once inside the suite, we discovered that it was on two levels, with the bedroom/bathroom a flight of stairs up from the kitchen/livingroom/powder room - a bit of an inconvenience. The kitchen was very large, beautiful and well-equipped. We enjoyed the mini-Dove bars that were placed in the freezer every evening, as well as the daily muffin delivery and bottled water. The livingroom had a comfortable couch, two chairs and a very large flat screen TV (maybe 52\"). The upper level was not quite as comfortable. The bedroom was rather small, without very much room to maneuver. The bathroom had nice decor, but there was virtually no couner space. Towels were great - large and thick.

First, the property is beautiful and well-maintained. The central pools and gardens make the place lush and inviting, and relaxing music plays at just the right volume, so hanging out by the pool is very relaxing. Our suite came with a well-equipped kitchen with brand new appliances, and had we not enjoyed so many restaurants we would have made better use of it. If you want to vacation on a budget, you could easily cook all your meals in your suite. Housekeeping kept our suite very clean, turned down the bed (with chocolates) and provided muffins for breakfast each day. The hotel is located just a block from Duval Street (the \"main drag,\") but is on the quiet side of the island. If you want to whoop it up, all the bars are within a mile's walk (though I recommend a scooter,) but when the night's over, you can go back to your nice quiet room. In some hotels closer to the action, there's no such thing as quiet. Now about the staff... I have never had so many consistently friendly, knowledgeable, helpful people working to make my vacation so enjoyable. We were greeted by Ken, who gave us the rundown on the hotel and the island, and continued to take care of our needs for the rest of the week, from renting a scooter, to booking restaurant reservations, to getting our cab for our trip home. Derek, the poolside concierge, was my MVP. Being a resident of Key West, he knew the place like the back of his hand and his opinions of various places began to mirror my own, so I trusted his advice implicitly. He booked a great snorkeling trip for us, lent us towels and sunscreen to take to the beach, booked dinners for us, provided us with bottled water and snacks... He treated us like guests in his home. I can't say enough good things about Derek. They are really doing things right at Santa Maria Suites. And did I mention their rates? They're described as a 4 star hotel, but their off-season rates are very reasonable, and certainly better than some less-desirable hotels.

I called and spoke to Ken and he answered all my questions and gave me some recommendations. I ended up booking online and getting the Romance package which saved us some money and got us in the upgraded 2 bedroom suite! When we arrived, we were greeted by Ken. He welcomed us and gave us our room. I confirmed that it was a pool view because that's what all the other reviewers recommended. It was but it was a little off and didn't have a direct view. He told us to check out the suite and come back and tell him what we thought. Meanwhile he was checking to see what was available. The suite was gorgeous but we didn't love the view and the rooms were on the 3rd floor. We told him this and he managed to get us upgraded to Suite 17. IMO, this is the best suite in the hotel. It had a perfect view of the pool, but behind enough foliage to not have everyone in the pool able to see directly into our room. My wife and I spent the first 5 minutes with our jaws wide open! The room was incredible. From the fully stocked (pots/pans/silverware) kitchen, dish washer, washer & dryer and spacious living room...we were already blown away. Our bedroom was beautiful, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the master bath with its twin basin sinks and the twin showers were absolutely amazing! We honestly could have stayed holed up in the room all week but when we decided to head down to the pool, it was another taste of heaven. The pool is beautiful and has a cool fountain that is fun to stand under. Drinks by Derek were a treat. Free waters and smoothies were great and Derek's cocktails were fantastic (and strong!). Yay!

Overall, we were happy with the hotel and enjoyed our stay. I had e-mailed the hotel ahead of time to let them know we would be arriving late at night (driving down from Miami Airport in a rental car). I also requested a suite with a king bed and pool view. We arrived at the hotel at 3am, and were greeted by Wolfgang. He was superb, very friendly, funny and chipper - especially seeing as it was 3am. To my pleasant surprise, our requests had been granted and we were assigned to Suite #6. Wolfie was a super nice guy, and actually made our experience at the hotel even better than it otherwise would have been. He also recommended a nice restaurant for dinner, and told us about the free amenities that the hotel offers included with the $15 per day resort fee. Our suite was very pleasant overall and nicely furnished, although there are a few things that could be improved - such as loose faucets in the shower, a small stain on the bedding, a scratched up kitchen cabinet (where the trash was stored), a dirty bathroom, and lack of towels for half a day. Also, our internet access was very spotty in Unit 6. This can easily be addressed by adding more wireless routers. Finally, I had to use a hardwire connection, but even that failed after a day. The staff didn't seem to know much about the internet service and offered to call a technician the following day, but we were already checking out. Internet Access is critical for me when traveling, so I think this should be addressed and tested in every unit ASAP. The pools were nice, but a couple of the paving slabs are loose around the pool too. This should be addressed also. Note, these were very minor gripes and overall I liked the hotel and would go back. Pros and cons were as follows: PROS: - Good location - Modern and clean - Friendly staff - Many perks included with the resort fee CONS: - Some minor items need attention - Expensive over Labor Day (but where isn't!)", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hoover, AL", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!\u201d", "Author": "KellyQuick", "ReviewID": "UR117799668", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay at the Santa Maria.

There's a great casual beach bar here for lunch, and complimentary Popsicles and frozen strawberries passed around by the beach attendant in the afternoon. (One caveat: the ocean isn't great for swimming here, but I don't think it's much better at the public beaches.)

Santa Maria is also walking distance to quiet side of Duvall Street, though I suggest taking a taxi to get to Sunset Pier and any of the bars - this was actually a plus for us, as my husband and I were traveling with his parents and not really interested in the crazy, late-night scene.

I traveled with my parents and family and we chose to cancel our reservation at the Mariott after reading TripAdvisor reviews. Here is a thorough review of our entire stay: Upon check in, we were greeted by Ken who checked us in. We helped ourselves to lemonade in the main office and had a seamless check in. We had booked the cheaper room rate online with the 'garden view' and smaller beds. I suppose we had a garden view although most of it consisted of the parking lot and street. The hotel says that they are queen size beds and I still cant decide if they are. I agree with other reviewers that the room sizes were very small - think european small, but nevertheless everything was immaculately clean. There was a wine fridge, large fridge, oven, microwave, 2 cup coffee maker (only 2 cup coffee maker for a 2 bedroom suite?), toaster, blender, dishwasher, the works. Every appliance was top of the line and immaculately clean. My parents, who were disappointed with the size of the beds, that the suite was on level 2 and 3 with stair access only, the fact they didn't have a jacuzzi, and without an ocean or pool view (mind you, they didn't remember that they knew there was no ocean view during the placement of the reservation) initially requested to change to a different suite and Ken was gracious and accomodating. He had much more patience with them than I did! In the end, we elected to stay where we had been assigned originally and it worked out just fine. The beds were comfy and clean although we each had a backache the next day when we woke up. They charged us an extra $25 a day for having an additonal guest come and stay for a few days with us, which is fine, but it would have been nice for him to get his own towels and not have had to use pool towels. The pool was very clean and Derek was fantastic. Derek is there M-F from 10-530ish and he makes excellent drinks and can arrange for anything you want. He recommended Salute's on the beach and the food there was so amazing we went back several times. In addition to making amazing drinks and continuing to pour the complimenary Woodbridge Mondavi wine between 4-530, he made our reservations at the hotel's restaurant Ambrioso. The sushi was above average, service was ok. Towels were always left out after Derek left for those who wanted to stay out later or to take a midnight dip! Smoothies are complimentary, and all other drinks are reasonably priced (bottles of cold water for free). There is a very limited selection of alcohol. They offer fresh fruit (apples, oranges) and several bottles of sunscreen to all guests. There are always chairs available until happy hour, when it starts to fill up. When Derek isn't there; however, Summer takes over (Sat/Sun). Next to Derek, it looks like she offers no service. It's not that she was bad, she was just ok. She had an attitude with my father when he tried to make small talk as she made her drink and spent alot of her time on her phone. On one of the days she was working, they ran out of pool towels. I'm not sure whose responsibility it was to replace them but it happened regardless. We did get muffins (banana or blueberry) which were very good but we couldn't eat anymore after about day 3, dove chocolates during the turndown service and dove ice cream chocolate bars. They offered dish detergent, laundry deteregent, sponges, paper towels in addition but they are not free as everyone has described. They are included in a $15 per day amenitiy fee that I do not believe you can opt of out. I was a little annoyed to see that at check out. Why not just add it to the room rate? The hotel is near Duval but it is a long walk esp in the August heat. We rented scooters from Summer to get around and we had a blast on them. We did wish we had rented them through Derek. Derek rented one to a friend of ours a few days earlier. His suggestion was cheaper and they delivered the scooter to the hotel. They also have beach access with your room key a block or two down but we never went since we enjoyed Derek's drinks by the pool too much ;) Summer checked us out and we were missing half of our bill; although she graciously offered to hold our luggage and encouraged the use of the hotel's faciilities until our flight which was much later in the day. All in all, we had a great vacation. I wouldn't mind coming back, but my parents have said that they will see what the Mariott is like next time.

We were invited to park our car in the hotel lot and prompted to enjoy the amenities of the resort while waiting for our suite. At the pool we met Derek, the concierge.

Ken wanted to make sure we had the best suite available for us. At the Santa Maria Suites it's all about YOU! We were shown two suites by the manager, Steve Mungalle. When the first suite was not quite where we wanted to be, he walked us to the perfect suite. We have never been to a hotel or resort where the manager takes the time to walk you around and ensure your satisfaction. Again, awesome customer service! Our suite was fabulous!

We could not have made a better choice. My wife and I stayed in a two bedroom suite with my parents. While we were initially worried about spending a romantic week long vacation sharing a room our fears faded immediately upon seeing the suite. The bedrooms are on opposite sides of the suite and offer total privacy. The king size bed was very comfortable and the large, dual rain head shower was delightful. The shower in the second bedroom was a standard stand alone shower with a rainhead. There were large flat screen tvs in each bedroom and the living room. The kitchen was large, beautiful, and fully stocked with pots, pans, etc... The living room offered stools for the breakfast bar, a love seat, and 2 chairs to view the tv (equipped with a dvd player). Located on the premises is the sushi restaurant Ambrosia. Ambrosia is a 5 star Japanese restaurant that offered the best sushi I have ever eaten. Simply amazing. The resort has two smallish saltwater pools separated by a walkway. The pools were clean and inviting each day. The deepest part of each pool is only four feet. Smoothies are served all day, for free, by the pool and were a tasty treat. At the pool bar was the concierge Derrick. Derrick did everything for us from suggesting amazing restaurants and attractions that shouldn't be missed to making reservations, and getting us taxis. He booked an amazing sunset cruise and our snorkeling adventure. His amazing knowledge of the island and work ethic really made our vacation that much better! The resort is located on the quiet side of the island a block away from all the noise, nestled near the ocean. While the resort has no beach of its own they have an agreement with the hotel next door to use their beach, a 4 minute walk away. Derrick said we just needed to show our room keys and free use of the beach and lounge chairs were ours. Derrick was correct. The people at the beach were very kind and quickly arranged two chairs for our use. The parking lot at the resort is very tight. We made the mistake of flying in to Fort Lauderdale and driving down to Key West. I would strongly recommend against this instead flying directly into Key West. I would also recommend against renting a car unless you plan to explore the other keys. On Key West parking is so limited and expensive that walking or employing a cab made more sense. We did not use our rental car once after our arrival. The only slight negative I have to offer is the housekeeping should have been better.

The shower water pressure in the way too small shower stall was non existent... even by normal key west standards. After attempting to make ourselves comfortable, we realized we would not be able to. Therefore we requested to check out after the first night but they refused to refund our money. However, as an accomodation, they did move us to a 2 bedroom suite and just locked off the second bedroom. That guestroom was on the first floor overlooking the pool. The bedroom was a better size and the bathroom was more comfortable but my back was aching after two nights of sleeping on the uncomfortable mattress. The Santa Maria does attempt to make up for their short comings of the rooms by offering you free drinks at the pool, free water and ice cream treats in the room and free muffins for breakfast in the morning. The intention of a well appointed hotel is there.

I wish that I had this kitchen in my home. I was totally wowed by the master bathroom with the dual showerheads. My husband, who joined us for this trip, also liked the bathroom quite a bit. This place was perfect for our needs. We caught the trolley just outside of the hotel and did our best souvenir shopping at the the shop across the street. The hotel pools were fantastic and we enjoyed the happy hour wines and the steel drum player. The complimentary muffins were great the first day, but did get a little old by day three. The sushi restaurant adjacent to the hotel was handy for some appetizers to go. We really enjoyed our time at Key West because of this hotel.

They have an agreement with another hotel a block away to use that hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beach, but, in truth, you can just walk from Santa Maria Suites right onto the Reach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property and go to that beach. This resort is about 2 blocks from the marker for the Southernmost Point, putting it on the opposite end of Duval St from Mallory Square. This is the quieter end of town \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lots to do but quieter at night. Last time we were in Key West, we stayed at the Pier House (on Mallory Square) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very nice but far from intimate due to the crowds. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not familiar with Key West and Duval St, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 1 \u00c2\u00bd miles from one end of Duval to the other, a very easy walk filled with literally hundreds of restaurants and shops along the way. The rooms all encircle 2 pools, making the resort very private. I must specifically mention Derek, who was the combination concierge / pool attendant. He helped us with suggestions for activities (we rented motor scooters as well as took a jet ski tour of the island), restaurants and sites to see. He also provided us with the complimentary smoothies and fresh fruit (all day) and complimentary drinks and snacks (happy hour). We met folks staying at Santa Maria Suites from all over the world. The focal point of the resort is the pool, and we got to know many of them while lounging by the pool or wading in it. The price is great. For all of the amenities described, it ran us about $350 / day (total \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not per couple), far less than 2 rooms at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel, with value worth far more. There is no question that, upon our return to Key West in the future, we will stay here again.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious 2 bedroom for same price as 2 mediocre rooms\u201d", "Author": "Daugman", "ReviewID": "UR68645127", "Content": "We are originally from Miami, and know the Keys. 2 parents, our kid, plus mother in law wanted to visit Key West.

Derek at the pool kept the smoothies coming and kept our wine glasses filled. We booked a one bedroom but were upgraded to a two bedroom with two and a half baths. I think I would have preferred the one bedroom because it had a queen bed and we had two doubles. But,no problem. Someone complained about the stairs. Yes, thre are about 14 steps to get into the unit and then when inside another pair of steps going up to the bedrooms but since we live in a house with stairs it was no problem for us. Staff, from the front desk, to the cleaning crew to the maintenance man who showed my husband how to use the stove (we have gas and they have electric).. Location was great. We are a couple in our early 7-0's and had no problem walking from our hotel to the other end of Duval several times during the week. We did take a cab twice to go to dinner. One of the things we really enjoyed was e-mailing our grocery list to the hotel and then having the groceries in the room when we arrived. We flew to Key West and did not have a car so this was a big help. My husband likes to cook breakfast and we also kept the makings for our gin and tonices in the kitchen as well as cheese and crackers. The grounds are very beautiful and the pools were beautiful and there were plenty of chairs for everyone. The only thing I could complain about was the fact that while the unit was set up for 4 people we only had 3 chairs at the counter in the kitchen. When we travel with anyone else we also like to play cards in the evenng and there was no table. There is room for one in one corner of the living room. But since it was just the two of us there was plenty of room. We did some of the touristy things and then rented an electric car (I don't ride bikes) for a day and drove all over the island. Dinner suggestions from Ken included Camilles, a cute little restaurant within walking distance of the hotel with good food, reasonally priced and Ken gave us a coupon for a free bottle of wine. Ken suggested Louie's Backyard which we were not going to go to because of the bad reviews but he said we would like it and made us dinner reservations and we had an enjoyable time eating outside on the deck over the water.

Also, the mattress and pillows were pretty low quality. If they replaced those I would give the place an 8 or 9 total (out of 10).

We selected Santa Maria for its location, a conversation with the hotel and based on the amenities we were looking for. What a disappointment!! We were going to arrive late, so we not only confirmed our reservation, we kept the desk night manager informed of our progress during our drive so that we could ensure someone will be there to check us in. The check-in process was adequate and OK. Not particularly at par with what you would expect at a member hotel of Small Luxury Hotel collection of places around the world. In fact inexpensive hotel chains do a better and a more friendly job. We had already been charged one night's deposit on my partner's credit card. At check-in, I specifically mentioned that the rest of the charges were to be settled on my card, which I presented, and an imprint was taken. No mention was made of the fact that the unit we were assigned had a completely non-functioning, broken dishwasher, which we had to discover when went to use it, and in the process we discovered that it was filthy and dirty in addition to completely inoperable. Additionally, there was odious odor and there were small insects crawling on the kitchen counter. There was no one to call as they leave for the night (!) with an ability to leave a voice mail! We were hoping they would move us to another unit so we did not have to pack/unpack the next day or fix the dishwasher. We left a message. The next morning, I called them. A very rude and a curt young lady answered and when I asked if they had gotten my message, she apparently had no clue about what I was talking about. She lectured me that they have someone investigating and that it was still early in the morning for them to have gotten back to us. This is not true since I was calling around 8 30 AM and they claim to have someone come in the morning at 6 AM. I inquired what it is that they were investigating because someone obviously should have known that the dishwasher was not working, if their housekeeping staff had cleaned the unit before we arrived. There were curt answers, and a vague comment about if we have another room we will get back to you, and that, if not, just leave the dishes dirty, and the cleaning staff will clean it the NEXT day!! There are not enough dishes, utensils or other cutlery for even two people to have more than two meals a day without cleaning the dishes!! I insisted that the desk person tell me whether they already knew ahead of our checking in that the dishwasher was broken. She would not answer and told me if I had any more problems, I could talk to the general manager. I said I want to be connected. The gentleman was initially not very sympathetic but as the conversation progressed, he volunteered that there is no chance of fixing the dishwater during our stay as it was waiting for a part that had been ordered!! At the time of the check-in, this was not mentioned, when I called next morning, the woman at the desk, brusquely told me they were investigating, and yet, through irritated persistence, I finally discover they knew all along that the dishwasher had not functioned for at least some time! The matter of insects crawling and filthy dishwasher (it not working is one thing, it being filthy takes some work!) were not addressed but I was told they will move our refrigerated food, and our personal belongings to another unit at some point in the day. Imagine! Someone moving your food! We moved most of our stuff ourselves although a gentleman was there to help us if we needed it! Some luxury hotel!! They also offered half of one day's worth of credit. We had wasted a lot of time already and wanted to get on with our stay so I simply accepted the situation. To add insult to injury, they charged me and my partner separately on two different credit cards, for two units: the one we were in the first night, and also for the second unit to which we were moved on day 2! No receipt, and this despite my specific request to charge only one card and only one room. I was told that is exactly what would happen. We only discovered that we had been overcharged almost $732 dollars extra because my partner and I are diligent about checking our credit card charges before even the regular bill arrives! She was hesitant even to bring it up to me but thought the better of it to make sure that we were both not charged, since I had told her that I had settled thebill at checkout with my credit card. How embarrassing that she had to ask me if I was charged too! This was a Valentine's day celebration!! I called last night, with my partner and I on the phone together. They do not have access to billing data and would I please call in the morning when the people who handle the accounting are available to fix this small 'faux pas!' I let the gentleman know in no uncertain terms that I expect him to take care of it, I am not going to keep calling them and in these economic times or in any other times, to politely but infuriatingly to say to a customer that $732 erroneous double charge is a small faux pas really takes the cake. We are waiting for them to correct the error, and as of 9 30 AM, no calls, no e mails yet! There are other properties in Key West we would rather have been, paid a lot less, and accepted lesser amenities than to stay at a Small Luxury Hotel collection member, waste our time getting people to own up to known defects in the promised amenities, and be double charged, and now have to waste more time waiting for them to reverse the erroneous charges. I not only do not recommend this property, I suggest you avoid it entirely. A very disappointing experience, and gestures such as half of one day's rental and a fruit basket do not adequately give us our wasted time back! I would rather have paid full price as we were intending to all along and the establishment be forthright, efficient and diligent in matters of service and accounting process.

The beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Our quibbles with the place are minor, but are worth mentioning as they may help my fellow Tripadvisees. First, for a two bedroom suite with Sub-Zero applicances, more than a four-pot coffee maker should be standard. We made like four pots of coffee a morning! The manager tells me that they will soon have 10-pot makers on request, so ask if you want one (but I still think they should be standard in a hotel of this quality). Oh, and if you like coffee, buy some at the grocery, the in-room Maxwell House stuff is terrible. Second, while the beds are heaven, the furnishings in the living room are dreadfully uncomfortable. This, too, should be changing soon, according to the manager. Third, rainfall shower heads. I hate rainfall shower heads (gimme a good blast from standard head any day). Stylish, yes, practical, no. Finally, as it is a new place built with condos in mind, it has no Key West soul. It is all modern beige and black, and I totally realize that some people love that, but we like a little more of a vibe in our KW housing. But, KW vibe usually means bright and a little rundown, and this place is pristine, so there is your trade off. Oh, and it is in with a lot of other resort properties, so there isn't much of that great residential feel a lot of the island has, but it is totally convenient to all of that. And it is really close to the Southernmost Beach area, which you have access to with your card from SMS. That was really nice.

The hotel has a beautiful courtyard with pool and pool concierge where we enjoyed relaxing - the concierge provides towels, water, smoothies, friendly travel/restaurant advice, etc. I felt like Lindsey and Derek were old friends by the time we left. The front desk also assisted in making dinner reservations and booked us on a catamaran trip. The suite we stayed in (33) was essentially a very narrow town house. Downstairs was a narrow living room with huge flat screen TV, a half bathroom, stack laundry, and a kitchen with big counter and bar stools. Upstairs were two bedrooms, each with its own full bathroom. Other noteworthy amenities included free parking (rare in Key West since real estate is at a premium), and a small exercise room. Everything was newly renovated and top of the line. We could not have been more comfortable here, were sad to have to leave, and definitely will return. Some \"constructive criticism\" I'd like to pass to the hotel, since I believe as wonderful as any place is, there's always room for improvement: 1) Since everything at Santa Maria Suites is first class, please consider replacing the Maxwell House coffee you put in the kitchens. It is awful. (On the positive side, since the coffee provided was so bad, it motivated me to go across the street to the little Cuban take out for their most excellent Cafe con Leche.) 2) Please consider putting bathrobes in your suites, as many luxury hotels do. 3) Is there anyway to spray for or control the mosquitos in the courtyard?

I do have to extend a BIG thanks to the hotel manager, because even though it was only 12 of us staying between both suites, we attracted many other friends to our hotel, and he never gave us a hard time about it - instead, he was very attentive and involved, but without it feeling intruding!

The mini icecreams in the fridge and chocolates on the bed were also a nice touch. The best meal we had in Key West (and in fact during our whole 30 day US holiday) was at the Brazillian churrascaria restaurant (can't remember the name), just off Duval Street. It is a must for all travellers. The most amazing meat, salads, and service! I have since been trying to find a similar restaurant in Australia since returning home! Duval Street is a great area to wander down with lots of lovely boutiquey shops and interesting cafes. My 2 daughters had their hair braided with the lovely English lady who has the braid shop there....so nice! She did a fantastic job. Our only negative about our whole Key West experience was the man on Duval Street who has the snakes, parrots and iguana that you can hold and have your photo taken with....NOT NICE! We went up to him, with my 9 & 8 year old daughters very excited, to ask about having a photo taken with the creatures. He said it was $20 per child (which we found to be quite excessive) and before we could turn and leave he had sat the girls down and put the snake around them...of course putting us on the spot! One daughter asked if she could pat the bird and in the blink of an eye he wisked off the snake and put a couple of the birds on them and then turned to us and said, not to worry, it would only be $30 for it all! They were not sitting there for any longer than 45 seconds in all...I only had time to take 2 snap shots and then the animals were off them and he had his hand out! This really annoyed us as we didn't agree to his price but he then put us on the spot demanding his $30 which of course we had to pay! Watch out for this man as he is a TOTAL RIP-OFF and left a bad taste in our mouth. The rest of the Key West traders did their absolute best to encourage tourists and make them feel welcome but this man was doing his best to destroy their good work! Someone needs to have a chat to him....and whilst you're at it....we'd love our money back...or at least $25 of the $30 we paid!

There are beaches very close--one within like a block that also has a restaurant and Higgs beach isn't too far to walk either. It is caddy cornered to a market where you can drink out of a coconut and also a moped rental place. You HAVE to rent a moped while you are there. I swear it's the way to go. I drove all over that place and definitely decided Santa Maria was the best place. We were so lucky because when we picked it, we had no idea how great the location, service and suites were. Another definite MUST is to eat at the Conch Republic and the Cuban restaurant called Pepe's by Mallory Square. By the way-Mallory Square has great artists and entertainers. Blue Heaven restaurant was great for breakfast or lunch. Fogarty's on Duvall was great too. And you have to go to the Hemingway House, of course!

One really nice \"extra\" that the hotel provided (they were available at the juice bar outside) was a coupon for a free bottle of wine at Camile's--a really delicious seafood restaurant nearby. We were happy to take advantage of that and had a really great dinner there. Another nice thing about the hotel is the full kitchen. While we didn't really cook, we did make a run to Fausto's and got some cheese, crackers, fruit and other goodies for lunches and snacks. So between that and the muffins and snacks provided by the hotel, we only ate out one meal per day, which was great for saving money. The wine chiller was a really nice touch, too!

My expectations were exceeded. Let me start with the few flaws. Since you are a block away from the ocean, there are no ocean view rooms. The fitness room consists of a treadmill and some weights. Finally, if you are looking to be near the \"action\" side of Duval Street...well, the Santa Maria is on the opposite end. Personally, I was happy about that, but just know that before booking. Now, with that being said, there was so much that you will love, that the few minor points I just brought up won't matter. What sets this place apart is the unbelievable customer service. From the very beginning when I booked and spoke to Wolfgang, I knew this was a great place. He was so patient and helpful, and even gave me a poolview room at the same price as the garden view. When we arrived, Lindsay greeted us, and made us feel right at home. We had a problem with our room (the fridge didn't work), so we had to be moved the next day. Tatiana took care of moving all of our stuff, including the food. The room itself is huge and beautiiful. Granite surface, modern European appliances, and bathroom fixtures. There are two huge bedrooms and baths, with the most comfortable beds. The place has not one, but three huge flatscreen TVs. The room opens to the most beautifully landscaped pool. The pool itself is small, but it is very pretty and relaxing. The complimentary smoothies and nightly wine and cheese, is a great touch. Finally, the maid service is outstanding. This was the cleanest place I have ever stayed in. How could it be Florida, and I didn't see a single bug, not even a gnat, the entire week I was there. Finally, a word about Key West. My second time there. Simply, the best place in Florida. There is something for everyone. Casual, fun, laid back, great resturants, great music, beautiful beaches.

We too had issues a couple of days with late and very rushed housekeeping. The staff seemed to be was overwhelmed cleaning up after the spring breakers had left.We solved that problem by informing the front desk know when we left for the day and asked them to clean our rooms. We, too, called about the towel shortages. Apparantly their supplier did not make a complete delivery for a couple of days so everyone had fewer towels . We were in a deluxe first floor pool view suite. We enjoyed sitting on our terrace every afternoon. Once inside our suite we could hear very little from outside. Our bedrooms faced South Street, but the car noise did not bother us. We had wonderful weather so we sat by the Santa Maria pool a couple of days but the water was too warm for me . We spent most of our time at the Casa Marina ,with it's 2 big pools and huge beach area with lots of chairs. Steve and Scott were wonderful about setting up our chairs everyday. To be able to use the Casa Marina is a great benefit of staying at the Santa Maria. It is about a five minute walk to the Casa Marina. ( No need to take any towels, the Casa Marina provides them) We walked everywhere except to the major grocery stores. There is a quick market that has some supplies and sandwiches a cross the street. We found lots of restaurants to be within a 10 minute walk. Lots of restaurants in historic Key West are expensive, but are excellent. We loved Ambrosia, the sushi restaurant at the Santa Maria Suites.The servings are huge. Louie's Backyard is around the corner, which has wonderful out door seating. There is an Italian restaurant and Camille's, a seafood restaurant, less than a 5 minute walk. To walk to the other end of Duval is about a 20-30 minute stroll. Lots to look at!

We arrived on Friday the 13th and walked into EXACTLY what the previous reviewer describes- spring break gone wild. There were dozens of beer cans, empty plastic cups, tequila bottles and drunken, cursing frat boys littering the pool. We walked through the gorgeous pool area upon arrival and, after months of anticipation, were devastated to see that the hotel seemed to be catering to spring breakers. We considered leaving and were going to move to the Marquesa, but they have a no children policy and our 9 year old was with us. We promptly complained and the front desk agent seemed completely unable to help us. We mentioned posting pictures of the pool area on TripAdvisor and the agent immediately went out and started collecting the garbage. He called the manager, who did contact us the next day. By that time, the problem was solved, so we did not need to follow up- but it was good to know we could have. The previously mentioned paper of rules was also presented to us on check in- listing many rules-almost all of which were being broken! And we, mature adults with a child in tow, were asked to sign this agreement! After complaining, we were on our way back to our room, and one of the girls in the party of young people said...don't worry, you won't have to listen to us much longer, we all leave tomorrow. We were SO relieved...and don't understand why the front desk couldn't have set us at ease by mentioning that? The front desk agent told me the next day that 20 of the hotels 32 rooms checked out, and they were mostly the same group. 20 rooms, 4 to 6 people per room....you can imagine how many spring breakers there were!!!! It did seem like the hotel had been completely overwhelmed and they were trying to accommodate everyone as best as possible. Once the big group left, the hotel was peaceful and serene and very family oriented- like we expected. The only other so-so thing was housekeeping. Our unit seemed to be the last to be cleaned everyday. We would be out from morning till late afternoon, which always seemed like the time they wanted to clean the room (like, after 4). It was frustrating to be out all day and as soon as we wanted to come back to the room the cleaners arrived. Also, towels were not replaced daily, and we ran out a few times. Room was SPOTLESS on arrival. On to the good parts..the room is absolutely, terrifically gorgeous. The service, even on the first day, was kind and as helpful as they could be, given the circumstances- especially Ken. Every subsequent exchange was helpful and professional, and they really tried to go above and beyond. Location was good, a bit away from the action, which was good for us as we were wanting a relaxing holiday. Not too many restaurants nearby. Cuban takeout window across the street was good. Grounds are so beautiful and tropical, balconies great. We went on and on about the room...the space, the bathrooms (stunning- double shower in the master bath), the well-equipped kitchen- to everyone in Key West. The pool is as warm as bathwater and the free smoothies are awesome- our daughter must have had 5 a day! The pool concierge was a lovely service, and they were both very nice. The complimentary muffins (delicious) and dove ice cream bars were great...we looked forward to them everyday. Free high speed internet, free parking were appreciated. We are still talking about the bed- most comfortable bed in a hotel room EVER. Once the initial kinks were worked out, our stay was perfect. We're sorry it began the way it did.

I want to make this clear, we had little issue with the hotel itself. The rooms were clean and nice, the pool area was pretty decent, when it wasn't over-run with Spring Breakers. That was my first complaint, for what we paid AND when I had asked months before because I knew we were coming in during Spring Break, the girl over the phone told me explicitly that they wouldn't be a place Spring Breakers would stay and it shouldn't be an issue. What a crock! It looked like MTV was outside our room the whole time. We couldn't use the pool at all because of all the kids. I don't even think half of them were staying there. And anytime we'd go to say something to a staff member, they were too busy to talk to us. It got really frustrating. When I did get to talk to a staff member, they were either really short with me or just flat out rude. I asked for a scooter rental and about a sunset sail, and the girl at the front desk called to the back office and asked \"Who pays the most commission?\" Obviously not even caring about the quality of the trip or vehicle, but how she could make the most off of us. Needless to say, I was so appalled that we booked with one of the street vendors. I was very disappointed with our stay, and to top it all off, when I was woken up several times through the night, when I finally asked the kids to be quiet at the pool, since it was well past midnight, I got told \"The Manager said we could party!\" While I doubt this claim, I went to talk to the manager about it before we left, I was told \"She was too busy to talk to us.\" Not caring we were leaving.

This hotel was everything and more than advertised. The suite we had was 2 floors (#21). Kitchen, living room, 1/2 bath and washer dryer on first floor. Two bedrooms with queen beds ( be careful not to bump your shins on the platform bed frame) and full bathrooms on second floor. We arrived late, yet the staff was waiting and happy to get us settled (Ken even walked us to our room and showed us around)! The room was probably the cleanest I have ever encountered. Every need was anticipated by the staff as the suite was fully equipped. They provide you with laundry detergent, every pot and pan you can imagine, and all of the kitchen tools to fix and serve an entire meal. Most every room looks out over the pools and gardens, which are beautifully maintained. Our room had 3 patios so the doors were often left open late into the night for the warm tropical breezes. The furnishings are VERY contemporary, which thrilled my 16 year old daughter to no end. Both bedrooms were almost identical, so if traveling with 2 couples there wouldn't be that \"who gets the better room\" issue. The granite, Jenn Air and Cuisinart kitchen was fun to work in, and easy to maintain (dishwasher, wine cooler, perfect organization of dishes, glasses, etc by the staff). Closets are large and will easily handle all of your clothing and luggage (we traveled with our 2 teenage daughters who bring SO much, yet had plenty of storage space). My only complaint, and believe me this one is minor, is that the room was perfectly stocked on arrival.....plenty of towels (unlike any other hotel in this world) , Key lime cookies, bottled water, coffee, tea, and dove ice cream bars in the kitchen, and those wonderful Bath and Body Works ammenties in the bathroom. The restocking of these items was not consistant. We had to leave a note to ask for more tea bags, and had to call for towels (the used ones were removed, but no new ones were delieverd). Hand towels were removed from the kitchen and 1st floor bathroom, yet none were brought back. Those great key lime cookies were never seen again after the first night, nor was the bottled water replenished. The Bath and BodyWorks products (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc) were replaced some nights, but not all....one night leaving my daughters without any shampoo. I know these are minor complaints and they were quickly fixed when a call was made to the front desk. I guess this is a complaint I have the world over. Hotels seem to woo you the first night with totally stocked units, yet on following nights, the service seems to slack a bit. We are paying the same price every single night, is it too much to ask that the room is maintained the same way each niight? Don't get me wrong, this hotel is a treasure and the staff is top notch. After reading the great reviews, I was a bit nervous that the real thing wouldn't measure up, but it was really amazing. Words can't describe the feeling of being totally pampered and relaxed that you will have while here. Be sure to take the quick bike ride or walk over to Casa Marina Hotel. Santa Maria has beach use rights there and it is WONDERFUL. The staff there treated us as if we were staying there, even though they knew we were guests at Santa Maria. The ocean front beach, pools, staff and landscaping made a wonderful spot to relax a few hours every afternoon. Lunch pool side was delicious.

There was 15 in our group (4 rooms). We had a 2nd/3rd floor 2 bedroom condo. The rooms were very nice (modern decor) and well maintained. The front staff was very helpful providing advice on things to do and places to eat (and directions/reservations). We ate most breakfasts in (and 1 dinner) so having a well equipped kitchen with top of the line appliances was appreciated. Every night the staff gives you muffins and mini dove ice cream bars which was an added bonus. By the pool, there were complimentary smoothies (booze optional and free). We have 2 teen age boys (19 and 16). The second bedroom with 1 king size bed was an inconvenience. However, the boys rotated sleeping on the living room couch and they didn't mind. Our living room and bed room balcony overlooked the pool so we got nice warm breezes from across the courtyard. My sister had a side room so her balcony faced the side of our complex and the parking lot (be sure to ask for a pool view). The hotel location is at the south end of Duval Street so you are away from the hustle and bustle but still close enough to the action (1.5 miles from Mallory square for the sunset ritual). The sister hotel is the Casa Marina and is about 3-4 blocks away located on the beach. You can use all of their facilities (health club, pool and beach). All-in-all a wonderful place to stay -- we will definitely stay there again!!", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cStay Here!!\u201d", "Author": "LyleK", "ReviewID": "UR23225231", "Content": "This is THE place for a family or 2 couples traveling together to stay in Key West.

We have a family of four so needed two rooms. Unfortunately the rooms have king beds. Not good when you have two teenage boys not wanting to share the same bed. They put an air mattress on the floor in the living room but it was cumbersome. Overall the resort is very nice. If you absolutely need a full kitchen and washer/dryer then this is the place for you! If you are like me and want cool ocean breezes coming in the window at night and don't want to cook while on vacation...then don't stay here! Our room was stuffy at night (had to use the a/c everynight) with parked cars outside our window. Positive side: free drinks and snacks all day by the pool!!

The pictures and descriptions on the web site hardly did it justice. Room and staff were wonderful. Only complaint being that one day our room did not get cleaned.
