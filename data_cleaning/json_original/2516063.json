Cons: -Clueless front desk staff, so unhelpful, didn't know anything about public transportation or nearby services. Also, just interacted weirdly: \"You can look it up online but I know for a fact there's nothing available.\" Why would I look something up online that you know for a fact won't be helpful?

I completely would've gone before they closed, had I known! -Paid internet in the room (not even wireless), $11.95 for 24 hours. Of course I just went for the free wifi in the lobby.

Taxis are essential, and most of the drivers yell at you for using cards even though there's nothing nearby.

A few days prior to arrival I called and inquired about a refrigerator in room and a very helpful gentlemen asked if we would like them to bring one in for us since they are not standard. Of course I said. We arrived check-in was very easy, very friendly staff, the lobby was buzzing with energy it was nice. They gave us warm cookies, who doesn't love that?? We eagerly went to check out our room, noticed a plate on the floor outside our door. Our room was ok. The white linen cover on the bed had a dirty hue to it, you could tell its older. The chair in the corner was dirty and needed to be reahpolstered and the bathroom door was a pocket door that had big stains all over the bathroom side. It just needs some TLC in the form of updating. The plate stayed in the hall all night. We did not have a refrigerator in room, I asked the front desk and was then told it would be $10 a day additional. No thanks. Breakfast time. It's nice to stay where you have options so you can grab and go. The breakfast staff was on it, super helpful. They were out of wheat bread and went and got it for me, they refilled our juice glasses. Very friendly. The downfall the price. One morning my husband only felt like eating fruit, and a couple hash-browns ( that tasted like freezer burn) and a cup of juice all for $16???!!! I only felt like a bagel ($4) that wasn't fresh and juice ($3). Bottom line, if your not going to eat 2 platefuls go out. I did see they rotate the food options and that is nice.

I have noticed that at a certain point in hotel costs, you start getting less and less for the dollars you spend. Like the $350 hotel room I once paid for, only to find out that it cast $25 a night to park. The Double Tree San Pedro has free parking. For the dollar, I would expect free internet and some sort of breakfast as well. The hotel uses it's perfect location to justify the cost, and it just might actually justify it. After spending an extended stay at this hotel, the location and it's staff are it's greatest assets. However I still struggled with the value, knowing that the main customer using this hotel will only stay one or two nights as they come and go from a cruise. Does the fact you can park your car here for a week at no charge justify the one night charge? Maybe it does. You are paying for car storage, security, and a night stay at a very nice hotel within walking distance to a lot of cool stuff. The hotel is very clean, despite the enormous turnover of guest that I saw while there. The assistance I saw the staff give was way above par. The van drivers even gave a family a ride to Target and back when they discovered they arrived without swimsuits. They took a few other couples to local restaurants as well. My room, 204 (I think) looked over the Marina and had a balcony. It had a great view of the the oldest Yacht Club in America. I also could connect to the wireless internet offered in the lobby...even though the package I paid for came with wired internet in the room. As I was staying for an extended time, I had a large cooler in the room for food storage. I found out later that I could have rented a small refrigerator. I figure if someone was paying for that many nights, the frig might come complimentary, but I didn't ask. I left for one weekend (while keeping the room) and put the cooler in the bathtub in case it leaked. When I came back, the water had been drained, and someone had kept it full of ice. I figured they tried to move it to clean the shower and found it full, so filled it with ice. That was a nice touch. If you are looking for a place to have a conference, this place is great. They supplies mine with incredible snacks that caused me to gain about 10 pounds the first week. I had to start using the well equipped gym, pool and hot tub to fight the bulge. The conference rooms are wired for sound (not sure if it is all of them or not) and the staff was awesome to work with. All in all, I think the hotel is great. You just have to ask yourself if the price is worth the security of parking your car here for a week or more for free, the location, and the very attentive staff.

You are paying for location. It is very close to the Port of Los Angeles, so if you are going on a Disney or Carnival Cruise you are literally minutes away. The location next to marina is nice for walking and the views, but the amenities are lacking for the price of the rooms. For example, there is no fridge in the room (you can rent one for an extra cost), no free breakfast, no included internet access. There is internet access in the rooms...if you pay for it, and if you have a cable to access it. There is no wi-fi in the rooms at all. There is wi-fi in the main lobby area, but there are no quiet spots due to the fact that the restaurant and bar are open to and part of the lobby. When we were there some huge party was going on and it was very loud in the lobby area. I was trying to do some work because all I had was my tablet (so I could only access wi-fi) and I finally gave up and went upstairs around midnight, and the party was still going strong. Yeah, it was a Friday night, but it was disappointing that there were no quiet areas to work in. The pool was clean, but frigid. My kids, who love to swim, spent about 20 minutes in the water and then had to get out because they were freezing. The ice cold water is probably really nice in August, but not so great at the end of October. Our room was nice and clean, so were the linens. The bed was pretty comfortable. The bathroom had a sliding door on it, and no lock. This didn't bother us but might both some people. There is also no fan in the bathroom, so it gets very steamy and the mirror foggy, and you have to wait for it to clear. The door to the hotel room had a slow-closing mechanism on it to prevent the door from slamming shut, but it was a total pain because you either had to wait for it to close totally, or you had to manhandle it closed. If you don't wait, your door is wide open and anyone can just walk in, and if someone was trying to push their way through the door you would not be able to close it quickly. I don't think this is very safe, especially for women traveling alone. This hotel is also very spread out, so you will be doing a lot of walking to get to your room depending on where it is located. The final thing to be aware of it that since this hotel is so close to the port, if you like to sleep with the window open you will hear a constant (about every 90 seconds) horn blowing. I am not sure what it was, but it was constant. And it seemed to increase in frequency about 6:30 am. You can't really hear it when the windows are closed, though. Our room was also overlooking the marina, so maybe it wasn't as noticable on the other side of the hotel. If you want to be close to the Port, you can't beat the location. But you won't get as much for your money as you would at another hotel. You can find packages online that will add to what you get for your money (such as comp. breakfast, etc.), so I would recommend searching these out if you plan on booking here.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salinas", "Title": "\u201cNo in-room wifi :(\u201d", "Author": "David L", "ReviewID": "UR121931043", "Content": "We like this place.

We had 2 rooms (which were across the hall even though we pre-requested adjoining rooms and the hotel wasn't that busy -- there are adjoining rooms but they had booked one of the pair to someone else -- I don't think they read the requests ahead of time on rooms booked on interenet). We were not able to access the internet in either room without help from the engineer due to trouble with their outdated tangle of cable wires.

Ok, yes, there is one.. Can't say it affects me personally, but here you go.. On cruise turnaround days the hotel is very busy.. The only significant impacts I have noticed of this are that a) the pool area can get a little crowded (as opposed to my being there on my own, some days) and b) there can be a wait for your room on check in on these days as, often, they are turning around a large proportion of the rooms in the hotel (as a set of guests depart the hotel to check on to their cruises, a new set arrives from the recently docked ship)... They work very hard, from what I can see, to minimise impacts from this, but they are clear about their check in times.. If you arrive early, they will try and help, but you may also be waiting.. I have seen many folks trying to check in pretty early and, well, when they are turning 'round som many rooms, that will lead to the inevitable, I'm afraid..

I don\u2019t consider this a problem, except when I can\u2019t find how to connect to the internet. I decided to check the other room again and found a yellow cable connected to a box on the bottom of the desk. I had my own cable so once I found the connection I was in business. These were minor problems and in no way affected our stay \u2013 I was just glad it happened in our room rather than the other one which was occupied by guests of ours. And the front desk made up for it with some extra cookies \u2013 delicious. This is one of the few hotels which had not only a flat-screen TV but actually had HD on some channels. We had dinner at Ports O\u2019Call Village which is about a mile from the hotel. The next morning we had great buffet breakfast.

Unfortunately, that isn't the case, at least at this property. We were staying one night before a cruise and for that purpose the location is nice with beautiful views of a marina. There really isn't anything within walking distance, but the hotel shuttle will take you anywhere within 5 miles, so that gives you some options even if you don't have a car. The staff overall was very nice, but there seems to be a lack of training. Everyone does seem to try hard to be pleasant, which is a definite plus these days. I did have to wait while the valet guys rolled each other around on the luggage carts though. They could have easily hit someone coming out of the front door of the hotel....I'm sure management would be horrified if they saw this going on. Once I got their attention they were good about signing us up for the port shuttle the next morning. We arrived at 2pm and our room wasn't ready (check-in is 4pm), which we understand. We were told that the front desk would call us when the room was ready, which never happened. If you aren't going to follow through, don't offer to do it. They did offer to store our luggage and that worked out fine. We wandered around the marina and had lunch in the hotel's restaurant to kill time, so it wasn't a big deal. The food in the restaurant is very good, they offer a wide selection (although they were out of things at dinner), and the prices are reasonable for a hotel. The service was good at lunch, but very poor at dinner...we were never offered drinks other than water and the check was dropped off without asking if we wanted dessert. We received our Gold Hilton Honors benefits with room upgraded to marina view even though we were staying on points, which was nice. I expect to get them, but not necessarily without asking. Everything was in order and properly presented at check-in. Now for the huge flaw where this property really falls on its face. The place is filthy. Honestly, I've stayed in $50 motels that were cleaner than this hotel. I was shocked and I'm not very picky. All of the furniture in the lobby was either dirty, extremely worn, or both. There was trash on the floor, the carpets were dirty and needed vacuuming, and there were paper towels strewn all over the public restroom. There is a pool table in the lobby that has a light fixture over it that had two burned out bulbs and a missing shade. Really tacky. Take it out if you can't fix it. The room itself (room 357), while fairly spacious, was not properly cleaned by any stretch of the imagination. The bathroom floor was disgusting and had not been mopped because it had small chunks of dirt still on it. The bottom of the bathtub needed to be scrubbed, the shower curtain rod was about to fall down, the electrical outlet and light switch were very dirty, and the back of the door had a huge black smudge that looked like mold from inside the wall pocket it slides into. In the room, one of the beds was so rumpled it looked like all they did was remake a slept-in bed (I convinced myself it was just wrinkled), there were cobwebs floating around on the ceiling above the desk, the floor lamp had huge yellow stains on the shade, the lamp by the bed had something spewed up the inside, and the internet cable on the desk was broken so it wouldn't clip into the computer (I bring my own anyway, but I shouldn't have to). The carpet looked clean enough except for some crumbs indicating it hadn't been vacuumed. The upholstered chair had crumbs all over it and the desk chair was filthy. Note that the marina view rooms have the possibility of noise from people walking/talking along the walkway and it can be noisy if there is a party going on at the adjacent yacht club. This hotel has a lot of potenial, but I'm sorry to say it isn't living up to it. I'm sure it gets a lot of rough traffic with all the kids embarking Disney cruises, but that's no excuse for poor housekeeping. I would say that overall the noise level here is acceptable even with the kids running around. The old A/C unit was very quiet and worked properly. There is no way I'd pay the regular rates for this hotel. I might stay here again using points or with an extremely discounted rate under the same circumstances. All in all it was tolerable and the staff was nice, but wouldn't cut it if you are paying full price.

The A/C worked great, and there was even a wireless remote so I could adjust it from my bed if it was too hot or cold during the night (but I didn't need to).

There are also free tennis courts on property so bring your raquets if you play. Oh yeah, and the fitness center has a sauna! One very mior complaint- the room service attendants could probably check the hallways more frequently as there were many room service trays sitting outside the rooms.

We booked our own room and the other three members of my family got the room next door which was adjoined. So far so good. We were told to talk to the bell desk to arrange for transport in the morning to the cruise ship, but no one was there. After waiting by the bell desk for 10 minutes, we decided to just go upstairs and come back later. As we walked through the hotel to get to our room, we noticed the hallway doors were propped open by rag towels stuffed under the doors. EVERY single hallway door was propped up as such. Upon arrival at our room on the third floor (we stayed in room 306 and my family in 308, we saw that the rooms had probably not been renovated since the 1980s or early 90s. The bathroom floor tile had a sticky film or oil that you could feel with even your shoes and the air conditioner was creaking and rusted. One of our bath towels had a yellow/ brown stain on it that was visible while hanging. The air conditioner was actually only blowing regular air and wasn't working properly at all. We opened the window since it was cool outside, but the window opened only 3-4 inches. We decided to go back downstairs and not worry about it since we were tired and checked in late as it was. We ate dinner at the restaurant with so-so food that was way overpriced, and for a party of 5, an 18% gratuity was added. I don't know if this is customary, but we didn't think a $125 dinner bill for 5 people with no alcoholic drinks ordered was a great deal. We went back to the bell desk, and again, no one was present to make arrangements for us. We waited another 10 minutes, and finally a bell person came. We went back upstairs and my wife fell quickly asleep. The window was still open, and starting at about 11:45pm, a loud crashing was heard outside. I went to look and saw that our room view was of the alley/ garbage disposal area of the hotel. It also seemed to be a sort of loading/ dock area. Every 10-15 minutes, another crashing noise came which made it impossible to sleep. I had no choice but to close the window and turn on the broken air conditioner. The air conditioner blew air, but the air felt humid and extremely uncomfortable. I could have complained and gotten another room but my wife and family were asleep and exhausted so I chose to endure the horrible experience for the night. In total, I think I finally fell asleep around 5am and slept for 2.5 or 3 hours. Disgruntled in the morning, I still washedup up in the nasty bathroom and used hand towels to dry myself off since my wife used the only non-stained bath towel we had. We went down to breakfast and had a decent breakfast buffet (free since we are Hitlon Gold Members). After packing up and coming downstairs for our 10:30 transport, I thought the worst was over. I made my complaints about the above to the front desk to just \"let her know\" and the lady just seemed to take some notes and said thanks for letting us know. At that point, I didn't really care anymore since I just wanted to be off on a good cruise and have no more worries about the crappy hotel experience. We get into the transport vehicle, and my wife and I get into the back seat, and what did the driver have playing on the stereo? Unedited rap music with explicit sexual lyrics including all types of profanity that could send you down to he final level of hell. Once all passengers were loaded into the vehicle, the driver did NOT turn off the music or change the station! This is the absolute WORST hotel experience I have ever had.

We had a rate of $174.00 which was negotiated with the hotel due to the difference between the online price and what the reservation desk first offered with our AAA discount. We took the Super Shuttle from the airport to the hotel and arrived before the 4:00 p.m. check in. The hotel locked our luggage in a storage area so we were free to sit outside on their patio to have food and drinks. The waiter was very friendly and provided great service. After 4:00 p.m. we asked the front desk if we could check in but were told we should come back in about 10-15 minutes. This happened 2 more times. Each time the front desk had to call housekeeping to see if the room was ready. Finally at 4:45 p.m. we were able to check in. I had reminded the front desk we had a free breakfast and they brought our coupons up to the room later. We signed up for the hotel\u2019s shuttle the following morning to take us to the cruise port which really worked out well. When the Super Shuttle dropped us off at the hotel, the bellman asked if we wanted to take the hotel\u2019s shuttle around the marina area for dinner at any of the restaurants. We declined, wishing now that we had. Dinner in the hotel\u2019s restaurant was more than I thought we should have spent. When we were leaving port the next day we saw all the restaurants we could have eaten at if we had chosen the hotel\u2019s shuttle around the marina.

We decided to do a pre-cruise stay for our RCCL cruise leaving the 9th. We drove up from San diego and decided to make an outing of it and went to see the Aquarium of the pacific (outstanding! buy your tickets online and save $5.00 a person) and the surrounding marina area (also great). We also had lunch at a near by restaurant withing walking distance of the aquarium and the prices were reasonable.There are plenty of shops to see if you are into that and great areas for walking and lots of restaurants and you can get a good view of the Queen mary. Well we had a full afternoon and headed back to the hotel. We reserved the \"park and cruise\" package that included accomodations, parking for the week, champagne or cider and a breakfast buffett for two the following morning. Check in was quick and friendly and they gave us warm chocolate chip cookies which we saved for later. The front desk asked us to check in with the bell desk to arange for what time we would like to depart for the ship. The bell desk just asked what time we would like because they had scheduled times to depart and the just asked how many pieces of luggage that we had and said what time to meet in the lobby. That was it and took all of about two minutes. Our room was a king size non-smoking ground floor facing the marina which was very nice. The room was clean and was large enough. The bedding was crisp and clean and there were plenty of pillows. the bathroom had plenty of towels and the ammenities were neutrogena, including sunscreen (nice touch, for use on shore excursions) and face wash. We decide to walk around the marina and the hotel is next to a yacht club with plenty of nice boats, the grounds were well kept and we felt very safe in the area. When we returned to the room they had delivered the champagne on ice with glasses (more on that later). By that time it was time for dinner and you could eat at the hotel but we decide to ask the bell desk person what was in the area and he mentioned a good seafood restaurant. The hotel will shuttle you for free to places in the immediate area and then you just call up the number on the card the bellman gives you and they come and pick you up. It is a very nice service and my Wife and I enjoyed a nice dinner at the 22nd street pier (thanks Paul!!). What a perfect way to end a very full and enjoyable day. The bed was very comfortable and there was nothing that hampered a good nights sleep. In the morning after having coffee (Wolfgang pucks complimentary in the room) we decided to go to the buffett. I was not large but had just about everything you might want for breakfast and you could always order from the menu. They had hot and cold cereals, eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, muffins, juices, tea, coffee. We thought it was good and it was included in the package. By itself I think it was 18.00 per person, very convienient. Back to the champagne..we decided not to open it on arrival and instead make our own mimosas with some o.j. from the buffett. Another good memoy and nice way to get primed for a cruise ship departure! With the mimosas all gone we gathered our belongings and went to the lobby which is large and allows ample room for people to spread out with luggage etc. it is also a nice time to chat with other cruisers who are going to be on your ship. The shuttle driver loaded our luggage at the designated time and we were at the cruise ship terminal in about 10 minutes. the driver unloaded our luggage which went right to the cruise lines luggage handler and away we went to check in. Over all a very good pre-cruise adventure.

The other staff problem we had was with the shuttle service person, the girl was very uninterested in helping us get to a wedding the next day\u2026she said the destination we wanted was out of their range, they only go 5 miles within the hotel, well where we wanted to go was 4.8 miles. Needless to say we drove ourselves\u2026she was very unaccommodating.

I am being charged $189 per day (pre-taxes) for a guest room with a king-sized bed and (partial) view of the harbor plus more $$$ for all the other optional, but, for me, personally necessary extras [Internet, microwave ($10/day), and mini-refrigerator ($10/day)] that are usually free at other like-priced hotels . The room price is way too steep given the fact that the room, while pretty clean and decent looking, is rather small. There are no screens on the window, which forces one to use the air conditioner, which is NOISY and dated. There are few available TV/cable channels and the maid service is only adequate. Over all, it's an overpriced hotel that charges much too much for semi-views of a marina and really robs one blind for Internet, refrigerator, and microwave usage, which, albeit, are optional additions. One plus, though, is the hotel is pet-friendly--but again, only at an additional charge!!!", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cA Diamond in the Rough\u201d", "Author": "spkjones", "ReviewID": "UR7554761", "Content": "This is a tough review to write. As others have said the hotel is wonderful. The views from the balconies facing to marina are beautiful. The lobby, rooms and other areas are newly renovated, clean and nicely decorated. The staff was all very friendly. The cookies - of course - are great. We paid $109/night for a Sunday night which was outstanding for the LAX area. We had cocktails in the lobby restaurant in the evening and the prices were reasonable - and the views area great. It was a bit cool outside - but I would have loved to walk around outside near the marina. I'm sure it is great. The problem is this. The area surrounding the hotel is not so great. There is a nice restaurant/yacht club bar just up the street which is nice, BUT as soon as you get past there - it was a bit scary. My husband and I took a drive toward Long Beach just to take a look at the Queen Mary and on the way back spotted what we thought was a Farmers Market @ one mile from the hotel. We thought we'd stop by. Let's just say we felt VERY out of place there and after one quick walk through we drove directly back to the hotel and decided to stay in for the night. The area directly surrounding the hotel seems very safe, but don't expect to wonder around nearby. San Pedro, itself, didn't seem like the kind of town I'd venture through in the evening to look for a nearby pub or restaurant. I hate to say it, because I LOVED the hotel... but I would not stay there again, nor would I recommend it to family or friends.", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nacogdoches,Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "bbnactex", "ReviewID": "UR7193658", "Content": "If you are planning a cruise that leaves from San Pedro,this is the hotel for you.

Allot can change in a year and did! I looked all around for a hotel in the long beach area but I i could not get the double tree out of my head. So I looked on tripadvisor and noticed some users say that there was a massive renovation. I called the hotel and they said the renovation is almost complete. Wow I thought. So I booked the hotel 3 nights before our cruise. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was that the staff gives you warm fresh made chocolate chip cookies upon check in. The restaurant has been updated and looks great. The little gift shop has not changed and i guess thats a good thing. The carpet thoughout the hotel has been changed. The rooms have been completely updated with featherbeds and nice neutural colors thoughout the room. Everything about the rooms are first class. The rooms with marine views are great , the windows are large and completely open. Room service is prompt and resonable. I would come to this hotel for a weekend just to get away. You can't beat the location if you want a quiet relaxing hotel.The one thing you should know is that if you want to go anywhere from this hotel you will need a car. If you are coming from the Long Beach Airport it costs $35 to get to this hotel via taxi or van. The hotel has a free shuttle to the ship if you are taking a cruise. The hotel sits on a marina about 8 miles away from long beach and any activities, so rent a car if you want to do anything outside of the hotel. I mean anything. To wrap it up the hotel is in one word Awesome. I will stay there again when we cruise next year and I might make a few trips there before then. It is a home away from home. At the same time you are quite aways from Long Beach. So if you want want a great relaxing hotel out of the hustle and bussle of the big city this hotel is for you.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Dorado Hills, CA", "Title": "\u201cNot Worth the Price\u201d", "Author": "whosit", "ReviewID": "UR6137694", "Content": "We Usually stay here every year for business and have seen the Hotel change names many times!!.

They converted to Doubletree as of August 1st. The rooms are by far the best in the market.....and I feel they even rival some of the best Hotels in Long Beach just over the bridge. The shuttle to the cruise terminals was convenient & affordable and the Bellman were very accomodating. The food was incredible as well. They have this Seafood Buffet every Friday night on the patio overlooking the Marina, the view was breathtaking.
