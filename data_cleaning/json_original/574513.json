The 1st time was Days Inn Oceanfront @ 23rd, a few days before Hurricane Irene hit, had to evacuate, thank God, the place sucked! (I wrote a review on it last year). 2nd was week before Memorial day 2012,stayed at the Quality inn Boardwalk @ 17th st. Very nice place and would stay there again but was sold out on our 3rd visit on 8/7/12. The Crystal Beach had vacancies, so we stayed here. Location & parking garage was a plus! The Hotel & Rooms were very clean. The room itself had an kitchenette but no stove, only microwave, ok, planned on eating out anyway. The room was big, 2 queen beds, pullout sofa, 2 chairs & table. Could use another piece of furniture in room, looked a little empty. Very clean, nice balcony, and the whole Hotel smelled clean. Now the bad points, the pool was small and the lounge area around pool was small. Booked a room that was ocean view. It was the side of the hotel and had a partial view of the ocean, not a big deal, but if I knew the poolview room was the oceanfront room also , I would have taken this room for 40.00 cheaper! Now if the people who worked here were a little nicer, I would have found this out. So I give this Hotel for rooms & cleanliness an 8 out of 10. For the employees a score of 5 out of 10.

Can't beat the unobstructed view of the beautiful beach. Close to the tram station. Within walking distance of several restaurants, miniature golf, and stores. Less expensive than other boardwalk hotels. Rooms were spacious and comfortable with all the promised amenities. Friendly and helpful front desk staff. Clean. The housekeeping staff were always around. Paking not an issue. The negative: the old bedspreads, hotel blankets, and curtains have got to go. Each of these (yes, both beds) was stained and/or torn. Gross. The sheets are probably supposed to be a cream color but this makes them look dingy and unclean also. The pillows are really thin. They don't put a fitted sheet on the mattress (only a flat one), so when you sleep you wake up with your body against the bare mattress. Speaking of the mattresses, they've got to go also. Very old and no longer firm or comfortable. The grout in the bathroom is stained/chipped. The TV was busted/cracked in the corner. There was a light out in the entryway of room. Our fridge was not working properly. After notifying the front desk, someone came up with a new fridge in less than 10 minutes (this was good). Our toilet became partially clogged without reason but then resoved itself the next day. The air-conditioning was bearly adequate. To be fair, we didn't complain about this because we didn't want to be moved to a different room. There were three couples in our group each staying in three different rooms on three different floors. Between all of us there were two broken phones, a broken TV, a broken fridge, and two clogged toilets. The staff did promptly correct anything that was brought to their attention. Overall: Despite the negatives, staying here was still not a bad experience. I view these things minor annoyances versus major issues. If you want to stay in a clean, affordable place with a great boardwalk location, consider staying here. If you expect perfection and are easily upset when things are not exactly right, this is not the place for you. I would certainly consider staying here again but would also look into similar places that are better maintained. Upgrades to the bedding, appliances, and heating/plumbing systems would bring me back sooner.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Akron, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAdequate and affordable\u201d", "Author": "familyofsixgreens", "ReviewID": "UR135554239", "Content": "Our oceanview efficiency was somewhat outdated but clean .

The best thing about the Crystal Beach Hotel is the location. You can't beat the quiet north end of the Boardwalk. We were initially pleased with the room. The view was great and it wasn't anything more than we needed for the weekend, but things weren't quite as nice as we're used to - even at the beach. While we had no complaints about the cleanliness or service, the beds were rock hard and there were no extra pillows (in fairness, we didn't ask for any), but pillows wouldn't have helped the problem of feeling the mattress springs poking at you all night long. The exhaust fan in the bathroom (on the same switch as the main light) also sounded like its bearings were about to give out completely and the screeching noise would last for several minutes after being turned on or off - so after the second or third time, we just left it on all weekend. Turns out the exhaust fan wasn't a problem though, since there was no hot water on Sunday morning. I let it run for a good 15 minutes (figuring it may just take a while to get up to the top floor in an empty hotel), before I gave up and took a cold shower. It never did get hot and the front desk advised me that the maintenance guy didn't get in until 8:00.

The second night we were there the sliding glass door completely came off the hidges (remember traveling with a 3 year old boy) and when my husband went to the front desk to report the problem the man behind the counter informed him that the maintenance guy was out for the day. The hotel was completely booked so they couldn't move us to another room.

The person who took my reservation over the phone told me I would have an efficiency overlooking the ocean. I would consider an efficiency to have some type of appliance to cook on. Well, I suppose they count a toaster as a \"full kitchen\", because there was no stove, and all of the items we brought to make in the efficiency went back in the bags. I thought trying to make spaghetti with the toaster would have been a little difficult. To be honest I did not inquire about Wifi when I talked to a somewhat disinterested Crystal Beach person on the phone, but I was really ticked when I found out we had to pay for access. In my experience, having to pay for internet access was unheard of. Not only did I have to pay the service, it was incredibly bad. When the Wifi worked it was very slow and kicked you off every five minutes. I complained to the management only to discover they contract a third party Wifi provider, and my $13.95 plus tax would have to be refunded through them. Considering I was charged some kind of $3.00 fee for Wifi upfront I find their method of operation disturbing. Cleanliness; I know its Ocean City, but it could have been better. The reason I say this is when we had cause to refit the ill fitted sheets on one of the beds there were toenail clippings and general crud under the bed...yuck. Comfort; the room never dried out. even though the air conditioner worked, it did not remove the moisture from the air. Everything was damp at all times, and after three we felt like mushrooms. Staff; I know others have remarked regarding the staff's helpfulness and friendliness. I can neither confirm or deny as we had minimal contact with them.

Had two queen-size beds, nice size bathroom w/tub & shower and hair dryer, kitchenette (microwave, small fridge, bar sink, cabinet space, & coffee pot w/coffee and tea daily), ironing board w/iron. The room was carpeted and tiled in kitchen and bathroom. The balcony had two chairs, with room for more. The front desk staff and housekeeping were courteous and helpful. Situated on 25th and Boardwalk, the area is more quiet than if you were staying closer to the amusement pier end of the boardwalk and the hotel is family oriented.

As I was loading my 3 year old in the van she yelled \"I gotta go to the bathroom\" So I went back in and asked if I can take her back to the room to use the potty and they wouldn't even let me do that.

I will start off by saying I was very unsure about staying at a small hotel with mixed reviews on Trip Advisor. However, the hotel was adequate....it did the job. Their is nothing special about the Crystal Beach. Yet it was for the most part clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and check in was easy. The only sign of uncleanliness in the room was smudges on the mirror. Pay extra and get the Ocean View b/c the efficency rooms truly have no view from the balcony. The beds wre ok.....but the air conditioning needs to be updated. It either freezes the room when on or the room gets way too hot. The way to get around it is too keep it on during the day....freeze the room and then shut it off when you get back after dinner and you will be ok for the night. The pool sits on the boardwalk which is very nice and the hotel is 10 feet from the beach. It is at the quieter end of the boardwalk which was very nice. The bottom line is that your not getting a 5 star resort...if u want that stay at the Hilton...but if u want a clean, adequate, reasonably priced hotel on the beach then the Crystal Beach Hotel is for you.

As hotels in O.C. go, you could do much much worse than this hotel. I originally booked a side Ocean view room via the hotel's website for $189 a night at the beginning of August based on the many positive reviews I had read on tripadvisor. This was the only type of room and price the website showed as being available for my trip dates. The hotel has 79 rooms. I continued to check the website a couple times a week for other availability and prices. There were none. Then when I rechecked the website only one week before I was to arrive there were all these rooms which suddenly had become available, including Ocean Front , which had not ever been on the site for my trip dates during several previous weeks. It was as if a large group that had booked many rooms had just cancelled all of their reservations. I found all this sudden new availability to be very strange. I called and one of the owners upgraded me to Oceanfront for a rate of $229 a night. The very next day a very negative review appeared on tripadvisor for this hotel and, along with all this sudden room availability, I started getting very nervous. I am allergic to mold, and I decided to handle this by calling the Hotel and I read the review directly to one of the owners. She told me I was outside the 72 hour cancellation policy and that I could still cancell without penalty. She also told me if when I arrived and looked at the assigned room and did not like it I would not be held to the reservation. I do not know if this was really true, but I think reading the review to her made an impact. When I arrived at the hotel I was assigned to an Ocean Front room on the top (5th) floor which is non-smoking. The Ocean Front rooms do not have a sleeper sofa along with the 2 double beds like the side rooms; just the double beds. They are a bit smaller than the side rooms too but for two to four people it was fine and had plenty of room. The front view of the Boardwalk and the ocean was very nice and the balcony was large. The balconies are all the same size regardless of room location and can easily seat 3 or 4 people. Although you have an individual balcony, they really are not private if the people next to you are out on their balconies. For the most part, the people in the rooms next to me were not out on their balconies when I was, but if they had been I would have not enjoyed this balcony design as much as some other hotels from a privacy standpoint. On the other hand, because it is open, you have a very wide view up and down the O.C. boardwalk ocean around 25th street. That was nice. I agree with some of the other comments here saying the rooms are rather plain, but they certainly are not tired and run down looking in any way. I would describe them as being a step down from a new Hampton Inn. However, no Hampton Inn I know of has a view like this. There was no mold of any kind in my room or anywhere else where I could see at the hotel. While the public areas of the hotel are very clean, i would give the cleaning service in my room a B+. It was good but not great. Also, the beds are on the hard side, and not that comfortable. They were acceptable, but I think this hotel could do better. The lighting in the room is just too dim at night, and I found myself wishing I had brought a pack of 100 watt light bulbs with me. That would have been very helpful in the evening, and the lamps can accomodate that wattage. I suggest you do that if you stay there. The kitchen area was adequate with a good sized small refrigerator, microwave, and storage space. There was no stove, dishwasher or utensils. It is true there really is no lobby to this hotel. The front desk and check in area is the size of one the rooms if that. There were Security Cameras on every floor and you could see the view the cameras had behind the staff at the front desk. There are vending machines near the check in but no place to sit down. There is nothing of a lobby here like, for example, the Stoweaway Grand on 21st Street. The pool is in front of the hotel next to the Boardwalk. It is kind of on the small size but with plenty of lounge furniture to lay out in the sun. The area around the pool has plenty of room and did not seem too crowded at all. The pool was very clean and I saw hotel staff cleaning it every morning before it was opened for the day. That is a plus. There were problems with noise in the middle of the night on the Boardwalk even though this hotel is supposedly at the \"quiet \" end of the Bordwalk. Two of the three nights I was there the same group of 4 to 6 young adults ( not staying at the Hotel ) congregated at one of the benches on the Boardwalk and got very noisy around 1:00 to 2am. Yes, they were drinking. O. C. has a noise ordinance curfew in effect, and I did call the police the first night. I saw the police car drive up to the group the first night but they did not break up the partiers and the noise continued. I went to the front desk and Mike, the staff on duty checked out the situation and called the police on behalf of the Hotel. This time the police broke up the group. The second night it happened again I just went to the front desk right away and Mike again called the police immediately. There was no more middle of the night noise problems after that. I appreciated the Hotel's prompt attention to drunks on the Boardwalk disturbing their guests. The adjacent parking garage was very convenient and always had plenty of room for everyone. There was never any time wasted with the annoyance of trying to find a place to park. It is important to share that in talking with several other guests in the hallways and elevators, no one was disappointed in this hotel as an Ocean City property. People commented on its cleanliness, and one couple said they had checked out of a very dumpy motel nearby and that the Crystal Beach was the Plaza in comparison. Also, the elevators are modern and there is never a wait. Last summer I stayed at the Dunes Manor Hotel and the very slow elevators there were totally and completely unacceptable. Such a waste of time. The first evening of my stay when I was in the hall near the front desk I overheard a conversation between one of the owners and some potential walk in guests who wanted to stay for only 2 nights. It was a pleasure to hear the various room rates quoted to these persons were all HIGHER than what I was paying for an Ocean Front room with an advanced 3 night reservation. ( I do not like it when walk ins get a better deal than people with advanced reservations who trust the hotel to give them the best available price. ) They decided to leave and look elsewhere and the rates were not dropped to get them to stay. In closing, I will say that the hotel has responsible staff and owners who run things efficiently and professionally. There is no doubt about that. However, I have to say when I checked out I got the definate feeling from the owners that they could have cared less if I ever came back. As I checked out I thanked one of them who acted surprised someone would thank her and said bruscly \"you are welcome\". When I stood to the side of the front desk waiting to thank the other owner who was on the phone, I got the feeling i was annoying the first owner I had just thanked. When I thanked the second owner after she finished her phone call the first one said to me \"I already said you are welcome.\" I found that comment to be strange. They aren't the most friendly people. As to whether or not I would return, the jury is out on that one. If owners of a hotel act like they don't care if you stay there again or not in the future, should you?", "Date": "October 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumberland, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "jrh179", "ReviewID": "UR5628095", "Content": "We checked out of the Seabonay 30 minutes after we got there and found this place!

We got in and had made a reservation for a Ocean view room, when we got into our room I could literally see into the next buildings bathroom. There was no view of the ocean. I went back down to the office and explained that I wanted an Ocean view room and the girl at the front desk told me that I need to pay more for the ocean side room and if I wanted a full view of the ocean, I needed to get the Ocean front room. We opted for the ocean front room, since it's off season, I got into one for 99.00 which wasn't bad. The room was pretty gross. The bed spreads were old and worn with cigarette burns in both that comforter and blankets. The room seemed clean but had that outdated, old feel to it. There was nothing to make you feel at home. It was very empty and plain. I really like a more plush, comfortable room and this just reminded me of a red roof inn or motel 6. You had to have certain switches on to make the TV and outlets work, I asked for more pillows and was handed them at the front desk with the pillow cases piled on top. They apparently dont bring things to your room there, as I balanced my 3 year old, a stroller and 4 pillows and pillow cases.
