I didn't reserve the cheapest room but also did not get the most expensive.We had two single beds pushed together. The rate was around E130/night. The elevator is not much larger than a phone booth but that really wasn't a big deal. There is no shower curtain in the bathroom but that was not a huge deal either. The water pressure was very good. I packed a beach towel with me and would recommend you do the same as you end up using at least one of the hotel towels to dry the floor. The staff was very courteous.

Location : Great. Easy walk into the Latin Quarter, Notre Dame, Musee D'Orsay and Le Louvre. Quiet street near the Odeon. Close to Metro and RER. Room: Clean, comfortable, compact but not too small, nothing elaborate but nicely fitted out. Was on the top floor (room 606) so had a bit of sky out the window. Single bed was like a small double. Comfortable, nice linen, two pillows, extra blanket. Bedside lamps. Free wi-fi which worked well and a small desk to sit at with my laptop. Big wardrobe for a smallish room with shelves and hanging space. Spotless bathroom with hot, strong shower. Key lock entry to the room, no Ving card. No safe in the room. Satellite TV with about 24 channels. Mostly in French. Reception : Didn't have that much to do with staff apart from check-in and out but the service was smiling and helpful. Free selection of teas and biscuits in reception when I came back from dinner in the evening. Nice. Breakfast : Started from 0700 and I was out of there by 0630 so didn't have it. Buffet for 20 Euros. Dining room looked ok and clean. Other : There's an elevator big enough for one person and a case, so no need to cart luggage up stairs. Thought is was a good 3 star hotel.

You are kind of across the street from the Latin Quarter yet in St. Germain/St. Michel. It's also near the famous medical University which means the area is relatively safe. Tons of fun through the shops and cafes in the nearby Latin section., although quite a walk if you have young kids. Great for teens -I'm sure not pleasant in the busy summer months. The lift/elevator fits ONE person with luggage or two VERY skinny people with no luggage. It's really like walking into a public telephone box. I am sure that the street level rooms are awfully noisy. Cleanliness is clearly a priority here, however, this is relative to the fact that this it is a 2-star. Although it was as clean as it could possibly be, the tub was simply too old (well-used) for me to consider relaxing for a bath. The balconies are pretty but basically cosmetic - more like a window sill with railings. Clean room, small with odd shape. This is the true \"drop your luggage and spend the day out\" kind of room.

I got no reply to any of these emails until I was told that -and I quote- \"Despite the circumstances the first night will not be refundable.\" I was angered by this and wrote to tell them that this was unfair given the extraordinary events that happened in grounding all flights in Northern Europe. Their general manager then sent me an email saying it was beyond his power to refund anyone, this was hotel policy and so on. I wasn't looking for a refund-I was seeking to move my booking and add on another night's business for him and this hotel. I worked for 15 years in hotels in Dublin-including three 5 Star Hotels in Dublin (Jurys Hotel, Ballsbridge; The Berkeley Cort Hotel; and The Shelbourne Hotel)-and know that this is simply not true.

Let's start out with the good stuff: The hotel had a cute, 1920's vintage feel. And the location was nice because it was right by the metro station Odeon. I went with my mother, and the room they gave us was great. Our beds were in seperate corners, and it was almost like having two rooms. Not to mention the price was fantastic. If you want to experience Paris without being a typical tourist, then this is really nice place. Unfortunately: The location had its downfalls. It is right by a university, so at night, you get all the kids outside drinking and being very obnoxious. Because there is no AC in the room, and it was June, we had to have our balcony door open, making it difficult to sleep at night. This WAS summer, so I don't think there will be any problems in the Fall or Winter. Also, there are two ways to get to your room: the stairs, or the 1x1 square foot elevator. Two thin people can barely squeeze in it. This leaves the stairs, which will give you good exercise, but do you really need it after running around all day? The staff is a little bit cold, but all you need to do is be nice to them, and they will open up. If you are going to Paris in the summer, I don't recommend this hotel, but in the Winter or Fall I urge you to stay here.

(it *is* clean though) 2.) the heating wasn't on in the evenings & so when we returned to our room at around 10pm, we were really cold (Paris in February is a bone chiller!!).", "Date": "October 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "rgirn", "ReviewID": "UR3813171", "Content": "Okay so I took a long time to write this but better late than never! Also want to point out that I gave this hotel a 4 star only because our room didn't have a shower curtain. There was a shower head but no curtain or curtain rod - so needless to say it took a while to get used to! The hotel is in the 5th district, which is the Latin Quarter. There's plenty of excellent restaurants, creperies, cafes, & bars around. Alot of hip artsy college students live around there and the metero is only steps away - as well as a Starbucks.

Let's start with the photo of the rooms on the hotel's website: large, luxurious, large, huge, large. The visit to the hotel proved quite the opposite. We requested a DOUBLE room-- which usually means a bed big enough for two medium-sized people. What we received was a tiny, not even 10 feet wide prison cell with two meager beds pushed together which kept sliding apart thoroughout the night. Let's add that these were sleepless nights, since the hotel has NO A/C whatsoever. Which isn't a problem if there are windows. But the infamous balcony (hence the hotel's name) has double doors which could not be opened fully because the second bed is in the way! Not so great for fire codes, but great for the hotel to squeeze out more money from a single room. Everyone raves about the breakfast, but who can eat when the temperature of the \"eating area\" (not the luxurious palacial type restaurant they boast on the website) is hotter than it is outside? I don't like to eat with sweat pouring off myself-- no thanks. It's better, more economical, and more Parisian to grab a few croissants and some beverages and head over to the Jardins du Luxembourg and sit in chaise longues and people-watch instead of paying 10 Euros for food in a steamy, cramped room. In short, this hotel might be ok in the winter but in the summer it is definitely NOT recommended. Why suffer in the heat and no ventilation, not to mention air conditionning, when there are plenty of comporable hotels 'round the corner? Also, why pay for a double room when you are getting two not even twin sized beds hastily pushed together? If you are a fan of decor, or at least expect some sort of harmony in your surroundings, then do not stay here. At least they could have put matching sheets on our bed(s); rather, they used two clashing colors, which made it more obvious that we had been gipped with the double bed. The bedspreads are alarmingly turquoise, rough, and in disrepair-- but then again, who uses blankets in a 100 degree room? As for the bathroom, I could read the paper through the towels, which might have covered 1/4 of my body, if I used two. NOT recommended.

After 6 months of research I decided the one bad review on this web site had to be just an off night, because this hotel is written up everywhere as excellent. We were not disappointed. First of all, the tiny lobby is just lovely. The staff were excellent, always directing us each day to the best of the area. (Later we found out just how FANTASTIC some of the places he sent us were - ask about how to get to the Patrick Roger chocolate shop.) Our room was on the top floor and had two beds, one double and one twin. We were shocked to discover we had a view of the Eiffel Tower! This may be the only room with view, but I will always ask for it now. (Yes, we would stay again.) The bathroom was very nice size, not small like other hotels. There was a long desk with phone and television, and we had to move the twin bed around, but a very large closet was in the room too. Had two chairs also. So, you can see, it was a nice larger than usual room for 130e. We did not partake of the breakfast, instead always chose to run out to a local patesserie for something unique. Turns out the famous Dalloyau by Luxumburg Gardens is very close. Also, the Odeon Metro is about 3 blocks away. Near the Metro is a tiny crepe maker who stands there all day. Yum. Have Nutella and Banana. We could easily walk to St. Supice and the St. Germain des Pres area to shop. In fact, several nights we walked all the way to Les Deux Magots! It was also not too far to Bon Marche. It is a great walking neighborhood. Our room was so quiet I actually woke up the first night worried that the City had no noise. I had never heard such a quiet city. But it was the neighborhood. We highly recommend.

Situated on a quiet, small street near the Odeon Metro stop in the Sixth Arrondissement, our family of three enjoyed a triple room on the fourth floor that was very large by European standards. We had three single beds, two placed together to form a king. The third bed was at the opposite end of a large room with desk nicely dividing the space to create two separate areas in the room. The hair dryer was located on the desk because the electric outlet in the bathroom would only permit electric razors, but with the very large mirror, chair and large desktop, there was plenty of alternate dressing space that was very convenient. The double sink and huge soaking tub with immaculate white tile all around the bathroom made it easy for three people to get out quickly each day for four wonderful days in Paris. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We arrived from an overnight flight, checked bags at 9 a.m. and returned around 1 p.m., when our room was immaculately cleaned and a complete range of toiletries was provided. Following an afternoon rest, we returned to the streets nearby for a wonderful evening of dinner, strolling and activity in the neighborhood. Later, we returned to our very quiet room where we slept without any interruptions. The small balcony was just large enough to step out for views and photos of the red tile rooftops nearby. We travel frequently, and given the quality, service, price, and location, this hotel offers the best value for the travel dollar we have seen in a large city recently. One tip: be sure to allow plenty of time for a taxi to show up. We asked the desk about time estimates to get to the Gare de Lyon and planned our departure time accordingly. The taxi company was about 20 minutes late, which seemed to be due to overbooking by the cab company. The hotel staff was very helpful and called several times for us during the wait and we made our train in a rush. The RER Line B goes directly to Luxembourg Gardens from CDG airport; the RER stop at Luxembourg is a short walk, and we found that a very easy way to get into the city, although rush hour can mean very crowded trains. The Luxembourg stop is only a 10-15 minute easy walk from the hotel.", "Date": "March 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "elainesl", "ReviewID": "UR3017600", "Content": "The following observations are mine (and those of my travel companion)--if others find the hotel completely to their liking I will not disagree with that. However, my friend and I didn't care for it at all. It is very well-located, about a 5 minute walk to the Odeon metro station. About a 20 minute walk to St Michel metro station which is also an RER station. Our 'twin' room was the smallest hotel room for two people I have ever seen. Two twin beds pushed together with no space in between. No bedside tables, just about 10 inches of floor space to a wall on either side of the beds. About 3 feet from the edge of the beds was a counter/desk top with some cubby holes underneath for clothes storage. There was a small closet which was a decent size. The furnishings were plastic, and clean, but far from pretty and new. Bathroom small, but ok, towels thin, Washcloths, soap, shampoo provided. Hand-held shower hose, no curtain around tub. Small tv with one English-language channel (CNN). Hair dryer provided, but not installed in bathroom, it was just left out on a shelf, and one had to crawl underneath the bedroom counter in order to find a solitary plug for the hairdryer. Worst thing was, the room, #406, REEKED of smoke. I don't smoke but am not an anti-smoking fanatic, but this odor was very unpleasant and made the room feel 'dirty', or at least, not fresh. Room rate 100 euro. The hotel's often-praised breakfast was okay. For 10 euro there was a choice of fruit juices, some dried fruit, yogurt, coffee, tea, and instant hot chocolate, good baguettes and croissants, butter and jams, and scrambled eggs (stone cold each day) and bacon and sausage. We had it twice, if we'd continued staying there we would not have had it again. By the morning of our second day we decided that our room was really too unpleasant and inquired about a larger room. We accepted, room 303. Much larger, it is a triple room, one double bed plus one twin day bed in its own alcove. Bigger bathroom, more electrical outlets, two sinks in bathroom, toilet in its own wc. A couple of area rugs, vinyl flooring. Posted price for this room 180 euro, but they offered it for 150 euro. Next morning, our third day, on our way out in the morning, we decided to check out the small hotel just two door down that we'd noticed each day. Hotel Delavigne, #1 rue Casimir Delavigne. Lobby looked lovely but since it is a 3-star, we assumed it would be much more expensive. Wrong! The hotel is lovely, fresh, modern but charming, etc. We were offered a twin room for 130 euro, less than our 2nd room at the Balcons. We went back to the Balcons, checked out, and rolled our bags down the street to the Delavigne.", "Date": "January 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cLove this little hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2987287", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in Hotel des Balcom for the New Years and we love this little hotel.
