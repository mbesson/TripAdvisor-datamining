The Mercantile is an Irish pub with accommodation above, so if you want a nice reception with room service & an extensive choice of breakfast, this is NOT the place for you. Instead you have to speak to someone behind the bar to book in (still using that dog eared exercise book & pencil), carry your own suitcases up the stairs (no lift) & if you do not fancy a \"cooked breakfast\" in the morning, I'm not sure what you do! Having said those awful things the location of The Mercantile is superb, being only 5/10 mins walk from all of Circular Quay's attractions. Staying in \"The Rocks\" area of Sydney is a must because everything you need starts from here. The Harbour Bridge/Opera House/Manly & Darling Harbour Ferrys/hop on - hop off tour bus/Botanical Gardens & The Rocks itself. You can even catch the train from the airport direct to Circular Quay for 15$ & takes about 15 mins. My wife & I paid 140$ for a double room with ensuite corner bath (circa 1980) & walk in shower. The room was large, had windows that you could open (3rd floor) & included a hearty cooked breakfast in the morning. An extra bonus was a small empty fridge & tea/coffee facilities topped up everyday, BUT there was no wardrobe -- just a line of hooks on the back of the door!! The biggest downside to The Mercantile is that every Fri/Sat & Sunday the road o/side(George St) is closed off to traffic & a craft market is set up. Combined with this the hotel has \"live\" Irish entertainment from early evening until about 11.00pm on each of these nights. So if you are looking for an early sleep -- look again! Luckily we were there from Sunday until Thursday so only had the one night experience, the rest of the week was fine. So staying at The Mercantile is certainly different & for us, once was enough. Mind you I priced The Holiday Inn just a few yards further down & it started from 200$ a day room only, so it could be said The Mercantile is good value. The Rocks area is superb, like staying in a living museum with old buildings all around as it was the original jumping off point for all those naughty travellers in days of old. As for Sydney Harbour & it's surroundings you will not be able to stop clicking away, absolutely lovely as indeed Australia is -- we did not want to leave BUT as the fridge magnets say: \"Australia, it's a bloody long way mate.\"", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallahassee", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but spartan room\u201d", "Author": "fieldsold", "ReviewID": "UR82786653", "Content": "I spent two nights at the Mercantile Hotel. The best thing about this place is the location: right in the heart of the Rocks which is the historic part of Sydney. And just one block from Sydney Harbor. From this hotel you can quickly walk to most of the Sydney highlights: the Harbor Bridge, the Opera House, the Botanic Gardens, Circular Quay with its ferry and subway stations, lots of restaurants. The Mercantile is only a few blocks from the Four Seasons, which I think costs about $300 per night, and one block from the Old Sydney Holiday Inn. But the Mercantile cost me only about $75/night U.S. and that included a full breakfast. So the location is superb. The breakfast is served until 9:30am, and included juice, toast, coffee or tea, and eggs. It was nothing to write home about, but it was okay. I did like the Irish guy who appears to run the place, and the staff are for the most part very nice and cordial. The place has a relaxed atmosphere which I liked. There is a restaurant and pub at the hotel. The restaurant serves Irish food, bangers and mash and all that. I did not eat there. So I've now mentioned all the good parts: great location, nice staff, free cooked breakfast, relaxed vibe. I also liked the antique feel of the hotel--I don't know just how old it is, but it is definitely old. And it hasn't been spiffed up lately, although that didn't bother me. For example, the carpet on the stairs was worn. So the place has character. My room could best be described as spartan. It was small, with a single bed, and small table, and an electric fan on a floor stand. And that was pretty much it. But the bed was comfortable, and there was a window that opened. I did love the great tin ceiling and crown moulding. I chose the cheaper room which comes with shared bath. There were 4 large bathrooms in a row right next to my room, and at any one time at least several of them were available. They were very clean, and everything worked fine. One potential problem at this hotel could be the noise from the pub. I asked to stay in a room on the back of the hotel (as I had read the reviews about noise), and I was given a back room on the third floor. My first night was a Thursday, and there was virtually no noise. The second night was a Friday, and the pub was a-rockin' and there was lots of noise, even though I was on the third floor and in the back. But I just turned on the fan in my room, and the white noise from the slightly noisy fan drowned out enough of the music noise to allow me to sleep just fine.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the location\u201d", "Author": "TMJE98033", "ReviewID": "UR74966138", "Content": "Staying at The Mercantile reminded me of solo travels through Ireland years ago -- scent of stale beer in the air, modest room, decent price, great location.

The place has a lot of character with really cool crown molding and painted tin ceilings and you could tell there was history there. They only gave us soap and no shampoo which I found to be a little weird. Also there is no sort of front desk u simply walk to bar and tell them you are staying in the hotel...you square the details up in a small converted office upstairs and go to your room.

The furniture was very basic (again I had to dust off a couple of pieces) and I had no phone, but I did have a small refrigerator and an electric kettle with plenty of coffee. There was loud music on the weekend and they set up the market EARLY on Saturday morning--lots of banging just outside my room. Lucky I was planning to get up early anyway. The breakfast was good and had some surprises (black pudding, which I love) but apparently you can't order, you just take what they bring you. All in all, I'd probably stay again because of the location, price (breakfast included) and the convenience of the room. If it had been well cleaned I would highly recommend it.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.

I had a single room with an ensuite, both were large and clean. The shower was fantastic. I found the staff incredibly friendly and they made a single traveller feel very much at home. And the included breakfast, well it kept me going well into the afternoon. Only down side, if you can call it one, is that they have live music every night, but this did stop at 11.45pm at the latest (i was there during the week). Finally the location is just perfect, you are virtually under Harbor bridge, in the centre of the rocks and Opera House is just a 5 min walk around the other side of the Circular Key. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, who wants a small friendly hotel rather than a large multi national.", "Date": "August 2, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Mercantile Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d298404-Reviews-The_Mercantile_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "298404", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b9/45/39/double-bed-plus-single.jpg"}}
