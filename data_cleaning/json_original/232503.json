It was our first time in Amsterdam, and so we weren't sure about which parts of town were convenient for tourists - it turns out the King's Villa was perfect for us. It's a 10-minute tram ride (Number 2 line) from the touristy areas, where you can find museums, restaurants, shopping, etc. Just get off at the Valeriusplein stop, walk three blocks, and there's the hotel. Very convenient! The hotel itself is a renovated mansion that backs up to the Vondel Park. It's very comfy and cozy inside, with a very pretty stained glass window as you walk up the staircase to your room (there's also a tiny elevator, but if you're a claustrophobe like, you'll appreciate that you can take stairs up to your room). The hotel staff during our check-in/check-out were all very friendly and spoke excellent English. Our room was a \"superior double room\" (room 116) and it was a fair size by American standards and HUGE by European standards. Very comfy king size bed, flat screen TV with several English programs, small smoker's balcony off the bedroom and another off the bathroom. The only reason I gave this hotel four stars instead of five is because the bathroom is a bit outdated and the breakfast downstairs is overpriced (12 Euros/person). But my wife wanted me to mention that the bathroom had very nice shampoo, conditioner, etc because \"that's the type of stuff women care about\". So there you go, ladies. Nice shampoo that made me feel pretty. If you want a good (and cheaper) breakfast option, I'd recommend Bagels and Beans at Koningsplein 20 (Number 2 tram line from the hotel to Koningsplein). We sat in the window and a had a great view of one of the canals on a rainy morning for half the price of breakfast at the hotel). Maximum quaintness. All things considered, it turns out this was a really good option for us in a great location. We were able to enjoy all the tourist attractions in Amsterdam, and at the end of the night we were happy to be in a hotel that was a short tram ride away from the rowdiness.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "iran", "Title": "\u201cso lovely for comming back again\u201d", "Author": "m0bin", "ReviewID": "UR116194404", "Content": "we had a family trip to amsterdam,it was so nice ,staff were very kind and helpful,the place of hotel is very quite and nice and near to a great vandle park,the complete place for rest and to be far from city noise.i sure that if i comming back to amsterdam in future i will go directly to kings villa hotel", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cflaws made up for by location and back yard\u201d", "Author": "well_travelled_girl3", "ReviewID": "UR115667025", "Content": "We have stayed at King's villa 2 times and we really enjoy it. it is right on Vondel Park in a very attractive neighborood. it has an amazing back area.
