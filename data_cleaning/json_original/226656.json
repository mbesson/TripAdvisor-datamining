It is a family tradition that his family started years ago and we plan to continue on with our own family. Every year we look forward to our fall visit to Branson, but I think we are all truely just looking forward to our visit at Lilley's! When my husband and I decided to get married on June 1 of this year there was no argument as to how we would spend our honeymoon which was at Lilley's of course! We are not avid trout fishermen but do enjoy the beauty of Lake Taneycomoe and spent at least two evenings out on the dock with a bottle of wine enjoying the cool breezes and beautiful views. Our teen daughter looks forward to the pickup games of basketball with her aunts and uncles in the fall and is really looking forward to the day that the weather is warm enough during one of our stays to enjoy the pool. Lilley's is a dog friendly resort and it is great fun meeting and greeting the other guests with their furry little companions. We have two westies that love to travel along with us and it is a great relief to not have to worry about them at a kennel. Although we won't be making the visit this fall due to a family wedding we are very much so looking forward to a visit in 2013 and will probably throw a summer 2013 excursion to Lilley's in just for good measure. If you are looking for an upscale hotel experience this is not for you, there are plenty of places on the strip for that. The pictures on trip advisor paint an acurate portrait of what to expect. This is a fishing resort. However, if you are looking for a great place to enjoy your family this is the place for you! The cabins are comfortable and efficient. I'm not a fan of the bedding so I bring my own, however unless I am planning a stay at a top hotel I have learned to bring my own bedding most anywhere. I can't say enough about the Lilley's experience!!! I love having my early morning coffee on the dock. I love the smell of breakfast being cooked at the various cabins around me. I love the friendliness of all of the other Lilley's guests. I could spend an entire day just sitting on the deck and walking my dogs on the docks. The carefully manicured and lush landscaping all around Lilley's is almost as breathtaking as the views of the fall foliage along lake Taneycomoe. You can tell that the Lilley family puts a lot of love into their resort and that just makes the visit all the more enjoyable. I can't wait to go back!", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cWell run small resort next to Branson\u201d", "Author": "John S", "ReviewID": "UR136325273", "Content": "I enjoyed my stay and would stay again.

So with that in mind, my review is based from a non-sportsman opinion. We had a 3 bedroom/2 bathroom on the lake location. It was very roomy and it was similar to a corporate apartment as it had cookware, towels, etc. The balcony had a huge table with seating for about 8 and a bbq grill. The staff comes around and cleans all of the bbq's every day. (Each cabin has its own grill.) And on our last day there, the used grills were being replaced with new. My husband likes this place because he can park his boat right outside in one of the 30+ boat slips they have. The outside of the place is pretty rustic but the people are friendly and the inside was more like a home than a cabin, i.e. the walls were drywall, the bathrooms were similar to home, the kitchen had a nice island, etc. The things I did not like (but not too much because I will be going back again) was that there were no tvs in the bedrooms (but hey, you are there to enjoy the outdoors, right?); upon leaving you are asked to make sure you take out all of your garbage (again this is no big deal because you have to do it at home, right?); and you share a balcony (which is not a hassle because most people who stay at this place are usually older nice people like ourselves). We had our dog with us and others had pets there as well. The place was immaculate. There are always people tending to the grounds, etc. You have privacy because they really don't come in to clean till you check out. You just set your towels outside your door if you need to exchange towels. So even though I am not a rustic kind of person, I will be going back again next Spring with my husband. Also, there are fishing guides available and if you want to make sure you catch some fish and you are not that familiar with this lake, then this is an option to consider. The tv had many many channels and the internet worked great, as did the central ac and heat. Our first 2 nights in the area were spent at an area hotel then our last 3 nights were here and it was most enjoyable to bbq and sit around with pretty scenery. If you like rustic but also like the comforts of home, and love the outdoors, then this is the place for you.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springdale, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay and right on the water\u201d", "Author": "BradWiegmann", "ReviewID": "UR119351269", "Content": "Lilleys's Landing is a great place to stay right on the banks of Lake Taneycomo.

The air conditioning was very, very cold; the hot water was very hot; the beds were very comfortable and as mentioned before, the cabins are very, very clean. We asked other visitors to see if they had as good of an experience as we did and they all agreed. The cabins all had the same degree of cleaniness and amenities. The cabins have a supply towels, equiped kitchen, etc. The resort is family friendly and provide a bevy of activities for children such as the swimming pool, a large playground and daycamp during the summer months. The proprietors are some of the nicest we've met traveling and are very good genuine people, accommodating all of your needs. They cleaned the pool every single morning and did a super job of cleaning the cabins and rooms. Many of the visitors we spoke to have been coming here for many years.
