The breakfast was pretty awesome for something that comes with your stay. The fitneed center was minimal on equipment. Also, if you fly in the larger airport in Dallas the cab right is a little expensive and takes about 15-20 minutes. The bad news... The water was a little tempermental the whole time. It is hard to find the right temperature. But the morning we left, when we had to get up at 4:00am and things were already unpleasant we ended with no hot water. I think this might have ruined the stay for me. Because the water was touchy the whole time I am going to assume this wan't a one time thing. So there you have it. I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone because of the water issue, which is a huge issue to me.

You can't blame a hotel for this, it is how they respond to this that is important. We didn't blame the hotel or ask for anything and we didn't write a bad review.
