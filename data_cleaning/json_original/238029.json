It\u2019s easy walking distance to all the monuments and Vatican City. The view of the fountain from the breakfast room is excellent. We were given a room at the back which should have been quiet but the lift is so old and noisy it was impossible to sleep. I have never seen a double room so small or basic, I guess it was about 2m x 2.5m and the bed was pushed right up to the wall to allow enough room to walk past the other side. Yes it used to be a monastery but it's now a hotel and guests expect more than a basic bed and wardrobe. There wasn\u2019t even a glass to rinse our teeth after brushing. It's a shame we didn't get one of the nice rooms shown on the website. The bathroom - I'll try not to be rude but it's very difficult and here goes: you can sit on the toilet, brush your teeth in the washbasin, soak your feet in the bidet and wash your hair in the shower all at the same time. Get the picture? Breakfast was lovely and there was plenty on Sunday and Tuesday but Monday was a problem when there was no juice, cold meat, bread rolls or pastries and we had to ask. Don't be afraid to speak out, you've paid for breakfast so ask for it. The breakfast lady on Sunday and Monday was not friendly and some would say she was rude but I know how tourists can be tiresome and will leave you to decide for yourself. The young lady on Tuesday was really nice and attentive. Staff on reception were nice apart from one who seemed a bit stuffy but I won\u2019t make any comments because you never know whether someone is just having a bad day. The porter is the nicest, genuine person I have ever met on holiday. He is full of information and has a smile every time you see him. All in all it\u2019s ok for the money because of the location but you can get better accommodation a lot cheaper if you\u2019re not bothered about the view. A word of warning about the taxis - be on your guard! We were taken for a ride (sorry for the pun) and were charged 28 euros for a 1.5km ride (the clock said 26).

I was staying at the hotel at the same time as Jovik below, so I can vouch for the fact the the manager Andrea Arte is SO RUDE it is beyond belief that he is working in the Customer Service Industry let alone on the front desk of a Hotel. Let me start by saying if you want to be on the doorstep of the Trevi Fountain you will find this hotel is right there. Be warned it is noisy all night and early morning with tourists and vendors setting up their stalls and also the fountain is cleaned each morning, so request a room at the back.Upon arrival I was given the key and went to check out the room as I knew my friend(who I was sharing with) had requested a room with a view. Fair enough the room was on the 1st floor with a view but NO SHOWER, I went down to reception to be told \"if you want a shower in your bathroom you must request that at the time of booking\".Where in the world would you have to request a shower in your bathroom, so my friend and I battled with a hand-held shower attachment....not easy for the slimmest of people! Now I was present at the breakfast incident. The waitress, well she wasn't really that as she couldn't even manage a smile let alone clear away the tables. My friend and I and an Iranian lady cleared the tables ourselves. The Iranian lady called the Manager to try and explain the lack of service at breakfast, he hung up on her....shows the level of service. He eventually arrived up at the breakfast room to shout to people \"why can't you all wait for 10mins for you food\". This was shocking, the guests were in the hands of the staff, the food was average, croissants and pastries are bought in tins from shops, and then cooked on site so they are like bricks when they come out of the oven. No fresh fruit apart from Prunes, all in all a poor choice. My friend had a guest come over to see her at the hotel and she ordered a cup of tea and mineral water, this came to 6Euros...outrageous! Also just to top things off I had a hole in my duvet cover and no mattress protector on the beds....could do better! Please do not use this hotel as it will certainly spoil your holiday.

As a hotelier myself and a well-travelled snob (for lack of a better term) I prefer to stay in delux 4* or 5* properties and I will be the first to admit that at first glance, this hotel does not fall into those categories...HOWEVER, I refuse to stay anywhere else when I travel to Rome. Yes the hotel only has 25 small and somewhat odd shaped rooms, and yes maybe you have to stand sideways in the tub because its not wide enough for your feet, and maybe the lobby doesn't display the glam factor of the Bellagio. Its true you're not going to find Molton Brown in the bathroom or Frette on the beds, and there is no iron/board or mini-bar in the room (but there are flat screens and SKY at least in our Superior room there was) but what the hotel lacks in glitz it more than makes up for in romance. Orginally built as a monestary, the preservation of the building allows the history to seep through, wrapping you in the warmth that is displayed not only the city, but by the staff (especially Issac) The view from the rooftop overlooking is breathtaking and probably my favorite room so I might ask to rent that part of the hotel during my next visit! I opted for a fountain side room this time and with the windows closed and air con on we only heard the peaceful flow of the fountain...it wasn't noisy or obtrusive as described in other reviews (and I'm a light sleeper) and we stayed Fri-Sun so there were plenty of people around at all hours.

However, upon check-in we discovered that the view was blocked by a giant billboard that was attached to the maintenance scaffolding. The billboard had an advertisement for a car. The hotel must be making money of that billboard. It was not mentioned in their or Expedia website that there was a billboard obstructing the view of the fountain. When asked about relocation to other rooms with a view, the front desk refused. They also refused to adjust rate to ordinary double room rate which is 20 euros less. We are very disappointed with the deception and rip-off. There is no hanger for bathroom tissue, and commode does not hold enough water resulting in the stuff being stuck on the walls of commode. It had to flushed several times and brushed off with commode brush. To make it worse, the commode takes several minutes to fill between each flush. At the time of checkout, the front desk manager insisted that we pay cash to pay the city taxes (which came to 32 euros). We did not have case, and we wanted pay by credit card. He then gives a form to fill out stating that we refuse to pay the city tax. When we refuse to sign that form, he calls police to scare us. Police tell us that we can pay by credit card. We then paid by credit card. Police also told us that, if we did not pay, the form will be given to the police, and they can cofiscate our passports and we have to pay the double the amount as penalty. Overall, this is not a good hotel to stay, very small and cramped, lousy bathroom, and no good service or view. Expedia related: Expedia customer service contact number does not have a clear choice for complaints. The English of the agents was hard to follow. They did not follow up and call the hotel with my complaint. They only would attempt to call hotel during our call. So, we had to make several calls, and finally had to get up in the morning to make sure they call the hotel during the hotels working hours. They finally said that the hotel refused to accept responsibility. We expected Expedia, with its clout and size, would be able to make the hotel change their web page information, and to get them to offer a reasonable compensation for misleading us and not providing us what they promised.

The Fontana di Trevi (Trevi Fountain) is directly outside the entrance. If you don't like crowds - stay away as hourds of tourists stand infront of the fountain at all hours of the day. I love the Trevi Fountain and found staying here - incredibly romatic. The location to every site in Rome i easy to access from this central point by foot. The highlight washaving a gelati at night, seeingt the fountain and having an array of fabulous restaurants simply outside your front door. Great shopping is just around th corner also. All my fabourites, including Massimo Dutti which has the best mens and womens collections for relaxed but sophisticated day wear. The hotel is nothing extraordinary - rather on the simple side. The rooms verge on small - but this is Rome. They are clean and neat. The breakfast room truly overlooks the Trevi Fountain and this is where you will get your best photo. You simply cannot get the whole fountain in the frame, from street level. This hotel is good value for Rome, excellent location - in close proximity to all my favourite piazza's or squares.

The first thing to say would be whatever you do, DO NOT get a taxi to this hotel - it is situated in a pedestrian area and it took forever to get through the crowds. The taxi cost us a whopping 100 euros, but on the way back we got the nearby subway to the central train station and from there got a clean, efficient, comfortable train to the airport: it took us about an hour and cost approximately 30 euros in total for the two of us! Anyway, on to the hotel itself. The location is something of a mixed blessing; yes, the fountain (literally right outside the door) is beautiful but the crowds and noise it attracts would've been unbearable if our room was at the front of the hotel. As it turned out, we were dissappointed to find our room was at the back of the hotel, overlooking some offices. It was, however, relatively peaceful. Peaceful and comparable in size to a shoebox! We immideately asked to be moved, but were told politely that this wouldn't be possible as the hotel was full - you could definitely tell that they were used to dealing with this kind of request! And so we remained in the shoebox. It comprised of a hallway with an antique (or just old?!) wardrobe and a small side table. The bed was down a step and was pushed against the wall, with a small nightstand wedged in the non-wall side. There was about a foot of space between the end of the bed and the wall, and a small portable TV. The bathroom, comprising sink/bidet/toilet/shower and a window, was concealed behind a sliding mirror. Now, I know what you're thinking: this sounds like hell. But to be perfectly honest, there's so much to see and do in Rome that we were barely there. Bizarrely, if we'd had a better room it would've gone to waste! When we were in the room, the tiny proportions of the bed were actually quite romantic - we were forced to cuddle up to fit in it! So ironically enough, this turned out to be a perfect place to stay in Rome. The only disappointment turned out to be the 'roof terrace'. It was disappointing because there is no roof terrace! There's a breakfast area with horrid perspex windows where two tables look out onto the fountain, but to be honest it seemed pretty pointless when you can go and see the fountain in approximately 15 seconds just by leaving the hotel.

The hotel and rooms may be small (space is a premium in cities like Rome) but the place is spotless and the staff are friendly and helpful (we got very detailed instructions on where to buy tickets for football and then find the Stadio Olimipco via foot, Metro and buses from reception). With cities such as Rome where there's so much to see and do, all you're really doing is showering and sleeping in your room and the Fontana is better than most city centres hotels I've stayed in. Undoubtedly, the best thing about the hotel is it's fairly central location as everything is walkable from it (Rome is a fairly compact city). Our room was on the third floor with a Trevi Fountain view which was just breathtaking. It was noisy with the window open due to the constant crowds outside (even at 11pm in Oct it was packed outside), but there was aircon in our room so no need to have the window open other than to take in the view and crowds. With the window closed, all we could hear was the fountain but I'm not so sure about rooms on lower floors and whether you'd hear the crowds. The were two downsides to our room but these were fairly minor to us. Our 3rd floor room was below the breakfast room so from around 7/8am we could just make out chairs scraping across the floor. There was also a large sliding connecting door to the next room which literally took up a third of the wallspace; this did mean that we could hear our neighbours loud and clear (nothing that banging on the wall didn't sort out!). Breakfast on the top floor was delicious with a good range of cereals, breads, fruits, meats and so on. The 2 ladies serving breakfast were lovely. From our observations, generally if you make an effort to smile and say hello in the local language, which isn't hard, your efforts will be rewarded. Please be aware of pick-pockets in Rome. I'd been warned by relatives that had purses stolen at a Metro station a few years ago, so was extra vigilent with an over the body zipped up bag, but still almost got mine pinched at The Forum (zip open and hand hovering over purse).

One of the primary advantages of this hotel was location, location, location. Fontanta is RIGHT in front of the gorgeous Trevi fountain, easy to walk to major sites in Rome, easy to find, etc. We liked the top floor terrace where breakfast was served. It overlooked the fountain and was very nice in the morning, and in the evenings we would take a bottle of wine up there before going out. The breakfast was good for us: hard boiled eggs, olives, yummy fresh baked pastries, tomatoes, cereal, juice, fruit, cheese. The ladies were friendly and accommodating. I would say our room was adequate. It was located just over the entrance facing the fountain--fantastic sight! However the din of the ever present people visiting the fountain is quite loud and the lights are very bright. We had to close the windows and drapes every night and turn on the fans in the room and even then we could still hear occasional drunks jumping into the fountain, getting arrested, etc. At times that was entertaining, at other times it was exhausting. If it had been a hot night (no a/c) and needed to open the window it would have been a major problem. The furnishings in our room were minimal and \"antiquey\"--meaning they were not really useable. We couldn't use the built in closet because the door would not close unless it was locked with an old key and the key would not easily unlock the closet so we just gave up. The other piece in the room was a large...uh antique something...with drawers. Too cumbersome to be useful! Our bathroom was small but clean and modern. Shower and plumbing were good. Our friends were given a microscopic room on the top floor--couldn't even fit 2 night stands in it. Actually it was a prison cell with small windows across the top. They arrived late and were too tired to complain until the next day. If it had been me I think I would have considered not paying, it was that bad. Anyway, they got moved the next day (\"no problem\") but it soured our first impression of the place because our friends were so uncomfortable. Frankly I think the staff was worn out from the season by the time we got there. They always started their conversation with a smile but seemed to shut down mid-sentence. It seemed to me that there was a level of irritation towards the guests. Perhaps this is due to the location of the hotel. If you are standing at the front desk there are always fountain visitors stopping in, asking questions (where's the nearest bathroom, looking to exchange money which they do as a service) so that it is difficult to have an uninterrupted conversation with the front desk person. Our luggage was lost by the airlines but was located fairly quickly. We knew where it was but needed help communicating with the airline transport to bring it out to us. Each morning and afternoon we asked for help to make a follow up call (this went on for 2 days) we were met with a level of annoyance. My sense was they would go through the motions of trying to make a call but that was it--not their problem. And it wasn't. But it was frustrating because we had no other recourse, we did not speak italian. If you like to lock your room and keep the key this is a problem as well. They got angry if you take your key with you, they want you to leave it at the front desk. If you forget or don't there is a key showdown. My husband took the key and I came back early. We had the key showdown and the front desk person scowled at me as if I were very, very bad. Wow, back to elementary school. So then time is take out to call the \"helper\" (Big Sigh and Major Glare) to come down from wherever, walk me to my room , unlock the door, glare at me, then leave. This is not what I want to experience when I am on vacation.

We stayed in room 206 which directly overlooks the Trevi Fountain. The view from the window is truly awesome, you almost feel you are in the fountain, the atmosphere and the noise of the fountain is mesmerising. Having said that, we were able to sleep soundly with the window closed to dampen the noise, as there was a ceiling fan in the room it felt quite cool. The room itself wasn't large but certainly adequate and nicely furnished with a monster bed, fine for a 5 day stay and the bathroom was fine with a powerful shower and bath to rest your weary bones from all the walking! The front desk staff were polite and friendly and the 2 ladies serving tea and coffee at breakfast were helpful and welcoming. The breakfast itself was varied and plentiful although the water for tea and coffee was never very hot, which seemed to be the fashion everywhere we went! The hotel is in a great location for most major sights and we walked to the Pantheon, the Vatican, the Forum and Colesseum the Palantine hill and many other areas each day. It is also right in the middle of a great area for restaurants and shops. We tended to come back to the hotel for a rest most days at about 5pm before venturing out for dinner and although the area around the Trevi Fountain was always packed solid with people, we usually managed to sleep for an hour despite the busy location. We would recommend the hotel unreservedly to anyone who enjoys staying somewhere with character and charm. One thing to watch is that we asked reception to book us a taxi to Campiano airport on the 10th and they told us it would be 65 euros. They had forgotten to do this as we checked out so they rang for a taxi for us which cost just 31euros!

I had originally read about the hotel in a book about charming small hotels. After reading all the negative reviews, I almost cancelled. I am glad that I didn't, because our night at the hotel was a wonderful way to end our vacation. For those expecting the Hoilday Inn, this hotel is not for you. If you are interested in a small and intimate place with lovely marble staircases, quirky hallways and charming antiques, this is the place for you. Our room was on the third floor and overlooked the Trevi Fountain. We could open our window and experience the beauty of the fountain (day and night) without the crowds. Our room was bright, simple and elegantly furnished with antiques. During our vacation in Italy, we stayed at three hotels in Rome. Our room at the Hotel Fontana was small, yet it was not the smallest room we had stayed in. The high ceiling made the room feel larger. We had ample space for our belongings and could walk about the room comfortably. The bathroom was small yet workable for the two of us. The towels and toiletries were lovely. We never ran out of hot water. The air conditioning in our room worked very well. The hotel staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. They helped us make phone calls within Italy and abroad, arranged for a private driver to take us to the airport, gave us a map of Rome and helped with directions to places that we wanted to see. The cleaning staff all smiled and said buongiorno to us when we passed in the hall. My husband and I both found the breakfast woman very friendly. I did speak Italian to her, while my husband spoke English. I agree with a fellow reviewer that the breakfast woman probably only speaks Italian and therefore can come across as unfriendly. The breakfast spread consisted of pastries, croissants, cold meats, cheese, cereal, juices and hard boiled eggs. The hotel had a toaster (!) so I could have toast for breakfast. This may seem like a trivial thing, but of the approximately 11 hotels we stayed in during our Italian vacation, only three had toasters. The area around the fountain is crowded from approximately 9:00 a.m. to well into the wee hours of the morning. With our window closed, the only sound we could hear was the sound of the fountain. This did not disturb us at all. The location is excellent and we were able to walk to the Pantheon, Colosseum and the Bocca de la Verita (mouth of truth). When we checked into the hotel, we were each given a tiny envelope with a coin in it. This was a coin to throw into the fountain to ensure that we would return to Rome one day. On our last morning in Rome (before heading out to the airport) we woke up early and went to the fountain. It was 7:00 a.m. and we had the whole piazza and fountain to ourselves! How many people can say that? The only people we saw walking through were Romans on their way to work. We threw our coins in and hope to return to Rome and the beautiful Hotel Fontana again one day.

Like several other reviewers, I chose this hotel based on its wonderful location. Little did I know that it would turn out to be such a charming hotel! For those who like the chain hotels that consist of 100 or more rooms, this little boutique hotel is not for you. However, for the more discriminating traveler, one who appreciates the unconventional, you are in luck! Unfortunately, the pictures on the Hotel Fontana's website do not do the hotel justice. We stayed in Room 203. Yes, it was extremely small, but very quaint. Our friends stayed in Room 202 and their room was much bigger and had a lovely bathroom which was adequately sized for two adults. My mother and niece stayed in Room 305 and it was a dream! It had two double beds, lovely antique furniture, and the bathroom was down some winding steps and had a tub and shower. They were in heaven! What I appreciated about all three rooms was the antique furniture, the cleanliness, the fresh fruit and water every day, and the luxurious feel of the towels, toiletries, and decor. The hallways on each floor was tastefully decorated. The elevator worked fine. The breakfast was fairly large and included toast, juice, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, a couple of breakfast cakes, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, and a few other items. The lady serving us was not the most friendly person, however, I attributed that to the fact that her English was not very good and so she was limited in what she could say. We were polite and she was too. We NEVER ran out of hot water. The hotel staff was friendly, Isaac and Foster in particular, were EXTREMELY delightful persons. The hotel's location is unbeatable! It is a 10 minute walk to the Spanish Steps, the Piazza Navona, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, and the list goes on and on. It is VERY centrally located. The hotel is old, in fact, it was around even before the Trevi Fountain was built. It used to be a convent. Upon finding out those tidbits of information, I was even more happy with our choice of booking with the antiquated Hotel Fontana. If I had to complain about something, my only complaint would probably have to be the air conditioner in our room didn't blow out absolute cold air. However, we were in Italy when there was a heat wave going on across Europe, so I'm sure that may have affected things some.
