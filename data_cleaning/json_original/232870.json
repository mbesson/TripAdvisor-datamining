Firstly the hotel is not in the best of areas, and the building isnt just fior this hotel, there are others attached to it. The staff, as is typical with Italians, were not very pleasant. They were never openly rude, however i dont think they know how to smile, or even went out there way to be friendly. The one and only real plus point is it is located 5 mins away from the main termini, which is very handy for getting about to all the various sights and locations, however be advised no matter what time we seemed to go the metro was always busy. Breakfast in the hotel consists of cereal (corn flakes or coc pops) a roll, selection of pastries and 2 slices of toast ........ in a packet. And again to demonstrate the staff, every morning i had to ask for something, a bowl, spoons, a cup for juice (which you will also have to use to store milk for your tea as they dont offer it for you). It is a small dining area, which also doubles up as a bar...... however its closed untill someone asks to have a drink there. Hotel offers wifi, but only in a small room on across from reception. Our room, seemed more like an old office, high ceilings with that sort of sqaure pollystyrene you find, and the bathroom was a small box in one corner. It was concrete floors, which helped in making the room cold to stay in, no heating, and the air con was switched off the whole time. It basically was a tired and worn looking room (corners dirty and peeling, hole in the main door, bath stained, bathroom smelt), also the bathroom isnt well laid out, expect to have the sink in your face whilst using the toilet. Sleep quality wasnt the best, as apsart from having the one wafer thin pillow, there was also the fact there was a dip in one side of the bed, and each morning you were woken up to the sound of cars, shouting from outside and sirens. The other thing was there was nothing in the area for going to at night, a few restaraunts in surroundings streets, but not like somewhere you can go for a drink unless you went up to the main termini area, but its not a walk where you can stroll and enjoy the ambience of the area, simply walking up with lots of tall buildings and the odd occasional passer by. There was no dinning on offer within the hotel. There is a telly in the room, however unless you speak italian there is no point having it switched on. Overall unless your happy with just having a bed for the night then this is fine, if your looking for more to a break with something to do at night, i wouldnt recomend here. Rome Is a fantastic sightseeing city, but for us the hotel brought the overall experience down", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whangerei", "Title": "\u201cFine but small rooms\u201d", "Author": "kiwistroller", "ReviewID": "UR126110109", "Content": "I cannot say I enjoyed my stay here, but it was good enough for what we needed. This hotel is the first I have stayed in where the wall area of each wall was bigger than the floor area. Not really a problem for my wife and I as we spent most of our time out of the hotel. This was made easy as the hotel is well placed and is a 5 min walk from Termini with the train, tube and bus links. We even managed to walk from the airport bus stop at Termini to the hotel with our 20 kg suitcases. Breakfasts are good here, in the european continental style. Good rolls, cake, satisfactory fruit and yoghurt, tea as good as in most small european hotels - I should really start drinking coffee though. Reception staff are the usual Roman offhand (its a culture thing), but once you get over that are helpful with maps and guides, willing to put up with our school-standard Italian and happy to book our taxi to the airport. Only snag was the unexpected \"tourist tax\", which was sprung on us as we left. A bit of warning might have been useful as we tend to budget our currency pretty tightly. Back to the room. We were on the 3rd floor in a standard room. It was quiet, warm, had a poor outlook but we did not mind, bed was comfortable enough, but so small, partially due to the en-suite being inserted. We found turning around in this en-suite tricky. But the shower was ok, the bath was not full length but could have been usable if we had wanted to. Incidently, the internet PC did not work but there was wireless in the hotel. I would check it just in case. So overall, a modest hotel, good as a base to sleep in and have breakfast, but if you expect more you may be disappointed.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ostersund, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cHotel ok\u201d", "Author": "flyga", "ReviewID": "UR125920434", "Content": "If you have moderat expectations this hotel is ok.

Cleaning in the corridors could be improved and more lights could be provided. The worst part however was that though we inadvertently arrived in Rome on the day of protest (15th Oct.), no one at the hotel or elsewhere bothered to tell us about it and we ended up at Colloseum with an infant in a stroller in the middle of the unending protest March with noisy,rancourous and sometime violent marchers when we could have gone somewhere else! What were they protesting for anyway with liqour in their hands and ciggerettes in mouths - the end of their easy carefree life?!?

The shower in my room stank of sewers but was generally OK by morning and the smell didn't pervade the room if the door was shut. If I turned the shower head upside down, the pressure was so low the water nearly stopped coming out and the water temperature was warm at best but no problem really. The 5th floor room was run down but clean and OK to crash. I've been in better in Guatemala for less than a dollar a night. Not a place for romance. Wi-fi was free for guests (in lobby only) and the breakfasts were plentiful and fine. But.....That Roman attitude? Why do they do that? Nearly forgot... the room was incredibly noisy despite my request for a quiet room.

I wanted a place to stay close to Termini Station having stayed in Rome before. I was going to take several side trips outside of Rome so I wanted to have quick and easy access to the station. This was the first time I took the Leonardo Express train from the airport into the city. Getting off the train was a bit disorienting since the platform is a bit removed from the heart of the station. If you keep moving inside of the station and walk in the direction of the lower numbered tracks you are walking in the right direction. Exit the station on side that runs parallel to track 1 and you will be good to go. the Cambridge is about 4 blocks away--about a 5 minute walk. Check in was smooth and easy--there is a small lift to get you and your luggage to your room. My room would have been reasonably comfortable for 2 people. The room was small but clean. The bed was firm and comfortable. Most reasonably priced rooms in Rome are this size. If you are there on holiday, if you spend more thatn one waking hour in your hotel room you are missing out!!! I stayed in a room on the level above reception, it was very quiet. Since the building is old and solidly built, I heard no traffic noise and very little hallway noise. The shower was piping hot. Be careful stepping down out of the shower. Use the shower mat because with wet feet on tile, the floor can be slippery. There is a small refrigerator in the room. Rooms are very secure since you need a key to at least enter the hallway on the level above reception and then a key to enter your room. The hallways are monitored 24 hours a day by reception. The breakfast is simple but nicely served. There is coffee, juice, yogurt, pastries, breakfast rolls, cereal, cheese, fruit, butter, and jelly. A few tips about staying in this area--try some of the small cafes located all around the hotel. If you are on a budget--shop at the Despar market at the Termini Station for food. Bottled water there is about 40 cents for 1.5 liters. I even bought a bottle of Despar brand red table wine for under 1 euro. It was actually drinkable!

It barely worked but was not to bad at night as we also left the window open. The bathroom was large and had a marble floor. The shower in the tub had no curtain or rod for one so you had to be careful upon getting out. There were lots of restaurants in the area and it was easy when we took the train to Civitavecchia. There was a small elevator that can be described as triple phone booth.

It's not. At best it is a 2 star hotel so please compare this hotel against other 2 star hotels. The service provided was fine - they provided new towels each day and the room looked like it was clean. There are mainly 4 issues that I found with this hotel. The 1st is the inflated rating as noted earlier. It really belong with 2 star hotels. The 2nd is that they advertise that they have an elevator and air conditioning. But the air conditioner barely works. Air came out of it but it felt more like a fan on low setting. It was so hot and the only thing you can do is take a shower and hope it cools you down. Also there is an elevator but there are several steps that you have to climb first to get to the elevator so this is not the place for those that are disabled or anyone that needs an elevator. The 3rd is the condition of the hotel. Other reviews had mentioned how the hotel looks old and the furnishings are old which is true. However if you're looking for a bargain I think that is to be expected but what I didn't expect was how poor the room was in. I posted some pictures to show what I mean. The 4th is the location of the hotel. It is located in a building with at least 2 or 3 other hotels. The check-in office for the Cambridge hotel is located on the ground floor but I don't even know how the staff there can tell who is a hotel guest or not since anyone that comes in might be going up to another hotel. So essentially any stranger can walk in and not be questioned. I would not recommend this hotel even for someone that is on a budget. Rome is a great city with many things to see. However i found myself in a situation where I would be exhausted from walking around Rome and I didn't even want to go back to my hotel room.

The place looked kind of thread-worn but I expected that being near Termini. It was close enough top walk to from Termini. Even though we only stayed here one night, they managed to over-bill us, charging my credit card for 2 nights. Hopefully my bank will straighten this out.

I think there must be another part of the hotel which is ok because otherwise I can't believe anyone would write a good review of it. The only good points were that the hotel is in a quiet central location and it was kept as clean as possible, with the beds made and fresh towels provided on the second day. However the room was shabby and reminded me of cheap hotels in North Africa. (the only difference being that it would not cost 100 euro a night in Tunisia or Egypt). There was no way that this was a 3 star hotel and I realised that I had been naive in believing the star rating). The toilet was shared, which would have been fine if they had not been in two smelly cubicles which were shared with showers. The staff were reasonably polite but clearly bored and incompetent and were unable to provide hot water, despite my partner's constant phone calls to the reception to tell them that the shower was cold. We were constantly told that we should \"wait ten minutes\" while people went up step ladders to fiddle with the water tank, but only we only managed to have one shower each in lukewarm water over the course of our two-day stay. We came home in need of a proper wash, which is unacceptable considering the price we paid. Finally, the radiator in the room did not work. Overall, I was shocked at the quality of this hotel for the price, even considering the time of year (which meant that we couldn't go elsewhere). There is a big difference between a basic hotel (such as the ETAP chain where I stayed in Paris the previous year for half the price) and a squalid one!", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cnoisy rooms\u201d", "Author": "Minhao", "ReviewID": "UR10037890", "Content": "It's a 2 star hotel first of all!
