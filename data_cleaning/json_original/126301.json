Here are a few things that we dealt with during our one week stay. 1) Elevator up to room sounded like it was going to explode the day we arrived, used stairs the rest of the week (see last comment) 2) Roll away for son was a sleeping bowl with mattress. Sent it back and waited 2 hours for a new one. Maid shows up with roll away with no pillows, sheets, blankets. Wait another hour for bedding. 3) 2 burnt out lites in room 4) toilet will not flush 5) bathroom door will not close 6) holes in walls 7) tv wouldnt stay on or would come on by itself and change channels when it deemed appropriate 8) daily charge for phone use, did not notice this until getting into the room. No matter if you use the phone or not. BS 9) take a shower before 10am or no hot water 10) last day of stay, we had no hot water 11) last night of stay, someone got stuck in bad elevator. Parking for this hotel is horrible since there is only one way in and one way out. They have limited the access to the parking lot because of the water park next door. In this case, because the fire trucks were there to rescue the person in the elevator, the trucks blocked the only way in and out of the hotel. We had to park in the front parking for Shoneys. If you can afford an extra $10 a nite, sleep somewhere else.

There is much to tell but I will attempt to be short. Beginning assumptions: We expected this place to be a clean room for us to sleep in at night - nothing more - as we were obviously not expecting a 5 star resort in a 2 star hotel. Checking in: We waited for 1 hour in the lobby while the one receptionist was trying to put us into our room. The receptionist told us that the hotel had overbooked. After visiting the public washroom in the lobby, I sincerely hoped that they would move us to another hotel. Unfortunately, no such luck. Eventually at midnight, the receptionist \"found\" a room and away we went. The elevators: Don't look at the spalling plastic and hold your breath. Otherwise your lungs will suffer from the wonderful aroma of mold and urine. (The floor of the elevator is carpeted) The first room: As we entered the room, we were overcome by the stench of mold and mildew. The smell was so overpowering, and I being allergic to mold and mildew, there was no way we could stand it. My husband went back to the reception area. Of course there were no rooms, apparently no rooms in any of the other Orlando hotels, which meant no transfer. It turned out that our only option was to get an uncleaned room. The cleaning staff: Work only from 8am until sometime in the early afternoon. They are not available in the evenings or nights. The second room: This room, even though not cleaned from the previous resident, smelled normal. From the comments that we read previously on this website, I think this room must have been in the newer wing. Since the stench from the previous room had been so bad, we felt glad to have finally a place. We couldn't flush the toilet and called the reception. They sent a guy to plunge the toilet. He left the plunger... The cleaning job: Don't expect the cleaning staff to vacuum the room. It was never vacuumed after the previous resident and was never vacuumed during our entire stay despite many phone calls and visits to the reception. We didn't ever get any more toilet paper, tissue paper, soap, coffee, or cups. We had to pick these up at the front desk when we came home every night. The toilet: The toilet would half-flush if you went for a #1 and no toilet paper. It would get completely blocked and overflow if you needed to go for a #2 or if you wished to use any amount of toilet paper. We called in to the reception again to \"fix\" our toilet. The guy came again and plunged it. He then went on to explain that this was normal as they fitted newer and smaller water tanks to the toilets (thus less water to flush with) and that the blockage somewhere in the pipes would have to be removed once we were gone. \"You'll just have to live with it for the week\" he told us. We used our toilet as sparingly as we could from then on and mastered the art of toilet plunging. I included a photo of my dear husband during one of the many toilet plunges. The cockroaches: Oh Yes! We had 'em by the dozens! We discovered this treat while we were eating back in our room. Everywhere. Crawling around the fridge, peeking out from around the TV, on the floor eating last month's leftovers... Being from Canada, I have never seen a cockroach before, but my savvy husband being originally from a tropical country, knew right as soon he saw them. They can jump, fly short distances and are quick as lightening. You have to be very careful about these little monsters as they can spread nasty stuff if they get into your food. Since I'm pregnant, and justly worried about toxoplasmosis that these little critters can spread, we called in to get another room, hoping that one would become available. No luck - we were offered the same moldy room in the old wing again. I figured I would take my chances of getting a disease rather than getting a fatal allergy attack. We did get a couple of pictures of these guys before they suffered an untimely death. One is crawling on the fridge lip and the other is right by the TV. The pool: Smaller than it looks in the pictures. You will enjoy floaties of many different origins. As this is a cheap hotel, there are obviously going to be many families. So just expect to get spashed by kids at any time of the day. The \"breakfast\": I think they now have a little more honest description on their website. They had apples, small cheap granola bars and \"coffee\" with milk-free creamers when we were there at 6:30am when the \"breakfast\" started. Don't expect it to be a breakfast.

The suite included a living room, a very small kitchen and 3 t.v's. In the bedroom there is a king sized bed and in the little kids parlor there is two twin bunk beds which were a lot bigger than I thought. We previously stayed here in 2000 and had a standard room which was nice. The only thing the suite did not have was an eating table. The standard rooms usually come with a table for two to four people. This suite didn't come with a table for you to sit down and have breakfast or a quick meal of some kind.

We drove 6 miles to the next hotel to discover that they would not accept the letter plus they only had smoking rooms, unacceptable for us since we were traveling with our baby daughter. We went back to the Park Inn and after 15 minutes or so it turned our that they had rooms available, they were reserved for some police members staying there helping on Hurricane Charley matters. The rooms were RESERVED but nobody had claimed the reservations therefore they were AVAILABLE to be used. We got to the room which had a hideous smell of cigarette smoke and mold. And to top things off, there was a cricket chirping through the night, it sounded as being inside the room right next to the A/C unit.

I personally stayed at the Park Inn (formerly the Larson Inn) three times over the last 6 years and have a radically different opinion of the facilities and it's staff. First off you have to understand that this is a TWO star hotel...so if you expect to pay for a TWO star and receive FIVE star service and amenities then you're setting yourself up for a fall. For what it is, the Park Inn is a decent no-frills place to stay for couples or families who have their feet on the ground. Prior to my arrival I emailed the hotel on both occasions and made my \"requests\" for a non-smoking room facing the pool on any floor. Simple request really but one that was messed up last year by the staff at the Quality Inn on International Drive. In both instances the room I requested was ready for me when I arrived for check-in. The front desk greeter was of the spanish persuasion and her English a little broken, but nothing that an anglophone Canadian couldn't comprehend. She was very personable, helpful and polite. Our room was very clean when we opened the door, however I noticed that the sink-stopper in the bathroom was not functioning properly. 15 minutes after informing the front desk, a very friendly maintenance man arrived at our door and resolved the problem in about 5 minutes. On our second days stay (of 7) the cleaning staff failed to give us enough towels and flannels for the evening. After a quick phone complaint, when we returned the following day from a Disney all-nighter there were enough towels in the bathroom for at least 2 days and they were replenished this way for the duration of our stay. The pool area and jacuzzi are moderate in size but situated perfectly between the two towers of the hotel complex. The pool area is kept very clean, and the jacuzzi was comfortable and terrific. Pool staff were always willing to turn a blind eye (at a polite request) to extending the hours of the pool for a little while longer which was nice when you returned so late from the parks. If you're not into a short walk to the front desk you might be put off by the distance from the back building...however I enjoyed a morning walk to the front desk. The property is well maintained and the layout is okay. I would repaint the metal supports of the canopy leading from the hotel area to the lobby as the peeling rust paint could be a put off for some people. Each room is equipped with a wall safe, coffee maker (first replenishment free, you have to buy more at the gift shop if you want it), and a small bar-fridge and microwave. Rooms are actually cleaned daily (again no horror stories for us) and all requests were met with understanding and efficiency. The carpets and bedclothes are a little dated in style but I experienced no horror-story problems with cleanliness of the sheets and did not feel compeled to \"sleep in my car\" like some of the previous reviewers. If there is anything to complain about at this hotel it's some of the people who stay there. On our first trip there were no problems at all with other vacationers, however on the second trip we had a 10 - 15 person family in about 3 ajoining rooms staying beside us for about 3 nights who were right out of the cast of \"deliverance\" or the infield of a NASCAR race. Loud music, people hanging their laundry (not just a few towels) on the balcony, moving upholstered chairs into the walkways and the sound of beer cans being popped open until the late hours. I was compeled to say something but I'm sure there were shotguns in the Budweiser filled pickup in the parking lot so I remained silent. There was also a VERY large bodied man who chose to wear a VERY small tiger-striped speedo in the jacuzzi and pool for a few days, but beyond scaring a few small children this was more a laugh than anything else. The hotel is perfectly situated at the corner of Hwy 192 & Hwy 4 less than 10 minutes to Disneyworld and about 20 minutes from Universal. A continental breakfast is supplied daily, but you have to be up with the fishermen to get something, as after 9am most everything is gone, however coffee and juices are usually there. A Shoney's restaurant is built into the front of the hotel however the prices were a little high compared with Denny's or Ponderosa so we chose to drive down Hwy 192 for eats. Hwy 192 in Kissimee is a neverending (almost) strip of hotels and restaurants to match any tastes...do yourself a favour and pick up quite a few of the \"tourist\" newsletters, maps and magazines...these are loaded with coupons for almost every small attraction of food place in Orlando/Kissimee...If you're a race fan check out Race Rock on International drive...amazing place and good food too! Watermania (family sized waterpark) is literally right across the road from the hotel and our package included free 7 days access although we never took advantage of it as we were too busy elsewhere, however this would be a treat for those with children...check your tour operator for availability. If you're planning on doing Disney and any of the other parks for the majority of your vacation then this is a perfectly safe, convenient and clean place to \"sleep\" overnight and for a few nice mornings or evenings in the pool. If you want (expect) more than the basics though, pay the extra and stay elsewhere...choose your hotel to match your expectations rather than your budget and you'll be much happier with your vacation.
