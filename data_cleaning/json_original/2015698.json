The rooms are small but well-appointed and ours had a wee terrace out the back. Nice and modern. No food available apart from breakfast (which could have been better, the coffee was HORRIBLE!) and we were travelling with a baby and needed some hot water for the formula and they told us we would have to go next door and ask the Pizzaria for water.

LOCATION The location is prime, facing the Roman forum and a stone throw from the Coliseum. This means that one can easily walk to the main sites, 20 mn to Navona, Trevi, Pantheon \u2026. The area is very lively with plenty of bars restaurants and convenience shops. We were running the marathon and it is 50m from the finish line which was a lifesaver after the race HOTEL The hotel itself is contemporary with a minimalist design. The 20 or so rooms are spread out in a main building and in several small buildings in a series of interconnecting courtyards. There is a lovely garden complete with table and chairs for drinks. There is also an upstairs and very sunny terrace accessible from the metal stairs in the garden. Because it is a little hidden, it is always empty. The receptionist was very helpful directing us to the marathon village and providing all sort of information during our stay. ROOMS As others have mentioned, the rooms are small and there is a real issue with the shower as water will spill out everywhere which is quite annoying when you shower in the evening and need again to use the bathroom before the next cleaning We had room 504 in the garden and it was perfect, all done in white, very comfortable bed, flat screen TV, modern lighting, a separate area for the storage and safe. There are no shelves in the bathroom and this is annoying as you cannot fit more than your toothbrush on the sink. Therefore the amenities are spread out in the storage area. There are plentiful and replenished daily. Plenty of towels on the heated rack including cloths for the bidet. There is a rain shower and a handheld unit. Pressure is adequate Slippers are provided . The room was very quiet BREAKFAST It is on the roof terrace of the Richmond hotel (inside access via a series of steps or elevators) It is simple and you have to pay 2,5 euros for a freshly squeezed orange juice We booked this room for 60 euros inc breakfast on octopus.com thus an excellent value for money !", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "portugal", "Title": "\u201c4 days trip to rome\u201d", "Author": "PortugalAllison", "ReviewID": "UR125027259", "Content": "This hotel is just 8-10 min walk from the coliseum metro station and has a great location if your purpose of travelling to rome is sightseeing... you can walk everywhere... the hotel is brand new.. clean, cosy and modern. the staff is amazingly nice and breakfast is included...", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki", "Title": "\u201cBest location ever\u201d", "Author": "FlyingRussian", "ReviewID": "UR124951803", "Content": "If You want go out of lobby and see all in antique Rome, be in 15 minutes walk-distance from everywhere, receive latest information from extremely friendly reception ( thank You, Fabio ! ) and sleep in very quite room, after having relaxing bath ( bathroom is probably bigger than usually in Rome ) - this hotel is for You.
