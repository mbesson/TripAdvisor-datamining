At the time there was no aircon in the rooms, lobby or anywhere else in the hotel. The windows can only open very small, so the hotel rooms felt like an oven. When you do open the windows to get a tiny little bit of air in, it also sets off the next problem - noise! The back side of the hotel is next to a railway station, so braking trains screeching sounds until 23:00 every night and from early morning. So I asked to move my room to a street facing room - here it was even worse because the noise from the cars get reflected between the buildings, and their noise keeps going long after 23:00, so the train side was actually better. The room was also very scarce, but had the basics you would expect. Service was ok, but please stay away from the restaurant at all costs where they serve you microwave dinners and charge crazy prices. The location is very good and close to tube stations.

I have stayed in various Travelodges previously and, generally speaking, you get what you pay for - no-frills, budget accommodation. I frequently stay in the Travelodge at Southwark and couldn't really complain about it. However this was my first (and hopefully only) ever stay at the Travelodge at London Bridge. I checked in quite late on a Tuesday evening after a vey long and tiring day. At reception they wouldn't give me a breakfast voucher, even though I had an email printout from a booking agency showing that B&B had been booked. The guy on reception was very polite and apologetic, but insisted that I would have to speak with his manager in the morning to get it sorted ( which I did and it was indeed sorted very quickly). I was allocated a room on the 5th floor. I don't know if every floor is the same but there are seriously creaky floorboards both along the length of the corridor and inside my room! Inside the room - electric wall heater which was off, two windows both open - so it was freezing. Closed windows, turned on heater. Tried turning on TV and found that the remote didn't work. It had batteries and a red light indicating power, but it didn't control the TV. Another problem was that there were only a few sheets of toilet roll left on the roll, and no spare roll in the room. I didn't notice this until the next day when (ahem) it really mattered! What really bothered me the most though were the multiple stains on the carpet adjacent to the bed. Without forensic testing I obviously can't be sure, but I'm pretty certain that these were dried bodily fluids. As I really did not want to walk on these in my bare feet I actually moved the bed to cover them - out of sight, out of mind, only they weren't really out of mind.... Normally there would have been enough in the way of problems there for me to have complained at the time and requested a change of room but like I said I was shattered and just wanted to sleep. Unfortunately the hotel is located is very noisy at night, with car horns, police sirens etc going at frequent intervals. Apart from the vile orange juice substitute (common to all Travelodges), breakfast was okay and the breakfast/restaurant area is bright and spacious. I won't be back here....", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warwick, England", "Title": "\u201cvalue for money\u201d", "Author": "Philstowe", "ReviewID": "UR125763093", "Content": "great budget hotel, in the centre of London.

The room was clean and there was no mould in the bathroom. The mattress was a little bit on the soft side but didn't have any large hollows in (like previous ones). We only had one towel so we asked for another which was fine, but the cleaners obviously don't understand the concept on the tag in the bathroom which says leave your towels on the floor and we will change them, leave them on the rail and we won't. They took both our towels even though they were on the rail, and only replaced them with one, so we had to keep asking for another towel each day. Not very environmentally friendly. There wasn't a hairdryer in the room but you can go and ask and they lend you one. Due to our previous bad experiences of Travelodges, we did not book breakfast, there is however a Wetherspoons at the back which does breakfast very reasonably. The hotel was very easy to find - tube to Tower Bridge, left and round the corner as you leave the station, you see a Minories bar over the road and the Travelodge is behind it. When you get off the tube you will see Tower of London directly in front. The location was ideal to visit most places although be careful at weekends as this is when they close some tube stations for maintenance. We walked to the London Eye, going via the Monument and St Pauls, it was quite a way but it was a nice day. We walked back along the Thames and there were some lovely rivers edge bars to stop at and we crossed back over Tower bridge. Because the Tower is so close, visit it in the morning and make sure you do the jewels bit early as by the time we came out there were huge queues and it wasn't even a busy time of year!

We checked in fine at 3pm, the room is a typical Travelodge room, large double bed, small en suite, desk, mirror, TV, hangers etc. The en suite was great, lots of hot water and pressure, the mattress on the bed unfortunately was incredibly soft which is fine if your used to that. Saying that though we found our room to be very clean. As has been mentioned, this Travelodge backs onto a railway line and road. Our room backed onto the railway, and although you could hear the old train the windows do keep out the majority of noise, but I'm sure in summer when you want the window open, this could be annoying so take ear plugs just in case. The only other slightly annoying thing other than the mattress and there only being one two socket plug, was the cleaners knocking on your door at 9.30am. I'm sure this is fine if your there on business which I would say the majority of customers to this hotel are visiting for, but if you spent the previous day sight seeing and want a little in sleep or are in the shower its annoying. It's a shame they didn't have a do not disturb sign as this would have been useful! Just a little tip although Tower Hill tube station is closer, Aldgate tube station has a Boots chemist and a small Tesco near it which is handy. Tower Hill has restaurants and a wetherspoons nearby.

All I wanted was a room that was clean and functional. Sadly, this Travelodge failed to deliver on both counts. My small room on the 4th floor looked tired, every wall was grubby, and a tennis ball-sized hole in the plasterwork had been crudely filled. There was an unpleasant stain on the carpet by the side of the bed. I didn\u2019t get close enough to examine what had caused it! The grubby windows opened by about one inch and overlooked offices and several lanes of very noisy traffic (apparently this is the best side of the Travelodge, as the rear backs directly onto a rail line). The bed was incredibly saggy and unsupportive and there were a worrying amount of stains, and what looked like cigarette burn marks on the duvet (strange, as Travelodge has been non-smoking for some time \u2013 so how old is the linen?). The pillows were wafer-thin, but worse was the constant scuttling in the cavity wall during the night. The noise could do with being investigated by Rentokil. After an awful night\u2019s sleep I looked forward to a shower in the relatively modern but small bathroom. Sadly, this was a disappointment, too. The shower only had one setting: so hot it almost burned your skin off. No amount of turning the thermostat down altered the temperature. I didn\u2019t appreciate seeing long hair from a previous guest stuck to the tiles, and mould growing around the base of the shower tray. Could breakfast be this hotel\u2019s saving grace? I\u2019m afraid not. You have to queue and are presented with a knife, fork and plate. The buffet offered a miserable selection of sausages, scrambled eggs and cooked tomatoes \u2013 it looked like it had all been microwaved several hours ago. So I decided to give it a miss and settled for a stale croissant and a self-service slice of toast. Only in central London could Travelodge get away with charging \u00a399.95 (plus an extra \u00a37.95 for breakfast) for such a poorly maintained, scruffy and depressing hotel. It\u2019s not cheap, it\u2019s certainly not cheerful, and my advice would be to pay a bit more for a Premier Inn.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guildford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDreadful\u201d", "Author": "CazEasyPeaseyPease", "ReviewID": "UR121274915", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel last night and got around 2 hours sleep!

Upon first impressions the hotel looks fine, perfectly clean and hospitable. However, the rooms were unbearably hot with no way of cooling them down (the window would only open about one inch). We asked SEVERAL times at reception for a fan, and each time we were told 'sorry but we gave the last fan out half an hour ago'. I believed this the first time they told me, but by the 6th time of being told this I started to doubt that it was the truth. We were eventually given one by reception, only after enduring a sleepless night on the first night. Secondly, we had been hoping to order a meal from the night time menu (advertised as available between 10pm and 5am) on Saturday night. When we asked reception, they informed us that they were not doing the night time menu as they had not got any stock left, and were awaiting a delivery on the Sunday. I find this extremely surprising - running out of stock on a Saturday night (busiest night of the week). Finally, on the Sunday we were at reception by 12pm to check out. As our train home wasn't until 9pm I enquired as to whether it would be possible to keep our luggage with reception until we needed to collect it, as we had planned a few tours that afternoon, and as is customary in every other hotel I have ever stayed in. I was told bluntly 'no - for security reasons'. This resulted in me having to take a taxi to King's Cross Station and pay \u00a317 to hold two items of luggage for what was really just a few hours. In general the staff at this hotel were unhelpful in every way, and although Travelodge are not the most expensive of hotels, and are advertised as basic but effective, nothing about this hotel was effective in the slightest. For \u00a3100 per night I would certainly expect a little bit more in terms of service than what was provided here. On top of all this the dining area was not kept clean. Furthermore, our tea and coffee facilities were not replenished, and only one set of towels and pillows were provided (in a double room!).

Hotel is a basic utilitarian hotel, furnished with fake wood furniture, plastic chair and a small hanging rail for clothes with shelf above. No side tables beside the bed but a very small cubby hole set into the headboard. Small room with a small en- suite, not much space to store baggage etc. The hotel does not appear to have a luggage room and will not accept baggage prior to/ after check in/ check out. So you have to plan your stay around this. It is in a rather noisy location, with the light rail on one side and a noisy arterial road on the other, which was busy all night. If you are a tourist, the hotel location is ideal for seeing the Tower etc,however be warned that at the weekend this part of the city is essentially \"dead\" with cafes closed, also shops as well, which was rather surprising. A better location is the Covent Garden travel lodge, which again is a basic utilitarian hotel but with a great location. The front of house staff in the Tower Hill location are friendly and helpful, apart from a rather diembodied voice which kept calling out to the reception staff when we tried to verify our booking on arrival at the hotel, \"charge them ten pounds\" this was at ten minutes to the regular check in time. I declined and waited the ten minutes and then booked in. Not a great service example to the front of house staff from ? a manager on duty. Also of note is that the electrical socket in the room was hanging out of the wall and the reading lights attached to the headboard were somewhat loose. There is a good flat screen TV in the room, the shower in the ensuite was adequate. The hotel is in a good location for a buisness traveller who needs access to the city during the week.

Pros: The room was very clean with good flat screen tv and tea/coffee making facilities. Location was brilliant, round the corner from Tower Hill tube station, Tower Bridge and the Tower of London. The bus tours leave from Tower Bridge so very easy access to everything. The Jack the Ripper tour (recommended) starts at Tower Hill tube (it doesn't end there though, the guide left us at Spitalfields to find our own way back so take a map - we got lost!) Lots of pubs and restaurants in the area, including a Wetherspoons across the road which serves full breakfast for \u00a33.30 from 7am. Be warned though - many of the restaurants are full of City workers in the evenings and getting a table or a drink at the bar can be problematic. Cons: The hotel doesn't provide toiletries, not even a bar of soap so you need to take all this with you. Even though we had a double room, only one hand towel and one bath towel was provided. There is no air conditioning so the room was very hot, and if you keep the windows open you have the noise from the train station so don't expect much sleep! We were also ripped off with the internet access. On arrival the receptionist told us that if we paid for a day's access, we would get 24 hours over our 3 day stay. This, however, was not the case, we paid at 1pm on Monday and by 1pm Tuesday our access was terminated. If you need to use the internet better off going to Wetherspoons as there is free access there. I would use Travelodge again but only if I could get a deal, we paid \u00a3180 for our 3 night stay (not including breakfast) but would definitely not pay any more than that. A friend has just booked a break in the Southwark branch for \u00a319 per night which is a brilliant price but more than \u00a360 per night is a bit of a cheek.

Our room was located literally ON the train track however we never found the trains to be a bother as the latest we had to deal with them was about midnight. All my experiences with the hotel staff were pleasant. are check in/out was happy and straight forward and when I ordered drinks at the bar for our room the bar staff were very cheery and full of banter. Also there is a great pub called 'The Minories' across the road that does a cracking breakfast if you're not up for the travelodge brekky. I would recommend this hotel if you're stopping off for the night - as you simply can't beat the price in central London. But any longer and you'd drive yourself insane due to the heat in the room unfortunately. Like I said, I feel sorry for this hotel, I'm not rating it a 'bad' two stars.

I booked the room last year not long after booking the concert tickets, and got a rate of about \u00a380 per night for the room. I'd hoped to get one of the special rates and kept checking, but a better rate never came up. I tried to book a twin, but the website offered me a \"Family Room\", describing it as having a double bed, a sofa, and a \"put up\" bed. We reckoned that would be OK for the two of us. Right from check in, things started to go wrong. I thought check in time was 2pm, so after arriving in the area at about 1pm we had lunch in the Wetherspoons nearby, and arrived at the hotel at 2pm. We were told that we couldn't check in until 2.30pm and it would be an extra \u00a310 to check in early. Fair enough, rules are rules, but she could have been a bit nicer. This time we found the wonderful Minories pub next door to kill another half hour. On returning to the hotel, the first room we were given was just bizarre. A double bed in one corner, masses of other space in the room - but no other furniture apart from a small desk. No sofa, no put up bed, nothing. You could have had a roller disco on the empty carpet. So we returned to reception and asked for a family room. The room we were given this time was small with a double bed and a sofa that had a pull out mattress underneath which wasn't made up. But quite frankly, I don't see how you could make it up. There was just no carpet space to put it up. Thankfully my friend and I have known each other long enough and well enough that we didn't mind just sharing the double, but that could have been a major problem for some people. Again, there was practically no other furniture. One small desk, no drawers. No bedside cabinets. No wardrobe, just a rail with about six hangers. There were only two power points, which for two ladies with phones, hair styling things (and the kettle in the room) was a bit of an issue, especially as the sockets were hanging off the wall and moved whenever you unplugged something. As other reviewers have said, the room could be a bit hot and had no AC. Fair enough, it's a Travelodge. But there is no excuse for the following: - no toilet paper left one day. We were running dangerously low! - half the towels being taken away one day. - the sofa had several quite disturbing stains on it. We didn't eat in the hotel, and I couldn't see why anyone would. The Minories next door does a wide breakfast menu up until noon. Two poached eggs on two slices of toast washed down with a huge fresh orange and soda for under a fiver. Perfect. The one thing it has got going for it is that the location of the hotel is great. Right next to the Tower of London, the Thames, and Tower Bridge. Transport is easy with both Tower Hill tube and Tower Gateway DLR on the doorstep. If, like us and many of the guests in the hotel, you are using it for visiting the O2, I can highly recommend the riverboat service. We pre-booked the O2 express from London Bridge Pier, which was about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. The return clipper stopped at Tower Pier on the return, and we found a pub called the Peacock round the corner which was open until 1am.

Have to say the room had nothing more then just a bed but hey we paid 29 quid for the room as we managed to book in advance, and i think in central london getting a room for 29 quid is already good enough so we didn't really create a fuss on the room having basically just a bed and a table with tea making facility. Toilet was very clean, a bit small but techniqually we didn't have to play football in the toilet anyway. We didn't really eat in the cafe as we had other plans for the evening.

Don't know, I never eat Travelodge food anywhere that has any alternative within walking distance - and this one has lots, touristy and pricy near the Tower - but walk five to ten minutes EAST into the real London, and eat with the locals - hearty breakfasts for half the Travelodge prices, and twice their quality.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cone of the better travelodges\u201d", "Author": "janecad", "ReviewID": "UR96624613", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights-11/12 Feb.

In actual fact not one of us in our group heard one train! we didnt hear a single sound from outside. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable. The staff were polite. It is close to the tube station (tower hill) so just a couple of minutes walking distance. when you walk in that direction you can see tower bridge which is walking distance too. There is a multi storey car park at the back of the hotel but i think it was 12 pounds for 12 hours. Depending on when you stay here you can get free parking! we got there on the Saturday and found that a back street very close to the hotel did not have parking restrictions at the weekend so we got free parking! Bonus! It cost about 68 pounds for the one night but hotels in more central areas were double the price so this was a cheap deal, the tube is about 6.40, they stop running around 12.30am but there are the night buses. Also it is only about 4 stops on the tube to embankment, change over and 2 more stops to leicester sqaure where the nightlife if fantastic!

The main problem was, although i was on the railway side the train noise wasn't annoying over the weekend, what was worse was the noise coming through the door as people walked past talking, the door didn't hold back much noise at all. In the end you just give up and start trying to hear what the different languages are!! Not really a problem for me but the Minories pub next door did have a late night on friday night, you couldn't hear the musicbut the bass came through the walls, this is only as i was right up that end of the hotel though. It was clean, the shower was good, although i prefer the bottom of the shower curtain to be not floating up and sticking to me! Staff sorted everything quickly. My stay was 4th-7th Feb' and even with the heater turned off the room was plenty warm for me. (it was working just turned off) As mentioned the Wetherspoons is good and close, they serve food till 10pm. We ate there instead of Travelodge for breakfast and food was quick and good, breakfast menu served till 12 noon. We only went to the Liberty Bounds pub which is really nice inside and has a view over to the Tower and Tower Bridge. But across the road there's a set of shops under ground level behind 'EAT' and in there's a KFC and also a pizza place where you can get an 11\" pizza for \u00a35 (3 toppings), it's freshly made and cheap and was fine. Also the hotel is a short walk from Liverpool Street Station, and a small tip if you're going to stock up on water rather then paying crazy prices for small bottles in small shops or at the Travelodge, where it'll cost you nearly that much for not even a litre, is to go to Tesco, there is one outside L.Street main exit onto Bishopsgate, or, there is another one near to Monument, where you can get 4 litres for \u00a31.50 (2 x 2l bottles) So, overall a good stay, it was the weekend so was always going to be quieter than a weekday stay, such as trains didn't sound horns during weekend but they did monday morning.

The location is therefore fantastic - just round the corner from the Tower of London and Tower Bridge, thus I rated this \"excellent\" for location. The Tube is cheap and cheerful and, even if you get lost, it's easy to get off at the next station to backtrack or simply ask any of the helpful staff in the Underground. The staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful and always have a ready smile so I was happy to rate them \"very good\". Cleanliness in the hotel generally I also rated \"very good\" - same in the room - though my bin in the bathroom wasn't emptied on my second day. The bedding was changed daily and ample fresh towels replenished, also on a daily basis. The room is basic but adequate for a short stay. As with all Travelodges, there are tea and coffee making facilities though it has to be said they are a bit stingy with the teabags (only one provided in a room catering for two people). To be fair, though, I may have been given more had I requested this. The reasons I gave the room an overall \"poor\" rating was for the following reasons: 1) lack of drawers! There were none at all in my room even though there was plenty space for them. I therefore had to put my smalls, t shirts etc onto a shelf above the coathangers, which is intended for towels and the spare pillow. The towels therefore had to be moved into the bathroom and the pillow I put on my bed. I'm only 5ft 3\" so it was a bit of a pain to reach up to rifle through the things I needed on the shelf. 2) shortage of coathangers - only 6 provided. This was just enough for me on my own but no good at all for a couple. 3) My chair seat wasn't bolted down to the legs on the left hand side so any movement to the right meant you were likely to fall off - quite dangerous for people who are maybe not as quick to save themselves as I was! 4) Lack of power sockets. There was only two in my room - located at the desk under the window. Not very handy when you need to put on your laptop and charge a phone, camera and mp3 player - all while heating up the kettle to make a cup of tea while trying to dry your hair with a hairdryer - so things had to be disconnected constantly at the risk of forgetting to plug them in again to recharge. 4) I was on the ground floor (room 12) which faces a main road. Unless you pull down the window blind (no curtain) everyone can see into your room. I was never awoken by traffic noise however. The bed was a double - lovely soft clean duvet with a comforable mattress giving me a good night's sleep every night meaning it earned an \"excellent\" rating. I chose not to book breakfast at this hotel having had many Travelodge breakfasts over the years in various hotels around the country. I feel they are not worth the money charged and, passing through the breakfast area one morning, spotted that they are still serving the same tired old dried out breakfasts they normally serve, so was glad I didn't have any. Instead I tried the pub literally steps away from the hotel at the front door. The Minories is a very spacious pub but manages to retain a cosy feel due its fairly low arched/brick ceiling and is located right underneath the railway line so the trains travelling overhead can be a bit noisy. The food and service however is fantastic (breakfast for \u00a35.99 including a drink). I booked my room a good few weeks in advance of travel through one of Travelodge's own promotional emails. Had I not got the room for \u00a335 a night via this special offer, I would have paid around \u00a385 a night for the room.

One other thing future guests may want to know is that the Travelodge really has nothing to do with the internet you pay for when you register. It is offered by an offsite company and the staff at the Travelodge is largely uninformed as to its use. The way it works is not intuitive, at least it wasn't to me. When you make your reservation and pay for internet, you sign up for a My Travelodge account. A voucher code is sent to that account and you use the voucher code every time you sign onto the internet. The only other two complaints we had were that the toilet paper wasn't refilled even when the roll was completely empty until we requested more paper and that there was only enough hot water to take a tepid shower. These weren't major things and were offset by the price of the room (Our room averaged 60 BPS a day) and the convenient location.

Looking at the website for this hotel they offered a buffet breakfast for an extra \u00a36.95 per person, great i thought how wrong was I. the choice was cereal a cooked breakfast which consisted of sausages, very cheap bacon, dry processed scrambled egg, cheap beans and a tomato. all presented in plastic tuppawear and, if you weren't there early enough a selection of two things ie beans and sausage, none of the staff seemed motivated enough to replace anything that wasn't there.

( not a family friendly hotel) Please people don't be fooled by the price beacuse for an extra \u00a330 you could stay in a luxury 4* hotel in knighsbridge, close to Harrods the natural history museum and the v&A (which was superb.) pay the extra cost it will be well worth it.

This was very last minute and I did not have much time to look around, but the little time I did spend looking at hotels I was never too sure about location, value for money, cleanliness... We ended up booking the Travelodge, because I thought it was a name I could trust. I never stayed in one, so didnt know what to expect. First of all 250\u00a3 is not really what I call \"budget\". But I thought at least I would get everything I needed out of it. When we arrived i did look rather new and modern and a friendly lady checked us in immediately even though we were a little early. She proceeded with giving us one room key. I asked for a second, which she gave to us at no extra charge. Trying to get into our room, we were greeted by two confused spanish ladies, who clearly already occupied the room. So down we went and explained the situation and after asking us about 20 times \"Are you sure?\" she gives us a second room. This one was not occupied. It was good enough sized, hardly any furniture. There was nowhere to store our cloths so we had to leave them in our cases for the whole stay. The telly was a flatscreen mounted to the wall but was adjusted, so that it was hard to see a picture when lying on the bed. Our room was facing the station behind the hotel and as we were on the first floor, there was just a brick wall for a view. The windows only opened about 2inc for safety reasons, which was rather inconvenient as there was no fan in the bathroom and this 2inc gap was the only place where the steam could come out from after we took showers. The bathroom was very small. There was no bath, just a shower, no shampoo or anything like that was provided, but I was informed about that when I made the booking, so i remembered to bring some. We didnt eat in the restaurant area and while we were there we didnt see anyone eat there either. The prices were rather discusting at 7\u00a3 for breakfast each. We went to a pub on the other side of the bridge every morning which did full english breakfast for 1.99\u00a3. That is what I call great value! There was also a 5\u00a3 charge to use the internet in the hotel so we took our laptop with us to where we had breakfast as they had (like nearly every place these day) free WIFI. The good points about the hotel are deffinately cleanliness, location and comfort. It was very clean, with no signes of anyone occupying the room before us. The location was awesome! Right by the Tower bridge and the tower of London. The tube station was right around the corner and there was a tesco express there aswell. And the beds are soooo cumfy! The shower was brilliant! And we hardly heard any noise from the train station. I realy wished I had done more research before booking it, as I am sure I could have gotten just as much comfort for less. They didnt even have a hairdryer, telephone or a clock in the room! All things that I totally expected to be there. Maybe if I had booked it earlier I would not have had to pay quite so much, and at a lower price I would consider staying there again.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "SandN", "ReviewID": "UR61734085", "Content": "We stayed here on an Easter break to London and were impressed by the cleanliness & new feel to the hotel.

We were quite far down the corridor and the only concern I would have if I stayed here again would be if I had a room adjacent to the entrance to that floor as you can only gain access to each floor with your own room key so each floor has an initial door you have to go through, I wouldn't fancy hearing that door opening and closing at least 60 times as each guests passes through, don't get me wrong the doors don't bang shut but you'd certainly hear it closing in the first couple of rooms on any given floor, at least I'd think so.

When we got to the actually very nice, clean and modern room the following was instantly noticeable: It was ROASTING hot No shampoo or conditioner No toohbrushes/toothpaste ONE bath towel No air con Broken window latch obviously done on purpose by a previously melting guest I decided to call reception to enquire about the bath towels at the very least. Ah..... no phone. I went down to the reception to ask about this, the guy gave me a slip of paper with the hotels number written on it and said 'just use your mobile, mate!'. Fantastic... I should have thought of that... isnt modern technology great!!! He then provided me with an extra bath towel. One problem down. I went back to the hotel room a little flustered. During the next 5 minutes come kid from outside actually entered the room. I have no idea how. I chased him and his 5 friends (guests at the hotel) down the corridor and took them to reception where they were reprimanded for at least 10 seconds by manager-man regarding the case. THEY WERE IN MY ROOM!!!!!!! Not so much B & B here... more B & E. I should have called the police. I went back after realizing that they weren't going to do any more and the lady said \"Well, if they do it again they'll get kicked out of the hotel, so don't worry\". Shocking. No other offer even hinted at to appease my frustration. The night was spent either boiling hot with not much noise (window closed) or nice and cool but totally awake (window open). Problems with my pre-paid internet voucher (\u00a35 for an hour, bargain) weren't resolved until the morning and even after that the one hour could only be used all at once, not in little bits.

Upon arrival we were impressed with the appearance, it looked clean and fresh. Upon collecting our key card we found our room, each hallway has to be entered using the same card which was reassuring and gave a sense of security, as only people on that level should be able to gain access. Our room appeared fresh and clean, the walls were a little scuffed in places which is a shame as I understand this Travelodge has only been open a few months. The bed was a king size and had clean bedding, in the bathroom the shower and toilet both appeared immaculate & fresh, clean towels had been provided. In the bedroom you get a desk & chair, a flat screen LG lcd TV, somewhere to hang your clothes up, a full length mirror, a wall mounted heater, a reasonably comfortable bed with two pillows, each side of the bed is mounted a flexible swan necked reading lamp, also a nice touch is a backlit / illuminated headboard which gives a soft light while watching TV, also there is a small kettle for making hot drinks along with tea & coffee. We had a front facing room overlooking the road on the 2nd floor, to be honest noise from the road below was quite loud, as we were very tired from travelling however we both managed to sleep pretty well despite the noise of traffic. The room was very hot so we slept with the window open, which made the road noise worse. We were made aware of food available at the Travelodge as a brochure had been left in our room promoting pizza, simply order at reception then take it to your room and enjoy, we were out until quite late as we had been out on the \"see London by night\" tour bus and when we returned we thought we would order one, the guy at reception said they had ran out which left us rather disappointed, especially after enjoying the thought. Breakfast was much better than we expected, we started with: orange juice, cereals, coffee, toast, bacon, mushrooms, and tomatoes, beans, which was quite good, you can also have sausages & scrambled egg on your plate too. Other stuff was available like croissants and muffins, and also yogurts, so you shouldn\u2019t really be stuck for choice. We found the breakfast to be perfectly acceptable and even enjoyable. Location of this Travelodge is excellent, its less than 5 mins walk from Tower Hill and the Tower of London, Tower Hill is where you can catch the open top tour bus for the sight seeing. We walked from Liverpool Street Station to the Travelodge which is roughly a 20 - 30 min walk. We found the staff at reception very polite although attendance was lacking on occasions, other than not being able to get a pizza and the warmth of our room we dont really have much to complain about.

We looked at other Travelodges/Premier Inn etc and they were \u00a3400+ for anywhere near central London. We arrived and the hotel was clean and the staff very helpful. The hotel is situated 2 mins walk from Tower Hill tube station, which is great for sightseeing London as it's on both the Circular and District lines, which allow easy access across the whole of London. It was easy to get to places and get back on an evening, I'd recommend the London Travelcard - it's great value for getting around London. The room was basic, but very clean. Towels were provided, although only one for a double room - we read reviews beforehand, so take your own. Although the hotel is next to the DLR it is well soundproofed. Saying that, it was hot when we stayed and we left the windows open all night and didn't get disturbed. The only real grumble I have with the hotel is that the food is a real rip off there. Although we didn't eat there, it was \u00a37.50 for breakfast each per day (which we didn't have). There is a pub literally 20 metres away called 'The Minores' which is AMAZING! They do breakfast for \u00a34.95 in there, should you want that, however, we just ate muffins we got from Tesco's. However I cannot reccomend enough going to The Minores for dinner, TWO MEALS FOR \u00a37.95! BARGAIN! The meals we had in there were LOVELY, loads to choose from (We'd recommend the beef wrapped in a Yorkshire pudding) chilli, lasagna, veggie kiev, chicken/beef burgers etc etc. We were recommended the 'Wetherspoons' in Tower Hill from one of these reviews, but it was rubbish! Go to The Minores! Even things like the chicken burgers at The Minores are made with real chicken breasts opposed to Wetherspoons 'pre-packed-frozen-stick in the oven for 10 mins' burgers. Great value at The Minores! Also compared to the food that the Travelodge serve, you can't go wrong as you can get two meals at The Minores for the same price as one at the hotel!

The windows only opened a few inches, but even so there was a choice of the intense heat or opening the window slightly and then hearing the sound of the racing traffic.

There is no air conditioning and the room was very hot (windows barely open) and when we did look out of our window our view was of a brick wall.

I booked the room using the saver rate (\u00a355) and because it was such a good rate for London we managed to get away for nights instead of a couple! We arrived earlier than 3pm for check in, please be aware that the receptionist will charge you \u00a310.00 if you get there before 3pm! Was not aware of this, but we paid it as we didnt fancy lugging our suitcases around London Bridge and Tower Bridge. Also, make sure that if there is more than one of you in the room, that the receptionist provides you with a second bath towel. The double rooms are only kitted out for single travellers (? I suppose this is because they are more used to single business travellers staying?). My husband overheard a very irate guest who was very upset that there was only one towel in the room. So be aware of this. The hotel is nice and airy when you arrive, the rooms, as stated in previous reviews, are very basic but very clean and new. There is next to nowhere to keep your clothes so we lived out of our suitcases, and only hung up our smart evening wear. We had no problem with this to be honest as we had read previous reviews warning us of the lack of storage. Our room was on the second floor and was right next to the trains passing by (DLR) but with the windows shut you could hardly hear them. The bed was very comfortable. The TV had been angled on the wall so I think they have now addressed the previous problems with the angle of the TV and how it is viewed from the bed. The angle is fine, the picture is clear. Take a hairdryer with you (there isn't one in the room) and your toiletries. If you forget any, the vending machine downstairs had toothbrushes, toothpaste and shower gel etc. The towels are crisp and fluffy. The pub next door (the Minories) is great for a wind down drink and unusually situated in the arch beneath the railway so every now and again you get the trains rumbling overhead! We had a cheap and tasty dinner here (two meals for \u00a37.95) so they are obviously trying to compete with the Witherspoons up the road. It was a nice and comfortable pub, lovely and quiet in the afternoons. We took breakfast at Witherspoons (called Goodmans Field) and you can get a full English breakfast for \u00a32.99! Very good value also is the tea, toast, butter and jams for \u00a31.39, although we seemed to be charged slightly differently each time we ordered it.

It\u2019s a basic, but relatively new hotel (you can see it being built on Google street maps) so naturally you would expect everything to be spotless, undamaged with everything working and we can report that the hotel scored 10 out of 10 in all these categories!

The hotel has just been refurbished so is very clean and fresh. We didn\u2019t have much contact with the reception staff but the couple of times I did speak to them, they were very friendly. The room was nice, quite basic but spotlessly clean. The bedding was white and was sparkling, not a hint of grubbiness. The room contained a small area for hanging clothes (not a wardrobe per se) which had one shelf above it. My one gripe with the room is that we could have used more storage space, this probably wouldn\u2019t be an issue for a single night stay, but for a 5-night stay, it was slightly irritating to have to live out of our suitcases. There was a desk and a chair, small kettle, tea and coffee (no hairdryer). There were some nice touches like ambient lighting behind the bed and the bedside lights that twisted.

On the plus side though, the windows are extremely well insulated, you would expect to hear trains being so close to the DLR, but once the windows are closed, you can\u2019t hear a thing. The bathroom is lovely and clean. The shower is surprisingly strong and there was always plenty of hot water. They do not provide any cosmetics other than a small bar of soap. This isn\u2019t a problem as long as you know in advance. We didn\u2019t have enough towels the first day, but were able to get some from reception. A couple of pounds tip to the cleaner each day ensured that we always had more towels than we needed on subsequent days! The cleaner was very good, couldn\u2019t fault her at all. We decided not to pay the \u00a37.50 for breakfast, there are so many places to eat, you have a choice of a couple of pubs right beside the hotel that serve hot food, or several coffee shops including Starbucks if you fancy something lighter. The Tower Hill tube station is just around the corner, it is served by the District and Circle lines. Unfortunately, to get to the main tourist spots (e.g. Piccadilly, Covent Garden, Leicester Square) you do have to change line, but it\u2019s not a major hassle, one change will get you most places and you never have to wait more than a couple of minutes for a train. Just be careful if you are arriving or departing on a weekend, we arrived on Easter Monday and both the circle and district lines were closed for refurbishment. It meant our journey from Heathrow took two hours instead of 1 hour. It would have been fine if we\u2019d known in advance and made alternative arrangements. You can get updates on the tfl website, so maybe have a look before you go. Overall, we had a great experience in this hotel, for the price, it really can\u2019t be beaten. I would definitely stay there again and I have already recommended it to friends!", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent clean hotel, friendly staff, great value and location!\u201d", "Author": "mrsbruce2b", "ReviewID": "UR28381636", "Content": "We stayed at the Tower Bridge Travelodge, for 4 nights over valentine's weekend for my first ever trip to London.

The location is great for the City, but even when I was visiting for pleasure I didn't find the hotel (if you can call it that?) to be too far out of the way, and Tower Hill and Aldgate tube stations are only 2 minutes round the corner. The reception staff are very pleasant and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are perfectly adequate but can get quite hot. This wasn't really a problem in March but it was really warm in London on Wednesday and I had to open the window, which resulted in quite a lot of traffic noise due to the room facing Goodmans Yard. Echoing previous reviews, the angle of the plasma tvs needs amending. Even sat up in bed I couldn't see the picture properly (but I'm not the tallest of people!). I should have mentioned this to reception but was in a rush checking out. Didn't opt for the \u00a37.50 all you can eat breakfast, choosing instead to visit the Weatherspoons across the road for a \u00a33.49 full English and coffee.

However I believe both lines that serve this station are closed on Sundays so it is important to be familiar with the buses from this location if you are staying on Sunday. The RV1 and 15 buses are very handy and close by for site seeing. This hotel is also very close to the Tower of London. There is a large rail station nearby and our window was facing the rail station. However the noise from the rail station was minimal and did not disturb our sleep.

The television is quite good! You are surround by roads and a railway line, so there is always some general background noise going on, particularly if you sleep with the windows open, but we didn't find it a problem. Handy for tube access, only about 7 minutes walk to Tower Hill. A little away from the centre, but close to Tower Bridge, Tower of London etc. so still very convenient for sightseeing. Friendly helpful staff. Booked online through totalstay.co.uk and got a better deal than if we had booked on the travelodge website. Breakfast was advertised as continental, but turned out to be buffet style anything you want including bacon, eggs etc. so we were quite pleased with that.

This is our first trip to London with our 3 year old son and wanted a location near the river as this is where most of the things we wanted to do were situated. Found the location to be excellent. Only a few minutes walk from Tower Hill Station and a Central line service, if you need a Northern line then its just a few minutes walk in the other direction. There are actually 2 Wetherspoons pubs within very close walking distance, we went to the Curry night at the closest one and this was excellent. There is a Slug and Lettuce pub around the corner as well as a couple of coffee shops and also a Boots within a 5 minute walk. Breakfast was excellent in the hotel, yes the food is not always piping hot but it is very fresh and plenty of it. We were given a family room on the 3rd floor when we first checked in but ended up in a different room as the first only had a shower in it and my son does not like them, the staff were excellent, no problem with the change and brought us a travel cot straight up with all the bedding we needed, they had given us extra towels when we checked in. If you do want a bath you need to request this as they only have 7 in the hotel, all the other rooms are shower only. Room was an excellent size for us and we had no issues with noise or anything else. We used the windowsill as a sort of mini fridge by opening the outside window and putting bottles on it and closing the inside one, worked fantastically, just brought up some glasses of ice from the bar and used them for our drinks. We also ate on the other side of the river one night at Pizza Express, the atmosphere there was great and we really enjoyed the walk back to London Bridge tube station, it was very easy to get back from there, we did have to change tube twice but it was only one stop on each line and took about 10 minutes. No issues walking around after 10pm, felt completely safe. This hotel certainly ticked all the boxes for us, if you go with the understanding that this is a Travel Lodge and not the Ritz then you will be fine, they provide decent clean accomodation for a very good price.
