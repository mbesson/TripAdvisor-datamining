The rooms are spotless, the hotel is located in a very safe and convenient location. Marco and Serena's warmth and easygoing attitude really \"set the tone\" for our vacation.

Breakfast was delicious and plentiful and the room was spacious, impeccably decorated, comfortable and clean. The location of the hotel felt very safe and was an easy walk to a number of the great attractions in Rome (and not far from a square where you can jump on one of the hop-on/hop-off sight seeing buses).

From start to finish it was just perfect. Marco and Serena are fantastic hosts and this is what sets them apart from the large hotels which you may be considering. Upon arrival Marco opened a bottle of wine for us to share whilst he annotated a map of Rome and highlighted the main attractions and also the best restaurants and bars in each area of the city. Going the extra mile like this totally made our trip as his recommendations were spot on. We celebrated our first wedding anniversary whilst we were there and wanted to try a small intimate restaurant for a romantic meal. Marco recommended Osteria del Pegno and it didn't disappoint. We also ate at Casa Coppelle the previous night which, too, was wonderful. Upon entering our room there was a bottle of Prosecco and chocolates waiting for us as well as a small bottle of fizz in the well stocked (and complementary!) mini bar. The room was modern and tastefully furnished. A real surprise was to find an iPad 2 in the room which was ours to use for the duration of our stay. I have never come across this before and was very useful. Free wi-fi is available throughout. The bathroom was very clean and the bed was comfy, if a little small (we're quite tall). Breakfast was good with croissants, fresh fruit, cold meats, cheese and fantastic coffee. Serena did a great job in ensuring we had enough. Throughout our short stay Marco was on hand to ask if we needed anything and offered us a glass of wine on several occasions. So to summarise, Deko Rome is the perfect place to stay whilst in the great city of Rome. You will not be disappointed.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat personal service! Deko did it for us! Highly recommended!\u201d", "Author": "skdcitraveller", "ReviewID": "UR127797507", "Content": "We chose Deko Rome after researching TA as we would rather avoid the impersonal nature of a large hotel and like building our own short breaks. We couldn\u2019t believe it was no.1 rated in Rome and wondered what it had done to earn such a high accolade. We made contact in hope rather than expectation that we could book it. We did book with 4 months notice and went last week in March 2012. We can see why it has earnt such a good rating after only 11 months in business. It would be very difficult to fault anything. Depending on what room (honeymoon suite, superior or deluxe) you book and when, defines the tariff. All I will say is that we made the right decision for making our trip extra special. We took advantage of Deko\u2019s offer of a limo service pick up (\u20ac50)/drop off (\u20ac45) at Fiumicino which was about 40 minutes door to door. We were met downstairs by Marco who insists on carrying suitcases to the room. I guess we had to walk a hundred steps (almost all at airport) from airplane to Deko front door. The hotel is more an up market but informal bed and breakfast located near to the US Embassy, as well as a police station and a Spar, in a safe and smart area, 8 minutes walk to Barberini Metro Station. It is well located for walking to Spanish steps (8 mins), Trevi Fountains & Pantheon (15 mins), Victor Emmanuel, Colliseum, Roman Forum & Palatine hill (15-20mins). The Vatican Museum & St. Peter\u2019s Basilica are 15-20 mins by Metro from Barberini to Ottaviano with short walks at each end (\u20ac1pp per trip). A few tips on booking Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel (suggest book on-line when at Deko to avoid queuing) and e-mail ahead to Marco to book Museo Borghese as it would have needed a 2-3 week advance booking when we were there. Deko is 60\u2019s contemporary chic and very comfortable but undoubtedly the thing that sets it aside from impersonal hotels is the concierge +++ in the form of Marco and Serena. They have converted two apartments into a six bed room guest house. On arrival you are genuinely warmly greeted, seated and Prosecco thrust towards you and given the Deko welcome with a guided tour via tourist map of the sights to be seen, where to eat, where to avoid and other recommendations etc. It is a bit daunting when you first arrive as you are not orientated but by the end of your first day you have identified most of the locations he flags up on your map. If you have forgotten their significance just ask Marco or Serena when you get back and they will jog your memory. This young couple put so much into this place, 12 hour days, 7 days a week for 51 weeks of the year and it is paying off for those lucky enough to stay at Deko and receive their personal attention. I won\u2019t say too much more about Marco and Serena\u2019s customer service as I am sure you will enjoy the Rome briefing & bespoke welcome they provide as well as the genuine warmth they purvey to all their guests who arrive and leave on first name terms having made their trip to the wonderful City of Rome even more memorable. We enjoyed chatting with guests at breakfast and late afternoon as we talked through our days and shared some tips. Everyone was so chilled and polite. Deko must engender that feeling of relaxation on its guests. The rooms have good en-suite facilities including safe, hairdryer and toiletries. You have a daily replenished fridge with water, soft drinks, beer and Prosecco. Sky Italia TV and gratis internet access too. Can\u2019t think of anything else we would have wanted. We had Room one (the smallest but perfectly adequate) then number three (larger). Both were on street side but quiet. Just a few tips, if like us you hadn\u2019t been to Rome before, or at least not for many years\u2026\u2026\u2026.. prepare with comfortable shoes! Most of the famous sites (as above) are within a 1-2 mile radius with the Vatican over the Tiber a bit further away (use the Metro). If like us you run out of steam on the fourth day, maybe take the open top tourist bus from St Peter\u2019s and negotiate a hop on/off all day rate and sun bathe upstairs as you rest your feet! We went round two and a half times before we got off near Barberini! Won\u2019t bother with separate restaurant reviews but following Marco\u2019s advice we visited two of his recommendations and one that we had from home before we came. 1. Il Margutta (5 mins by taxi), One of the top Vegetarian restaurants in Rome (apparently). Nice ambience, d\u00e9cor & substantial menu with a Barolo wine probably the best I\u2019ve ever had. Sadly we both found the food was bland and lacking in imagination with over reliance on lentils and artichokes. I like strong tastes and this didn\u2019t do it for either of us. Too expensive and ostentatious. An easy way to spend \u20ac120 too! 2. San Marco (3 mins walk from Deco). We ate here twice in busy, large and vibrant atmosphere. Both times service and food was excellent. As we had eaten here on first night we chose this for our anniversary meal and both had Argentine steaks. Wow! Great with Multipulciano as well. Not much change from \u20ac100 but worth it. 3. Due Ladroni (7 mins taxi). A sea food restaurant in Piazza Nicosia. A recommendation from home but shut on Saturday lunchtime and all day Sunday so couldn\u2019t eat here for our special occasion. We had sea food bruschetta followed by Lobster linguine and grilled scampi (langoustine in UK). Both mains were large offerings. All I can say if you are looking for a special meal with a good wine list then we will still be talking about this for years to come. Lots of Limoncello and other tasters thrown in after sweets so left very happy. No change from \u20ac140 so beware! All three of these restaurants are listed in TA and have their own reviews. A personal choice on our part but we like to give our honest opinions so that others can take a view and make their own minds up. A great trip to Rome made perfect with Marco and Serena\u2019s attention to detail and hospitality.

I'm so glad we did - I've never felt more welcome in a hotel anywhere. Marco and Serena are the loveliest hosts you can hope for. They will sit with you at check in and point out places of interest and their favourite restaurants and things to do with you on a map. From then on any question you have is never too much trouble, they will book restaurants or galleries for you and help you tailor your trip for maximum enjoyment. The hotel is more like a boutique B&B (they call it a guest house, which is playing it down) - our room (the suite) was wonderfully finished, stylish, clean and comfortable with an awesome shower and Sky TV. It's definitely worth the extra for the suite, you get a living room plus the bedroom. Plus, book direct with Deko as it is cheaper than via Booking.com or whatever. It's not as instant but Marco will get back to your emails quickly. Breakfast was generous and varied and plated for you each morning by Serena, you can have it in your room as well if you like. Each evening after a day's sightseeing Marco would welcome us back with a cheery \"drink?\", and pour a spritz, prossecco or cocktail before catching up after the day. Often other guests would be around too and we'd end up having an enjoyable discussion. The friendly atmosphere rubs off on everyone and helps avoid the occaisional awkwardness you can get in shared areas of hotels.

They usually have breakfast from 8am to 11am, but since our taxi was picking us up at 8 am, Serena came earlier to make sure we ate something before we left, then she walked us down just like she would their friends. Oh, for Valentines, they left us a bottle of Proseco and and a card. Again, thank you Serena and Marco, we had a lovely stay.

The best part is the people \u2013 Marco and Serena are the most amazing hosts! They are warm and incredibly helpful and make the Roman experience something really special. We were there last week (Feb 2012) for four nights and enjoyed every single moment. Marco had arranged a taxi pick up from the airport for us and, upon arrival, he greeted us with a smile and a glass of wine! He proceeded to go through a map of Rome with us, in detail, not simply highlighting the tourist attractions (which we did want to visit) but specific streets and areas of interest. He also gave us lots of information about restaurants and bars and either he or Serena would ask us each day where we would like to eat that night and make a reservation. All the restaurants were amazing, serving truly Roman food. We even went to a small bakery in Campo di Fiori one afternoon (Forno) just because Marco had recommended it. Each day, when we returned from our sightseeing, Marco would welcome us with a glass of wine or Prosecco and ask us about our day. He and Serena are passionate about their city and about what they do and they genuinely want to make your stay as personal and enjoyable as it can be. Deko Rome is in a great location. There is a taxi rank two minutes walk away, the metro (Barberini) is about 10 minutes walk, and very handy for getting to the further sites, such as the Colosseum and Vatican. There are some excellent restaurants close by (top tip \u2013 take Marco and Serena\u2019s advice regarding where to eat!) and we walked almost everywhere, day and night. Our room was contemporary and stylish and immaculately clean. And nice and quiet at night, although we would usually return late after several glasses of wine and Amaretto! A number of other visitors have mentioned the details that make Deko Rome stand out \u2013 free WiFi, free mini bar, plentiful continental breakfast (served 8-11am, although they are completely flexible!). If you are looking for a large corporate hotel with a spa, pool, concierge and anonymous service, then Deko Rome is not for you. If you want to experience genuine, warm Roman hospitality which will ensure you experience the best of Rome, then you will not find anywhere better than Deko Rome! Grazie mille Marco and Serena!

That is a travesty! We reserved our week's stay in Rome at Deko Rome before they ever opened their doors. I had scoured Trip Advisor for reviews of \"guest houses\" and B&Bs, because I've had good luck doing that before. When following up on a recommendation for a nearby B&B (that was already booked for our week), they gave me the names of several other accommodations, including Deko Rome. The response that came back from Marco was brimming with anticipation about their planned opening, and after a couple short email exchanges through which he answered all our questions, we booked a full week for Sept 9-16. If you've read all the glowing recommendations here, you are aware that Deko Rome is clearly a successful enterprise for Marco and his charming wife, Serena. I have never felt so \"at home\" or so well taken care of at any hotel or guesthouse anywhere in the world. Every transportation question, directions, restaurant or shopping recommendations, or even silly problems with the way the toilet seat fit in the bathroom, were answered with confidence and smiles and the attitude that if you need this, it will be done! The quiet location was delightful...the AC invaluable (September was SO hot!) and the complimentary mini-bar refrigerator was fantastic. One night, we just wanted to chill out and eat a sandwich in the \"cafe\" area. They got us plates, glasses, silverware and napkins to use. (We'd picked up supplies a couple doors down) We were careful to clean up after ourselves as the place was ALWAYS spotless. The evening wine & chats with Marco, Serena and other guests provided some lovely memories. Oh yes, and we also appreciated the free wifi. Clearly, if we ever have the opportunity to visit Rome again, Marco will be our first contact.

My husband, our one and a half year old and I were in Rome at the end of August (staying at a different hotel) and as we were off to other parts of Europe before our final leg back in Rome, Marco and Serena were kind enough to keep some of our luggage until our return to stay so that we would not have to lug it around. From the very moment we got to Deko (Marco helped arrange our airport pickup for Euros 50 so do be sure to ask if you need to), we were made to feel at home by the friendly couple. They helped with our bags and took us up to our room which was a little small but completely comfortable, modern and sufficient. It probably felt a little smaller as we had 2 big suitcases in the corner! The location is convenient, just off Via Veneto - easy walking distance to many places, restaurants close by, safe and there is a supermarket a few doors down if you need the essentials. Marco and Serena made restaurant recommendations and we had meals in 3 of them and were very, very happy. They made reservations for us and nothing was too much trouble. There is a pizza place within walking distance (I forget what it's called) that had good food and a fabulous tiramisu! Our son had big smiles for Serena who chatted away with him in both English and Italian and from whom he picked up a very cheery 'Ciao'! In a small establishment such as the Deko Rome, it is often the people who make the place and in this case, Marco and Serena definitely do. They are a lovely couple with whom we were very comfortable and whom we wish well. We enjoyed our pre-dinner wine and vodka with Marco who shared stories about himself and life in Rome.

The breakfasts were huge- too big in fact and I felt bad each morning with the amount of food I wasted. Perhaps a better idea would be to let guests help themselves to whatever they want as I couldn't eat cakes and biscuits for breakfast so wasted them every morning whereas I would have preferred to have much more hams and cheeses. The free mineral water everyday was a nice touch and they even left us a bottle of prosecco and a pannetone on new years eve which was lovely.

I also read the information on their website http://www.dekorome.com Why some are complaining confuses me, Marco has clearly stated that Deko Rome is a guest house. If you wish for warm company, nice clean attractive rooms, and VERY helpful staff Deko Rome excels. Nothing was too much trouble for Serena or Marco, they are both superb hosts that try extra hard to make your stay enjoyable. If your looking for a large bar area, or restaurant within the facilities you will need a Hotel... This is a Grade A guest house, with lovely people. Its unusual, its different, in a positive way The Good Location is great short walk to. Trevi Fountian ( walk) Spanish Steps (walk.. close to Trevi) Vatican ( tube.. metro 4 euros) Coliseum (taxi 7 euros) Palatino (NEXT to Colisuem ).. Borghese Gardens (very close walk) Also quite handy a SPAR supermarket TWO doors away.. very useful for last minute supplies. Fav Resraurant... SAN MARCO ... close walk also Harrys Bar Best restaurant street :- Via Vittorio Veneto (close walk) We also went to Leonardo Shopping Centre on last day (V Close to airport) NICE shopping centre. Food is pretty good everywhere, we had one poor meal, that was probably just a one off bad night. The room we had was excellent, spacious and clean NUM 6 The Negatives As a guest house, not many negatives, Marco and Serena do their best for you, its all about what you want, this is not a Hotel, its more like staying with friends, you can come and go as you please, and breakfast is very flexible time wise, as long as you go prepared to act under your own Initiative you will love this place. If like myself you are unfit, I would recommend walking TO your chosen attraction, as most are downhill, and get a Taxi back ... approx 7-10 euros from most places. To walk back to Deko from Colisuem is pretty tough after a long days sight seeing.. Restaurants, Trust Serena and Marco.. they know the area well, and will book tickets for attractions and Restaurants.. What Would I Change ? Personally I would like to see SKY UK or USA satellite, nearly all TV is Italian dubbed, its not important , but would help enhance the stay a little more. Would I got back ? Yes I would, and I have already recommended Deko to some friends, I prefer the no nonsense approach of Marco, you get exactly what you would expect.. great hosts, lovely room, good location.

However the highlight of the hotel are the owners, Marco and Serena, they really go out of their way to make sure you have a truly fantastic trip. When we arrived Serena spent ages talking to us about the city, recommending places to visit, things to do and places to eat. We tried a few of her recommended restaurants and they were all amazing! If you visit here you must try the restaurants that Marco and Serena recommend, you will not be disappointed! In the evening Marco and Serena offered to share a few glasses of wine with us and talk more about our trip to Rome, they made sure we had everything we needed, including booking a table at the restaurant or calling a taxi - it made us feel very well looked after. I have stayed in lots of hotels and I can honestly say the service at the Deko Roma is the best. Anyone who is planning a visit to Rome should really consider staying in this hotel, it is fabulous, and we had a fantastic stay here.

My wife and I would sit on the stairs of our leased apartment in the Piazza Navonna and absorb its essence, We would stand on the terrace of our hotel at the top of The Spanish Steps and ingest the tranquility, history and purely Roman experience long after sightseeing was the reason we were there. Year after year we watched Rome morph from the Rome of Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn, to the Rome of tour buses, queues of tourists dutifully following placards and visitors cramming into piazzas like commuters cram into homebound trains at workday's end in Manhattan. We understood that Rome must be seen, but we had had enough. Last month, after a 15 year respite, spoiled by our higher budgets when younger, but no longer willing to pay exorbitant rates for a pleasant place to sleep, we started our trip in Rome again. An article about the Deko peaked our curiosity, and after lovely EMAILs back and forth, we booked for 5 days. The hotel arranged to have a taxi meet us when we landed.. The young owners, Marco Cardillo and Serena Piccolino lease 2nd floor space in a building off the Via Veneto.The location is superb. They have parsed the space into 4 rooms and a suite. The rooms are modern, fresh and clean. The bathrooms elegant and comfortable. The atmosphere is pristine and uncomplicated.. The breakfast is sufficient. Their company, however, one of the primary reasons one comes to Italy in the first place. They are both so sweet, caring and so Roman. Our trips will start in Rome once again, our Rome primarily being the square half kilometre bordered by the Borghese Gardens, Via Sistina and the length of the Via Veneto. We will venture out into the gardens, head toward the Tevere, walk along its quay down to Trastevere and roam around the periphery of the inundated streets, knowing we'll be returning to our lovely space at The Deko and the wonderful Marco and Serena. dk.. .", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NZ", "Title": "\u201cIgnore the bad reviews\u201d", "Author": "Gordon_Bennett_NZ", "ReviewID": "UR120620882", "Content": "The first thing I read are the bad reviews; I figure they will be the most honest reviews.

It's true they are not a hotel but to my mind that is a bonus. It's true also the lift is old, but it worked perfectly well for us. And yes they weren't on the premises 24 hours a day, but that was no problem and they supplied a phone number for emergencies. Nothing was too much trouble and they were genuine in their approach, a far cry from the 'service' at most places. The price is very reasonable - make the comparisons - but if you want the anonymity of a hotel and enjoy being treated as just another person by someone who really doesn't give a damn as long as you tip, go elsewhere. I'm a budget traveller who enjoys being spoiled, I'm no tycoon and I'm unimpressed by luxury. For me the service I experienced was the best I've had in all my years of travel - which has encompassed 55 countries and places from 5 star hotels to shacks with holes in the roof. I'd recommend them without question; I'm only afraid that success will take them places I can no longer afford. And I fell instantly in love with Tania, but that's another story.

We had one of the best meals on our trip at the great little restaurant recommended by both Marco and Serena----Casa Copelle. Our room was clean, modern, and large by European standards. We do not like stuffy or frilly hotel rooms, and our room at Deko was the antithesis of such rooms. Both the room and the bath were minimalist chic.

It was our favorite hotel during our Italian vacation. We would stay there again without considering any other place if we are so fortunate to return to Rome in the future. It is clear from past reviews that whether you are as happy with your experience as we were depends on what you want and expect out of your hotel experience while visiting Rome. Deko Rome is NOT a full service, luxury hotel with 24 hour room service and staff, a pool or workout facility, and an on-site restaurant or bar open late in the evening or early in the morning. If those services and resources are important to you and what you are expecting, you may want to consider booking at such a hotel. However, for the reasons below, our stay at Deko Rome will be a treasured memory that we wouldn\u2019t trade for any of the luxuries or services offered at the 5 star, full service hotels. The owners, Marco and Serena, and their assistant Monica, set Deko Rome apart, and made our stay at the hotel a unique and memorable experience. It is clear they sincerely want to get to know their guests, and eagerly take the time to do whatever they can to ensure that their guests have the best experience possible while exploring Rome. Other reviewers hit it on the head when they described a stay at Deko as staying with friends in a well appointed apartment. Marco, Serena, and Monica are not formal, do not address you by your last name, and do not dress in the uniform\u2019s you find in a luxury hotel chain. Instead, they are informal, dressed in clothes befitting their young age, and interact with their guests much as they would with their friends. Even though I booked the room through Agoda (see edited version of review on Agoda), Marco emailed me a couple weeks before our arrival, offering to arrange to have a private car pick us up from the airport. When we arrived, Marco was upset that we had not buzzed him in advance so he could have helped us carry our luggage up the stairs. Despite one reviewer\u2019s opinion, we liked the old-fashioned lift, and had no complaints using it. It definitely is an old fashioned, quaint, lift. However, we found it charming, with sufficient room for our two huge, over-stuffed duffel bags. If someone is so tired they don\u2019t want to take the 3 flights of stairs to Deko\u2019s floor, the lift works perfectly, even if it moves slower than the modern elevators. Again, it all depends on a traveler\u2019s expectations and standards. I would also take a different view of comments that there is no reception or concierge at Deko. I travel a fair amount for business, and we are fortunate enough to be able to vacation a couple times a year, occassionally splurging at luxury hotels. We felt that Marco and Serena were more helpful, and spot-on with their restaurant recommendations, and places to see, than any other hotel in which I\u2019ve stayed. We also did not have any problem with the fact we were on our own after Marco and Serena left late in the evening. We made sure that if we wanted extra towels or supplies, we asked for them before they left. But we knew before arriving that we were not staying at a hotel with a staff on site 24 hours a day. I rarely, if ever, order room service or have a need to contact the hotel staff once I\u2019m in for the evening. If you value that level of service, you may want to consider booking at a different hotel. The service and advice that Marco and Serena willingly offer is more sincere and personalized than I\u2019ve received at well known 5 star hotels. As the other reviewers have noted, when we checked in, Marco shared a complimentary drink of our choice while he showed us on a map his favorite tourist attractions and sites, and his favorite restaurants. I highly recommend following Marco\u2019s restaurant recommendations. We dined at 4 of the 5 recommended restaurants, and each meal was fantastic, reasonably priced, and busy with many more locals than tourists. Marco and Serena recommend restaurants that they go to when they get a chance to eat out. At the end of the day, when we returned to Deko, Marco and Serena wanted to hear about our experiences as we shared a drink at the little bar in the breakfast area off the lobby. The hotel is not in the middle of the crowded tourist sites, or within throwing distance of the Colosseum, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, etc. For us, however, Deko is perfectly situated because it was an easy 7 to 10 minute walk from the Spanish Steps and a Metro and bus stop to take you to any spot in Rome. Yet the neighborhood is quiet, peaceful and secure. The hotel is located in a safe area, a block from the U.S. Embassy and the police station. You need a key to enter the historic building in which Deko Rome is located, and you need a second key to get into Deko\u2019s reception and rooms. The hotel is only 3 blocks from the Villa Borghese, the equivalent of New York\u2019s Central Park. If you are in Rome on a Sunday and have time, we highly recommend strolling through the park to mingle with the locals and their families taking boat rides on the ponds, picnicking, and riding bicycles. The hotel is new and the rooms are decorated in a modern style, with the newest conveniences, such as fog-free bathroom mirrors, electronically controlled flat screen T.V\u2019s and AC. The pictures on the hotel's website and from the TA reviewers accurately show the condition and decor of the lobby, breakfast area, and rooms. The rooms are quiet, with heavy curtains shutting out any noise from the outside. We booked the junior suite (the room with a picture of an elephant as seen on the hotel\u2019s website), which had a large living area with a large couch, in addition to the good sized bedroom and king sized bed (as oppposed to the more typical arrangement of pushing together two twin beds). The bathrooms were relatively large, with great water pressure and shower doors to keep the floors from getting soaked. The room and bathroom were spotless and sanitized each day. Because we paid for an all-inclusive rate, the water, juice and prosecco in the mini-fridge was included in our rate. Monica, who is as sweet as Marco and Serena, helped prepare at least one of our breakfasts, and should be applauded for keeping the rooms so clean. The breakfasts are typical of many other Italian hotels, and varied little each morning. But there was more than enough food, including cereal, yogurt, croissants, cheese, ham and bread (to make a sandwich), toast and jam. You can order a variety of juices and coffee made to your likeing. The cappiccinos were great. If I was going to nit-pick, and try and find areas for improvement, I\u2019d suggest that Marco and Serena add a dresser or armoire to increase the storage space in each room. Our room had a standing closet with room to hang a few items of clothing, but there was nothing to store our clothes if we wanted to unpack for our stay. Also, when you book your room, you may want to call Marco or Serena and ask if the room is adjacent to the breakfast area. When breakfast was being served, you could hear the voices and meals being prepared through the walls. It didn\u2019t bother us, because we were getting up by around 8 or 8:30 to get started on our day. But if you plan on sleeping in, it may be worth asking for a room set away from the breakfast area. In conclusion, we knew the sort of hotel we were looking for, and found it. We could not have known, however, that we\u2019d meet hotel owners and staff that clearly enjoy getting to know their guests and doing all they can to ensure their guests have a wonderful experience while visiting Rome. Thank you Marco, Serena, and Monica, for making us feel welcome in your wonderful city.

We were greeted with open arms and welcomed to the city of Rome with an offer of breakfast at 4:30 am (US time) after our overnight flight from Boston. After only a few minutes and a brief conversation, we knew we had found some very special people. Our intent was to stay at a small boutique hotel, well appointed, clean and close to the center of Rome, and that is exactly what we found; not to mention that\u2019s its brand new, in a beautiful historic building with marble floors and lots of security. We stayed for a total of five nights in two different rooms, pre and post our cruise. Both rooms were lovely but we enjoyed number 3 that opened up to the street we were on. The pictures provided on this site are the real thing. Feeling very safe with the US embassy on one side and a police station on the other; we were able to walk around after dark. You are close to taxis, buses and the subway. Actually, Marco will call you a cab that will pick you up at the front door. They arranged tickets, limo\u2019s and recommended sightseeing and local restaurants that were perfect for us. We had everything we needed/wanted including a great breakfast of Italian pastries, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, cheese, meats and breads served with coffee and tea in a delightful caf\u00e9 setting. The most impressive times were our personal conversations with Marco, Serena and Monica. They talked about the places to visit in their city but more importantly their lives, the culture and their dreams, and guess what; they were truly interested in ours. When we left, it was like leaving family behind, not knowing if we would ever see them again. You manage to \u201cbump\u201d into people along your journey that make a difference in the world and we found three of them at this hotel.

The rooms are good sized, stylishly decorated and have all the expected things of a standard boutique hotel (tv, desk, safe, closet, etc). The room, common area and amenities are not what you would find from a five star such as the Four Seasons but you would be missing out if you made your decision based on that alone. Sure you compromise certain things bigger hotels can offer like a gym, room service, etc but why would anyone bother to workout in a hotel gym when they can walk or run around the city of Rome and why would anyone ever eat food served by a hotel line chef when you have hundreds of amazing places right outside your door? What sets this place apart from all other options in Rome aside from the value are the hotel's owners, Marco and Serena. In a nutshell, this young and attractive couple understand what travelers want and fill a major void in the hospitality industry today - value accommodations with a personal touch. Serena checked us in with a beautiful smile and a warm and friendly demeanor. She proceeded to spend 45 minutes pointing out all the city's attractions, restaurants, stores and anything else we were interested in using a handy city map while Marco served us refreshing cocktails from the bar. In all my travels, no concierge has ever been more spot on with their restaurant and shopping recommendations than Marco and Serena. Every place we visited based on their recommendations were truly great. Not only did Marco and Serena book our reservations, they had their waiter friends take care of us when we got to the restaurant. I would highly recommend the Deko Rome to anyone looking for a great value and experience. Notes: The hotel serves a generous portioned breakfast in the mornings served by Marco and Serena. Morning conversations are also a fun time as you plan the exciting day ahead. The hotel is near the popular Via Veneto, Villa Borghese, Spanish Steps, the Westin hotel, the US Consulate and the local police station. Taxi rides to most areas in the city are about 10 euro but walking + metro are also convenient.

We actually took Marco's advice (thankfully) to have him book us a taxi from the airport to the hotel for 50euro, and the driver was waiting for us with a sign. He drove a newer Mercedes and was an awesome young fellow. What was even better was that there was a transit strike that day and we would not have been able to get to the hotel by bus or train anyway, and having booked the taxi thru Marco ensured we were not ripped off by an illegal taxi at the airport. The trafiic and the drivers in Rome are really crazy so be prepared for it, there is nothing like it I have ever seen before. Breakfast is served each morning with fresh fruit, cereal, ham/cheese, baking and tea/coffee and on evenings when we were home while Marco was still working, he offered us glasses of wine or presecco (for free) while we visited with him about our day.

We had a large room on the quieter side of the building. It had a separate bedroom with crib and the living area had a pull-out sofa bed as well. Everything was brand new and working well. There was also air conditioning which we could control and two flat screen TVs. They also provided free wi-fi.

It was a very generous breakfast, which included ham, cheese, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, breads, juice, tea/coffee and/or milk. It was so large that we had to tell them not to give us so much! And Serena and Marco would always offer a coffee to us when we returned to the hotel after being out. There is also a small grocery store just below in the same building (Despar). Serena and Marco allowed us to use their microwave to heat up any food for our kids. The location was very convenient. We were 10 mins from two Metro stations: Spagna and Barberini.

There are also some nice restaurants very nearby and a couple of car rental places less than 5 mins away (Europcar and Avis). Serena and Marco provided us with several restaurant suggestions and they were all very good. The staff and service definitely exceeded our expectations.
