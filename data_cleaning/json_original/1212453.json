I was somewhat leery of staying here due to the bad reviews, but after my previously booked hotel charged me, then refused to accommodate me, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have many options for the price I was able to pay. Enough of that. The hotel was a $20 shuttle ride from MIA. The hotel is not well marked, but if you have the addressee the shuttle/taxi should not have any problem finding it. Check in time is 3:00pm and there is a locked closet available to leave your stuff if you like. Fast wifi is avaible in the lobby and some rooms. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The sea is across the street. There are several bargain restaurants and drug stores within a 5 minute walk of the hotel. Several busses pass every hour headed for South Beach and Aventura mall, both of which are a $2 ride away. As for the rooms themselves, I was impressed. For the price that I paid, I can not believe the negative reviews that people have posted regarding this gem! The room was roomy, clean, and quiet. The shower was hot, water pressure was great. The bed was to die for! The fridge was cold and quiet. The channels on the TV were slightly fuzzy and the phone appeared to be broken but I did not mention the issue to the staff because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care.

(This was at midnight after a long day of traveling.) The room was dirty with stains on the walls and ceilings and it smelled. There was no blanket on the bed (as another reviewer stated). It was incredibly noisy because people sit on the porch of the hotel next door talking until 3:00 a.m. The maids do a very mediocre job of cleaning the rooms. Also, they slam doors early in the morning as they are cleaning requiring you to wake up when they start their shfit. The hallways are tiled, and this makes the sound echo very loudly.
