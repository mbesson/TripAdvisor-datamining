Maybe the rooms are deliberately bland to make you spend time in the bar ! The bar area was OK, but not somewhere I would be able to relax.

Iv stayed here before and again was not disapointed. I would not pay the rack rate or above the \u00a360-\u00a370 a night price mainly as you can get better in London for facilities etc but if your wanting a comfortable cheap place to pop your head down then this is perfect. People do complain about having bed linen in rooms and having to make up the spare beds.... Well initially the spare beds are the sofas and also couples book family rooms just for 2 on occassion therefore easier to have the linen available to dress as pleased. Bearing in mind Travelodge is a 'BUDGET ' hotel chain they cut their costs by id imagine sticking to a tight schedule along with no fluff and extras! We never had the linen in our room yet we booked a room for 3 adults. We did check in at 12 as we could on our early check in and the cleaner was on our floor doing other rooms so was easy enough to obtain the linen. We were out all day and into early evening and were back at the hotel for around 9pm. (no clubbing for me as 6 months pregnant lol) The beds were ok but we were on 1st floor at front of hotel. Bit noisy with traffic and people that had enjoyed a few drinks lol.... This did disturb our sleep but to be honest your staying in central london on a weekend so was to be expected. If this will ruin your stay i suggest requesting a quiet room (i have requested a quiet room overlooking what the receptionist said is courtyard area for when i stay again in April with my husband and 4 year old daughter as this may affect her nights sleep) The breakfast is typical Travelodge, and having experienced one last year at the Covent garden Travelodge we did opt to pre book again mainly as on our 1st morning we wanted to be up and out as we had purchased bus tickets on the 'Original tour' and wanted to make the most of our day. Its nothing special and im sure the scrambled egg is made from a powder form but for the bacon, bread, Croisants, yogurts, Muffins & cereals it was more than adequate, coffee tea & juices included as well. theres plenty of places outside the hotel to eat for lunches etc and there is a Tesco express couple doors down which was handy. Theres also places like Garfunkels and frankie & bennys that do 2 for 1 breakfasts/2 for \u00a310 but would have to possibly get tubes or walk a bit further a field for those. The bar is 24hours and food & drinks can be got at all hours. On our 2nd night we had some friends also stay but as they were there for the nightlife we never really saw them. They had a few drinks in the bar and for central london the prices are reasonable. Considering the 24hour bar aspect we were not disturbed in our room and there is security at the reception (its not rowdy or anything, just think they are there for peace of mind) Overall if you were wanting a base and somewhere clean with access to central london it is perfect. I have also stayed at the Covent Garden Travelodge which is exactly the same as this one and just has the edge over moorgate but only for location... We saved about \u00a350 by staying at Moorgate so thats the reason this one won this time (& when i go in April ) Remember you pay budget prices then expect a budget (clean) hotel", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cMuch better Travelodge experience\u201d", "Author": "JellyNump", "ReviewID": "UR124855246", "Content": "It really does depend which Tracelidge you go to but this one was very good.

I did, however, ask for extra pillows, as we only had one each and they were extremely thin. The lady at the desk seemed unwilling to part with any and eventually gave us just one - rather poor, I thought.

The very high ceiling makes the room seem smaller than it is. It was large enough for the sofa bed to be made but doesn't leave much space. As expected it was Travelodge clean. However 1 pillow was so stained with some form of bodily fluid, it was visable through the pillow case. When my husband requested a clean pillow the Receptionist's answer was 'we dont have any spare pillows' he was warned that i wouldn't like this response, and my Husband was right! 7 years in Front of House and i'd have not accepted that as an answer from my staff! I took the offending pillow to reception and grumpily (a week of family illness + lack of sleep + drving 3 hours to London = one scratchy lady!) I informed the Receptionist that 'there was no way i was going to put my head on this pillow and not to tell me that there are no spare pillows' a clean (ish) pillow was brought to our room 5 mins later. I feel that i shouldn't have to get grumpy to get a clean pillow and House Keeping should be picking things like this up, regarless of being a budget hotel or not. We were at the back of the hotel over looking an office block due to be knocked down so no city veiw.

But the price and importantly the location swung it for myself and two friends going to see Manic Street Preachers at the o2, as we decided to travel there and back by the Thames Clipper boat, which departed from London Bridge, which is just a few stops away on the Northern Line. The hotel was just 5 mins from Old Street underground station, we passed a couple of supermarkets, cafes, pubs and a Subway on the way to the hotel. Not much else around, it\u2019s mainly offices and apartments, but in the grand scheme of things the location of the hotel is in great, as it\u2019s so centrally located on the underground network. We arrived after the 3pm check-in time, there was a small queue at the desk, tried to use the automatic check-in machines, but all three were out of service. Once served check-in was swift. We wanted to eat before heading to the concert, but the restaurant hadn\u2019t started serving at that time, the reception staff, without any prompting from us, went off and kindly checked if the kitchen could do anything for us, they apologised as they couldn\u2019t help us, which was no problem. So I checked that we were okay to dial in a pizza and they were fine with it. In fact, talking of the staff, he check-in staff, bar staff and security guards were all fantastically helpful and lovely, especially the security guards. We had booked a family room, which was at the back of the hotel. It had a double bed and a twin sofa bed, the bed was comfortable the sofa bed a bit too firm and not very comfortable at all. The room also had a bath and a shower en-suite, small flat screen TV, desk , chair, open wardrobe and tea and coffee facilities. There was no hairdryer, but reception lent us a powerful one for a strict 45 mins! Our room was basic, a little bit bare and drab, but to be fair, for the money and location it was perfectly adequate. Also, when I had been looking in to booking a hotel room, some of Travelodge\u2019s rivals had a silly rule that more than two adults were not allowed to share a room, which did not suit us three young women who were spending a girlie weekend in London! So we were happy that we could be accommodated by Travelodge. After the gig, we returned to the hotel at about 1am and made use of the comfortable 24 hour bar and also had a bit of snacky bar food which we had no complaints over. We were pleasantly surprised by the noon check-out the next day, which was great as we were shattered. Check-out was as quick as check-in and the receptionist asked if out stay had been good. So, in summary, the location and price were good, the room basic, yet adequate, the communal facilities were great and the staff excellent.

Not bad for ctrl London on NYE! (Breakfast was \u00a36.95 each and kids eat free, which we added). First off, location, well its easy enough to get to from either Moorgate or Old St tubes on the Northern Line. Its on the busy noisy City Road, so don\u2019t expect peace and tranquillity, at any time 24/7! There are the usual coffee shops around the place, Pret, Nero etc, plus a Metro Sainsbury\u2019s & Tesco within 5mins walk, and a nice looking caf\u00e9 besides Old St tube (which sadly, was closed). On arrival at 2:25, as we had been travelling for 3hrs, and had young kids with us, we asked if we could check in (normal check-in time is 3pm) and was told that would be an extra \u00a310, there is no flexibility with this, which peeved me! and was then told abruptly by the receptionist \"i don\u2019t make the rules\" (zero customer service niceties). When we came back at 2:55 there was now along queue of people waiting to check in, and the foyer was busy; they have self service machines, so we tried this, only it didn\u2019t recognise our booking! So then we waited in line and checked in after a phone call to the house keeper to check if the room was ready. We were in room 254. All TL rooms are basic, so you know in advance what you\u2019re going to get, a bed, TV, bath-shower/WC. All fine & clean. The mattress of the bed was the softest I have ever tried, very uncomfortable, but the sofa bed for 2 kids was fine. The TV didn\u2019t have a remote control, so we went back down to reception and asked for one which was brought up to our room. Most annoying were the noise from adjacent rooms, OK it was NYE so we expected partying, but the constant slamming of door, shouting & screaming from people running up and down the corridors and the loud music was rather testing, even mid-afternoon, early evening! We were out until abt 1:15am, and came back to note the hotel had \u201cSecurity\u201d staff in the foyer, and the bar open 24hrs. We got to sleep at 2-sih, only to be woken up between 4-5am, from returning revellers, no problem, we\u2019d expected that and it soon came down, plus I knew we\u2019d take our revenge when we were getting up at 9 for breakfast, and not trying to be quiet in our room! \uf04a So we eventually went down for breakfast at about 930, to be met by a queue into the restaurant/bar area, which was full of people, we ended up be sat on the sofa /coffee table area as there were no dining tables. What then followed can only be described as a food fight, you would be fortunate to get anything unless waiting in line, with people jostling and barging in front to get at whatever that could grab, not pretty, not relaxed not enjoyable, and food of poor quality and not enough staff to organize the place. Kids managed to get some insipid watery scrambled eggs sausage/beans and toast and we had breads/pastry and juices; it\u2019s a budget hotel, you get what you pay for, don\u2019t expect more.

We got hungry so went to grab some food at reception, they cook to order even if it's basic you can take it up to the room with you with affordable prices I think it was all night as well (just order at the bar). Breakfast was all you can eat too and well worth paying for, not a bad hotel to stay in what with a bar that serves all night although you need your room card for use of toilets and the bar past 11pm which is fairs.

We used the small towel as a bath mat. We stayed at Premier Inn before deciding to try Travelodge and decided to strike Travelodge off our list of hotels to stay after this experience.

Unlike Premier Inn and Comfort Inn, they also did not bother to lay out the beds for my family of 4 persons. So I gave them a feedback that it is unlikely I will stay with them again or recommend their chain to anyone soon. Another thing to add for this particular hotel - it is about 8 mins walk from the tube and no barrier free access at tube meaning you have to drag your luggage up the flight of stairs if you travel by the tube.

It's in London, near to a Underground station, not in the nicest part of London by any means, but it is cheap. I paid \u00a368 including breakfast. However, you may choose to spend a little more. I was given a room facing the inner 'courtyard'. I use this term very loosely. What it actually overlooked was the air ducts and air-conditioning units on the roof of the reception area/restaurant below. So if you are on level 1, they are literally outside your window. Speaking of the window, there is a wire lock on it, preventing it from opening more than 3 inches, this makes an already very warm hotel room into a very hot hotel room. Because the hotel and aforementioned courtyard form a triangle, the seven floors of the hotel prevent any breeze that may be about, entering the window. There is no air-conditioning unit, so I awoke several times from 4am onwards, sweating and uncomfortable. The room is sparse, with no pictures. The TV signal is ropey to say the least and the bed is extremely low. All this combined gives the impression of a prison cell. If you think the rooms are warm, wait until you need to summon a lift. The lift vestibules are little toasty ovens, which make you want to pass out until you arrive on the ground floor and make a dash for the cooling sanctuary of the street. The rooms are relatively clean, with no more marks than can be expected for a hotel pitching itself at the lower end of the market. I thought the breakfast was quite nice, not too pricey for London and done in a buffet fashion, so you can help yourself to as much as you would want.

I should have been suspicious really though, given that it was a fairly last minute booking and still had some availability. I have rarely known London hotels to be so busy - only hostels or very high price rooms available anywhere in zone 1! I booked online and price wasn't cheap at \u00a3149 for one person and breakfast extra. I arrived early but check in can' be performed even a minute early as apparently they need to wait for 'their systems to change over'? - what is all that about? Viewed this with suspicion, as was invited to pay more to get in room 40 mins early! Didn't bother and was offered to sit in the bar area and someone would be with me to get me a drink. Almost an hour later, nobody had turned up and I wasn't that bothered really, as by then the room (same as used for all meals taken in hotel) had filled up with people (big student parties it seemed) and luggage, was extremely hot and tables were so sticky that any papers I was trying to read had stuck to them. I decided to return to the foyer and get into the queue that was forming there and I favoured the human check in choice over the machines. By 5 mins past 3 o'clock that part had been completed relatively smoothly and I was quite impressed to be told I had a room on the 1st floor. Even more impressive to find it was close to the lift. That is where being impressed left me! The hotel (and rooms it seems) are a strange shape due to age and previous use of building. It is also unbearably hot in places and no air con. I must have booked one of their last available rooms as it was a disabled room, although I did not have those requirements. The corridor was such a tight turn from the lift though that a wheelchair user would surely struggle to get to the room door. The room overlooked the back of the hotel and so didn't suffer with noise thankfully, as having the only window open a crack (all that is possible) was essential. The window was tiny and if I left the blind up then every other room overlooking this back triangle could see down and into my room. The only view was other postage stamp windows and the odd dirty tissue somebody had lobbed out onto the roof space - not pleasant! The blind was just a plain, grubby cream colour. By contrast to many posts on here, the room itself was vast! It would probably taken around 10 mobility scooters and needed them too! In all of that space stood a solitary, very plain and minimal bed. Just a pillow and white duvet and no colour at all (although the bedding did appear clean). The only other 'furniture' in the whole room was one plastic chair and something resembling a plank for a desk and a small, open hanging space joined to the end. The whole room looked as though someone had moved all the furniture out and then just put a bed back. I coughed and nearly scared myself, as the noise echoed around the space. Although the bed seemed clean, sadly the carpet wasn't and I kept my shoes right by the bed! The TV (stood on the 'shelf') was very basic and no menu facility for programmes. It was all a bit 'old'. The worst was still to cocme though, with the bathroom! Being a disabled room, it was a walk-in wet room. That wouldn't present me with problems - had it been clean! The whole room and shower / toilet area looked as though the floors were dirty - probably from wheelchairs? Not sure, but the floor surface in the shower / toilet area was damaged and had dirty marks and black areas in the cracks and joins. Worse still, at low level the tiles and floor edges were orange with scum and there was no way I was going in there with bare feet. I see cleaner showers on basic camp sites! The shower curtains also had some strange red marks, which could have been scum but looked like dried blood. Good job I was only there one night as the shower didn't appeal! The whole thing was like an 'unpadded cell' and with room for more prisoners beds to be moved in! Breakfast was interesting, as I was already expecting the sticky tables (and not disappointed!). The tables are wiped, but the varnish appears to have given up and is permanently sticky, so surely can't be cleaned hygenically. Even the salt pots are stuck to the tables and it certainly stops you eating with elbows on the table! The food itself wasn't too bad, as they can't go far wrong with cereals and yoghurts that are packaged and there is enough to pick from to get by without having to eat anything prepared by the hotel, if you are by now suspicious of hygiene. The staff were courteous enough as well, although the minute you get up to fetch something else from the self-service buffet, your table is completely cleared. That necessitated starting all over again and fetching another drink etc,, as there was no way I was leaving my handbag on the chair to show the table was in use, given the traffic through the dining area. I had thought a nearly full cup of copy would mean the place might be left for a few minutes, but by the time I had collected a croissant and jam everything had been removed! If I had paid anything under \u00a3100, then I might have expected these standards. However, at \u00a3149 plus \u00a36.95 for breakfast, I expected something better. Premier Inns and Holiday Inn Express have always been good, basic accommodation and something along the lines I was expecting. This 'hotel' is far inferior. The member of staff on reception did ask if my stay had been comfortable as I handed in my room key card. I replied that the room had been disappointing and her response was that the building was very old and meant that room shapes were unusual. Obviously this must also make cleaning a challenge too?!! About time they reinvested some of the money they charge you in refreshing, repairing and generally maintaining I think.

On arrival we had to wait for check in as we had arrived too early, no problem this gave us a chance to check out the facilities. An ample bar and a good sized restraunt area with televisions and 4 PC's for internet use. So first impressions were fairly good on what we had seen so far. After a pleasant check-in from one of the employees we proceeded though the door to the lift area. THIS is where the proverbial hit the fan (well it would have done if we had had one). The lift foyers were unbearable and oppressively hot and smelly, the corridors are not that much better, thankfully we were only on the second floor and used the stairs a lot but even then a sat nav would have been useful to find them. The room was AWFUL, it was extremely tight and narrow and was far from being a family room, I would struggle to describe it as a double actually. The window is set out quite high looking out on to a disused building opposite which served to add to the feeling of quite \"prison like\". The bed was extremely soft and uncomfortable and you slid into the middle all the time and with no air conditioning became exceedingly hot at night which gave us sleepless nights along with the expected noise. The bathroom faired even worse, the air extractor didnt work which left you feeling rather faint by the time you had finished your shower and made the bathroom smell of damp continually, the soap was never replenished(had to complain before I got any more) paint was peeling off the walls and generally the cleanliness was of a poor standard. We did not eat very much in the restaraunt as the food was of the usual frozen chuck it in the deep fat fryer range served on tables that were very sticky. The location of this hotel is ok and has plenty of shops etc close by. There are are 2 tube stations within 5 minutes walk and service is generally very good, however to get to the centre of London you do need to change tubes and if you dont have any savvy about you could become quite confusing. Overall - Good location with good local amenities and good transport links. Travelodge advertises great value accomodation and at \u00a319 or \u00a329 a night I would agree however 2 of our nights were in excess of \u00a370 and at that price I would expect more.

We were in over the weekend of 30 June-3 July, so experienced one workday night, Friday and Saturday nights, and Sunday night. Sunday was the only night when the noise level from outside the room was what I'd call \"low\". Saturday night was disturbing, with a loud party outside and all the noise reverberating around the buildings, and it went on through the wee hours. The other two nights were tolerable. My advice is to bring ear plugs, just in case. The room itself, on floor 1 facing Tabernacle St was spartan and very clean, with a teapot and coffee/tea, sugar etc for the morning brew. One small bar of soap was provided in the bath. Towels are of excellent quality, very large and absorbent. Pillows are small, and the basic mattress was covered with a base sheet and a very nice comforter. We requested bedding for the sofa bed and received it promptly. Hot water was in plentiful supply. Despite the noise we experienced I still give this hotel a good rating because of the positive room attributes and its location relative to many places of interest, good transport by numerous bus routes and Moorgate and Old Street underground stations a short walk, and proximity to Spitalfields. If the hotel restaurant doesn't suit you there are many choices within a short walking distance. Over the weekend the neighborhood slows down (except for nightlife). Customer service was helpful in sorting out a reservation change using the telephone once we got through to the right person; my opinion of the website and first point of contact for customer service is that there's room for improvement. Otherwise check in was smooth. Summation: noise level for my room was almost enough to make me question my choice, but the positives outweigh that one big negative and combined with a very competitive room tariff provide the incentive to give this one your consideration when researching hotels in central London.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Angus, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cBasic, not particularly cheap, but okay.

We had a few gripes about the place but the location (for us anyway) was the saving grace.. On arrival we noticed that the rooms and public areas were uncomfortably warm, it was in the low 20's deg C outside and the hotel doesn't seem to have any aircon other than at the reception area. Our room on the 7th floor was hot most of the time, the window had a security wire attached that prevented it being opened more than about 15 cm. The room was very basic with only some tea and coffee making facilities and a TV (without remote control). The mattress was very soft and the double bed was made up with only one pillow each. There was a single spare pillow in the room and we managed to request another from reception. We didn't eat in the hotel as previous Travelodge dining experiences have been a disappointment. Here's a few tips if you do decide to stay here - there are two underground stations nearby, Old Street to the north and Moorgate to the South, each are around 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Outside the hotel are bus stops with regular services including night buses. Within a few minutes walk are a Subway sandwich place, a Starbucks, a few pubs and a cafe called 'Eat'. Leaving the hotel entrance and turning right will take you to a small Tesco market shop and a little further on a Sainsbury's. The Sainsburys has more choice and better opening hours than the Tesco. Try and buy any drinks or snacks from either of these two shops as the vending machines in the hotel are very expensive. There is wifi in the hotel but you will have to pay crazy prices to use it. Best to use your mobile phone for internet access if it is equipped to do so. No hairdryer, valuables safe, ironing board, bath mat, complimentary soap or toiletries are provided in the room so make allowance for this before arriving.

I know it's a no frills hotel and very cheap for London standards (standard price for other European countries), but using this as an excuse to not store guest luggage is lack of customer care, IMHO. Instead, I was pointed to luggage lockers in Liverpool St station, which is 15 mins by foot. Well the hotel location is between Old St and Moorgate station, and like I said, 15 mins by foot to Liverpool St station. Good if you can use the Northern line, and average if you need the Met/Circle lines as these lines are very hit and miss in terms of service. It is not very close to tourist attractions, unless you want to see financial institutions or the \"Gurkin\" building. I was very lucky to be given a room on the 1st floor which was at the back side of the hotel. It was a large room with a twin bed. There was a small LCD TV which does NOT come with remote. Contrary to another review, there were tea/coffee making facilities in my room. And in the toilet/shower room, I got a small soap and toilet paper at least. There was no bath - only floorspace to take a shower, although there is a plastic seat to sit on. The hotel is clean and my room did not require any renovation. The service I received was polite and helpful. But I can easily believe that this chain is owned by Easyjet or Ryanair, since they charge extra for early check-in / late check-out. Again, I would NOT say that the price is cheap even for London, as the location is actually not THAT convenient for going to the tourist spots.

After about the third day, the manager organised for our entire booking to be entered into the system and we had no further problems. Our room was a double on the first floor with a window opening onto an internal view of the hotel. No Traffic noise. No corridor noise. No lift noise. Unfortunately on the first day we also had no hot water. (Mrs Maccas37 was NOT impressed) Throughout our stay the hot-water occasionally ran out in the evenings, but was always OK in the mornings. The shower didn\u2019t drain particularly well either. Of the three lifts in the building one was out of service for our entire stay and a second was out of order for about three days, but as we were on the first floor we often took the stairs anyway. Breakfast was plentiful but at over 7 pounds each, was a bit pricey. We made the call that it was worth it as it meant we could nip down for breakfast, then return to the room to brush our teeth and get \u2018rugged up\u2019 for the wintery weather on the streets of London. We tried the restaurant once in the evening and it was dreadful. There are at least 3 or 4 places nearby to get a decent meal. Because we were staying for an extended period, we needed to do some clothes washing and found a place in Holborn that we were able to get to by catching a bus from just near Old Street Station. Very handy as we were able to drop the clothes off for a \u2018service wash\u2019 in the morning, catch the tube from Holborn Station to wherever we wanted to go, then pick the clean clothes up on the way back.

The price for a double room was surprisingly high - similar to other London hotels, despite it being a \"cheap\" Travelodge - although it's fairly central so that might be why. The automatic sliding doors at the front of the hotel have \"Welcome\" printed on them, so it's a bit of a surprise to everyone that they do precisely nothing when you approach them from the outside. Security is understandable in London, but while waiting in the lobby saw dozens of people nearly bumping into the doors because of the mixed message of the signs. Even for a budget hotel the rooms are incredibly sparse, without phone or indeed TV remote control. One of the three lifts was out of order when we were there, and the corridors were piercingly white and spare, like a conference centre. Our room was functional, but that was it. Compared to similar hotels it felt like someone had gone in before us and removed anything that might make it feel relaxing. The walls were white and bare (except where they'd been scuffed), the furniture all rock-hard pine/MDF, we're still not sure our heater worked, there was no bath mat, the bathroom was a bit damp-towel smelly (although spotlessly clean) and the single chair was one of those stackable plastic ones. If you tripped anywhere in the room you'd land on either a sharp corner or the bed. None of the hen or stag do's we saw milling in the foyer actually kept us awake in the end, but around 3.30am we were subjected to ten minutes of incredibly loud drum & bass that shook the windows. It's still not clear where from: maybe a nearby club was doing some grand finale, or maybe it was just a renegade taxi. The hotel was sharply understaffed, although what staff we saw were polite; frequently queues would develop at the front desk when the only person staffing it was required elsewhere. Checking out was a complete mystery - the desk was deserted when we did so - and we think we were right in just discarding our keycard in a slot provided. Who knows? Maybe even now they're wondering where we got to. All in all, it was a place to lay our heads, and there was no real deal breaker - and you could probably do worse in central London - but in future we'd go for somewhere a little further out, as the overwhelming sparseness and shoestringness (even compared to Travelodges and Premier Inns elsewhere) didn't really add to the enjoyment of our stay.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBasic, but does the job\u201d", "Author": "RS10675", "ReviewID": "UR92908452", "Content": "I've stayed at this Travelodge a few times.

Overall we had a good stay at this Travelodge. It's located in a convenient location; only a 5 minute walk away from 2 different tube stations, and within walking distance of some attraction such as Spittafield markets, and the Shoreditch area which has lots of nice bars to have a few drinks in the evening. Check-in was good. We had paid for early check in, so when we arrived at the hotel a few minutes to twelve we checked in straight away, which took only a couple of minutes as there was no line whatsoever. The room was as what can be expected of Travelodge; basic, but clean. We were on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel, and although there was some exterior noise, we had expected this (there is a 'warning' on the travelodge website), so we had brought earplugs and slept perfectly. Okay, so there are no toiletries/hairdryers/etc., but this is also stated on the website, so again, not a problem, since we knew what to expect. The only negative things I could say is that there was too little toiletpaper in the room (every day we would have to go down to the check in desk and ask for more), and every day when we returned to the hotel in the evening, the card to my room wouldn't work anymore, so I'd have to go back to the desk and have it reset. However, all in all, I think this is more or less the best value for money one can get in London. We paid 120 pounds in total for 3 nights, so approximately 13 pounds a person a night. In London one can barely get a bed in a hostel dorm for this price, and here we had our own room + ensuite bathroom.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly Average\u201d", "Author": "CBRY", "ReviewID": "UR90021168", "Content": "Stayed here for one night while in London on a hen weekend.

No phones in room so if you want to have a rant you cant. On a positive note the room had a basic standard of cleanliness, the shower was very nice when the water eventually warmed up. My other half said the room was cold but the heater soon warmed it up and I wasnt cold in there. The foyer is ok with an express check in facility so that was pretty straight forward, there is a cafe/bar for you on site with vending machines in the foyer. The location is good, near to theatres (taxi distance) and there are a few pubs nearby. I would have been very disappointed had i spent full price to stay here, its a large lodge with many rooms, coridoors need a bit of a facelift but decor was basic throughout. If you are able to get this hotel cheap rates I think you'll be satisfied, top price you would expect more from a Travelodge. I cant comment on the staff as i never spoke to them but some people on here have written reviews that say they were rude. Id like to give a pretty fair report by saying it's ok, it is noisy but what would one expect from its location. I would recommend to a friend but would state these issues prior to their travel.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money and suitable for family with children\u201d", "Author": "Rachel66", "ReviewID": "UR60850876", "Content": "Stayed over the Easter Holidays with husband, 10 year old and 4 year old.

My friends and I had booked this hotel in advance last July for a concert. We had planned in advance to check in early as we were getting the over night bus from Glasgow so we paid the \u00a310 early check in fee when we booked. We had booked a saver family room for the three of us. Check in - After arriving into London at 7am we did a few tourist things til we were able to check, We got to the hotel at 1145 we thought we would chance our luck incase they would let us check in a wee bit earlier but the very RUDE girl on reception said we have to wait til early check in which starts at 1200. We told her we'd wait in the bar which we did and had a few drinks which were seriously over priced. At 12 we went back to reception and the rude girl told us there were no family rooms ready and it would be another 20mins before they would have one for us. So went back to the bar for another over priced round. There was a family at the table next to us and they were boasting to another family who had just came in that they had arrived at 1045 and were told if they had paid \u00a310 there and then they could check in and get a room, so the 2nd family went to reception and within minutes returned with the key to a family room. As we had been told we werent allowed to check in before 12 and then told that there were no rooms ready for us at 1200 we weren't exactly happy. At reception there was now a rude man aswell as the rude woman who said she thought we had left. 1310 we got our room. Our second night stay was booked under my friends name so we asked if we could just keep the same room and the man said that it was fine but when we came down for breakfast the next morning the new man on reception was a bit hostile towards us. he had no change and asked us to get the correct change before we could eat, we asked could we not bring it down after breakfast and he said no we're not allowed because we are checking out. We then told him we weren't and that we had the 2nd booking that the rude man from the day before had okayed us for keeping the same room, we also told him of the problems from the day before. After we went back to our room to find change to pay for breakfast the man on reception told us that we have to give our credit card details, I told him that my details were already on their system. This was another trip back to the room before breakfast. We told him that were weren't happy about the way the staff had treated us, we were not offered any refund on our early check in fee nor an apology. when we finally got to breakfast - not a lot of selection but it is a travelodge so didnt expect much but no clean cups or cutlery and lots of dirty dishes left by the food which i found a little un hygenic. The room itself was ok very basic, but walls are paper thin can hear everything thats going on outside. Location was a 2 minute walk from Moorgate tube station so handy for getting around central London. My friends and I have stayed here before and never had any problems but after this experience we will not be going back or reccomending it to anyone.

Our room was at the front of the hotel, it was a large family room, number 315 (I normally book family rooms for the additional space - same price as normal room), it was immaculately clean, spacious, king size bed (2 pillows only but as we had booked family room we got one more for the additional sofabed), if you like soft to medium beds you will LOVE the beds here (myself and my daughter loved it for comfort and size), views of the armoury opposite (like a beautiful old castle).

The shower head is fixed on the shower and it makes it hard to take a shower without making your hair wet. Quite disturbing! The biggest minus of the room was that there was soooo much noise from the clubs in the neighborhood on friday and saturday night - there were 2 clubs under our window. There was also plenty of noise from inside the hotel - children running and screaming in the corridor very early in the morning plus doors slamming. Finally the bed mattress was of very poor quality.

I\u2019ll start with the ****WORST THING BY FAR *** so you don\u2019t miss it\u2014this hotel overbooks it\u2019s rooms on purpose in expectation that some people won\u2019t turn up, so if you check in late you may very well find there\u2019s no room for you. This was the reason it was finally and deservedly blacklisted by my company- some colleagues and I were staying at the hotel one night, all our rooms had been block booked and paid for in advance and our director went to check in at almost 11pm to be told that there were now no rooms left and he would have to go to WEMBLEY which was the nearest place they had a room, they wouldn\u2019t give him any help to get there and no other assistance, they wouldn\u2019t refund his room as they said there was a perfectly good one in Wembley waiting for him, they wouldn\u2019t give him internet use to find an alternative. This must happen every night as their attitude was completely indifferent and almost as if they thought he deserved it for arriving late. In the end a colleague and I ended up sharing a double bed together and giving our director the spare room, but when I went downstairs to get extra towels at almost midnight there were FIVE people in reception who this had happened to also- including a young woman of about 20 and travelling alone and one woman who was staying for 5 days and had pre-paid the room- they had still given it away! For anyone that doesn\u2019t know London that well Wembeley is way, way, way out of town and by this time of night the tubes are shutting down- a taxi would have been horrifically expensive too. The other bad points about the room in general include no hairdryer and they probably keep about 2 behind the desk as they are NEVER available; no toiletries; no phone in the room so if you have a problem there\u2019s no way of reporting it without making a trip all the way down to reception; the corridors are also stiflingly, sick-makingly hot, so when you do have to traipse round endless corridor after corridor you end up really sweating and feeling ill. The first time I stayed there I thought the window was frosted but on closer inspection it turned out that the view was a white wall about 6 feet away from the glass- nice! Another time I stayed in room 24 or something like that and was kept awake until after midnight and then woken up again at 6am by an unbelievably loud rumbling noise coming from underneath my room. As there was no phone I had to get dressed to go down to reception- when I did report it the manager said \u2018oh yes that was probably Tesco next door\u2019 so apparently some of the rooms on the 1st floor are over the tesco delivery bay! Another time I was given a duff key three times and this room was on the sixth floor- it took me half an hour and three trips up and down in those boiling corridors with my bags just to get into my room- every time the staff couldn\u2019t have cared less and made that quite clear. Breakfast is pretty terrible with a huge hunk of sweaty bacon all stuck together and covered in white gunk, there is one toaster and one hot water and milk dispenser and always a queue waiting to use them, the bread and sausages are always disgusting- I only ever have fruit and yogurt as the hot stuff is so horrible and I am not a fussy eater! Don\u2019t stay here unless you find a very good deal, we were paying about \u00a390 a night B&B on a weeknight which is good for London but a rip off for this hotel- if you want somewhere cheap nearby I suggest the Holday Inn on Old street which, although not the ritz has never let me down.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cStaying at this hotel cost me a lot of money in parking\u201d", "Author": "d3bz26", "ReviewID": "UR56528626", "Content": "We arrived during the night only to find that there were no parking facilities.

Thirdly, they wont leave another toilet roll if there is more than a quater of a roll left which is absolutely ridiculous...we had to return to reception on 2 occasions to ask for another one which is something that should never happen when a room is cleaned daily (which these are) - it is incredibly frustrating having to make lots of stops at reception on your way in and out of the hotel.

Rooms were very basic but clean no iron, hairdryer, toiletries, there was tea and coffee but not very much but you only have to ask for more at the reception same if you need more pillows and they do have a hairdryer and iron if you want to borrow one.

So far so good. That was untill Friday night. We got back to the hotel after an evening out at about 11.30 we were disturbed by slamming doors and youngsters going out to the clubs eventually all went quiet at about 12.45am fell asleep then was woken at 4.15am by inconsiderate Americans why do they have to shout they were carrying on the party in the corridoor outside our room I got up and asked them politly to keep there voices down dorrs slammed went quite then again at 4.40am 4.50am 5.20am whan again I told them unpolitly to shut up. They were going from room to room two bokes and two women you only need to use your imagination to know what they were up to. Finally it went quite at 6.20am you could even hear them in their rooms!! Saturday night was slightly better Americans must have left. We did hear a group of English lads going out at about 12.30 and we heard them come in at 6.00am and a girl who had lost her card thet was trying to wake her mate up but we did manage a bit more sleep. To be honest it reminded me of holidays in Teneriffe. We did not use the restaurant. My husband went out sat morning to get a paper and came back with a bacon roll and cappicino from a little cafe near subways, it was the best bacon roll that i had tasted definatly recomended.

It's about 5 min walk from hotel but its at the back of the hotel through side streets.

Road in front of hotel noisy with traffic and nearby clubs at night but pretty good sound proofing and you are in the centre of london! Mainly office environment but some bars, restaurants, shops and a subway takeaway on same street. Ideally tesco express next door and M&S 2 min away.

The location of this hotel is great if you enjoy the City area of London. This hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk from two Tube stations (Moorgate & Old Street), and it's only about 20 minutes walking distance from Liverpool Street station (trains & tube). The City area of London is quiet at nice, so there isn't much noise coming from the street, and since it's mainly a business area it clears out after 6pm. This has a downside though because it can be difficult to find somewhere to eat in the area in the evening. There is a Marks & Spencer right down the street from the hotel if you want to eat or grab some food there. We did eat at the restaurant one night; and we found the food to be fairly good, nothing too fancy or special, but was perfect for a dinner after a flight. You order at the bar and then they'll bring your dinner to your table. There was a large big screen TV in the restaurant area as well. Our room was a corner room and so it was quite large. It had the usual furniture: closet storage with a lot of shelves, desk with mirror, a long full-length mirror, bedside tables, and a clean bed. Being that it was a corner room there were plenty of windows for natural light & good blinds that helped keep it dark in the early morning hours. TV worked just fine. One thing to note, the rooms don't come with a hair dryer so bring your own if you need one. Plenty of plugs also in convenient locations in the room. The bathroom was an odd shape due to the fact that our room was a corner, almost in the shape of a triangle. It made it awkward to have two people brushing their teeth at once, but was fine for one person otherwise.

Not exactly the most exciting of alter-ego's to assume, but with my costume of suit and tie and trusty sidekick 'Blackberry' at my side, I beome a selfish power broker, with high expectations and low tolerance thresholds...sparring with our lawless capital at least once a week. Invariably these covert missions into London Village involve the temporary rental of a suitable superhero lair for the evening and this traditionally always meant Malmaison, after all Business Traveller Man isn't picking up the tab, so understated luxury is a must... Or at least it was...until... POW! Through an administrative cock up, my alter-ego found himself facing a night in a Travelodge. A TRAVELODGE for crying out loud....oh the humanity. Surely Business Traveller Man would at least be enjoying a central location from which to endure his cut-price incarceration? BAM! He was actually on the eastern fringes of the City...almost Shoreditch...holy micro-scooters! Anyway, so the story continues...Business Traveller Man arrived late into the City Road area of our sprawling capital...expecting to do battle with shouty tramp-like villains and skag-fiend-nemisis-like-characters...but to his immediate surprise, not a bit of it. It was bustling, alive and...gulp....cosmopolitan. Mmmm...the area was better than expected, but surely the budget dwelling would underline the need for Business Traveller Man to stay in more sophisticated surrounds...wouldn't it? BIFF! On sidling into the Travelodge entrance, the almost surreal experince continued... The reception was basic...but very clean. The receptionist was basic...but again, very clean The check-in was basic...but again, very very clean. (I was in my room in 90 seconds!) The lifts were basic...but again, very clean The corridors were basic...but again, very clean The main living space in the room was...you get the idea. Okay, so on first impressions the room itself did have an ambience not disimilar to a prison cell about it, but the TV was good, the bed was nice and soft and the bathroom was, although basic...you've guessed it...very clean. BLAM! The following morning Business Traveller Man awoke rested and ready to do battle once more with the urban sprawl of the city...but during his stay, he'd changed. 'He' gave his head a shake and became 'me' again...and I immediately realised that there really isn't any point in spending any more on decent overnight lodgings in London.

There is a pub and a club located in the same alley as the back side of the hotel. In addition to that, people who work in the buildings near by come out for smoke breaks and have loud conversations. The conversations, the pub noise, and the club noise all carry very well up into the rooms and pretty much drowns everything out if your window is open. We initially had a corner room, at the back of the hotel, located at the far end of the hotel from the club, but still on the first floor. As long as my earplugs were in and the window was closed I was able to sleep. This was a little uncomfortable though, because the rooms can get very warm and there is no air conditioning. The only other complaint than the noise I have, would be with the staff. After a couple of days of staying in the same room, we noticed that the carpet was very wet near the bathroom. Evidently we had a leak. We let the front desk know and they were unconcerned, but totally willing to let us have a new room. That was great, until we checked into our new room and the TV was broken. Ok, no big deal, this is a large hotel, we can just ask for another room. We went downstairs, but encountered a new staff person at the front desk. We explained the situation and were told we could not change rooms because the TV didn't work. Well, that might be the case, but I would think if you were flooded out of your other room, the staff might want to make sure you're comfortable in your new one? There was no arguing with this staff member, but luckily the first one that helped us came along and they allowed us to switch again. Now, this third room didn't have a remote, but luckily we still had our key from the last room, and were able to zip down and swipe the remote. So we settled in, three stories higher than we were before, and although the room was much smaller than the corner room we had before, we were delighted to discover the noise had diminished a bit. We were now able to watch TV with the window open, even if we still couldn't sleep with it open. This is a kinda lengthy review to say, \"if you get this place on a great price online, aren't going to spend much time here, and own a pair of earplugs, this is a clean, fairly well located hotel.\" Also, I wanted to share that we booked every night individually to get a better price, and had no problems with this. The front desk said we could stay in the same room the entire time (they didn't foresee the flood).

The website at the time of booking advised of the nightclub noise, which I will admit we heard none of, but failed to mention that it is on a major bus route (it now does mention this on the new website). The \"double glazing\" was awful, and after conducting a test, I can assure you that there was no noticeable difference in noise between the window being open and closed! Pretty poor for someone on such a main road, even if it is a budget hotel. The second disappointment was the attitude of one particular member of staff. I would like to start here by saying that all subsequent members of staff we dealt with were polite and courteous, however, the first impression we got was awful. We tried to check in early, but having not booked this, were were not surprised when there was nothing available. However, the attitude of the staff member was disgraceful - she basically told us to get out of the hotel and not come back until 3. When i asked if I could leave my luggage, I was told in no uncertain terms that I couldn't. Although i was annoyed at this, I understand it is Travelodge policy, but i did not need to be told this so rudely. The hotel was cheap, so I suppose in one way i shouldnt complain, but neither me nor my girlfriend got much sleep in 3 nights due to the traffic noise.

Now bearing in mind this is a recent addition to the Travelodge line up, I was slightly surprised to find, no air con of any kind, and as such the lift lobbies are very warm indeed, due to the vending machines that are located there, as a result it can be quite uncomfortable whilst waiting for a lift as these seem to break down regularly, and the night I was there, two of the three were out of order. The room itself was exactly what you would expect form a Travelodge, simple and clean, and functional. No bath, but shower was adequate in size, if only they didn\u2019t insist on those stupid shower curtains that attack you each time you turn the shower on! The only other issue I had was to do with the lack of any air con, due to the unseasonable weather we had, where I left the window open (it had a cable attached for safety as I was on the 6th floor!) and pulled the blackout blind down when I went out. When I came back the room was still very warm, but thought I will at least get some air in the room, by leaving the window open. Big mistake, as there seemed to be some sort of business that works 24/7 and the noise was unbearable with the window open, so nothing for it, but to close the double glazed window and suffer the heat instead. The sound proofing between rooms is not up to much as someone in the room next door, decided to plug something in in the middle of the night and as such I was woken up at 4am!

I was on the third floor at the back of the hotel (room 354). When I got out of the lift on my floor, I was met by a wall of heat.... This was summer in London and the outside temperature was 26C. A short walk along the corridor and I found my room, which was overlooking an alley way at the back. The window would only open about 6 inches, thus stopping any sort of fresh air getting into the room. The room was very hot. On retireing to bed, I had to leave the window open to try and get some air, but at about 1130PM, I was woken by the \"Rythmic bass\" noise from a nightclub across the alley from my window. Not just was this rythmic bass driving me crazy, but the noise of patrons waiting to get into the club was appalling, they sounded very drunk and a lot were shouting. The music kept me awake well into the small hours and then when it ended, I had to endure the revellers leaving while they shouted and roared at each other. I eventually closed the window and sufered the heat. Following morning I asked if it was possible to have a fan in the room due to the heat and was informed that there were none available. I complained about the noise and was told, it would be OK on the next night, as the club did not open on a Monday night..!!!! I am aware that Travleodge is trying to cut costs in order that customers get a good rate to stay, but not having a telephone in the room is a bit too much, If I was a female travelling alone, would I feel at ease with no telephone in the room to contact the front desk in an emergency...I think not. The bathroom was supplied with one small bar of soap, no shampoo. When the room was made up after my first night, the soap was not replaced and my hand towel disappeared and was not replaced. The main towel was thread bare and had seen better times.

This resulted in us being booked into an \u2018ambulant\u2019 room for half the stay. Upon checking-in the staff member indicated it may not be possible for us to stay in the same room for the entire stay and we would have to go to reception each morning to have our room key re-activated. I must say the staff at reception were wonderful, and managed to keep us in the same room for the whole 5 days. The hotel itself is located between Old Street and Moorgate tube stations. We mostly used Moorgate because it was on the Circle Line as well as Northern Line, whereas Old Street is only on the Northern Line. There is also a bus stop right outside the hotel\u2019s front door. The room was sparsely furnished, but immaculately clean. Being an ambulant room, there was plenty of space and we were on the top (7th) floor facing away from City Road. Had absolutely no problems with any noise and the view was quite good. In fact we woke up to snow on Sunday morning \u2013 \u201cLondon\u2019s heaviest April snow fall for 20 years\u201d. Bathroom was nice and new with a good shower over a small bathtub with plenty of hot water with good water pressure.

While it is not in the most exciting part of London, it is relatively quiet at night which is nice after a looong flight from California! I recommend taking the Northern Line to Old Street rather than Moorgate personally. It's only a few blocks away from Old Street tube station (head toward the churchyard, which I think would be south). Check in is at THREE pm, however. I seem to recall when I booked that it was at TWO pm, which meant a lot of people were just sitting around waiting for 3pm, and then a queue formed to check in. That was rather annoying. But... for the early booker rate of 29 pounds, I didn't mind waiting an hour. The first room I had was a family room, so there was a pull out sofa bed for my friend and a double bed for me. I slept just fine in the double, and my friend never pulled out the bed because she said the sofa was perfect the way it was! The bathroom was fine, perfectly clean, and the shower water temperature and pressure were excellent! The second night at the end of the trip (I went to Paris) I had a double, and as soon as I got to my room, a fire alarm (test) went off, and we gathered outside for 10 minutes until we were allowed back in. Sort of annoying but at least it wasn't raining out. The room was of equal cleanliness and quality as the first. The flat screen TV was nice, and the bathroom was very clean. The cafe had good coffee, but I never ate there. There are quite a few take out places all around the area!

The room was very cosy and we had a high floor so no traffic noise. TV had quite a few channels and room had all the required amenities including a decent view.

No luggage storage available which is hard to believe but instead they offered late check-out for 10 pounds which allowed you to keep the room until 2pm.

Spotless bathroom, clean white duvets, comfiest pillows I've had at a hotel. For 26 pounds we had a bargain. There is some bar noise at night especially if you have a window open, so bring earplugs, but overall the outside noise was minimal. Rooms are small but adequate. One problem: no phones in the room, even for use in emergency. This is a problem. What would happen in case of fire, heart attack, etc?? Not only could we not call, they could not contact us in case of a call from family, etc. Unfortunately, there were high school/college groups who caused trouble 2 nights running, and although front desk apologized, they really didn't do much. I was so ticked off (it was 2 am and they were still noisy) I ended up dressing and going out and telling the noisy group off. Guests should not have to be security guards. One tip for those of us from N. America. I ran into people who said their radiator was broken, but it wasn't, it's just different from ours. You have to turn the switch on at the plug. Then look at the top right of the rad and you'll see a min-max dial and a small beige bar. Press the bar so that the red light comes on, then it's turned on. I think they could post instructions over it for international guests, I noticed others in previous reviews noting \"broken\" rads. We ate at the restaurant once, the barman Ryan was fabulous, very nice, but the food was dreck. I ordered what I thought was a baked potato with sliced chicken and got pink creamed chicken instead. Disgusting. I thought that was outlawed now. Transit is fabulous, buses stop right out front, and buses 271 or 214 will take you right into Liverpool station in 5 minutes where you can get a variety of buses and Tube on 3 different lines, stores, etc. Moorgate is also just 2 stops away and any bus leaving Moorgate will stop across from the hotel. Moorgate/Liverpool is nicer than Old Street area. EAT is right next door, M&S 5 minutes away, Liverpool station has a good variety of shopping, Boots, Carphonewarehouse, Simply Food, etc. Very safe area. I walked alone at night from Liverpool station over to City Road, all around the area at night, never had a problem.

If you've ever stayed in London, you know what an incredible bargain this is! I stayed for five nights and had a great stay. I had a family room, which included a large double bed and a foldout sofa. The bed was very comfortable. The room was kept spotless and the tea and coffee supplies were re-stocked every day. My room was right above the lobby, so I did encounter a bit of coming-and-going noise, but I just left the TV on at night to drown it out. I tried the breakfast one morning. It included hot items, as well as cereal, yogurt, and fruit. It wasn't bad, but it was a bit dear at 7.50. If I'd paid the normal rate of 90-100 pounds, I would expect the breakfast to be included, but for 26, I can't complain! The Marks & Spencer down the road proved invaluable. I picked up sandwiches, snacks, and drinks there and kept them in the room to save a bit of money on eating. There are also a few coffee chains and pubs on the road, though otherwise, it's fairly quiet. The hotel is situated between Old Street and Moorgate tubes, so it's really handy to catch trains on either the Northern, Circle, District, or Hammersmith & City lines.

The \"walk up\" price of a room was about \u00a3105- at that price I give it 2 stars. Be aware that special prices are typically only for one night, so it could get confusing if you are looking to stay a few days. Firstly, a little gripe. I had paid in advance for early check in, and booked a family room. When I got there I was told, politely, that there were no clean family rooms. This was a little frustrating, because surely if they accept bookings and payment in adavance they should have the room ready on time. I accepted a double room. The room was big enough, a big bed, three pillows, and a small TV and desk/shelf area with a chair. View was a wall, and other rooms! The bathroom was standard, witha shower and WC. The room was clean, and the heater worked and was easy to use (not always the case with Travelodge.) The area was OK- about 400 yards from Old Street Tube, but actually a reasonably quiet street- I think there was a pub there, but that wasn't open Sundays! Actually, the immediate area was very quiet. It is about 40 minutes walk to Euston Station, which I did in the rain on Monday morning. The hotel also has a bar and restaurant, and drinks/snacks machines. There is an internet computer, that charges the stupidly high price of \u00a31 for 10 minutes. Had I been paying the full price room I really would have expected this to be free, but at the budget rate- fair enough. Breakfast would have been an extra charge too. So, conclusions- its Travelodge- a functional hotel, in a decent (but certainly not premium) London location, which was clean and served its purpose- somewhere to sleep!
