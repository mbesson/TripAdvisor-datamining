It was one of the hotels suggested by the University. My son has since enrolled there and loves the school and New Orleans. When we first arrived, we were enchanted. A zydeco band was playing in the lounge and there was a lot of activity. It seemed perfect for New Orleans and we both loved it. However, we were on the third floor and were there the week after Mardi Gras. Maybe the third floor does not get used much. That would explain the layer of dust on some of the bed pillows. There were no mattress pads on either of the beds and very thin sheets. The bathroom was old and the soap caddy in the shower was rusted and chipping apart. For the couple days that we were there, the same Mardi Gras beads sat in the hallway near a doorway. It looked like no one had vacuumed within an inch of the walls for months (this applied to the carpeted stairway as well.) It was during this trip that I discovered TripAdvisor when I went on line at the hotel to try to figure out if I should try to move. We have returned here for food and drinks because the veranda and lounge are so charming, but only when we are not rushed because the service is so slow. I would guess that the bulk of The Columns income is from the college kids who come here for poetry readings and music and that they just don't make enough on overnight guests for the management to care at all. And that the people who do stay here repeatedly (some have posted reviews here) either don't mind the shabby/dirty conditions or are able to request the rooms that are clean (assuming there are some.) I just checked back in to see if current reviewers were experiencing cleaner conditions than I had but I see that little has changed, prompting me to write this delayed review.

After visiting a couple of times to NO myself, I knew the best place to stay would be off of St. Charles Ave. in the Garden District, because the traffic and parking situation downtown can be a nightmare, and quite expensive. The trolley takes you right down St. Charles from the Garden District to the French Quarter, and the fee is much smaller than what you would pay for parking. Plus, the trolley rolls until 3am in the morning. But check schedules for holiday hours at: norta.com. We picked The Columns Hotel in the Garden District on St. Charles Ave., and it was a fantastic choice. The Columns is listed in the register of historical places, and with good reason. Upon first entering, you feel as if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stepped into a Victorian mansion that would have fit perfectly into a Harry Potter movie. There are twisty staircases, giant stained glass windows, a Victorian tea room where you will have your complimentary breakfast (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a yummy one!), a large antiquated bar with decent cocktails, and a Victorian Lounge to have dinner. Not to mention the sweeping patios and balconies decorated with exactly the kind of patio furniture you would expect in the garden district, and live music on some nights. We were having so much fun at the hotel; we almost forgot we were there to check out the French Quarter. At night, the lights dim to make room for mood lighting, making it the perfect spot to bring your date, or partner in crime. The rooms were spacious, but I have to warn, if you are not able to move around very well, then make sure you let the hotel know before booking. This is because the floors are slanted in some of the rooms, and the claw foot tubs have high sides, making it difficult getting out if you are not in good shape. Otherwise, the rooms are decorated with Victorian sensibilities, and you will feel as if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stepped back in time. Another charmer of this hotel is you are in the Garden District surrounded by amazing architecture of a bygone era. If you like walking to check out the sights, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found a perfect area to do it. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the muggy heat, then make sure you visit The Columns Hotel from the end of October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c April, when Louisiana is at its coolest.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDrink on the Porch\u201d", "Author": "K-Buc", "ReviewID": "UR119788679", "Content": "We didnt stay here - but it was recommended that we swing by!

My mother had paid for this for us and she called and tried to reason with them. The man at the front desk was nice and polite as was the manager.

We will probably go, but you better believe I will be calling many times to insure we still get the room. I will also bring a memory foam pad for the bed. I will never pay for this hotel. Like other reviewer said, only go there for a drink on the patio or at the bar.

Two years after Katrina, my dream came true. When we walked in, the hotel wreaked of a powerful perfume spray and we could only assume that this strong smell was being used to mask another bad smell. We gave them a pass because as we toured New Orleans, we realized that much of the city was still gravely struggling to get back on it's feet. We were happy to support them, even with the smell, and even though our room on the top floor was pretty crappy and uncomfortable. I appreciate vintage atmospheres, which is why we chose The Columns, but the decor was just dated and tasteless. We were very disappointed, but again, we had a lot of compassion in our hearts for New Orleans at the time. We stayed there recently again, and the powerful perfume smell had diminished a bit, but it was still there. The place has beautiful architectural details but they seem to be taking preserving the home's original feel a bit too far, and don't bother to update or improve anything. The first night, they had overbooked our room and so we got to stay in one of the nicest rooms, #8 on the 2nd floor. We were impressed; the super high ceilings, the spacious bathroom, tasteful decor, the view of St. Charles (although beware, that street car is pretty loud as it passes and the sound irked our two small kids making it difficult for them to get to sleep). It didn't bother me though. I personally like the noise of the streetcar. The next night we were moved to room 17, far less impressive; The floor leading to the bathroom dipped so much that I thought I'd topple over every time I walked over it. Also, I am not a big believer in ghosts, but we definitely had some disturbing experiences during our stay: One day after coming back from a day out, we found a large splatter of blood on the baseboard in the bathroom. Mind you, the cleaning lady had already come in to clean our room before we left out for the day, while we were at breakfast. My husband told the cleaning lady that we refused to clean it because it wasn't ours. She told him she understood and proceeded to tell us about a couple of other ghostly experiences of other guests and even herself! That second night I heard horrible, loud scratching all night long. It was so loud and terrible that I could not sleep. My kids slept through it as did my husband, but he still heard it and told me that it was just something outside the door, but I knew it was something inside the room. I thought perhaps there really was a ghost in there, I turned on the light, walked around the area the scratching came from but saw nothing. I decided to leave the light on, since the noise stopped once the light was on. Finally, the light was bothering me so and I was so sleepy, I turned it off. Only 10 minutes later, the loud scratching returned. I dealt with the scratching til sunset when it stopped. I got no sleep. My husband refused to believe that any ghosts existed, but he went ahead and admitted to me that one day while standing outside of our door, one of the heavy, plastic Do Not Disturb signs was flapping about as it hung on the door knob. He told himself it must be a strong draft, but there was no draft, and no reason for the sign to flap around like that without anyone touching it. Besides the \"disturbances\", this hotel draws a large, loud, college crowd several nights a week and especially on weekends. The music is loud and we could hear it in our room and the people sitting outside on the porch are loud and can be heard inside the room. And don't come into the hotel during the peak party hours or you will have to bombard your way passed all the revelers who will be totally oblivious to the fact that you are trying to pass by with all your luggage. The good news (or bad, you decide) is that when we got home, I realized the loud scratching noise was not a ghost after all. When I took out our bags of chips and cookies that were tightly sealed inside of another bag that was sitting up off the floor in a chair, I found the bags had been eaten into by some God-awful critter that I am just thankful I didn't see that night! It was a terrible thought, as my 2 year old had been sleeping in a playpen that sat close to the floor! Of course with that noise, I was checking on her often anyway. I'm tellin' you, something very strong tore into those bags and had to be fairly large to get up on the chair and make that kind of noise. It was no mouse and more likely a large rat! So these things come along with old houses that haven't been updated: ghosts, critters, uneven floors, etc. But, I have decided that this was too much for me and I would recommend The Columns only for music, partying and hanging out at the bar and on the porch with all the others, just so you can soak up the old mansion feel. Sleeping there; I cannot recommend that. The hot breakfast was nice, and the staff were nice enough but there have got to be many other hotels in New Orleans that have that old world feel and good service without all the drawbacks of The Columns.

Clearly people's opinions are all over the map. I stayed here for three nights on a weekend when we had a function planned at The Columns. The price was reasonable considering that it came with a full breakfast. The hotel is in a big old house right on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans' Garden District. This is very convenient if you want to take public transportation to many NOLA attractions since the streetcar runs right in front of the hotel and goes to the French Quarter for $1.25. I stayed on the third floor and was happy I did. The bar on the first floor does a brisk business and is open late most nights and could be noisy. Many people seem to hang out at the bar in the evenings. The hotel's wireless did not reach to my room so I had to go to the lobby to use it. The hotel had an elevator but I don't know if it was for general use so I climbed 58 stairs to go to my room. Not a big deal for me, clearly a dealbreaker for others. The stairwell is paneled in dark wood and decorated with wall murals and stained glass with an impressive stained glass skylight at the top of it. The whole place is tastefully decorated in similar ways with statues and neat furniture and light fixtures. Nothing in this place is new, I think that's part of its appeal, you might not. My room, room 26, had a giant bed that was elevated so high off the floor that there were portable steps to climb into it. There were ample pillows and nice bedding and a comfy carpet with plenty of drawers to put things away into. There were also dark curtains which made the room great for sleeping. The room had nice prints on the wall, and a mismatched series of lamps. The AC worked great and there was also a ceiling fan and an old but functional TV. The bathroom was pretty basic [stall shower, no tub, sink, toilet] but clean and while there was a lot of soap provided, there were just a few random-seeming sample sized shampoo bottles provided. Each room seems totally different and I was happy with my room and didn't see the need to pay extra for a corner room. Every staff member I spoke with was polite and friendly and available for local questions and transportation arrangements. The event we had at The Columns was terrific and we felt well-supported by both staff and management. The place is definitely funky. If you're looking for a top of the line place, this is not it.

If you want historic and charming\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this is the perfect place for you! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the quintessential New Orleans mansion. However, please realize that with historic and charming come some inconveniences and quirks. If you need new and modern and slick\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6look elsewhere. We arrived at night and the bar was busy. A lot of people out on the front veranda enjoying the beautiful weather. You have to bring your own bags up the walk\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so it is kind of funny lugging your baggage past all the bar patrons, but once again, this is just the quirkiness of the place. The front desk staff was personable and helpful. Very friendly. Our room was on the 2nd floor (#10) and was quite pretty....the room was reflected very well in the photos on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. Full of antiques and character. We heard that the noise from the bar could be a problem when staying on the 2nd floor. However, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem for us\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was more of a hum and the noise winds down when the bar closes, I believe around 2 am.

However, if you are the type of person who will be up until 2 am anyway and out and about\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this will be perfect for you. Our room was clean and large....very interesting decor. However, if you cannot handle the quirkiness of an old historic place, as I said, this is not for you. But I think that should be pretty obvious when you are booking a room here! Quirky elements include: our bathroom sink had one tap for cold water and one tap for (very) hot water on opposite sides of the sink.

We are research hounds. This hotel met all the criteria: located in the Garden District, old-style accommodation without sacrifice, queen beds (you try sleeping well with your spouse in a double for four nights!), and the ability to have adult hang-out time. We found the Columns online and used the site to select our room (3rd floor with 2Q beds). I called the hotel directly and spoke with Jeanie, who was lovely and efficient. No problems. When we arrived, we found our room to be very clean and nicely decorated. They've updated the interiors recently, apparently. The beds were absolutely some of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on (and I've stayed in some very nice places around the world). The bathroom was basic, but clean. The sink wouldn't drain one night and they fixed it while we were out the next morning (I notified the front desk at breakfast). Not a big deal. There are three fantastic highlights of the Columns: 1. The main floor lounge with sweeping veranda. There was a live jazz band playing on the veranda during the early evenings (5-7pm). Then the bar picked up--it was Columbus Day long weekend. It was busy and noisy late. But, as hotel guests, we had exclusive access to the large second floor balcony. We ordered drinks and appies from the bar and brought them up to lounge outside. It was furnished with comfy wicker and wrought iron furniture (plenty of cushions), and there was a very large fan turning overhead. We watched the comings and goings of the bar, without the noise. Our kids joined us to colour and nibble (we were 2 hours off our normal time zone). It was perfect! 2. The interior. The bar ceiling is painted in the most exquisite design--it looks like a silk tabriz rug. The rooms on either side of the main hall were beautifully decorated in an old southern style with european tall narrow doorways, high ceilings (24', we guess), gorgeous moldings, etc. Walking up the majestic staircase (I know I'm sounding like a PR person, but it's all true) the walls were painted with a landscape mural and the ceiling had a massive and quite intricate stained glass skylight (original, I'm sure). It was built in 1883 and lots of original detail has been maintained. 3. The breakfast. My relatives stayed at the Hampton Inn a block away and had breakfast included--some fruit, some pastries, etc. available in the lobby. We had a breakfast room with nice sit down service. Fruit (freshly cut for you), a great selection of juices, pancakes and french toast, and bacon, sausages and eggs (omelettes--to your specifications--and poached and other). Relaxing. Hot. Fresh. Tasty. Served 7-10am. All included in the room rate. When we went to bed each night, the bar was still humming, but we couldn't hear anything in our room. It was so quiet. The room was cool when we wanted it to be--i.e. the air conditioning worked perfectly and wasn't loud. The hotel is in a great location, by the way. The Garden District is beautiful, with tree-lined streets and wide boulevards. It's also close the the boutique shopping on Magazine Street (just south-ish) and downtown/French Quarter (both a quick cab ride--be prepared, though, cabs are a bit pricey in NOLA). By the way, our stay at the Columns was during the second portion of our 8 night trip. We highly recommend the following restaurants: Dick and Jenny's (menu on the web), which was absolutely delicious creole food. They don't take reservations so go before 7pm. Relaxed atmosphere. Liborio (321 Magazine St--Central Business District)--a Cuban restaurant with bistro style interior. It looks a bit basic, but the food is OUTSTANDING! We went back twice it was so good. Try the grilled grouper, tuna salad. Very kind service. Luke (a John Besh restaurant) is located at the Hilton in the business district. It's like a French brasserie. Try the duck/venison pate--OMG! We had great service too. If you need to shop... Rubenstein's (on the web) on Canal at St. Charles is the place to go. Individual service as soon as you step through the door, with a good selection of high end clothing. We were dressed unimpressively and were given professional attention with southern hospitality thrown in. They rushed the tailoring on my husband's sport coat and slacks and my children were treated kindly too. The epitome of a satisfying shopping experience. The best swamp tour (my cousin lives in NOLA and recommended this one): Dr. Wagner's Honey Island Swamp Tour. Go to the Audobon Aquarium. Watch the Hurricane on the Bayou film at the IMAX theatre beside the aquarium--it's riveting. New Orleans lost 80% of its city/population. It hasn't recovered. Most of the city, outside the original \"crescent\", is ghost town territory. It's unnerving and overwhelming. We were worried about safety. But, we were fine and never felt threatened in any way--we used common sense, though. Our last day (Oct 9 2007) they were running the St. Charles Street Trolley for the first time since Katrina. The city had to replace 13miles of copper line that was stolen for scrap metal after the hurricanes and flooding. Read about the trolleys: (wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Charles_Avenue_Streetcar) I've written too much, probably. But, we had a relaxing, interesting, and fun visit to New Orleans.

You can make some new friends in a heartbeat. - The free breakfast is amazing, although not even remotely healthy - The Sunday Jazz Brunch is pricy but worth it once or twice. The food is amazing and sitting on the southern mansion's porch while eating and listening to jazz is hard to beat. - Superb location for being in the Garden Distict - I got a \"stay 6 nights and the 7th is free\" deal - The history of the home is quite interesting CONS - The Pretty Baby and Bellcocque suites are amazingly dark in terms of natural light, as they're windows are little dormer windows along the floor. The Bellcocque suite is downright tiny. Avoid this (and only this) room. - Noise from the bustling bar can be a little much in the second floor rooms if you're super-sensitive.

My fianc\u00c3\u00a9e surprised me with stay at the Columns Hotel with the hopes that we would be able to relax and unwind. During check-in, the beauty of the interior blew me away. The same went for our room. After getting settled in we took a couple of minutes to freshen up and then headed out in search of food. When we returned, the \"quite Columns Hotel\" had turned into an out of control party. One thing that they don't tell you when you make your reservation or when you check in, is that the bar in the Columns Hotel has been voted one of the best bars in New Orleans for young people - this was evident! The other thing they forgot to inform us about was that there was a wedding the weekend we were there, and our room was the only one not part of it. According Jacque (owner of the Columns Hotel), weddings are a regular occurance. We went directly to our room and laid down (in our room above the bar). Within seconds, the water bottle on the table started moving to the music downstairs. Sleep was going to be impossible. I went down stairs and talked to a very nice gentleman at the front desk, I believe his name was Bo. I told him how we came to the Columns to have a quite relaxing weekend - and this is anything but. He tried to find us another room, but no such luck. After a couple of minutes of discussion, we found another hotel, and Bo said that he would take care of the situation and make sure we weren't charged for the room. We felt this fair since we were \"sold\" this room under false pretenses. We left, disappointed that we didn't get to stay at the Columns, but were pleased that the situation was handled the way it was. That was until we got our Visa bill. There it was on our bill, a charge for the Columns. In fact the charge was never taken care of as promised. We made several calls to the Columns Hotel and spoke with managers at the front desk. All of them said the matter would be taken care of. Months went by, more calls were made. Nothing. Enough was enough; we wanted to talk to Jacque. We left messages with the front desk, and again, nothing. Jacque couldn't even return a phone call. Again we called and left a message. This time we told the person at the front desk that if Jacque didn't return our calls, we would report him to the Better Business Bureau. (Not sure what the BBB would have done, but Jacque returned our call none-the-less). Jacque told me that there was nothing he could do since we had signed an agreement when we checked in. I agreed with him that we did sign it, but only because we were told we were going to have a quite and relaxing weekend. What really irritated me was Jacque saying that none of the managers that we had talked with had the authority to make such a decision, which was, we could check out and our card would not be charged Where does this issue stand today? Pretty much in the same place. Last week Jacque promised that he would call me back after talking with his partner, to see if there was anything he could do. And yet again, there's been no returned phone call. And, our card still hasn't been credited as promised. So, if you're looking for a nice relaxing place to stay in New Orleans and are considering the Columns Hotel, ask them when you call to make a reservation, \"is there a wedding this weekend or any parties we should know about?\" You might be surprised; the Columns Hotels is not what it appears.", "Date": "February 19, 2002"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cWhoa!
