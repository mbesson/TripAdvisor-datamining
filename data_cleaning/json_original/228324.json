{"Reviews": [{"Content": "5 star for 3star price We have just returned from staying at this hotel and must say it was a good experience,clean,friendly staff and all for a good price.It was the little extras too,coffee available in the reception area all day plus fruit,while we where there it was satsumas and on top of that there was a basket of biscuits or cakes to choose from too.The kitchenette in the bedrooms is a really good idea even if only used to make a cup of coffee or tea.We followed instructions on how to get to it and found them a little wanting so if you do stay here and are coming from the main Hauptbahnoff(train station),if you stand with your back to the main entrance of the station you will see tram stops infront of you go to the 1st one and catch the number 11tram going from left to right right and get of at osthafenplatz it tells you each stop so don.t panic. Buy your ticket before you get on the tram,there is a information point on the tram platform and they where really bhelpful when we asked them.when you get off the tram walk forward the same way as the tram is going and you will see a pedestrian trafic lights crossing,cross over and walk to the left for about 100 yards ,take the first road right,there is a restaurant on the corner,and the hotel entance is on the end of this road only about 75 yds.We will stay here again and use their partner hotels in other cities in Germany .", "Date": "Dec 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR842279643", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "dunnitall"}, {"Content": "Good hotel but... We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights altogether. Clean hotel even with the smoking room the last few days. Did not smell smoky.Parked on the street even though there is a parking garage (for a fee).

There is also 2 grocery stores just up the street (Plus and Lidl) and an Esso on the run store. The problem mostly was there are no decent, not too expensive retaurants close by and most restaurants open for Dinner at 6 pm. - a problem if you want to eat earlier.

The Golden Leaf is a little out of the way, but we found the value of the hotel more than made up for the walking distance to the train. The walk to the train was about 15-20 minutes, and a healthful way to start the day. We would deffinately stay again. The room was very comfortable, the street noise minimal, the bathroom very large and the kitchenette a well used convenience. There is a grocery store within a 5-10 minute walk, a great stand up and eat sausage shop across the street (a deffinate must is to try some of the sausage and mustard...absolutely fabulous), and Frankfurt's best pizza at the Devina Lounge. The Devina Lounge was newly opened, and they made us feel right at home. Try their vegetable appetizer.....it was Wunderbar! There's also a fast food type restaurant around the corner, where the staff was extremely helpful. Additionally, there is a liquor store next to the grocery store that sold a huge variety of beer and wine, at incredibly reasonable prices. Within one block, there was also a bakery, a coffee shop, and a Japanese restaurant. Note: Most restaurants close in the area Sundays. Make sure you have what you need for provisions before the shops close. The hotel staff was great. We become ill half way through our trip, and they were able to help us find an Apothecary (pharmacist) for medicines. The staff greeted us warmly every day and was able to easily accomodate our non-smoking room request. We also used the hotel's small, but adequate sauna facilities. Frankfurt was a great city to explore, and a good place to base out of. Day trips to Cologne, the Rhine river, Wurzberg, etc. are all within easy traveling distance on the train. The train station is a lot of fun, and we ate many reasonably priced meals there.", "Date": "Apr 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR515042880", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ASBURY30"}, {"Content": "Good city hotel.

There is a hotel restaurant which appeared to be a concession separate from the hotel ??? OK but nothing special and sort of pricey (100E for spagetti for four and 1 bottle of wine).Downtown Frankfurt has to be seen especially the cathedral which is outstanding; take a boat cruise on the Rhine (Zeil Street tram station) inexpensive and only 50 mins.There is an outlet store close to the hotel (top couturiers) and a major supermarket for wine and food 5 mins away.There is no restaurants to speak of close to the hotel.
