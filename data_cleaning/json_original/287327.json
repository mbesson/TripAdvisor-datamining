I was searching for cheap good location hotel with good enough reviews (most importantly - clean rooms) and this hotel matched these criteria. Overall I was rather satisfied. Location very convenient - 5 minutes walk to Victoria station (underground, busses, trains). It is one of those hotels with paper thin walls.... So huge deal of experience depends on the people living in rooms around you. After first night I was ready to change hotel because our neighbors were very load and I didnt get any sleep. Besides that it is not even possible to close door quietly as hard as you try; so it is rather bad when people next door walk in and out every minute. But other night it was better. I was very glad to see recently renovated wc/shower room - clean and fresh. The towels were changed every day (i just experienced for first time that it was only one towel for person; not other one for the face). Sheets and pillow covers very clean. The room was so tiny that there was no space for the suit case; unfortunately had to put it in the only chair or bed. TV had 3 or 4 channels (I dont care about that). No free wi-fi now; paid 5 pounds for whole stay and it was very slooow; sometimes couldnt get at all. There was very simple breakfast (corn flakes, muesli, yoghurt, orange juice, milk, water, coffee (good), tea, toasted white bread, jam, butter and cheese). And yes - we had a room on the very top floor. On the last day when leaving I was ready to sit down on my heavy suit case and slide down..... lol", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Celbridge, Kildare, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to see London from\u201d", "Author": "Blanche G", "ReviewID": "UR124822144", "Content": "My Mother and I stayed here for three nights, found the staff really helpful.

Okay, so the towels in the rooms are the thinnest and scratchiest, the room is teeny, and the bed is a little hard and creaky, but for London it was CHEAP!!! The location is absolutely fantastic. It is a 10 minute walk from the Victoria tube station, train station, bus depot and the amenities that go along with that - a small shopping mall and numerous restaurants and pubs. We were very happy with the breakfast every morning, though the staff has managed to cultivate an attitude juuuuuust between annoyed and friendly. If you are at all unable to climb stairs, you must request a ground floor room. Our room was on the third floor, which doesn't sound like much but the daily climb up countless flights of stairs was very exhausting even for our young, relatively fit legs. In the unit we stayed in there was a small rooftop area where we sat out on a few nights when we were there overlooking the Victoria rooftops, very pretty and a definite plus. If you are visiting London on a budget and do not plan to stay in your room very much, this hotel is well worth the money spent.
