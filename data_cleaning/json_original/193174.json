Close to nice areas like Noting Hill and Hyde Park and very well communicated through metro (stop just right the corner) with other parts of London. The room we got was quite large. Not sure if all the rooms are the same, but ours was situated on the corner of our floor and was very large. Also quite clean though the furniture is really basic. On the downside is the stuff. Do not go there if you are looking for a personal approach. Check in and check out is very cold showing how tired they are of following the procedure with all their guests. As a remark, and already commented by other guests, indeed it is not possible to leave your luggage once you've checkout (something I have done in multiple other hotels in many other cities) They offer you instead to pay 10 GBP extra pounds for a late checkout (2 pm) Quite a sly solution but showing a total lack of customer service approach. Also, as part of this lack of customer service and attention to details, after paying those 10 GBP for the late checkout, when we came back to our room at 13:45, the key didn't open because at reception they had not re programmed it, causing us to go downstairs again, ask for the change and go back to our room to collect our suitcases.

The result: BIG MISTAKE. For starters the staff in the front desk is plain useless. I am a small woman and I had with me 4 large pieces of luggage as I was staying at a hotel temporarily while I was doing some refurbishments, so I had with me some of my home stuff. I went to ask to the so-called concierge if I could have some help as my luggage was dropped off at the entrance and he just limited to say \u201cyou have to check in there, you have to check in\u201d pointing at the reception. I told him I had my luggage at the entrance and that I needed help or at least a trolley to carry it myself but I did not have a positive answer so I had to drag myself all my luggage, holding bags in each arm, dragging 2 suitcases and pushing with my feet a box while the so-called concierge was behind the front desk contemplating the scene. The service at the reception too slowly and cold. Then I had to start dragging again with me my luggage on the way to my room. The room (I had a single one) was tiny; I could barely fit all my stuff in it. Then I needed to make a local phone call so I called the operator who (with very poor English and nearly nagging at me) explained me that I had to pay a \u00a320 deposit if I wanted to make phone calls. So I though, OK not the end of the world, I\u2019ll use my mobile then. But then I needed the internet for an urgent matter and I found out that I had to purchase credit to use it with a minimum rate of \u00a35 an hour!!!! This is outrageous, even the coffee shop in the corner offer free Wi-Fi to their clients and there are around internet cafes where the rate for an hour is from \u00a31. However I ended up paying \u00a312 for 24 hours of internet, just to use the internet for 3 hours as I needed to do something urgent from my own computer. What a rip-off. And breakfast was not complimentary. In this hotel the rates may be cheaper for the area but they try to squeeze every penny from you with their overcharged additional services. Many of them being complimentary services in most hotels. You may save money in the price of the room but you end up paying lots of extra costs, so in the end I think it could have been better had stayed in another hotel, paying a little bit more but avoiding all this annoyance and the sensation of being ripped-off.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Teignmouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPoor\u201d", "Author": "shish57", "ReviewID": "UR125186079", "Content": "What can I say.

But should you ask for lunch maybe even a sandwich at 2.31 no chance. Lunch is at 5.30 he murmured but lunch is at midday I replied. Oh no he said - on break until 5.30.

I could not have been more wrong in my expectations. The staff at the desk were helpful and friendly at check-in. Despite the fact that this is a non-smoking hotel, a previous guest had decided to be anti-social and leave our room stinking of his/her tobacco. The front desk had no hesitation in apologising and allocating another room, which was fine. So by now we have seen the lobby, the fifth floor corridor and the third floor corridor, together with a room on each floor. The carpets throughout appeared to be very new, and everywhere was spotless. The rooms are not enormous, but this is not a 4 or 5 star hotel, so what do you expect? There was certainly adequate space to walk around the room, though two people would struggle to be in the bathroom at the same time. The bathroom, the basin, bath and toilet were spotless and shining. The worst hotel I ever stayed in was in New York, where the second bed in our twin room slid out from underneath the other bed, blocking the ony door to the room - the place was a grimy, smelly fire-trap. Breakfast was absolutely fine. My wife had a continental - croissants, bread and toast, with ample supplies of butter and jam/marmalade. Sure, a continental breakfast in a more upmarket hotel would offer ham, fruit etc - but this is a cheaper end hotel in London, so again, what do you expect? I had the English, which was absulutely fine. Better bacon and sausage than I've had in many, more expensive hotels, together with boiled, scrambled or fried egg, beans and hash browns - perfectly acceptable and tasty. The breakfast hostess was the charttiest, friendliest I have ever come across, and the breakfast staff were all friendly and very comptetent.

The room was the filthiest and the smallest I've ever seen in a hotel; filth which included insects on the walls, a clogged sink with mucus and pubic hair floating inside, urine stains and body hairs on the bed, and a warm mini-fridge which had the distinctive smell of hot garbage. The cleaning staff was also often very rude, profane and audibly obnoxious in the hallway around guests. Another perpetual problem with the hotel was the abhorrent front desk service. Throughout the trip the concierge was present at the desk far less than 50 percent of the time. When we did need the concierge\u2019s assistance, he was not only unhelpful, seemingly unknowledgeable and reluctant to help us, but at times he downright refused to help us. The laughable \"continental breakfast\u201d was the worst selection I've ever seen. The breakfast included: buns, croissants and dry cereal, room-temperature milk and juice (there were no cooking appliances available to us and the only available glasses were smaller than a shot glass). The taste and quality of these selections was also sub-par, and the low-quality of the breakfast was one of the most bothersome and consistent issues with the accommodations. The computers in the hotel were also borderline unusable. The internet was relatively expensive, the computer room was often locked and the computers were the most inefficient machines I\u2019ve used in my recent memory. In sum, our experience at this hotel could hardly have been much worse.

Instead we had two singles pushed in a corner (under the window) with the top duvet being two singles zipped together. Nevertheless a terrible nights sleep for me and my partner with one of us falling down the middle all night. Second main downfall was the bathroom. The sliding door had nothing sliding it at the bottom so it gaped and had gaps between it and the wall! Needless to say if you like your privacy in the bathroom this isnt the place for you (you could see the otherside of the bedroom whilst sat on the loo). Also the loo is squeezed in between the bath and the wall, if you were overweight you would struggle. There was a pointless mini sized bath (may as well have saved space with a shower tray) and the shower settings were all over the place. The room was dated (my nan would have loved it). The hair dryer was very old and you had to keep holding 'on' for it to work. The tea tray was pointless, only one milk carton per cup - two per cup of tea/coffee at least.

In fact when you enter the hotel, with all the nice marble in the entrance door/hallway, concierge, cocktail/sport bar and newly/renovated interior for the downstair breakfast restaurant, you may think: what a good deal soo much for soo little.. and then again, you will be wrong! I recently stayed for 5 nights, so i had the time to get a full picture. I would not tell if you should stay here or not, but i will tell you what to expect.. so you know what you will get for the money you may spend here.. With a little effort from the staff it may get even 3 stars, but no more.. can't possibly go over it. And don't worry, they won't change anytime soon: according to them they are always fully booked.. is not a surprise, the hotel is cheap and the position is good: after all London is always busy.. The room: I got a single room cause i didn't want to break the bank to get a London sized room... The room is dated, the cupboard are the minumum you can get, but there is a nice bag stand integrated with the table area.. that is practical. Another plus is that you get a fridge, and that is handy to store food, drinks.. TV choice is limited (4 channels not even the full freeview, plus 2 arabic mostly you cannot see due to signal noise.. no BBC news, no Cnn, no sky news.. reception also bad from time to time in all the channels). TV is mostly there for decoration really.. The bathroom was smal but clean and relatively new, however, be carefull with the shower pipes: the aren't solid and the older fixing for the top was already replaced once, tough i would not trust the solidity of the work done.. in other terms, to me is not safe!. carefull with the bath tub: there is not mat neither strong handle to grip.. hope you don't fall. If they have to put in place an unsafe bath tub, better do what radisson or Indigo does: place a single or double nice shower and save some space. sink drain doesn't work well either, so you know. There is no way to shut the fan in the bathroom when you use the light: is so noisy you can hear it when the bath door is closed: there is no light at the mirror no electrical shave plugs.. There was no air conditioning (actually there was but wasn't working properly) but fortunately I was able to open the window and for the time of the year the temperature was just fine, the summer would have been unbearable. For the winter there are electrical heaters: i would not leave that on in the night.. first is bad for your lungs, second, i think is not safe in general.. considering how they do things in this hotel.. better get chill than roasted. I always ask a quite room far from passage ways even in 5 star hotels: they forget about it, or they wouldn't care. anyway there was noise from the back of the hotel every night.. i am not sure the locals like to annoy the guests, or are the guests of other ho(s)tels in the area or is the staff that gets crazy at a certain time.. insulation from the other hotel rooms itself is also bad, also you have to consider the other guests, easy ppl or students, would express their joy for the kind of service they are getting from this cheap hotel, and they will share that with you, like it or not.. and i would not argue with drunkies in the night. No breakfast: best choice! The breakfast was not included and i was glad i didn't give any extra pennies to this hotel.. sometimes i am disappointed with 4 stars, i can't imagine what is like having a breakfast here with these first times hoteliers.. The hotel staff and housekeeping. The hotel smeels.. hostel.. i donno how to describe it, as soon as you leave the lift and you enter in your floor you will know what i mean. If you really want to bother and try to sleep after 7am (!!) put a do not disturb sign.. the house keeping will knock to all the doors near you and will make so much noise you will wake up anyway.. if you happen to be in the room, let's say about 11am you will be shout by 'em if you want your room to be cleaned, after 12 the house keeping will ring you and by 1pm they may cut your electricity..(i am not joking: ask to get it restored and they will make fun of it: utterly rudeness!!)...i was working on my computer and phoning some ppl: embarassing to say the least.. internet is overpriced!!! The reception/front desk and checkout process. Upon arrival, and is something i rarely do, i asked for lagguage storage upon checkout: i am glad i asked.. because there isn't. However the naive girl, many young and not trained staff here, said i may ask for a late check out and my leave the room until 3pm. Wrong!!! ain't gonna happen.. trust me!!! Plus she said, anyway Paddington is only 10 minutes walk and you can store your lagguage there.. yes, but walking with a bag makes it 15 or 20 mins dear! Or if you are not fit, you need to get a taxi.. Anyway that is an emergency solution and there is no justifications, after the money you spent to renovate the bar, the entrance or you could use the breakfast room that for the rest of the day is close.. in the Radisson they are more clever, they use all the space they have, even office space, to meet the customer needs. Room in London is pricey.. have some spare room for the breakfast, that is not a restaurant, wanna charge me 5 pound a bag? give some job to do to the concierge.. Mostly this is a badly managed hotel with lots of potential.. They actually deserve the hard way to know how things should work. (I just dumped one of the 2 stars i gave.. sorry but is for the best) I'd NEVER stay in a hotel which does not provide a storage for bags on the check-out day. Naively i phoned them on my check-out day to check about the possibility of a late check out: to my surprise she said that wasn't possible to KNOW over the phone and i had to go down in the reception to agree.. it was too tired and i smeel there was a trick there. I went down at check-out time, i was busy preparing for my departure, had a late night and had to do stuff on my computer, so i took my time.. plus i really wanted to make it a bit harder for them.. the customer service received in the last days was already beyond my (worse) expectations: after queueing a bit, not due to a massive number of ppl, but due to incapacity of the ppl at the desk, so prepare in advance.. (your check out my take half an hour in busy times.. and if your room is not pre paid, even more..) i kindly asked if i could check out later (one hour at least, half was already wasted by queueing): the guy was totally unprepared for this unprecedented quest, so he had to get advise by her supervisor (behind him), embarassed to ask in front of me.. she rudely said: we are fully booked is not possible. and he parrotly repeated.. in that case i said, i'd go up to take my stuff... meanwhile you prepare the bill if any: he would check cause he wouldn't know really.. i figure it out that in half an hour he would have and answer for me, so i could pack with my pace.. Lagguage storage and the concierge desk Honestly i do not see the point to have a concierge in this hostel level so called wanna be posh hotel but i can't really.. there is a porter, poor man.. there were some baggages around so, altough the front desk said no lagguage room, i dare to ask this person.. after all there were bags in the premises and in a little office in the back (and the front desk ain't showed the cleverness of a monkey and perhaps they were wrong i tought). He hopelessly said that they don't have lagguage storage, but intrigued i asked what about temporary storage, unsafe storage (i was really tempted to dump my bag and see what would happen). He said no we don't have any storage room.. perhaps he meant \"no room left\", oh well i will never know because i will not come back.. I decided that the 2 stars hotels is bloomsbury with shared bathroom offer more for less and in case i really want to save on an hotel that is not in Paddington, the Royal National, previously tried and dumped, immediately becomes a better choice than this. Now you are warned: if i survived the experience so could you, but you will not relax and be ready for some bitter hanger.

I would not recommend this hotel at all. The room was a double but, had my husband been with me, it waould have been very small for the two of us. The bathroom was miniscule but clean. There was no air conditioning but fortunately I was able to open the window and for the time of the year the temperature was just fine, the summer would have been unbearable. I always travel with ear plugs and use them even in 5 star hotels. There was noise from the back of the hotel either from the hotel itself or other premises which backed on to it which I could hear even with the plugs. I was staying at this hotel because my friend from Holland had booked it for 4 nights for herself and her sister and we had arranged to meet up. The continental breakfast was very poor and my friend was very disappointed with it. All she could have, unless she paid some more money,was bread, juice, croissants and jam. She is Dutch and loves cheese and ham for breakfast and usually this is served as part of a continental breakfast and not as an extra. She said that she would not pay extra and would buy some cheese from the Spar shop around the corner and make ker own.!! I was embarrassed that she was having this impression from England and London. I had the English breakfast which was just about passable as it had been under the heated lights for quite some time with a girl giving a stir up from time to time. I know this because I waited about 35 minutes for my friend to come down to breakfast before I took mine so I could see what was going on. My major disappointment was that I booked out early and there was no provision for me to leave my small case until the afternoon. We had planned a trip on the sighseeing bus and river for the morning as it was a beautiful clear, sunny day. I was told, by a very po-faced front of houe manager that I could have the room until 12 but my train was not until late afternoon. I had to take my case with me an d carry it around for six hours. This was a nuisance, getting on and off the sighseeing bus etc. I have NEVER stayed in a hotel which does not provide a storage for bags on the check-out day. I told the front of house manager that I would never stay there again but he said nothing and did not care at all.

Overall, the hotel is a decent (almost good) value for what you pay for.

The bar in the hotel is very nice and was never very crowded (if that's what you like). The breakfast that was served will not any awards, but for a quick jump-start, it will suffice. Where the hotel keeps itself from being rated any higher is in its technology. The Internet service was awful. It is managed by a third-party provider and resolving issues is a challenge. After 3 days of suffering, I went around the corner and used the Internet cafe at the hostel. 75 minutes for about $3.75, and its open 24 hours a day. The TV in the room is small, and it never received very many channels. I had to wiggle the coax cable to improve the reception. I was never able to dial an outside line, local or to the US. I had to ask the front desk to connect me on all my calls (I do want to add that the hotel did not charge me for these calls, so while this was a negative on the equipment, it was a plus for the staff). As far as the location - you are close to two tube stations (one a 3 minute walk, the other about 7). There are plenty of places to eat, several currency exchanges, grocery stores, souvenir shops, and even a bookie joint and a casino. If you like to bet on real football (by that, I mean the NFL), then your choices are limited. The casino was small and clean. Mainly roulette, some blackjack, poker, and a few slot machines. If you are a \"go with the flow\" kind of person, and you like good value, then this hotel will rate a 4 for you (just remember that this is based on what you are paying for).

I was told they would hold my luggage for 2 hours while I was at a meeting, only to have another front desk member lambast me for even asking as it is not a service they would ever provide. They told me I could change in their bar restroom, which I did, only to come out 10 minutes later and have them tell me I could take my things up to my room as it was in fact ready. I don't think communication is their forte. I had an additional issue at check-in. My rooms were prepaid from a tour company but the front desk assistant said they were not and refused to check the system or call the company to confirm that they were already paid for. She demanded to charge my credit card and eventually refunded it when it turned out to be their error. However, I had to go ask about the refund, the front desk never alerted me that this had happened; I had to hear it from the tour company. So on the front desk aspect, this place is a horror. The room was sparse, but clean. The bed was very hard but the linens were clean. I saw no evidence of bedbugs as previously reported (I was on the 6th floor) and I checked thoroughly so hopefully they have remediated this problem. The walls are very thin and you can hear everything the person next to you is doing. There was a 1 inch gap between my hall door and the floor so I had to stuff a towel in to block out light and noise from the hallway. Decor and furniture is dated. Location was ok.

Looking around the room you'll find only a small place to put your clothes. What is supposed to be a cupboard, has not enough place for one person, not to speak for two. But the adventure goes on.

That means some unknown sort of tea, some melted, very salted butter, bread, jam and some dreadfull croissants. If you would like some yoghurt, fruits chease or meat you must pay extra. And all these when you could go nearby and have a delicious breakfast at half the price of the horrific \"continental breakfast\". You get back to your room and ask for the internet. There is none. You have to pay 5 pounds for 1 hour when nearby you could have internet acces for 1,5 an hour. The hotel provides internet acces at the basement, in a very small room, with no ventilation. Don't imagine that you could use your mobile in that place. You're not in the tube but you're in the same situation; no mobile signal. In case you want to have something printed you'll find yourself send to a hostle nearby. The hotel can't help you. It's time to go. There is no luggage place.

Myself and my partner had arrived in London having been up from 3am british time flying from Palma. Having lugged our bags around we eventually got to the hotel around 3-4pm physically and mentally exhausted. We had requested a double room and arrived to find a small twin room which had any space possible taken up by our bags (which the concierge or anyone else didnt offer to help with). We immediately requested a change of room from 417 I believe and were then switched to 517 (I am not 100% certain of the numbers) which was again miniscule. It began to get even better, as we noticed a power box of some sort right directly behind the bed which I would imagine would surely be a safety hazard. There was also a loose skirting board and bits of carpet not laid properly with threads clearly visible and parts of it partially ripped. Having lifted the duvet it was clear the bed was also not clean judging by the amount of hair in it. I congratulate you for having the first bed I have ever seen in need of a shave! The pictures of the above are attached! We immediately rang reception who promised to get housekeeping to contact us, 15 minutes later having not heard a word we decided to go back to reception and complain. At this stage we were very tired, our bags had been lugged around all day to the point where it felt like an extra body part(s). We told reception we were extremely disappointed with this treatment as we were very tired from travelling and had hoped to rest and wash before meeting friends. We had now changed rooms twice which was a waste of time given the 3rd room was again miniscule (700 and something). Once again no discount/major apology was offered and once more we had to lug our bags again as the staff didnt offer to (concierge was watching sky at this point). This experience has made me extremely angry and frustrated and certainly put a huge downer on my trip to London, things didnt improve as the staff then just ignored us for the rest of the trip even when we made the effort to say hello. Manners dont cost much do they? This included the cleaning staff who didnt even acknowledge us and one member of staff seeing me come out of the lift and turning their back! I began reading some more reviews on my phone which were surprisingly good until I discovered that despite having a concierge there was no facilites to look after our bags until it was time for us to make our way to Gatwick on our check out day. This turned out to be true when we enquired. We again complained that it was the least that could be done given our issue with the rooms and the money we paid (\u20ac213 not the dearest price, but it is dear when you consider how much we had to save given our bills, only for I had already been charged through Otel.com I would have left the hotel minutes after arriving). Although I was told facilities are not provided to store bags, I fail to see the purpose of a concierge who from what I can see did absolutely nothing other than watch sky and couldnt even speak english! The reception staff in trying to explain muttered and mumbled a half hearted apology which just made me leave in utter frustration (to lug our bags around once more, to Victoria at a cost of \u00a325). This most defintely the cherry on top of an awful experience which more or less ruined my trip to London. This merely describes my anger and utter frustration with the rooms and the service and staff from the hotel, I am utterly disgusted with the treatment received. I would most defintely not recommend this hotel to anyone! That said I would welcome your comments and a response to this, (an offer of a refund wouldnt go amiss) otherwise I would certainly have no problem in posting this or my views to deter any future visit for anyone across the world on the many websites I use to book hotels (and I am not talking just about tripadvisor or facebook). Given my experience of working in the Government for over a decade I would also certainly not hesitate to contact a local representative or Government Minister to highlight the issues I have raised. I await your response. Yours Sincerely PART 2 Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your email. First you have booked a room in the quiet zone which is in the basement and is a room without windows. But we have allocated a nice standard room which was not up to your expectations and as a courtesy we have moved you to an executive room on the 7thfloor for which the rate is 50% higher than the room you have booked. I refer you to our website which clearly shows that we don\u2019t offer luggage storage facilities and concierge service. And I must attract your attention that we are a 3*** hotel, not a 4**** or a 5***** deluxe. On your next visit to Central Park Hotel please contact me personally and I will be there to welcome you and make sure you get a very nice, executive room at no extra cost. Kind Regards, ********************* Front Office Manager Central Park Hotel 49/67 Queensborough Terrace London W2 3SY PART 3 (which has not been responded to) dear xxxx, Thank you for your response. I am confused as how you came to the conclusion that I booked a room in the basement without windows? The rooms were on the 4th and 5th floors and did have windows. You then suggest that I was moved to the 7th floor into an executive room yet it didnt look at all different from either of the other 2 rooms I declined. Your explanation that \"we are a 3*** hotel, not a 4**** or a 5***** deluxe. \" is true but I can clearly see that from the site and it is almost as if you are saying that as an explanation for things being so poor. I didnt expect a 5 star hotel and a presidential suite but I certainly expect a lot better from a hotel I pay over 100 Euros a night for. The 2 star travelodge I stayed in near Gatwick airport had a room twice the size for \u00a319, whilst its not exactly the centre of London, it was much better value. I also note that you say you dont provide a concierge service yet there is a picture of it on the main site, as they didnt look after the bags/or even offer any assistance to us, I am not sure what the purpose of it was. Whilst your site does not indeed advertise that it stores luggage I would have assumed that this was a basic service provided as it has been in probably every hotel I have ever stayed in.

Since this is what I did, I will focus my review on how this worked out for me. The hotel itself is located on a fairly unassuming street directly across from Hyde Park. The are several other hotels on the block but they look more like apartment complexes than hotels. Central Park is the only one that actually looks like a hotel. The hotel itself is located withing an easy five minute walk (two blocks over) of the Queensway and Bayswater station. This gives you easy access to the Central tube line and the Circle/District line. On the same block as the tube stations are supermarkets, restaurants, banks (including Pizza Hut, Burger King and McDonalds) and a in-door shopping center. There are also lots of tourist shops that sell t-shirts and other junk. When you go here BE CAREFUL! There are lots of people so I would not be worried about being mugged but there is also an unsavory element which will become immediately apparent. My wife had her pocketbook stolen while we were there so please do not underestimate the level of caution you should take. We did and paid for it (quite literally). Back to the Hotel. The front desk is open 24 hours and the people are friendly and helpful. We needed to documents faxed to us from the US due to the theft and they always found their way to our room. The room itself is small but comfortable. There is a small LCD TV which gets a surprising amount of channels as well as a desk and small couch. The bedroom is in a separate room. The bathroom was interesting. The shower was fine but it was very high off the ground. At 5'3, I need to be cautious when getting in/out. The toilet seat was actually broken. It still functioned (well to the extent any cheap toilet with little to no water pressure can function) but it was disappointing. There were plenty of outlets throughout the room so we were able to keep our devices charged. The in-room WiFi worked but I would not try to do anything more than email or basic web browsing. The room does not have air conditioning. This is not a problem in April but could be in the summer. While leaving the windows open may seem to be a good idea, the street itself is noisy. One nice feature was the fridge. With the close proximity of a supermarket and the use of a fridge, we were able to enjoy some early morning and late night snacks at a reasonable cost. Breakfast, depending on what you signed up for, can be very meager. We had the continental breakfast which was really just rolls & cereal with bread and butter. I will have to admit that the rolls were pretty good. They also offer an upgrade to pre-made eggs and ham but for the price they are asking, you can go less than a block away and get three times the selection of food and better quality. Your call really. There is room service but we did not try it. The Hotel also has a bar in the front lobby but we never visited it. Really the most important thing to me was that when we got there and when we checked out, things moved quickly and without incident. They accepted the vouchers from Go-Today and did not try to hit me up with any additional fees. One other note... they also did a good job in cleaning the rooms from day to day. We always had fresh towels. In summary, if you are on a budget, do not care about AC and want a place that gives you easy access to public transportation, you really can't go wrong with this Hotel.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDoes not even provide left luggage service\u201d", "Author": "Evabluebell", "ReviewID": "UR115578516", "Content": "Stayed here two night, last minute booking.

The shower was quite something - the shower head came some two feet out of the wall (no-one knows why) and the glass shower wall came some 2 and a half feet out. In consequence, every time you took a shower you flooded (and I do mean flooded) the bathroom. The carpet was so dirty that we always walked around in our shoes (someone had also managed to burn the mark of an iron on our carpet). I went downstairs to ask reception if they had a secure area to keep valuables such as laptops and other things (since the safe didn't work). The lady looked at me like she'd never heard of such an idea. The location was noisy because of all the partying that was going on and because there is no air conditioning, you had to leave the windows open. I don't blame the hotel for that as it is a function of the location. This hotel relies on having a good location and charging accordingly but doesn't deliver.

The breakfast was also expensive and poor (\u00a35 continental and \u00a37 english). This was not an issue, there are so much restaurantsa round the corner proposing cheaper and better breakfast.

It was included in our travel package and were excited as we knew the hotel was located in a great location. My mother and I stayed at the Central Park Hotel for 4 nights and 4 days. Our room was in the 800s and in between the ground and first floor. To get to our room we needed to go up two small flights of stairs as there was no elevator access. We were able to check in about an hour and a half early (check in is at 3pm). Our room was very clean. There is a mini fridge, water heater with various coffees and teas, and a small flat screen TV, a towel heater and heated floors. For two people the room was quite spacious. Our room faced the front of the hotel and as it's in between the ground and first floor we were able to look out onto the street. We were clearly able to see people outside and had to be mindful to close the blinds. The only downside to having a room on this floor is that we couldn't open the window for fresh air. But there was no street noise and we were able to sleep very very well. The walls are a bit thin, but not to the point were it was bothersome. We heard the guest next door cough a few times and were able to hear the water pipes when someone would take a shower, but for us it was never a big deal. My only complaint would be the shower. Perhaps it was the way the bathroom was modeled, but they could easily install a real shower with a glass door. When you turn on the water it seemed to go everywhere as there is only a cloth blend shower curtain to protect the rest of the bathroom. By the time someone was done with the shower the area nearest the shower (including the carpet outside of the bathroom) was usually wet. Breakfast was included in our package and we were offered a free continental breakfast every morning of our stay. The continental breakfast is worth 2.5 pounds so take it for what it is worth. You're given a choice of apple and orange juices, coffee, teas, croissants, rolls, toast and cereal. There is an option for a hot breakfast but that is at a higher cost. There's no free wifi available which is a bit of a drawback, but not a deal breaker. In the end, the hotel is no frills. Don't expect the Ritz Carlton, it is very basic at the most. But, the room was always clean and tidy by the time we came back. It had a luggage rack which easily fit two 25 inch suitcases and there is enough room to walk around in. There was enough room to fit toiletries, things needed for the day, enough power sockets for our electronics, and a blow dryer. The beds/pillows were comfortable and the hotel is located on a quiet block. If you walk 5 minutes to Queensway you'll hit the major food/shopping/restaurant area. If anything, I would change the shower, but it's not a deal breaker when given the location of the hotel.

We were allowed to leave our luggage in the room, as we arrived in the morning. The room is small. No drawers, no towel rack or hook in the bathroom. (They put towels on a shelf at the end of the tub). Shower curtain rod too close to the ceiling to hang a towel on it. Room- not too dirty, did not see any bugs. Only 1 chair (at the desk) & a small table we used as a shelf. Bathroom sink did not drain & after reporting to housekeeping, it was not fixed. Next evening, called desk 2 more times before the substitute manager (from food & beverage) came up & poured bleach down the drain & removed the drain plug. Very noisy area. Again, as mentioned, we had to keep the window opened because it was so hot & no fan available. Earplugs a necessity. Small fridge where drawers might have been. If you use it, leave the cabinet door open so the heat build-up doesn't keep the fridge from cooling. Concierge tries to be helpful. Don't use room telephone! The card said it cost 1.5 pounds to make a toll-free call- but 2 persons at the desk said that charge was Per Minute! Local calls also expensive. Very inconvenient to be unable to make necessary calls from room. Used their computer at 1 pound per 30 minutes. Agree, the continental breakfast was not very good & (as I recall- arrangements were made 6 months ago) rather expensive for what you get. It is about what is available at budget motels in the US at no extra fee. If we'd known all available restaurants in the neighborhood before booking, we'd likely had breakfast out.

So if you find one line down you will still be able to travel to and from your destinations with ease. You are also within a few minutes walk of Hyde Park. The next street over is Queensway. You will find a number of tourist shops selling the usual \"I heart London\" shirts etc. These shops do compete with each other by having the items marked down or offering a discount for large purchase, or for return purchases. The back of your receipt may have a % off discount on your next purchase. The shops feel very friendly. You will find a few inexpensive internet cafes in the area. Ask if they have headsets if you want Skype home or Skype your calls in London as the hotel charges a lot for phone use. There is also a nice indoor mall a couple of blocks down called Whiteleys. This street also has Boots, Tesco Metro, McDonalds, Burger King, Pubs, etc all a short walk away. Now about the Hotel. I was booked in this hotel as part of a package. The deal was good and London is awesome. My deal included airport transfers as well as some excursions. The day prior to the excursions I was instructed to call the tour company to book our seats. I went to the Concierges desk to ask if he normally set up the pickups. He told me he could sell me tours but had nothing to do with the tours I had included with my package. As I wanted to call home anyway, I went to an internet cafe and Skype'd the tour companies and set everything up. We had met up with a very nice couple from White Rock and they told us of the trouble and huge cost they had getting their phone to work in their room so we did not bother to even try. In the morning we went to the concierge and asked what were we needed to go to catch the bus to our tour. Everyone who spoke to him got the same answer, just wait outside. This did work out as the tour company Evan Evans Tours did a good job setting things up. (Something to remember, the tour companies do not take you back to your hotel, you will need to find your own way. Luckily the tube works great at getting you around.) The day we went to check out, again we went to the Concierge and told him we have a pickup in our itinerary to return us to the airport. Again his answer was just wait outside. As we stood there with all the other people told the same thing, every ten minutes or so, one of us would go back in and ask him to call to ensure our buss was coming. He would again say just wait outside. After our bus was about an hour late and we were getting concerned about missing our flight, our friend from White Rock got more forceful with the Concierge and finally convinced the Concierge to pass over his phone and he called the bus company. The bus company sent out a bus to pick us up and the driver told us, somehow our group had been missed on the route schedule. The \"Concierge\" sat behind the counter but refused to do anything at all. The room itself was small and basic. It had its own on suite (not all London hotels do) and it served our needs. The breakfast was not too bad. We did not pay the extra for the hot breakfast as it appeared to be a couple of strips of bacon, eggs , and all the included stuff. The breakfast which was include in the room price consisted of toast and pastries, cereal, coffee and juice. This suited me fine as I do not have a full breakfast every day, but I could hear some people were not happy. The room was clean and the cleaning staff were friendly. We needed to open our window as we had no AC, unfortunately this meant listening to the AC on the roof bellow. Internet time can be purchased in the hotel but as I did not bring my laptop, I did not look into the cost. All in all the Hotel was not great but not too bad.

I then asked her to ring and find out exactly when it would be released. shortly after some form of tall male manager appeared named Abdul came to talk to us.

I presummed it would be a spider but a very large bug came charging out of the bathroom, shortly followed by anouther. After stamping on them closer inspection showed them to be COCKROACHES!

I took them down the Concierge and he came to inspect the room, which he did poorly as shortly after he left my poor girlfirend discovered yet anouther one!

The Concierge came and saw the COCKROACH and just left it there.

Not very nice experience, if your wife is staying naked at the middle of the room. Reception stuff was helpful, very rarely smiling however. Breakfast. Yes, it is plain but eatable. And what do you expect for the price? Small juice glasses that were already mentioned here several times. Do not complain, just make an extra trip to the juice machine. Very friendly, helpful and smiling stuff in the dining area. One really bad thing already mentioned by at least two travelers: bed bugs. We were bitten and we found several bugs marching on the walls. The hotel HAS to do something about that, I am afraid. Internet: go to the internet cafe at the hostel close to the bus stop at Bayswater Road, three minutes from the hotel. In summary: We may try this hotel again if we are in London, however at first we will ask them about the bed bugs and we will check the Tripadvisor.", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Timothy1965", "Title": "\u201cCaution --- bedbugs\u201d", "Author": "Timothy1965", "ReviewID": "UR46413821", "Content": "I found most of the aspect of this hotel satisfactory.

The hotel staff was very accommodating about our repeatedly changing our booking to get the best rates possible. The weekday rates were very attractive at around 60 GBP a day (no breakfast). The room is a simple, no frills room with a safe, a tiny television and a mini fridge. The room and bathroom were very clean which was really all we needed. We arrived early and the staff was quickly found us a room by 9:00 AM even though our check in time was 1:00 PM. We asked for a non-basement room at the back of the hotel. So we did not have any problem with the noise. The room got fairly stuffy at night if you closed the windows, so we had to leave the windows open all the time. But the heating was quite effective and the blankets warm, so that did not really pose a problem. Good things about the hotel: 1. Location: As a tourist, this was an amazing location, just within 5-8 minute walk of two London underground stations and within 5 tube stops of most famous London attraction. Also within walking distance is the lovely Protobello market. The hotel is also a pickup point for many coach tours 2. Cleanliness: The rooms are very clean as is the bathroom. I'm quite allergic to dust and the blankets never caused me to sneeze, that meant they were really clean. The sheets and towels looked like they were changed daily. 3.Comfort: The room was warm and cozy with comfortable beds. If you shut the windows, it did get stuffy- but we were lucky and had good weather through the trip, so the windows just stayed open. I thought it was a fair sized room, but my friend thought it a bit small. Things I did not like about the hotel: 1. No luggage room: If you have a late flight out, there's no luggage room you can leave your bags at. Carrying our bags around on the last day was a bit uncomfortable 2. No lunch/dinner served: The hotel does not serve lunch or dinner- luckily we were prepared for this and so made arrangements 3. Rude staff: While the folks at the front desk were very pleasant and helpful, the hotel manager and housekeeping staff were quite rude. Though I must say the housekeeping staff were very honest. We were careless enough to leave the safe open with quite a sum of money in it one day and not a penny was missing when we returned. If you plan to use the hotel only as a base to explore London, i.e. you won't really be spending your day at the hotel- it'd just be a place to crash at night, then I really recommend the hotel.

Here's the list of problems with the hotel... and then some advises and good news for those, who already booked there - Rooms are extremely tiny, dated, noisy (due to thin walls and windows that don't shut tightly), and draughty- so plan your trip in such way that you don't stay in them for anything other than sleeping. - There are no basic hotel commodities, such as swimming pool, gym, normal bar (theirs is tiny, fully lit, with no selection, and unfriendly staff). So if for some reason you have to stay in, you are going to die of boredom... - There is no restaurant (other than for breakfast), so if, after a day of exploring London onf foot, you feel like a quiet dinner not far from 'home' so that you can crush right after, you are either going to go to bed hungry, or have to travel some more. - If you are intending to eat out in the neighbourhood, however, you are out of luck also... The area is extremaly touristy, so if you are looking for decent food, you might need to take subway to nicer areas around London. We could not find any decent restaurant around the area... just dingy dives, with staff not caring to provide decent service. Thankfully, the location is very close (10-15 min) to a lot of nicer areas, and you are also very close to all tourists' attractions. - Service at the hotel... Not the friendliest bunch, but if you command your way in stern manner, they tend to accomodate. We needed extra pillows and requested them. Did not get them up until next day, and after we had to ask for them again, and received a call from front desk with an inquiry as to why do we require more pillows (???)... they also did not provide us with extra blankets... apparently, they don't have any (???), so they brought heater, which smelled like something died and burned inside it. - Food (cold breakfast). If you like tasteless bread and disgusting coffee- go ahead and enjoy. My advise to those of you, who don't, go to the near by Qeenstreet and get yourself tea/instant coffee, sugar, milk, some fresh baguettes, and cheese, and have your own breakfast in the comfort of your room. There is a fridge and kettle in the room, so if you are not lazy, for very cheap you can cater to your own needs. - The best thing about the place is that it is extremely close to major attractions, and unterground is just 3-5 minutes walk from it. Also, it is relatively inexpensive. If you can, change your reservations to some other place. If not, do yourself a favor, take all the cosmetic/bath necessities with yourself (the ones provided at the hotel are not good), get some compact air freshner, your own face towel, and ear plugs... and most importantly, have an open mind. You are not there for the hotel. London is one of the nicer cities in the world, and there is not enough time in the day to see everything, so just spend most of the time out, and enjoy every moment of it:)", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "donegal, ireland", "Title": "\u201cThe hotel is in a good location and very close to the underground station\u201d", "Author": "tinneydonna", "ReviewID": "UR43363626", "Content": "At first when i read the reviews i did not want to stay in the hotel.

This was for a short three day stay during half term with my 8 year old son. As I was travelling alone I needed a central location in a decent area of London. This hotel provided just that. I found the reception staff to be efficent it took around five minutes to check in and less to check out. The room was comfortable and whilst not huge was fine for my self and my son. Having read poor reviews of the breakfasts we took our own croissants and there is a fridge in every room so we supplemented our breakfast with cheese and yogurt. IIf a cooked breakfast is high on your list of priorities there are numerous cafes and restaurants five minutes away on Queensway. can't comment on the breakfasts, but I found all of the other negative comments that I had read to be unfounded. The rooms were spotless and were cleaned and replenished everyday, all amenities were as described. I have stayed in more luxurious hotels but I have also paid the price for them as well, this room was had at a budget price particularly for such a great location, five minutes from two tube stations, 5 minutes from Hyde Park and five mins from a bus stop serving central London. My only reservation would be the unpleasant instant coffee that is left in the room, if coffee is your thing you may want to take your own supply or visit one of the nearby coffee shops, but this really is a small quibble. I cannot find any real faults with this hotel, it is not the Dorchester, but if you were not planning on spending hundreds or thousands of pounds per night then this hotel is fine. I felt safe staying there and walking back in the early hours after a theatre trip with my young son, I had no problems with the staff or any amenities and would recommend this hotel.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Egypt", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location small rooms\u201d", "Author": "Aya_Ob", "ReviewID": "UR31281403", "Content": "I have stayed in central park hotel 3 times, the location is excellent 3 minutes away from the queensway tube station, 1 minute from the bus station, just cross the street and you will be in kesington park. the rooms are very small but last time i went they gave us relatively a bigger room.

Being on the ground floor with sealed windows we had to have the A/C on almost all the time. The housekeeping staff are wonderful, extra towels, spotless room etc. The continental breakfast is crap, cold cereal, stale bread and a few old rolls, the so-called upgrade breakfast buffet looked horrible, it sat out from very early in the morning. The front desk staff, very helpful, but never said hello or made eye contact, which I think is their inability to speak English. Once a request was mad it was filled immediately! As mentioned in one of the most recent reviews, the Asian fellow did not speak much English, was very unhelpful and dare I say, rude, or very stupid.

There were no towel racks or hooks in the bathroom. I had to lay my new clothes in the sink so I would have them nearby after a shower. The room had one electrical outlet with two places to plug in. They charge about $40 us per day for internet; save your money and go to any McDonald's in London for free internet. Location was very close to two tube stations and lots of restaurants and souvenir stores. Noise level was fairly quiet at night except for some live jazz nearby. If we closed the windows (double pane) the room was quiet. HOWEVER, the room had a radiator that always gave off some heat even when it was turned as low as possible. Because of the constant heat in the room at night, we had to suffer with outside sounds and have the windows open. After the 2nd night I asked the front desk for a fan and they did bring one for us to use. Otherwise, the room would have been impossible to say in at night. I wouldn't stay there again.

LOCATION: Good in that it is about 2-3 blocks from two tube stations which are on different tube lines. There was construction blocking most of the street that the hotel is on, so I don't know how busy it usually is. FRONT DESK: This hotel had a conceirge desk, but they weren't helpful. The concierge from Asia seemed as though he wanted to help, but his accent was so thick that I could not understand one word in ten. The other concierge appeared to be from the Middle East, and he didn't want to help. I came down once to ask a question. There was no one else at his desk but me. Rather than say, \"May I call Housekeeping for you?\" - which would have let me know that it was a Housekeeping issue, but he was willing to be helpful - he told me to call Housekeeping. The entire front desk seems to be learning how to do their jobs, and they ignore people. They didn't even tell me how to turn on the lights in the room. (The room key is put in a holder right inside the door. This lets the light be turned on, and, when you remove your door key to leave, it turns them off.) This took me a few minutes to figure out, and it would have been nice if the front desk informed me of this. There was usually a free newspaper near the desk. Occasionally the Financial Times, but usually one of the free ones you get at the Tube stations. NO LUGGAGE STORAGE! ROOM: Big, but that could be because the trumble bed under my bed would make the room a triple. There was a small refrigerator in the room. It didn't work, but when I called, a newer one was put in. (It only kept things cool, but it was nice to have one.) On what Americans would call the 3rd floor, in a room facing the front, I could hear traffic from Bayswater Road, so I suggest ear plugs. One evening I heard some loud people outside, but it was only for a short period of tiem. There was one drawer in the room, and that was a small one in the nightstand. There were only four hangers in the closet, and Housekeeping would only let me have two more. (This is for two people in the room.) The TV remote threw me. (You click a number to turn it on, but hit the power switch to turn it off. When I called, someone came and showed me how to use it. There was a tub and a shower head. It was a bit of a climb to get in the tub, and it tended to be slippery. There were no places to hang clothes or towels, but the water pressure was good, and there was lots of hot water. HOUSEKEEPING: They did an acceptable job of cleaning, and were quick to bring an extra blanket and pillow when I called. MEALS: I didn't use the bar, the restaurant, or room service. The breakfast that came with the room consisted of cereal (three types), toast, dinner rolls, croissants, coffee, and SMALL cups that held about two ounces of OJ, apple juice, or milk. You're greated by an attractive lobby when you enter, too bad the behavior of the front desk staff/conceirge staff isn't as attractive.

This was a bit shocking for the beginning as I have stayed at really good hotels previously and this room was obviously of different size and equipment. However, all basic things I expected were there (safe, tv, hairdryer, teapot with a cup, plate and tea/coffee, even bath in my small bathroom, fridge) and this trip was low budget, therefore it was ok for me. Breakfast (continental) was basics as well, cereals, toasts/breads with jam, tea, coffee, juice. Thats all. But if you like that kind of food, its really ok. However, I didnt like the tea and brought mine. My safe broke down and it was repaired in 5 minutes after I told it to the guy at the reception.. Wi fi in room costs 5 gbp per hour, therefore I used internet in the \"business centre\" for 2 gbp per hour... The room was quiet. You can hear door slams and talking in the corridor, but in general it was ok. Location of the hotel is one of its greatest advantages, as it is 5 min away from queensway tube station (Central line) and some 7 min away from bayswater tube station (Circle line). As I came from Gatwick airport, I only had to take train to London (to Victoria station) and one tube line to the hotel, which was really convenient. And, during those 2 weeks, there were times when one or other tube line didnt work (repair works etc.), therefore there was always possibility to take the other tube line. Bus stop is some 3 mins away the hotel, even more convenient than tube station. Surroundings...In the nearby streets there are a lot of (cheap) souvenier shops, a lot of restaurants, food shop, and one amazing italian cafe :)) And I also discovered small mall with H&M and Zara...And, of course, Hyde park! One more thing - tv had some 6 programmes only :) Therefore \"the basics\" is the best word to describe the hotel. Well, to sum up - I was satisfied with the hotel, as it was cheap and had a really good location. Good choice for budget trips and non-grumblers!

It\u2019s versatility, it's thriving night-life, it's enormous shops, it's tranquil parks and much more... It must be Europe\u2019s grandest city. For the final two night of our travel through all of the UK, eventually leading to London, we decided to stay in a somewhat more luxurious hotel than the previous hotel/motels we stayed in. We were exhausted and we needed a good place to rest, located somewhere from were could easily explore the city. Choosing for the Central Park Hotel (which is supposedly of 3 star quality) was one of the WORST decisions we made throughout our many travels. As we came in, there was a giant queue in front of us, we needed to wait for more than 30 minutes before being told that we couldn\u2019t check in any time before three o\u2019clock. After three o\u2019clock, my fianc\u00e9e and I went to visit the Hyde Park in the meanwhile, a chubby lady who seemed to be inseparably surrounded by a strikingly strong odour of sweat and being relentlessly sulky towards us, said she wasn\u2019t yet capable to check us in for a twofold reason: there was no room available, there was no booking made (?!?). After I showed her my conformation and her inquiring at the reservation office, it took another 30 minutes for her to return, she admitted that it was simply not posted correctly in the system she worked from. So we where finally checked in. She said breakfast wasn\u2019t included in the rate, but after I showed her my conformation again, she annoyingly admitted it was. We got four, clearly already used, vouchers. The roomed that was given to us was remarkably tiny, imagine a cramp single room with a king-size bed in there, that\u2019s how it seemed. It was clearly smaller than the rooms of cheaper hotels we stayed in during our may travels. After noticing the dust on our in our windowsill and the stains in our bath we went down again to kindly ask for another room. The lady, still the same one and the only one apparently on service, who seemed annoyed while ending her Internet chat sessions to answer my request, simply said that there were no other rooms available. If we would come back in the morning, she said literally: \u201cMaybe one of my colleagues the other morning wants to change it for you, check it with them.\u201d I informed her, which is true and not just a lie that suits the situation, about my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s asthma, and that my fianc\u00e9e couldn\u2019t stay in a room as dirty as the one we were allocated in, she simply replied, \u201cThat\u2019s your problem, sir.\u201d The other morning though, after not-enjoying the cheap breakfast (only spongy croissant with some jam, no, jelly with a colour, we asked again, and still the receptionists weren\u2019t able, some maybe not even capable, of changing our room. My fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t sleep all night because of her condition, but I didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate using this in the argument, until everything resulted in me speaking to an uncaring, uninterested, bad tempered front-office manager. Still nothing happened. My fianc\u00e9e brought two towels from home. We were planning to sleep in hotels, but you never know for sure whatever your come across (like what happened in the CPH). After we asked for two new towels, the original ones had suspicious stains on them, we were presented with two greasy new ones. My fianc\u00e9e therefore decided to use one of her own. In the morning, after coming back disappointed from asking (applying seems a better fit term) for a new room, we found that our towels had been removed by housekeeping that was already cleaning everything. After calling reception, where they put us through to concierge, where they asked us to call housekeeping, where I was put on hold before being put through to a lady, we were explained that the towels had already been taken downstairs by mistake. In the evening after seven, we noticed they weren\u2019t delivered back, so I informed at the concierge desk. They didn\u2019t know, they asked the duty manager, a kind gentleman from India, who would ask housekeeping again. The next morning even after check-out they didn\u2019t find anything, they would just take another look which raised the suspicion the didn\u2019t look at all. We left without them, leaving our address at the concierge desk, but nothing was sent home. It is not about losing the towels, we might have thrown them away in the end anyway, but it\u2019s about the hotel fetching guest\u2019s possessions and not even taking an effort to return them to there righteous owners! The hotel is horribly dirty and cheap for a ridiculous high rate.

We found ALL of the staff to be very pleasant, particularly Paula at the lobby bar. We initeracted with many different nations at this hotel, which we found interesting. The rooms were clean (and cleaned daily) with fresh towels, however, bring your own face cloth/sponge. They also had a mini fridge in the room which we really liked...great for storing water, milk, etc. The location was awesome as well...steps to the Queensway Tube station, numerous eateries, etc. Do yourself a favour and dine at Tuk Tuk on Queensway, we ended up there on 4 occasions during an 8 day stay...outstanding Thai/Chinese cuisine. We walked EVERYWHERE for the entire 8 days and covered all kinds of territory, places like Oxford Street, Soho, Theatre district, Lambeth, Southwark, Holborn, Wesminster, Hyde Park, etc, etc. London is truly a FANTASTIC walking city, with so much history to see and explore.

Even with the window closed, you could be woken up out of a deep sleep. My advice to you is if your a light sleeper, request a room opposite from the street. Our package included the continental breakfast, which would have been great, however, for some unknown reason, we were upgraded to the \"English breakfast\", which now included bacon, 2 types of eggs, sausage, beans and what appeared to be a deep fried toast of some sort. Some people could be heard complianing about certain foods being \"not hot enough\" but we had no problems with it, afterall, we were on holiday and not cooking so what's to complain about. Overall, we had a blast in London and were extremely satisfied with choosing the Central Park Hotel.

The hotel's common areas (lobby, bar and breakfast area) have all undergone a sleek reburbishment within the last two years. (You can see the pictures on the hotel's website.) Like others have said, though, the rooms remain tired and dated. During each of our stays, we did comment on the cleanliness of the bathrooms, but the decor and carpeting in the rooms and hallways is stained, and certainly does not match the contemporary style of the common areas. On the positive side, there are 3 lifts, free luggage storage, windows that actually open (no air-con), and in-room coffee and tea making facilities. We do hope the rooms are next on the list for an update. However, you can be sure the rates will increase once that happens. We booked a twin room through Venere.com for a steal at 98 GBP per night. We also hope management will consider upgrading the continental breakfast offered with the room rate. Consisting of cereal, stale croissants, bread, coffee, tea and the tiniest juice, it is really not worth the trouble. Fresh delicious scones, muffins and baguettes can be had from any number of establishments on Queensway.

Decent, affordable hotels are hard to come by. We hired a three bed room and it was fairly priced, especially considering we were struggling to find deals on rooms for three people. We had asked for a double bed and a single bed as we were a married couple travelling with one other person; however, we received three single beds. We were too tired to argue, and to be honest we probably got a better sleep (haha). The outside of the building and the lobby are fairly nice and don't look like the standard white Victorian hotel that there is an abundance of; unfortunately, the rooms were not as nice as the entrance. The rooms were in need of reburbishment as they were old and worn. Seeing past the dated decor, the bedding and bathroom was very clean. The bathroom was humerous, when we opened the door we saw what was smaller than our walk-in-robe at home. The toilet was right up against the bath tub/shower. My husband who is 6\"4 nearly had a heart attack and looked at me with pleading eyes asking how on earth he was to use this space or lack there of. For the money the hotel is better than average for London. Elsewhere in the world you would get better for the money, but as far as London goes it was a decent hotel. I had been told that the Concierge was lovely - he must have had time off as we were given grumpy from the seven dwarfs who appeared to be irritated by the fact that we wanted to ask directions and get a 2p photocopy of a map. He wore his golden keys on his lapels, which glinted and mocked me by the lack of serivce and pleasantries he showed. Lastly, we had arrived at the hotel early and our room wasn't ready for us to check in. So we asked for the front desk to store our luggage in their store room. I explained clearly that two bags had glass and other breakables in it. We were told not to worry. I reiterated that there were breakables. Upon returning we discovered that one of the bags was being crushed by a large suitcase and the other bag had obviously fallen and was upside down. I personally was very unimpressed, when I complained the guy said it wasn't him. No sorry was given - luckily my items weren't broken. The location is nice as it is basically facing Kensington Gardens which lead on to Hyde Park. We walked to Harrods etc, which is quite a walk. Best to catch the bus to the sites and back. Fairly cheap for tickets - for three people it was less than 12 pounds in total for a return trip.

These rooms are ideal if you just want something clean to sleep, shower and get ready. They are not luxurious but they are acceptable. The walls are paper thin so might not be good if you ae a lightsleeper without earplugs! One of the days my meetings were cancelled so I decided to have a lie in and chill out- The cleaners were so loud, chatting in a foreign language nonstop and seemed to be cleaning the whole day 9am until 4pm!!Not a problem if you are out sightseeing but if you are planning to spend you daytime there then not ideal at all.

Once in the cab the cabbie raised the price to 18 GBP! I assume the guys and/or the management at the hotel get a kickback for this \"service\". Second example of how badly these guys treat customers is the exchange rate. Hotel rates are not normally the best but they are usually in the zone. Not so here-- with the USD/GBP rate at 1.93 these guys have a posted exchange rate of 2.23! That has to be the worst in the world! Incredible. These guys are not your friends.

The room is tiny with not enough space for us to move around in, the fridge isn't working, I think we might have been in the renovated part but it doesn't look like it. The bathroom is also tiny - there is no space to dry yourself etc and to get the hot water you needed to run the water for a while. One day we had no hot water at all and when we rung reception the phone was constantly engaged - probably taken off the hook in anticipation of all the complaints. Breakfast was ok - like other reviewers said there is not a lot of variety - fresh rolls, tea/coffee, juice, cornflakes or muesli and other condiments but it is sufficient. The hot breakfast is not good value for money, there are other restaurants etc in the local area which provide a better hot english breakfast. Your breakfast has to be paid for there and then (if you are paying for the hot option) it cannot be charged to your room. TV - only a couple of BBC stations, channel 5 and arabic stations. No pay movies etc. Phone - you cannot pick up the phone and make a call which is ridiculous for a hotel even if its a 2 star! You have to pay a 20 pound deposit if you wish to use your phone, EVEN if you have given them your credit card for your account. Taxi - Be VERY careful with the hotel taxi, we were nearly ripped off by the taxi they organised us - he tried to charge us 8 pounds more than what a black cab would cost and when we queried the cost pretended he was recalculating and reduced his price substantially. There are no meters in their taxis so make sure you get a price before you start your journey. Its just as easy to go onto Bayswater Road and hail a cab, at least you know you wont get ripped off by a dodgy cab operator. Internet - pretty expensive, was originally paying 5 pounds for 2 hours but this was changed yesterday so now you pay 5 pounds for 1 hour. Wireless which is good. Staff - on the whole seemed friendly however hard to understand and converse with. Over the phone conversation is totally lost in translation.

The room was clean and tidy and was of typical size for this kind of hotel but the bathroom was a bit on the small side.The toilet pan was also unusually small.Gentlemen would discover this when they sat on it - if you get my meaning!! Our toilet wouldn't flush very well either, it took six or seven attempts to get rid of any embarressment.One other small niggle was there was no shower/shampoo gel supplied.Even some of the most budget hotels I have stayed in supplied it in either mini bottle form or as a dispenser on the wall.Mini soap bars were supplied however.Our bed was very comfortable.The bar lounge stayed open until 1am,in fact,it stayed open a little longer if there were enough people in.The Aussie barman (I never did get his name)was very friendly and helpful although the bar prices were typical West London - \u00a33.20 for a pint of Fosters,but that wasn't the barmans fault.Still can't grumble too much after all we were getting the hotel for free. The buffet breakfast in the morning was plentiful but we opted for the cooked English breakfast at \u00a34 each which was very good value for money.It was hot and tasty and you could still help yourself to the buffet if you were still hungry.Even though there was a 3 hour \"window\" for breakfast 7 - 10am, the restaurant didn't seem to have enough tables for the number of guests staying there.At times there was a bit of a queue waiting for a clean table.The restaurant itself could have done with a makeover,it looked a bit tired. Just a couple other minor moans - the gift shop on the ground floor didn't sell daily newspapers and one other thing that would have been useful was an ATM machine in the reception.On a positive note the hotel was in a good location close to Hyde park,bus routes and several tube stations.Queensway was just around the corner with a selection of shops,bars and restaurants plus a casino and the famous ice rink - where I met my wife 32 years ago!!

We needn't have worried!! The hotel was warm and welcoming with friendly staff who soon sorted out the problem of having us booked in a twin room for one night when in fact the booking was for a triple room for two nights (we had written confirmation with us, luckily). True, the room wasn't very spacious and the bathroom was tiny but white tiles and very good lighting gave the illusion of space, and everything was spotless. The beds were comfortable and the only criticism was that a chest of drawers would have been more useful than the small fridge (but that's a very personal observation). Also, my advice to would-be visitors is to take extra coathangers as the ones provided did not hold anything of any weight without falling off the hook, and there were only four of them! The decor and carpets were pleasant and clean and the whole hotel had the feel of a much more expensive establishment. Breakfast was adequate if not very exciting but the cooked breakfast was worth the \u00a34 extra for those who wanted it. The location couldn't be better and we didn't even use the Underground to get into central London. A walk through Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park is a great way to start the day. Just round the corner on Queensway is the main hub of Bayswater with a great choice of restaurants offering cuisine from around the world. We found it better to eat there in the evenings and then go into the West End rather than trying to find a meal in the West End itself - much more relaxing. All in all we had a great few days in London and this was due in small part to the Central Park Hotel and it's location. Would we stay there again? Definitely!Would we recommend it? Definitely!

The water pressure in the shower is terrible in the morning and not much better late at night. I learned to take a shower at 5:00 pm to get the full water pressure. Also it is on a street of inexpensive hotels so it can be noisy even if you stay on a top floor. Check-in time is not until 3:00 pm (1500 hours) which is terrible if you just arrived from a long flight and are exhausted. You can leave your luggage with the concierge, however they are not shy in expecting a tip. The whole Bayswater/Padddington neighborhood frankly has a Middle Eastern feel to it which did not thrill me.

Because the rate seemed so low, even for the off-peak season, I sent an email to the Central Park requesting a confirmation at the 60 US Dollars per-night price for our stay from 23-27 Nov 2005. The General Manager sent me a reply affirming that not only was the 60 USD nightly rate correct, but it was (Quote) \"guaranteed\". We arrived as planned on the night of 23 Nov, only to be told while checking in that the rate was 60 pounds, vs. dollars. I had a copy of the email reply I received from the Central Park general manager and showed it to the desk agent. The agent said that although the email did clearly state the 60 USD rate as being correct, that the price was actually not valid, and that we couldn't check in until we allowed the extra charges in pounds to be assessed on our bill. I asked where the manager was and was told that the managers worked between 9-5pm and were gone for the day. We had cell phones that worked in the United Kingdom with us, and requested that a manager call us the next day. But we were told that management just doesn't do that, we must see them in person. We had pre-booked full day sightseeing tours over the next 2 days, hence we were not going to be able to speak with a manager during their working hours. I find it unsatisfactory that anyone with the authority to make decisions at a central London hotel is only available to discuss issues with guests from 9-5pm...typically a time frame that most guests would be out sightseeing. The desk agent also told me that there was no one with managerial authority available on the night shift to discuss the matter with. We felt forced to sign the check-in form, as it would be difficult, if not impossible to find other lodging at the time. But I emphatically stated that I'd proceed to dispute this matter via my credit card company for resolution. I felt this wouldn't pose a problem on my end as I had the email from the hotel manager to submit as proof. The next morning, as we were waiting to depart for a sightseeing tour in the lobby, I was told that a manager was in the building early and would see me. Though not the same manager as had signed the email, this individual read that confirmation email I'd received from his counterpart and told us that certainly there was no problem, we'd only be charged the 60 USD per-night rate, it was the hotel policy to honor that confirmed price. We carried on, glad the problem was behind us- or so we thought. In the morning on the day before our departure, we were called to the desk while in the lobby, and were told by the desk agent that there seemed to be a problem with our room charge. I explained what had transpired with the manager we spoke to a couple of days earlier, and that all had been resolved. The agent said no, that there was a note left to charge us 60 pounds vs. 60 dollars, and if we didn't pay that amount immediately, we'd be locked out of our rooms. I asked to see a manager, as it was after their 9am shift arrival. Another, different manager was summoned and I explained the situation, once again providing the email I received from the Central Park General Manager guaranteeing the special 60 US dollar rate. He took our paperwork in the back and didn't say a word. We waited and waited. I told the desk clerk once again that if we didn't get the guaranteed rate that I'd gladly dispute it through my credit card company- a dispute that I was certain to win based on the clearly worded email I'd received from the hotel. The desk clerk went back to see the manager and check status on what he was doing, as it was taking considerable time. Finally the desk agent (not the manager) returned and stated that we could have the rooms at the 60 dollar per night rate, but they'd only accept cash in US dollars. We strongly felt that the only reason Central Park caved was due to my decision to dispute it via the credit card issuer- a case they didn't stand a chance of winning, as we had written proof. And although it seemed like outright extortion on the part of the hotel, we paid them the US dollar cash amount straightaway and requested a receipt. The time spent waiting for final resolution that morning alone took 2 hours from start to finish. All told, we spent a considerable part of our trip going back and forth with the Central Park staff over this issue, losing valuable touring time in London. Only in the end (our last full day in town) to be reluctantly told that we'd be charged the initially quoted rate of 60 USD. I feel a class establishment would have gone the extra mile and even offered us some sort of compensation for our troubles & lost time, which were all their fault (perhaps a breakfast upgrade, etc.)...but it's clear that the Central Park just doesn't have such consideration in them. As an individual who has traveled extensively since my youth, I found this situation utterly appalling. The fact that the Central Park wasn't willing to honor their own email specifically 'guaranteeing' our room rates, that it took so much back and forth time wasted on the part of their guests to resolve, and that management - when available- seemed totally incompetent. We couldn't believe that they freely dumped the bulk of this problem on the front line desk staff to act as 'go-betweens' and do all of the dirty work of this touchy issue vs. showing some real leadership and taking control of the issue and resolution themselves. It is worth noting that we witnessed other disgruntled guests complaining at the front desk, they also were obviously frustrated with the lack of management intervention with their concerns. Why even have managers if they're not capable of handling sensitive customer concerns and complaints? And why so many managers who seem to do so little besides collect a pay check? My recommendation to the owners of the Central Park is rid your establishment of your inferior managers, or at least cut some of the fat from that layer as they are ineffective. Hire some qualified management, well-versed in customer service and proper principles of hospitality, as your current crop is not. Accept that once in awhile, a reputable business will realize they have to 'bite the bullet' or eat the cost every now and again or offer some sort of compensation in the interest of their customers. Especially when the error is not on the part of your client, but on yours. That's what true quality of service is. I think you could save yourself some of that ill-spent managerial salary money by hiring real professionals in their place vs. those slackers now on your payroll. Also consider giving your front line desk staff a big raise- they were the absolute picture of grace under fire while doing what should have been their fat cat bosses' jobs. These employees maintained a sense of class and calm throughout the ordeal thrust upon them. To anyone planning to stay at the Central Park, you may want to reconsider- as we all know, they're not the only game in town. London abounds with hotels, I urge you to consider other accomodations in Bayswater or elsewhere in town. Please beware: Even if you have a written special rate 'guarantee' sent from the hotel itself, our experience is that it is NOT necessarily going to be the rate you'll be charged once there. If you do decide to risk booking, even after reading this, then I advise you to pay by a credit card issuer with a dependable dispute process for questionable charges.

We didn't take advantage of that, since we were satisfied with the continental breakfast provided.) Another thing very good about the hotel is the location. It's in a quiet neighbourhood in Bayswater. Just across the Bayswater road, you can find Hyde park/Kensington Gardens. It's also close to the underground. It took us about 5 minutes to walk to Bayswater station with the circle line and district lines (off course with easy connections to other lines), and it took us about 10 minutes to walk to Lancaster gate (central line).

So if you travel after May 2006, the review gets even better, then you can forget about Lancaster Gate, and you have the central line just 2 minutes from the hotel. This line just has a few stops before you're in Oxford street, and just a few stops before connections to places like trafalgar square, theatre district, and so on. The central line also is the easiest line to use if you arrive to London Stanstead airport, because the train/coaches there goes to Liverpool Street Station or Stratford (like we did), and the central line has stops in both those places. But of course, the best thing about the hotel is the price. We booked the hotel from the hotels own website, and paid \u00a365 per night per room incl all taxes, and when we got a clean room, free breakfast and very easy location to the underground, this hotel has to get a good review. We don't have so much to say about the staff, since we basically only saw them during check-in and check-out. The hotel kept our baggage for free after checking-out, the few hours that were left before we had to go to the airport, and we could do some last-minute sightseeing/shopping. I would definetely recommend it, and if I get the same nice prices I will definetely stay there again the next time I go to London.", "Date": "October 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and great value\u201d", "Author": "carol55", "ReviewID": "UR3811764", "Content": "Have just returned from a 2-day stay at the Central Park Hotel. We were two adults each travelling with two children, and had two triple rooms located on the third floor. GOOD: The location is excellent. Just off Bayswater, about 100 yards from Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens. Bayswater underground station is about 5 mins walk away and it took me 15 mins to walk from Paddington railway station. We mainly used London Bus for transport. You can buy one-day bus passes in a small shop next to the bus stop just around the corner from the hotel. The main buses which pass along Baywater take you into Oxford Street or down to Westminster Bridge. Ideal for sightseeing. The rooms were clean and well maintained. We had a mini-fridge, small TV mounted on the wall, hairdrier and three single beds. There was also a safe for valuables and tea/coffee making facilities. Check-in was very quick and easy and I found the staff helpful and polite. In terms of cost - each triple room cost us \u00a381 a night. Very good value for London. NOT-SO-GOOD The rooms were very small. We had no storage space for clothes except for a few hangers in a wardrobe area. There were no drawers at all - not even in the bedside locker. This may have been because our triple room may be the same size as a standard double (?). Triple rooms are compact to say the least. We only stayed two nights and had very little luggage, but if we were there for a week I think we would have been tripping over our suitcases which had to remain on the floor. (I have read in another review that the size of rooms in Central Park can vary, so it may be worth enquiring in advance. I certainly will if we return and need another triple room). The bathroom has also tiny. There was a good size bath with shower head above it, WC and wash-hand basin. But the door opens into the only standing space in the bathroom. However, the bathroom was very clean and towels good and there was plenty of very hot water. Our rooms were at the front of the hotel. We had plenty of light but it was noisy. There is no AC so you need to keep the window open for ventilation. We all found the city/traffic noise very distracting the first night, but then we all live in quiet areas at home and are not used to city noise. The rooms at the back of the hotel are darker but probably quieter. I agree with other reviewers about the poor quality of breakfast. The glasses for orange juice are TINY. We ended up taking 2 glasses at a time and constantly refilling them - but it annoying. The orange juice is also watery and inconsistent. The tea and coffee was just adequate. The continental breakfast consists of toast, rolls or croissants with jam and butter. The croissants were OK and we tended to stick to these. The area where breakfast is served is in the basement with no windows. The tables are very canteen-like and the room has an unpleasant gloomy atmosphere. But you are not there long enough for it to really bother you. Small point but one worth noting. We had problems getting the safe in our room to work. The instructions on the safe tell you to enter 3 digits and then press 'B'. Actually you need to press 'A' not 'B'. Pressing 'B' meant we could not re-open the safe without getting the Duty Manager to use a special key. Save effort and time and instead enter 3 digits and then press 'A'. They will change the instruction labels eventually! HOWEVER, I would definitely say the positives outweigh the negatives - at least for a short stay - and would recommend this hotel to people wanting a good value, no-frills hotel in a great location.

View was of some building being renovated behind. The room was reasonable size though not huge, bathroom was compact but useable with a bath with overhead shower. Room was clean, huge bed, and room also had a fridge, but didn't like the small tv which was up very high on a stand. From the second night onward I had a room on the first floor, which seemed more renovated than the one on the 2nd floor, and quite a bit more spacious, the bathroom had lots of free space with room to walk around even - which is very unusual for a hotel at this price in London. Again the view from the window was nothing much, just the back of some other building I think. - While the room was very clean and I couldn't complain, the windows on both the 1st and 2nd floors could do with a wash from the outside... lots of bird poo etc... and this lack of window cleaning is probably due to the outside not being very accessible. Haven't tried the breakfast - I tended to spend my late nights out and mornings in bed, so can't comment. Location good, short walk to Lancaster Gate tube (or Queensway when it opens again). Concierge particularly helpful, and staff generally friendly. For the price I got \u00a365 average per night for a double room, with this central location I wouldn't fault the hotel.

We read all the reviews before going and took advantage in making our reservation at the hotel website which offers on-line reservations that are less expensive than several booking sites, and we were able to ask on the website order form for a newly refurbished non-smoking room on one of the lower floors. Our rate was below 50 pounds, but it was winter. We got exactly what we asked for. The room was no-smoking room (perhaps all of the rooms are no-smoking.) It was well heated, a good thing because we had furious weather outside dipping down below freezing for two of the days. Our room was in the front with a window looking out on the street. Since we only slept in the room, the plain furnishings were all we needed. There was a small fridge in the room, a convenience. The bathroom was tight quarters but adequate and clean. The room was cleaned every day. There was a desk and one chair. The television was suspended from high on the wall facing the twin beds. The room was narrow, only wide enough for the two beds with about two feet between, but it was about 15 feet long. The breakfast buffet in the basement dining room was fine. There was a choice between the complimentary croissants, butter and jam, with unlimited orange juice, coffee or tea or a hot breakfast. Getting repeat cups of coffee or decaf was a huge plus for a heavy coffee drinker, who usually has to pay for each cup. The hot buffet was quite adequate, if not offering a lot of choices. You could purchase the breakfast for 4 pounds or take the complimentary continental breakfast, and take both if you wanted. The hot foods included stewed tomatoes (of course), fried eggs and plenty of bacon, cheese. We ate there every day of a four day stay and did not get bored (though at home we would have chosen to fix a variety of things.) The large breakfast room had room for 15 tables, with another room for overflow beyond. There were no windows in the breakfast room, but it was a pleasant place to eat, and the food was a bargain. The staff was friendly and helpful. A simple bar in the large lounge was okay. The elevators worked well. The location was excellent, just a couple of hundred feet from Kensington Gardens and a block and a half from the nearest metro station. We were able to walk to Kensington Palace from there, and there is a wonderful playground for children dedicated to Princess Di only a few hundred feet from the hotel. There are several good restaurants in the neighborhood but we actually ate away in Picadilly Circus since we went to theatre a lot. It was easy to get to and from everything in London from there. Buying a discount pass for the metro made it easy and inexpensive to get around the city fast. There were people from many countries staying at the hotel, young and old. It's not a classy hotel, though the lobby looks that way--but it is fine for people who don't want to live in their room.

The best feature of this hotel is easily location.Queensway is just around the corner and Hyde Park just a stroll across the street.If you are staying on a Sunday there is a wonderful selection of original art on display on the Bayswater Road. Overall I would stay here again,its fair value for the price.", "Date": "July 26, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Central Park Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d193174-Reviews-Central_Park_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$115 - $475*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">49-67 Queensborough Terrace</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 3SS</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "193174", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/38/4a/384ac862f3fb34370082283bcb74df303large.jpg"}}
