I was disappointed with the view, was expecting a sea view, but instead had a view of a nice alley. My partner wanted that room instead, why I don't know. We were on the third floor and had to close the window at night because it was quite loud with cars or people as well as the call to prayer at 5am. Otherwise, a good value hotel in a good location. The rooms are a little small, or cozy as one would say. And there was a slight smell of mold in the bathroom, but no visible signs anyway. Fixtures were nice as well.

But because we are talking about hotels \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Divas Hotel is a 3* hotel, very well located (close to St. Sofia mosque and Blue mosque) in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of the town. It is a clean and nice little hotel, not noisy (unless you have an issue with the Islamic religious calling for praying time).

The breakfast was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you (like me) don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind to have only cheese \u00e2\u20ac\u0153combinations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (cheese, milk, yogurt, cheese tart, cheese pie or some cheese pastry). If I would have to think about minuses, I would say that I have never seen in my life such a small room and bed (considering that we had a double room). And I would also have to consider the fact that for one full day we had no water (for shower or toilet) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 But generally it was very interesting.

You can ask them for directions or any kind of advice you may need and they will do their best to help (restaurants, transportation, shopping, city tours). The room: like all the hotels in old Istanbul, this one is really small, but the rooms have all that 2 persons may need: confortable bed, cable tv, small bar, safebox. The only drawbacks were the bad smell from the bathroom and the noise from outside (cars, children screaming and prayers). The room was cleaned everyday and the towels were changed. Location: the hotel si hard to find even by taxi drivers. At first sight, the look of the area doesn't make you feel very safe, but once you get used to it, you'll realize that there are lot of other hotels and tourists nearby and it's safe even at night. It's 5-10 minutes walk from Sultanahmet Square, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, 10 minutes from Grand Bazaar and the tram that can take you to Galata Bridge in no time. The hotel has no restaurant, only buffet breakfast and a small terrace in the back where you can have a beer. There are no restaurants nearby, but in 10 minutes you can get to the tourist area where there are plenty of choices.

My experience at this hotel has been a nightmare from start to finish...in fact they are still making my life miserable, and I got HOME yesterday! The positives of this hotel are that one or two (literally!) of the staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. The rooms, although small, are nicely furnished; and its fairly well located in close proximity to the major tourist sights. HOWEVER from the moment I arrived I have felt like I have had to fight and argue in order to get what I had paid for and not to be ripped off. Upon arrival we were told that the double sea view room we had booked from the UK was unavailable as they were fully booked (?!) and told me to enquire the following morning with regards to being moved for the remaning nights. In the mean time they put us into a twin room which was actually below ground level, which I accepted as I guessed that little could be done at this point, despite the fact that this was next door to a very noisy lift and above the kitchen and breakfast restaurant which meant that it was also extremely difficult to sleep. The following morning the guy at reception told me that all would be sorted by his colleague when I returned from my tour later on in the day. I told the guy at reception I was expecting a tour guide to pick us up (booked from the UK) after showing him my booking slip and asked for him to give me a call when they arrived. Soon after the call came to say he had arrived, and suspicious of the fact that the company I booked through didnt match that on the guide's shirt. I was assured that they were the same company. Still suspicious however and by this time on the coach, I asked the guide to confirm which tour this was for... surprise, surprise this was a different tour with a different company for a higher price than my booking. I was extremely upset with the hotel for knowingly trying to put me on a tour which I hadnt booked (no doubt affiliated with the hotel), and demanded that they call my tour guide to arrange a pick up. The hotel manager was shockingly rude, and seemed to want to get into an argument with me. Famous Turkish hospitality (which I can generally vouch for having visited the country before) is NOT present at this place. After I had been on my planned tour, I spoke to a new guy at the desk about my room change. Again surprise, surprise he knew nothing about this and actually had the cheek to ask why I hadnt asked sooner after I had been told by his colleague that he would have it sorted. After much arguing, miraculously a double sea view room became available. As part of my booking at this hotel (through a very well known website famous for bookings at the last minute) there was also an offer of a free one-way airport transfer. When I consulted the hotel about this on the day before I was due to leave, they said that this only applied to Ataturk airport and not Sabiha Gokcen. This was obviously stated no-where on the booking, and that they would only give me a discount. By this point I had completely lost the will to argue anymore and I glumly accepted to pay whatever it was to get me out of there. Now back in the UK, I was woken this morning by a phone call from the hotel manager stating that a tea cup has been taken from the room and that either I pay them (either \u00c2\u00a315 or \u00c2\u00a350, I couldnt make it out) her directly for this, or they will contact my agent and get them to charge me. This is, of course, complete rubbish and I am very annoyed and concerned with the prospect of them charging me for something I havent done.

In my opinion the rooms could be further improved with simple additions, such as a waste bin in the bedroom, drawers for clothes, 2 bedside cabinets (instead of one).

Floors are laminate so sounds carry a bit but bearing in mind we spent little time in the rooms, this didnt present a problem. Sea view was correct, but a bit of a over statement.
