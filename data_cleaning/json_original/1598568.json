The WORST part was that, there were BED BUGS!!!! At first, I noticed only one bug crawling....but later that night, my roommate saw more bugs crawling everywhere...she spent many hours searching for the other bugs and trying to kill them. we informed Dina, but she insisted that it could have come from us. Though she sprayed some insect repellent but it did not solve the problem. we ended up coming home with red rashes....bite marks from the BED BUGS!", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rawai, Phuket, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cReceptionist stole from us\u201d", "Author": "M J B", "ReviewID": "UR133032644", "Content": "On our last morning, we told friendly receptionist Dina we'd check out after breakfast. My new expensive Bose headphones were the only valuable thing we left in the room. Later, we discovered they were missing and, in front of her in the office, we unpacked our bags three times and thoroughly re-checked the tiny room twice. Absolutely not there. Gone. Dina said, \"Maybe I'll find them when I clean your room.\" When we picked up our bags hours later, Dina said, \"Here. I saw them right away on the shelf.\" Believe us, they were not on the shelf. We are convinced she took them. She must've felt guilty and returned them to us.

But since you only use it to sleep, then it's okay. Showing is a little bit tricky, as the bathroom/toilet is proportionally small too, maybe just 1.5-2 sqm. :) But cleanliness is a top priority, our room was cleaned everyday and the Filipina receptionist (Dina) is very helpful and even taught us how to get around HK in a cheaper way. We also bought the attaction tickets for her. Location is very, very good, it's close to the Mong Kok MTR station, bus stops and just across Ladies' Market.

If you and your partner travel with many suitcases, it's not the place to go. Backpackers will find it okay, but you cannot really walk in the room. The mini bathroom is functional, but you might struggle if you are tall (to sit on the toilet, for example!). Quite cramped, but the ceilings are high. You can literally touch all the 4 walls of the double room en-suite at the same time! We paid around 40 $CAN for the room, but i cannot compare it to others in the same area. However, the location, next to Mong Kok station, is excellent. A lot of action, shops and restaurants all around. We stayed there for 4 nights, slept well for 2. The bed was comfortable enough, but again, if you are tall, you might not fit in. The duvet is also too small for the bed. The doors seem to be made out of cardboard : you can here everything in the hallway. The lady at the reception was however very nice and helpful.
