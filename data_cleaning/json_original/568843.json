{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very good Abover average. Definitley choose this hotel if you need to be in Sant Cugat. It is located right in the center. Hotel is comfortable and the service is above the very mediocre Spanish service level in hotels.Room heating is the usual oven or freezer mode. Impossible to regulate. Minibar well stocked with snacks. On Sundays, the restaurant situation in Sant Cugat is dire in general (nothing open), even the hotel restaurant is closed! Room service is good, but menu very limited. WiFi is free, Yaaay.", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR342664498", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TerryBarcelona"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d568843-r23324569-Sant_Cugat-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "568843", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
