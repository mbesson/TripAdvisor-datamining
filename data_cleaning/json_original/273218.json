We were both very, very happy with our stay and I can echo many of the comments posted already. Patti truly does make the best pancakes and is very patient if you are practicing your Mexican Spanish. We were unfortunate to have room 25 (balcony over busy Calle 28) but did not have to share the inside balcony with anyone so still had some great times sitting outside. I would recommend room 25 if you wanted a little more space - it seemed to be slightly larger than any of the others. All of the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly - even the poor overnight security who kindy said \"buenas dias\" every morning at 6:30am just before the end of his shift. Quiet, clean and simple - that's exactly what we were looking for. The free Internet is a really nice touch but wasn't availabe all of the time (faulty keyboard).

The rooms are small and modest, but each room is equipped with a/c, a mini fridge, and a balcony, perfect accommodations for not being in your room long. There was so much to do, the staff will help you plan and set you up for any excursions you are interested in planning. We did a lobster boat cruise, with snorkeling and had a ball. The breakfast is good, pancakes, bacon, eggs, coffee, fresh fruit and juice, but get down there quickly it goes quick and by the time we finally made it down some days the buffet was looking pretty scarce. We did this deal through groupon, and got a hour long massage included in our deal, which was great! The massage is set up in a private cabana by the pool. We went during the first week of December (the 1st-6th) and while we were worried that the weather would not be warm enough, it was actually perfect! We went to the beach every day except two rainy days, and on those rainy days we got our massages at the hotel and chilled by the pool. If you are considering bringing your kids, I think that the bric hotel is very family friendly. I was regretting not bringing my 8 month old son, as playa is more chill, and more accommodating for children, than spring breaky cancun, people had their kids and babies everywhere, and the bric hotel also offers crib accommodations upon request. Over all we had a blast, the staff at the bric hotel is amazing! So nice, so friendly, we were literally served breakfast in our room one morning :) There is no alcohol in the hotel however, or a restaurant, but there are several shops and restaurants within walking distance (like 2 feet away from the hotel) where you can eat or purchase bottles to drink in your room.

The front desk worker gave us a great day trip recommendation and we found it pretty easy to walk from BRIC to most places in Playa. The chocolate soap and honey shampoo they have in the bathrooms is fantastic. I just wish I could buy a larger bottle to take home. The drawbacks were that the lock on our room door was a bit stiff and so took a few minutes to open each time. We figured out the tricks eventually, but it would have been nice to not have to fiddle with the lock every day. Next, I remember booking a queen size bed but ended up with a full and a twin.

I confirmed there is parking and yes there is, it is on the street around the hotel in a nice quiet location. I stayed for one night on the way through, enjoyed it so much I stayed for 3 nights upon my return to Playa. Check in was so fast, I was asked if I needed help with my bags, a quick explanation of breakfast etc and off to my room. My room was fantastic, simple and clean with a surprise awaiting me. On the shelf in front of me was a bottle of Red Wine, 2 beautiful blue wine glasses, Chips n Salsa ! A king bed, 2 side tables with lamps, a drawer and cupboard to the end of the bed (not crowded at all) was a Valet with TV remotes for TV and AC and a small very cold fridge to keep my water etc cold, Sliding Locking Glass doors are your main entrance off to the right is a Closet with Safe, the Bathroom had ample room and a nice shelf to put my goodies on as well as a nice basket of bathroom amenities. The breakfast was a nice surprise I stopped down for a coffee to take to the room while I was organizing myself, then off to break which was buffet style, tea, coffee, juice, water, toast, delicious pancakes, bacon and eggs along with a fruit, cereal, yoghurt bar. The food was very adequate and above what i really expected. Upon my return I learnt that 2 times per week they do a nice Mexican Breaky which was fantastic. The woman who was the chef was so gracious and sweet along with her helper I was thoroughly satisfied. Within 3 minutes of this little gem is a Starbucks, 5 - 10 restaurants and ample shopping.

After a number of emails back and forth with the friendly staff at the hotel, which were all courteous and helpful, I was sure we would have the best time ever in Playa. Alas, this was not the case. At least 3 of the emails that I shared with the hotel had to do with our initial arrival at the airport in Cancun. At 9:55am (after a red eye from Seattle) our driver would be waiting outside the entrance with a sign with our name and the hotels name, and then the van service take us the 40 min away from Cancun to Playa del Carmen. Pretty easy you would think right? No, not so much. After a few painstaking minutes of being harassed as to whether or not we needed a ride to our hotel from the hundreds of would be drivers hanging out outside the airport, and not being able to find our sign, I made a call to the hotel. We were told the driver should be there any minute. And then 15 minutes later another call......oh sorry, he should be there any time now. 30 minutes later, the driver arrived and apparently thought we were supposed to be picked up at 1pm. Weird since I have like 9 emails to and from the hotel that we were arriving at 9:30am. Ok, whatever. No big deal, we're on vacation in Mexico and there were cold cerveza's to be had right outside the airport doors. We can deal with waiting a few minutes. The drive to the hotel was easy and pretty fast, but then we arrived at the hotel only for the check-in desk curious as to who we were and were we to be checking in? Ummmm, ya. Here are the printed versions of my million of emails back and forth to you guys about the reservation dates, the confirmation, oh and let's not forget that you had us on the list for a driver to pick us up today at the airport, though be it at the incorrect time (?) so yes, I would say that we were to be checking in today. Well, they did not have us checking in on the Saturday, but on the Sunday. Luckily, there was a room to be had and they squeezed the 3 of us in to a room for 1 night to then be moved to our actual room on the next day for the duration of our stay. A bigger better room for the 3 of us to relax in for the next 7 days. Not a bigger room after all, but was on the ground floor with a patio overlooking the pool. Very nice. Unfortunately, we were a bit sour already from the van pick-up/check-in fiasco, but again we were on vacation so let's enjoy! Oh, and as a side note, we learned at check-in that breakfast was not included with our stay as we did not book through the hotel, but they would throw in breakfast because of the mix-up. This did appease my hostility a bit, until breakfast time....... So, the first day was good. Breakfast is between 7am - 10am and was under a nice eating area by the pool. Very quaint and very cute. Loving this. The cook on our first morning made a delicious traditional Mexican breakfast and it was great! Leisurely breakfast, dip in the pool, switch rooms, head to the beach. Pretty good first day. Then there was breakfast the 2nd day. We would soon learn that if you were not at breakfast between 7am - 8am (even though it is served, sort of, until 10am), you would be left with rubber eggs, a few slices of bread and hard bagels, some weary looking fruit, 2 cold pancakes (not each - just 2) and a version of Choco-puff cereal. No milk left though, only cream. On a bright note, the coffee was excellent. Needless to say, we did not enjoy our included breakfast for the next 6 days as we were not planning on getting up at 7 just to get the bacon that was supposedly included with the meal. 3 strikes so far and we were only on day 2. We did however find the hotel not bad for the price. The rooms were clean (even though I had to ask for the room to be made up, and to get fresh towels twice after returning from a full day of exploring Playa and it's beautiful beaches etc), and the location is fantastic. It's right by the bustling 5th street and literally no more than a 5 min walk from the beach. We found Playa del Carmen a bit on the pricey side, but we were glad to have visited. If you do go, head down 5th to an excellent wine & tapas bar called 'Bites'. It is just wonderful and a pleasant get away on the eardrums with their cool jazz/laid back tunes rather than the constant DJ thump-thump that seems to pour out of every restaurant and bar. All in all, we found the hotel and it's staff to be pleasant, but not super accommodating and definitely not as fabulous as mentioned in other reviews. You could certainly tell who the regular visitors were though, because the staff seemed to be extra helpful to them. We would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a great price and an excellent location, but we will for sure try a different hotel or even an all inclusive if we were to ever come back to Playa del Carmen.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utrecht, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cA perfect slice of peacefulness.\u201d", "Author": "dr_moooo", "ReviewID": "UR99416322", "Content": "With only 13 rooms in a quiet tropical courtyard, this small boutique hotel really is a great environment for chilling out.

Come her for peace and quiet but not if you want to party with the other guests. Breakfast is better than Aventuras, but not as good as Hacienda. There is not a lot of variety and they did run out of stuff if we didn't come early enough or weren't patient enough to wait for the one person looking after the buffet to replenish what we were waiting for.

I did read it in a review but discarded it thinking maybe only some rooms were this way- IF YOU WON'T BE HAPPY WITH THIS TYPE OF SET UP THEN DON'T BOOK IT AS YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. We sleep spooning the whole night anyway so we could have even dealt with cramped space (otherwise someone gets the crack) but the bed was super hard & uncomfortable. Based on looking at all other hotels in this price range EVERY hotel has rock hard beds, unless you want to pay 300 plus a night just get that in your head. In hind sight had we been smart we would have ran to the local Walmart (yes they have one) and bought an eggshell crate to use and throw away that week for the 20 or 25 we would have spent that would have solved the crack problem and the hardness issue - that would have made ALL the difference in our sleep quality and would have been totally worth it. Entrance into the rooms - I will also point out that as in previous reviews the doors to the rooms are ONLY glass sliding doors (like a patio door) and the locks feel a little ramshackle BUT there is a safe in the room and security on site at night to only let the guests in - so we had no issues whatsoever. It made me very nervous the first night but then I said to hell with it and quit worrying and I felt pretty secure. If you are someone who would worry about that keep that in mind. We are a couple who basically wanted a clean, inexpensive, decent room to sleep in so we could spend our money on food and entertainment. There is no phone in the room (which was a HUGE plus for us) . I read other reviews complaining about this hotel wanting you not to put toilet paper in the toilet but in the waste can next to it. Understand Playa is on a septic system - you will find this sign in EVERY single bathroom in Playa so it's not really a fair criticism to this hotel. Overall after looking at several alternate hotels before we were to check out we ended up staying because it is a very cute hotel right off 5th and a great value comparatively. The Pros: The little breakfast was quite good each morning, coffee was good and we had a nice little patio right outside the pool to eat our breakfast and relax - we would not have had that quaint little condo atmosphere anywhere else we looked which factored in us deciding to tough out the crappy bed and stay. The staff is spectacular - they are friendly and helpful and were super accommodating when we encountered a transaction/banking snafu with a local merchant - they could not have been nicer. Consequently ONLY rent a car from a major company like Avis or Hertz (you'll find them on 5th avenue) DO NOT - I REPEAT DO NOT rent from little local car rental agencies - they do not disclose all charges and will tie your money up. Emily the massage therapist - wish I could clone her and have her at home with me - TOTALLY worth it - she is knowledgeable, friendly and gives a wonderful massage. The pool is impeccable - it was too cold to use while we were there but in the courtyard it really is a cool little place. Overall it's a great place, great convenient location - I wish they would invest in some way to make the bed situation better and perhaps put a more secure locking mechanism on the door but other than that I would definitely stay again.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "jeweljem", "ReviewID": "UR91889986", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Bric and enjoyed it very much.

We have been to numerous places in the Caribbean including Playa Del Carmen once before. However, every time we stay anywhere, it is all inclusive. This time we decided to try a non all inclusive. We came across the Bric Hotel by looking on various rental sites i.e. VRBO, Homeaway, etc. A representative from Bric rentals called me the next day. The hotel is situated on 28th street right between 5th and 10th avenues. The location, which was of course right around the corner from the famous 5th avenue, was great. It was also only approximately a 5 minute walk to Mamita's beach (2 streets down). I was offered a nice rate of $50.00 US a night and the hotel also provided breakfast which could be eaten at the Palapa in the center of the complex, or could be delivered to your room. Also in the middle of the complex there was a very nice and clean (a little small) swimming pool that we used quite a bit. As for the rooms, they were a bit small. One thing that was strange is the entry and only door to your room was a glass sliding door that could be locked with a provided key. They also had an in room safe (In the closet) and key as well. The floors were all tile. The sleeping area had a King size (made of two mattresses pushed together unfortunately) bed that was on a concrete platform. The bed was very firm, but slept well. There was an end table on each side of the bed along with lamps. There were a couple of storage shelfs on the wall and an entertainment center with about a 20\" tv with cable and a mini fridge. The bathroom had a nice size shower and sink and toilet. It was a little discouraging that the hotel required you to put all hygiene products in the trashcan beside the toilet including toilet paper instead of flushing. We had a housekeeper every day that would come, make our beds, empty our trash, etc (She unfortunately would turn off the A/C as well). At night the hotel had a watchman and was gated. The breakfast was pretty nice consisting of scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, cereal, yogurt, pancakes, fruit, and juice. Everything was fresh made. Wi-Fi was included as well at the hotel. All in all for the money this hotel was great. The staff were amazing and would help you to find anything you needed and would even get groceries for you. The only negative thing I have to say is, when we booked we were provided with 3 grocery lists. We picked the largest one ($75.00 + Liquor) that included things to cook, however when we arrived we found out the rooms had no cooking area (stove, microwave, etc.). I assume some of their rentals in other areas had these amenities. We very much enjoyed this hotel and we will be staying again.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cMexico Road Trip- PdC\u201d", "Author": "mathewpressy", "ReviewID": "UR84977626", "Content": "We had a very pleasant time at the Bric.
