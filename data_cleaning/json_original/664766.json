{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lodge Motel is my usual Sydney accommodation I live in Canberra and in 2008 will be attending many operas so The Edgecliff Lodge Motel will become my regular weekend retreat for my visits. I've stayed at this motel four times so far. Its accessibility within a few kms from the M5 exit allows me to be checked in after a 3 - 31/2 hour drive. There's free undercover parking on a 1st come basis or unlimited free street parking at weekends. The simple breakfast provided is cereal, 3 slices white bread, fresh milk, OJ, tea  coffee bags  the kitchenette is perfect for my needs with a fridge. There's an excellent Italian pizza place a few doors up the hill towards Edgecliffe underground rail station. The station complex has a large range of shops: coffee lounges, delis, a supermarket, ATMs, fresh fruit store, bakery, wine  beer outlet. You'll find the room air conditioning useful to slightly muffle the car sounds from the very busy New South Head Road, a small price to pay for easy access to public transport or simply hail a taxi. It's a budget place but its location is what I want.", "Date": "Feb 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR285077773", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Pikelette"}, {"Content": "Good Deal, Great Value       Front of the Hotel", "Date": "Jul 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR353323699", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "RESHMATHIAS"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d664766-r13416411-Sydney_Lodge_Motel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "664766", "Price": "$172"}}
