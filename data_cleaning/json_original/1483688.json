We have just spent five nights in room 620 and would definitely recommend the property for its location, facilities and service. We booked a standard room via Agoda and all our requests (non-smoking, high floor, king bed) were fulfilled. The room was spacious and very comfortable and we even had one of the famous chandeliers. The flat screen tv covered most European languages and about four or five in English. The bathroom was well equipped with a wide range of toiletries and a salon-standard hair dryer. We only had breakfast once and at 14 euros per person it was rather expensive. If it is included in the room package it is much better value. Wifi was good and each login lasted for an hour. Additional logins were cheerfully provided by the front desk when we needed them. Location is terrific. The Ku'damm shopping area is only a block away and it is only two blocks to the Savigny-Platz S Bahn station which has excellent links to most of Berlin. It is one stop to the Zoo Bahnhof (with its large bus interchange) and two stops to the Hauptbahnhof. There are several cafes and coffee shops near the station should you be looking for breakfasts, lunches, etc. There were large tour groups staying at the hotel on two of our nights there, however the hotel seemed to handle them very well and if we had not seen a crowd in the lobby we would not have known they were there.

Instead, there is a shower nozzle on the wall next to the basin. There is no shower curtain, nor any place where one could be put. When you take a shower, water sprays over much of the bathroom (which is quite large). It would not be possible for someone else to use the basin or the toilet while someone is showering. I've never seen this arrangement. The breakfast buffet doesn't open until 7:00. A really long line formed and it took a lot of time to get the food. Unlike some buffets, this one is cafeteria style. You stand in line and, when you get up to the food, you go down the line and pick what you want. If you want to get another roll or some yogurt, you presumably would need to stand in line again.

The whole hotel was recently refurbished and redone and looks fantastic. Very modern with a nice (yet basic) fitness center, sauna and jacoozi. Breakfast was very good, varied and had something for everyone. All in all it was a great place to stay at with a few nice eating spots all around (oliver platz and more)", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "orlando", "Title": "\u201cWonderful staff - a couple of drawbacks\u201d", "Author": "debsky", "ReviewID": "UR74739204", "Content": "This is a lovely hotel and the staff is very efficient and helpful.

Received a very warm welcome and could check in early, which was good because we had a long journey already. the room was very spacious compared to many modern hotels of same category, clean and had a modern decor. The bathroom was not huge but nicely decorated with a wide choice of toiletries. We even got a free welcome drink at the bar on the evening of arrival! Breakfast was great, you could choose from a big variety of food, I especially liked the fresh fruit and veg which you don't always get this fresh. I had the best sleep in a hotel ever in those beds. We had a big king bed, very comfortable and we felt well rested with a day of sightseeing ahead. The hotel is conveniently located only one street away from the Ku'Damm, one of the main shopping streets with plenty of restaurants around. Only a few minutes walk to the next underground station.

Our check in was very smooth a side from road construction blocking the on street hotel loading zone. My german is awful and who ever I approached at the desk, bar or restaurant always was able to help me in english. Our room was modern and interesting, very well kept and spacious. It was nice to have heat and AC in the room because for as cold and dreary the Berlin weather was, the room got stuffy at night until we ran the air. The location is nice, in West City and has good food, drink and shopping nearby. We walked to everything touristic we wanted to see in the center of town, but it is not a short walk. We could have rode the mass transit which is trains and buses close by, but we perferred the long walks. We did drive to the East Side Gallery though, it would have been out of reach. Parking is below the hotel and directly accessible from the hotels elevators and stair. Breakfast was quite ample by most european hotel standards and was always fresh. The dining room is the hotel restaurant so there was plenty of seating and there was breakfast staff on hand if you need help. The Bar was fantastic, we enjoyed Roman the bartenders company, drinks, his attention to detail and his love for his work. All in all this is a great place to stay, eat and drink. There were other facilities on site including a spa but I didn't take advantage of them. I don't like having to pay for WiFi, ad if I do i don't lke the system of tie block that are commen to more than this hotel. But the internet worked well, had good connection and good speed. I also think that 15 euro a day for parking in a hotel lot is excesive, but it was easy.

Savignyplatz U-Bahn is probably slightly closer. There are supermarkets and bars/restaurants nearby which is good and many at Ku'damm of course. The hotel itself is a very modern building and still has a 'new' feeling. I would have to disagree with the reviewer who said bad staff, all my questions were answered and they were willing to help out by speaking English. The room was a good size, spotlessly clean but laminate floors were not good for the grit and snow! Sound-proofing reasonable and comfortable beds. The style is more minimalist than luxurious but comfortable and all required features there (except Tea&Coffee facilities in standard room). There is a bath and shower, with all manner of complimentary toileteries. We had a travelzoo deal which brought the price to \u20ac198 for 2 nights. We had dinner on the first night, which was only a single course and not really a 'dinner' so watch out for that but the food was o.k. Breakfast was also included but as the hotel was quite empty, there wasn't much fresh food put out, so some of it was a little stale, but otherwise a decent choice. I would definitely reccomend this hotel for around \u20ac80 B&B to travellers familiar with Berlin but if there is no deal available or you are there for the major sites, I would look for a deal in somewhere nearer the centre.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gladstone, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBrand new out the box!\u201d", "Author": "Zannagirl", "ReviewID": "UR55439301", "Content": "The second stop on our Cosmos tour was in Berlin.
