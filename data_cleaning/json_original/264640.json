The staff was of average attitude, not what you expect as cheerfulness and deisre to fufil all your requests but they where helpful. Breakfast was a so so array of pastries, cereals, meats and cheeses. Our tv and heater worked and we had a beautiful balcony in our room. This hotel is not a 5 star luxury resort, but as I said I didn't mind since we spend little to no time in the hotel and most of our time exploring the city.

We needed a place to stay for one night before our study abroad program began. I arrived at the hotel after the three girls had. I was very confused about it's location. There is a sign outside of the building above a random driveway. Aside from the sign, there is no direction about how to proceed. At the end of the driveway, there is a small elevator. It only fits one person with luggage. In the elevator, I believe there was a sign that said what floor the hotel was on. Once I found the hotel, I had to ring a bell for service at the front desk. The man told me what room my friends were in, but upon wandering around the confusing hallways, I couldn't find it. Eventually, I had him personally walk me there. The room had four beds in it, which were more like cots. This room was not meant for four people and their luggage. It was not comfortable. The stand-up shower and bathroom in general were clean, surprisingly. We had trouble locking our door with the old key, but it worked once we figured it out. The wifi password system is confusing and doesn't work.

We were indroduced to this hotel by a tourist kiosk at the airport which provides shuttle bus service. We told the agent that we wanted something cheap but in an area that is not dangerous for two girls to walk. It is located in a really strange building. You walk by a corridor to take the elevator and go to the third floor. We found this building very interesting yet wierd; we couldn't find out if there was any other person staying in it. Our room was small but not in a way that we couln't agree with that. It was charmingly decorated and clean. I didn't like very much the bathroom, we had to shower in a really small place. (I don't know the english word for it). The curtain was flooding in my feet as I was showering myself. The room got a little bit hot at night. The breakfast hasn't got any variety at all, but we didn't want to take breakfast anyway. The worst thing in this hotel is the staff. They seem to be bored and that they don't want to help you in any way. We wanted them to tell us us things to do in the area and they just showed us a map telling us to find it all by ourselves. They all seemed a little bit rude, and they speak very litlle english. (in Greece, were I come from, there is no way a receptionist doesn't speak fluent english). The best thing was the location. You could go to the Vatican Museum and the city center on foot, in a very little distance. It was a very good area, and we weren't frightened at all to walk at night alone. We stayed there 2 nights, and I stayed alone for one more night after my friend left. When she left, I paid the same price even though I was only one person. It was very cheap, we paid 50 euro per room each day. (it was off season). I think that this price were extremely good for this hotel, I stayed in other hotels that were not as good as this and paid more.

The other hotel (The Hotel Borromeo) may be under the same umbrella ownership. It's at a higher price point though, so the owners of the Ari Pacis may simply overbook the cheaper hotel, then send the excess guests across town to the other hotel.

I was dirty and tired from traveling and did not want to start my adventure in Rome sweaty and smelly. I was told by the front desk clerk that their other hotels (all in the same chain) were just as nice. He told me he'd find a ride for me--which he did...a friend of his I believe. Not a hotel employee...a friend. She was nice enough but still... It was located near the Vatican though I wanted to be closer to the Forum. My fault for accepting. Anyway upon arrival at the Ara Pacis I wasn't impressed. The desk clerk was extremely gracious and kind. I had absolutely no problem with the hotel employees. They were all very accomodating. The clerk gave me a double room with a balcony. However, upon entering, my heart sank a bit. My very well-worn room with scratches and brown marks on the wall smelled extremely stale and moldy; the carpet was thrown together on the floor in approximately 14\"by 14\" squares and not glued down (I could see the cement floor underneath); the bathroom...oh dear...the bathroom. It's ridiculous to even call it that. It was the size of a large closet and the shower, if you can call it that, was simply a drain in the floor with a shower head attached to a wall...less than a foot from the toilet. There was no separate shower space. It was sink, toilet, shower head, shower curtain, drain. The toilet and shower shared the same floor. That's right. The entire floor would be covered by water because THAT was the shower room. Basically, the bathroom was a shower with a toilet in it. When I got into the stale-smelling room I opened windows on the balcony to let in fresh air. I figured since it was a balcony I didn't have to worry about the security of having the doors wide open since the room was on the 4th floor. However, as I was getting dressed a maintenance man came through a little removable gate on one side of the balcony to spray the plants and flowers. Not a big deal...unless you're a single woman getting undressed close to your wide open door! (The room was a bit crowded so I didn't have a lot of room to change) I was horrified. I quickly closed the door and curtains. After this I tried calling the Borromeo to see if I could still have my room (I'd only been in the Ara Pacis for 20 minutes or so) but was told the room had already been taken. Yeah, sure it had. I didn't feel like putting up a fight since I had made plans with friends so I decided to just stay in the room as it was only for one night and consider it an adventure. I was paying $140 per night and expected something similar to the Borromeo which I have stayed in before. The Ara Pacis was not that place. It's very close to the Vatican and St Angelo and there's a bus stop across the street if you don't feel like walking to the Forum, Colloseum, Spanish Steps, etc. I'm sure there are rooms that are fine in the hotel as evidenced by the other moderate reviews.

I refused to e-mail my card details as it's not secure, but eventually agreed to give them to the Hotel Ara Pacis (one of the Ludoviki chain) through their secure web-site.

I attempted to stop the payment, however I was informed by the bank that by me giving my card details to the hotel I was authorising the payment and there was no way I could prevent them from taking the money!

A very large wardrobe blocked more than 50% of the access to the toilet and shower room, making it almost impossible to get into (and we are not large people).

It had a small bathroom with new fixtures, but sticking with Italian tradition, it had the random,\"shower-head in the middle of the room\" motif happening. Once you get over how ridiculous that is, it is really fine. The room did not have central air, but they did wheel in a teletubbie-looking portable air conditioner that worked just fine. If you are able to get over the \"petite-ness\" of the space and the bizarre quirks, you will realize you are getting a pretty good deal in a good location for a very expensive city.", "Date": "September 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burntwood Staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Ara pacis\u201d", "Author": "annandron", "ReviewID": "UR2446469", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the Ara pacis on July 26 for 4 nights we had a twin room which was clean and comfortable.

The staff were friendly and helpful plus there was a new lift, the hotel was idealy situated for all the main sites of interest.

The whole hotel smelled of smoke...everywhere....it was just everywhere. Then we get to the room and there was no A/C....so we go to the desk and demand a room with A/C because it was promised in our reservation. We were told we could get another room the next day, but when pressed the concierge finally gave us another room. Also, we had a quad and they don't tell you that the other two beds are roll out sofas that feel absolutely terrible. Breakfast was horrific as well. The drain in the shower clogged and water went everywhere, no surprise since the shower looked so old. Only good thing was the location.", "Date": "July 12, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ara Pacis Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d264640-Reviews-Ara_Pacis_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Vittoria Colonna 11</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00193</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "264640", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/09/eb/09eb3f1400e53f970cf3ce2ed5d940d43large.jpg"}}
