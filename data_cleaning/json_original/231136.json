{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good surprise I end up staying in this hotel because my booking with another hotel in the area was not honored. Despite that incident, my stay in Frankfurt was not too bad. The hotel rates are maybe 30 to 40% lower than similar hotels in the area. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful. I've got room looking at the inner backyard of the hotel. Although did not provide a nice view, it was amazingly quiet!. Once in my room, I realised it was not really a 4 star hotel as they said over the phone, however the rate was not either. The bathroom was nice and heated up, but the room radiator was turned off. That was not a very nice touch for a 3 C morning. Despite this issue, I realised was not bad at all for the price I was paying. The room was a decent size and the bathroom was big (13-15 m2 + 5 m2 bathroom) in relation to the bedroom. The room was clean and organised, but very basic: it didn't have a iron  board, the TV was full paid (15 Euros if you activate the chip to turn it on!!). The bed and bedding stuff could be a lot better. Although the house keeping service was good, they never knocked up the door before open it when they wanted to do the cleaning. There wasn't do not disturb sign available. The WiFi internet was OK, and reasonable priced for Europe (13 Euros per 12 continuous hours or 15 Euros for 24).The breakfast!... mmm... was included in the room rate, but nothing fancy or special. It's just fine.No Gym at all.In summary, the hotel is not bad at all for their rates compared with similar hotels in the area. Is a good place to stay if you need something to rest decently well at night and close of Frankfurt Main Station. If that is not your idea, go and get a place in another area. I would say that there is nothing fancy in the hotel. Is what you are paying for, nothing more but nothing less.", "Date": "Nov 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR660203932", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Kowalsky_00"}, {"Content": "Good Place, Bad service I stayed in Hotel Minerva, Frankfurt in July 2006. Firstly, there was a mix up with our booking and the Manager was not helpful at all. In fact he tried to push us into paying for a more expensive room that we did not need. Secondly, there was a heat wave at the time we stayed and guess what - the Air Conditioning was not working and when we checked in the Manager did not even have the decency to inform us. Thirdly, when we realised it was not working we were told they do not have fans and they can only provide free water. We were then told on the second day that we will be given a fan and the staff will be put one in our room as the Air conditioning will take another day to fix. But by evening - still no fan. The customer service was terrible \u9225?just full of empty promises. Finally we were given a fan on the last night of our stay. On the day we had to pay - the Manger refused to give a discount and claimed we were told about the Air Conditioner not working before we booked in. Complete Liar.Don\u9225\u6a9b be fooled by the nice accommodation, the Manager is useless and just seems to be focused on getting your money. I like to pay for full service and treated with respect not pushed into paying for something so rubbish.

Our room was spacious, with a huge, spotlessly scrubbed bathroom. Five minute walk to station. View of backside of bland buildings from window. Very quiet. Large breakfast. In our case there weren't many vacationers- mostly business types and a big group of itinerant construction workers. Front desk guy was professional and well-dressed but lacked a personality. For the price, I think you can find better at the information/hotel reservation desk at the station-and there are nice bargain hotels in the area for far less (like the Union). Don't use the phone for customers they have on the front desk! Walk to the station. I was charged 7Euro for a 5 minute call (to a local cell-phone).", "Date": "Jun 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR189751269", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "nomimashoo"}, {"Content": "clean, convenient and comfortable Traveled to Frankfurt for a Fair and stayed at this small hotel.
