{"Reviews": [{"Content": "a perfect place to stay in Tokio Kanda Station Hotel is 1 minute walk from the Kanda station on the yamamote line (its a JR line, therefore very practical for japan rail pass holders). You can easily reach the whole city and it is only 2 minutes by train to the tokio station. The rooms are quite small, but perfectly suitable. Its near to the station and the tracks, but you dont get to hear too much of it due to very good windows. The sevice is great and very polite, some receptionist speak english. If you are looking for a nice comfortable hotel with a good price for tokio, this hotel is a very good choice.", "Date": "Oct 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR659523388", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lindusah"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066443-d1105251-r21330819-Kanda_Station_Hotel-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1105251", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
