The last two times I have stayed at a Four Points, the hotel was being renovated. At least this time, the one in Seattle was close to being finished versus the Toronto airport. My wife and I stayed at the Four Points Seattle because on the website it had \"free parking\". When we checked in, I was informed that there will be a charge for parking. However the person at the front desk said since they are still renovating, the charge might not show up. Also, in order to have a refrigerator in the room, there was also a charge of $10.00 per day. I guess because of the renovation, this charge was also not assessed. The hotel is located about a 10-15 minute walk from the Space Needle/Seattle Center. So getting to downtown Seattle was very convenient because of the monorail. The monorail will take you to about 2 blocks away from Pike's Market. Down the street (across the Hampton Inn) was a QFC super market that is open 24 hours. That made it convenient to buy some snacks and drinks for the room. The size of the room was a little tight for myself and my wife. If there was three adults, it would be very tight. This hotel is using a new type of card to enter your room. Instead of putting the card into the door handle, you place the card flat on a reader right by the door handle and this will unlock the door. During our stay we did not have any problems with this.

My bad for not looking at the map in a more micro level. The parking garage is ill equipped to handle guest cars if the place is full, so, late Saturday night, we had to squeeze into some illegal, non-parking space.

I've been to all of them but this hotel piqued my interest as it offers a more \"value\" price point. I was recently here for a weekend with my wife. I noticed that this hotel opened up their Cash & Points inventory so had to jump on that as it's an outrageously good deal. As a Starwood Plat member, I was also interested to see what they could offer. The Location As others have mentioned, it's a bit off the main area for downtown. It's a short walk to the monorail station and that can get you back/forth from downtown for cheap. Myself, I drove from downtown to this hotel. A word of warning - research the routes well before you go. Getting on to 5th Ave North was such a pain. Other than that, we really didn't stay around the area much so can't comment on how safe/diverse it is. Lobby/Check-in/Parking When I arrived, the front desk wasn't full. While they did ask me what I wanted for a Plat amenity, I wasn't really explained what other Plat bennies there were even though I explained it was my first time at this hotel. Also, I note that I wasn't put into an upgraded room (other than being on the 4th floor) but I stressed that I wanted a quiet room. More on that later. The lobby area itself is completely remodeled and looks quite contemporary. I did pay for the parking but noted the gate was open when I drove in. I was a bit uncomfortable with the security situation there but noticed the gate was down when I left in the morning. Room The room itself was a king bedroom with a sofabed pull-out. Myself, I thought the size of the room wasn't anything special - long but narrow. Having the sofabed was nice as we had brought dinner with us and sat down on the sofa to eat it together. There's the normal LCD tv and there were quite a few channels. The bathroom was a normal size and noted the sink counter area was a good size. I do also need to comment on how \"quiet\" it was. I was placed in the inner quadrant with the window facing the roof of a warehouse and then Aurora Ave N. The sound insulation on the windows is so poor that the car noise from Aurora actually came into the room. I've got to say that I'm not right above Aurora. Rather, I'm a good distance from it. A bit disappointing. Perhaps the only other solution is to have a room facing Roy St? Food I did have breakfast in the hotel resto with my wife. Service was prompt and friendly. Food was ok but the cut potatoes were horrid. Coffee was a bit watered-down - which is a surprise given that it's Seattle. Check-out When I checked out, they couldn't give me a printed folio right away as it seemed the front desk didn't know how to handle a Cash & Points booking. No problem, I told them to email it to me after they figured it out. I did receive it later with no problems. I also wanted to mention that the person checking me out noticed that I wasn't given an upgraded room as a Plat. She made it up to us and we were extremely pleased with the outcome. Final verdict Would I come back? Probably. I just have make an accommodation since the hotel isn't right in the downtown core. Would I refer a friend? Probably, also making sure fair warning was given regarding the location. However, the value proposition here is so good that I'm pretty sure I'll return. Problems encountered: 1) There was no in-room RJ45 cable so I called down to have one brought up. Once plugging it in, the wired internet did not work. I just gave and used wireless. However, I prefer wired as it offers a bit better security. 2) One of the bathroom lights \"seemed\" to be burnt out when I checked-in. As the other was working, I didn't bother calling down to have it replaced. Strangely enough, both lights were working fine the next morning.

It's a brisk walk downtown and within two blocks is a small retail section under the monorail tracks that has three good restaurants. It took me 10 minutes to walk to my favorite bakery on Wall and 1st. Free internet, great Sheraton beds, quiet and very nice lobby. I would compare this to the new upgraded Marriott Courtyards.

There are two very good places to eat just around the corner, Larados, a sophisticated Mexican restaurant, and Citizen, a coffee house, sandwich and breakfast place with very tasty food. The front desk service is happy, customer oriented and pleasant. Parking is an issue if you want to avoid the $12 a day fee from the hotel but with a little patience you can find a spot on the street. Note that the parking facists are very active and you need to be sure you are in a good spot. I was very pleased with the experience.

Also, the hotel had a shuttle come by and pick up guests who were going to the ball game, for a fee of $5 per person. It was very reasonable and so we took the shuttle. Seattle is a great city, and this hotel was more affordable than most of the hotels in the downtown core. The only downside is its location, since it is not quite as central.

The gave us a coupon for free breakfast which was delicious, cooked to order with all the fixings.....not your typical \"hot buffet\" in which the only thing hot is the \"make it yourself\" waffles. The room/bed was brand new and although small, very comfy. The beds of course were brand new and the AC worked great. The elevator was a bit slow since only one in the remodeled section was working.

I wasn't too thrilled because I have generally been pleased with Comfort Suites' hotels and underwhelmed with the Sheraton Four Points chain. To their credit, they honored our rate and free parking but we probaby wouldn't stay here again. The changes that have been made were not for the better. The rooms seem to have been shrunk from a much larger Comfort Suite size to a typical hotel room. The parking is no longer free (unless you booked when it was a Comfort Suites) and you no longer get a free breakfast either. The rooms have been remodeled with more modern styling but not everything works quite right, especially in the bathroom. The clear glass shower door is hard to open from the inside as there is no handle on the interior part of the door. In addition, the shower door didn't open all they way out. The toilet paper roll also kept falling off the modern looking toliet paper holder. We had a SUV (Chevy Traverse) and were able to get the car in the garage with no problem. The garage has a gate that can only be opened with a valid hotel key, so it felt very secure. The parking in the garage below the hotel is tight but we were able to get a spot when the hotel was full because of the Labor Day Holiday. Location of the hotel is fairly good. The area is very nice and you are within walking distance of the Space Needle and monorail station. The monorail will take you to within 3 blocks of Pike Place Market or you can take a taxi. You will probably have to pick up the taxi at the Space Needle because the Four Points is off on a side street. Some rooms do have views of the Space Needle but they also face a busy, high speed road below, which can be quite noisy. Guess putting in double pane windows wasn't part of the renovations but double pane windows don't generate any extra revenue either.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, good location, but...\u201d", "Author": "kalenacole", "ReviewID": "UR118000439", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to stores, restaurants, clubs etc. I really love the beds at Sheraton hotels.

I also don't like like the fact the hotel charges $10.95 a 24hr period for internet use in your room.

Not walkable to the heart of Seattle Shopping and Restaurants, but a $7 cab ride will get you there. Garage height requirement too low for standard SUVs so beware if you need parking and factor that into the price. Only one slow elevator, which made it difficult with luggage to compete with other travelors. checkout line was so long i could not wait, but hopefully management will address the need for additional staff - or provide express checkout or put the receipt under the door at nite.
