After our first day at Universal Studios, we returned to our room to find that our room keycards did not work.

Our beds were not made and we had no clean towels. The gentlemen at the front desk (didn't get his name, as it was late and I was tired) only apologized, gave me some towels, and said it had been a busy day. After our second day and third days, we had clean towels, but our beds were never made up. The only redeeming factor from this stay ocurred upon checkout when person on duty (Justin) asked about our stay.

The treadmill worked and that was all i could ask for. The TV in the room got lots of channels and had good reception. that was a big plus Now for the eh. The room was eh. Not dirty but not spotless. It was definitely of an older style and even the hallways looked a tad bit rundown. This may not matter to some but I like my carpet to be clean looking and I hated the drab green colored couches. room had a fridge and microwave that was nice. Bathroom was clean but some dirt buildup was in the corners. No big deal. Shower was powerfull and I liked that also. The breakfast was just eh. Eggs were watery. Not runny but kind of tasted watery. Not much choice either. Fruit looked kind of old and bananas were brown. If hotel reads this I am sorry but this is all true.

I have not stayed here in about a year, but when I was told I would be traveling to the Kissimmee area for work, there was no other place I would rather stay...based on past experience. However, this hotel has lost some of it's appeal. I will say that for the most part and for the money, this is a standard hotel. In the past I have always held Hampton's in high regard and actively search for Hamptons when I am traveling for work. The Good: Friendly Check-in - People at the desk are polite. Location Nice breakfast - to include fresh fruit and warm eggs and sausage - also the standard continental trimmings The Bad: Uncomfortable bed - I have never stayed at a Hampton Inn that had and uncomfortable bed...until now...the bed in my room has seen better days...lumpy and saggy. Cleaning Service - did not bother to put the iron board back in the closet and (while my fault) the iron was left plugged in all day...dirty coffee cup in coffee maker - I had made a second cup of coffee in my room but ran out of time to drink it...the cleaning service did replinish my coffee suply, but left a cup of coffee in the coffee maker right next to the basket. Furnishing - The desk chair has several rips and tears that are uncomfortable. Fidge cabinet has several scrapes and \"dings\" in it. Overall: I can honestly say that the hotel is quiet and work can be accomplished in the evening hours, but the bed and desk are major drawbacks to the hotel.

A good breakfast was served every morning starting 6am, we mostly took it up to the room as the breakfast area was quite crowdy, especially on the weekend.

The whole staff was very friendly and helpful at all times. We did not have a rental car, so the free shuttle to Disney World was very convenient as taxis cost so much in the States. However, if you want to visit other attractions, such as Sea World or Universal Studios you rather want to have a car, because they are really far out and you have to pay min. $30 for a cab. Taxi to the airport is around $50. There's a nice mall (Factory Stores) only 20 minutes walk from the hotel and Walmart is around the corner, if you need to shop.

I don't recommend getting the king bed and sofa bed room if someone is going to be sleeping on the sofa bed. I also slept on the king bed for a few nights which was wonderfully firm and comfy- I wish I could take it home! The sofa bed, on the other hand, had a mattress so thin that I could feel the metal springs digging into my back. Sleeping on the floor was considered. We complained about it. The person at the reception desk said they\u2019ll \u201csee what they can do\u201d which is apparently nothing, so later in the day we asked again to a different person and someone brought up some blankets up to our room to put as padding. It helped a little. The hotel isn\u2019t the cleanest in the word, but it\u2019s clean enough (maybe my expectations were too high after reading the reviews). There are signs of being old such as a little dirt along the edges of the wall and tiny orange specks from being washed too much, but that\u2019s normal for its age and overall it\u2019s clean. The room service was adequate- they brought in new towels, made the bed, etc. There were some nice free features in the room such as a microwave, fridge, flat screen TV, coffee maker, rectangular shower with adjustable shower head, internet in room, table, a leather chair and a regular chair. The Location: It\u2019s located right next to a busy freeway with fast cars. Maybe we weren\u2019t used to the traffic in Florida, but be careful of making U turns. There is a large center grassy lane in the middle and to turn in or make a U turn, you have to look for the openings. It\u2019s definitely a tourist spot, so a lot of places to shop and eat. Be careful of the stores with large signs saying they sell theme park tickets. There are a lot of random small shops there that I can\u2019t pronounce the names of. Some people are also selling fruit and hats along the road. There\u2019s a Walmart about a 4 minute walk (do not recommend walking! There is no sidewalk and the cars are fast) and a 2 minute drive from the Hampton (you have to drive down a road and them make a U turn since it\u2019s on the same side of the street as the Hampton Inn hotel). We went there quite often, so it was pretty useful. There\u2019s also a nice chicken store that sells up to whole chicken for a good deal adjacent to that area. The free breakfast: The breakfast is pretty good and the cooking staff friendly and helpful. There is a large variety, unlike what I saw was at the hotel next door. Breakfast is from 6-10. I don\u2019t know why someone said from 8-9 because it isn\u2019t when I was there. I advise going before 8 to beat the large crowd. There is a section that has a different kind of \u201cegg\u201d or random type of food every day. The first day it was an omelet and sausages, then scrambled eggs and a different kind of sausage, then French toast, etc. Also available everyday are cereal (when I came frosted flakes, cheerios, and raisin brain), muffins, bagels, slices of bread, English muffin, waffles (you cook yourself), mixed fruit, yoghurt, and pastries. There are also condiments such as honey, peanut butter, jelly, syrup. The drinks I can remember are coffee, hot chocolate, orange juice, low fat and 2% milk. Disney World and Tickets: There is a shuttle that brings people from Hampton Inn to Epcot leaving at 8:45am and 10:55am and leaving from Epcot at 6:30pm, 8:45pm, and 10:30pm. We drove so we didn\u2019t use it. Tickets are sold next door at the Calypso Cay Hotel (same place we saw the breakfast). They sell tickets for a lot of places including Universal Studios. One of the catches is if you\u2019re buying a one day ticket, say for a Disney World park, then there is an added fee (I think around $4?). There are also some nice maps at the park at the desk where they sell the tickets. The drive to Disney World isn\u2019t that far- about 5 minutes. Random: The water in the hotel (sinks, shower, water fountains) smells and tastes like chemicals. Ugh! I had to use bottled water to brush my teeth. I know it\u2019s not the water in Florida because I tasted the fountains at the other resorts around Disney World and they taste fresh. The ice from the ice maker tastes alright though. I saw some baked cookies (oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip) two out of the eight days we were there. I think it was because we were coming late. They\u2019re probably gone by 5:30. They have to check your room at least every two days or something. We had the suspicion that someone may have come in during the day even though we put the do not disturb sign up since the air conditioner was turned off. Nothing was disturbed or missing though. We could hear some kids running down the hall one night, but it was quiet overall. We were on the 5th floor overlooking the swimming pool. Even though it\u2019s usually crowded, we didn\u2019t hear anything which was nice. We also had neighbors next door, but we could not hear them either. There\u2019s a fitness center and pool but we didn\u2019t use them. Oh, and there's free parking. Overall, it was a pleasant enough stay for the long stay- nothing to be super glad about, but not too much to complain either.

Chose this hotel because of its high guest rating in hotels.com and the special low rate. It's situated just north of US-192, close to the Disney Resort. Virtually a five-minute drive to Epcot Center, and perhaps a bit more to the other parks. Located on a quieter part of Lake Buena Vista, I had to drive a bit to find good area restaurants (keep going north on 535 to get to Lake Buena Vista's center and find nice shops and eateries, not to mention Downtown Disney). The hotel grounds, lobby and room were clean. The hotel room itself was an interesting mix of new and old; the wallpaper and carpet were dated, while the furnishings and flat-screen (but not HD) TV were relatively new. No bath tub, just a shower, but the bathroom was a good size, with a large vanity area. The beds felt older, too. Very soft and worn-out mattress, with even softer and worn-out pillows. Your mileage may vary, of course, but I was expecting slightly higher quality from the bed and pillows. The rooms also don't enclose sound too well; my neighbor's singing was clearly heard Saturday morning, albeit around 9AM. (We were already up by then.) If you value being shielded from others, or ensuring you are shielded yourself, this may not be the hotel for you. Customer service was pretty non-existant. At one point I phoned \"housekeeping\" (this was around 8PM on a Saturday night) to ask for firmer pillows (they advertised firm pillows were available in the room) but was placed on hold for about 10 minutes before I decided to hang up and just go downstairs. I needed a shower cap anyway for my wife (they similarly advertised they had this and other toiletries upon request), which required a trip downstairs. I had to make the line, as there was only one worker, and once it was my turn the front desk person responded that they had neither firmer pillows or shower caps, despite the advertisements in the rooms. To her credit, she wasn't rude, but it was annoying to be troubled for what ended up being nothing. I'm not a fan of false advertisement. They serve hot breakfast in the morning, including eggs, sausage and french toast sticks. They also have fresh fruit, yogurt and a selection of teas and coffees (decaf, regular, dark), so if you're healthy conscious like my wife and I, this will be satisfactory. Lots of hotels offer something like this, so I wouldn't make a decision based on this alone. It's here if you want it, though. Conclusion: If all you want is a clean room with adequate bed on a quieter part of Orlando close to Disney by car, you may be happy here. If you want more, notably good customer service, you're better off trying your luck somewhere else. With all the choices available in the area, I won't be coming back here any time soon.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Fl.", "Title": "\u201c\" Wonderful, can't wait to visit again\"\u201d", "Author": "gerynjorge", "ReviewID": "UR54117023", "Content": "We are a family of 4 and last week we traveled with our friends to Disney for the long weekend.

We arrived around 6:00 pm from an all day drive down from Easley, SC. Room was ready so we located a luggage cart near the lobby and got settled into our room. We had a king room on the 4th floor away from the elevators per our usual request. This property is very, very nice. Room was overly large with a counter/sink area with a nice mirror above on the left after entering the room with a small fridge and a microwave located below. Sleeper sofa in very good shape, a couple of tables, along with a desk and chair for work fit with plenty of room to spare. Nice flat-screen TV located in the middle of the room with capability to rotate the screen for couch or bed viewing. On the far side of the room was the king bed with 2 night stands. The bath area had a large counter with one sink. (we utilized the other sink around the corner of the room for the kids to brush their teeth, etc.) The bathroom was a decent size with a great tub/shower combo.....being 6'3\", the shower was located high on the wall and was wonderful. The carpets were in great shape and everything was very clean. The room had 2 large windows, one along side the bed and one at the end of the sofa. Finally, the ac/heating unit was wall controlled and very quiet. The property was not very crowded at all. The breakfast area was immaculately clean and had plenty of food choices both mornings. The front desk staff was very efficient. We had no issues of any kind so our contact with them was minimal. Maid service was good. The pool area and pool, which we did not use, is on the smallish side and that could be an issue when the place was busy. We would definitely stay here again if it fit the needs of our stay. This is a great hotel and one of the best parts was that the room was only $66 a night plus tax for a non-cancellation type room rate over the internet about 3 months prior to our arrival.

Overall the stay went very well and for the most part everything was exemplary. Check in was nice and smooth, no issue with the rates or room at all. All of the room keys worked, which isn't always a guarantee either, and we were able to go to our room at noon. The room itself is nice and spacious, the beds were typical Hampton, which are some of the best in the world in terms of hotel quality. The room was modern and had a very nice desk area and a nice flat screen TV. Bathroom area was very nice with a lot of towels to use and enough toiletries for two people, they didn't skimp like some other hotels tend to do. The only negative about the room was the green color they had on the wall, it just didn't fit and made the room seem a little off. I prefer a more traditional/warmer color in my room. The facilities around the hotel were excellent, the outdoor pool was one of the warmest I have ever experienced, which was really nice. The hot tub area was very nice and the fitness center was unique in that each of the cardio machines had individual TV's and headphones, a nice touch. The only aspect about the hotel that I though was below average for a Hampton was the breakfast. It is a busy hotel but I still thought the breakfast person was getting food out in a rather slow manner. The breakfast also lacked some of the fruit offerings that I enjoy in other Hamptons. The breakfast was still good and the breakfast area itself is nice, but I thought the breakfast food selection could have been a lot better. The location for the hotel is very convenient, about 10 minutes from Disney and close (but not on, which is very nice) to 192. The hotel is next to the Osceola Parkway, which offers a direct road to Disney and I-4, but it is a toll road (75 cents I believe each way, exact change). You can take 192 which is not a toll road, but with the lights it adds an extra 10 minutes to get to Disney and I-4. Lots of restaurants in the area though and a Wal-Mart Supercenter within walking distance. Overall the stay was excellent, I would only recommend to the hotel changing the wall color and improving the breakfast.
