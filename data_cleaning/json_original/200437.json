A very impressive Hotel with exellent customer service and facilities. Had a small problem with car parking when we arrived but found that the staff could not be more helpful and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the front Office Manager for his assistance. We decided to go for the Executive Lounge option and found this to be great value. Included with breakfast, we also had use of the Executive Lounge where afternoon tea, nibbles with wine, beer and soft drinks in the evening were served. Drinks in the public bar were a bit pricy so the Executive Lounge was great value, The room was clean and very well appointed with tea and coffee making facilities available. Prices in the mini bar were not too bad either but again the option of the Executive Lounge meant that we didn't need to use the bar. For people who might be concerned that a 5*hotel may be pretentious and a bit full of them selves don't worry the Steigenberger is a class hotel that makes all their guests feel welcome.

The Steigenberger hotel, is a very much decent hotel with all its exteriors kept as it was before (before the 2nd War maybe) and very much modernixed inside. The latter is not my preferance but it is today a fact that every 5 years maybe all hotels need to change from something to everything. The renovated rooms are nicely designed (more rooms are now available since the old big rooms are mostlt cut and made more sellable spaces. The problem you see immediately is that the shower place fails to evacuate utilized water and overflowing in the bathroom adn the room may happen. The breakfast is absolutely perfect in its abundance of things to eat. In this hotel, the greatest option is to have a room overlooking the los Angeles Platz and the old building array on the other side of the hotel.

Overall we did not have any complains and were happy with our stay. Front office staff is efficient both during check in and check out. Location is ideal. Very close to kudamm but still on a quiet point. Rooms and bathrooms are rather small but comfortable. Dont let the ancient looking room doors and key card systems scare you, rooms are recently renovated. Although I prefer a more plain style in a hotel room rather then the colourful and stripeful carpets, furniture and curtains, it still looks good. Thin glass bathroom door could cause issues for some :)) Now on the down side. The Steigenberger did not made us feel that we were staying in a five star hotel. Nowadays the reason why 4 star chain hotels like courtyard, four points, garden inn and park inn's are so successful is because they offer everything that one would need from a good hotel. Yes they dont provide anything further than that, but does one really need it? There are still people who pay the extra and prefer to stay at 5 stars to get that extra service. Ths is where steigenberger failed imo. If we talk about in room amenities. No bathrobes, not even slippers, no shoe polish only a paper thin cleaner?? (only in executive rooms) I travel for business a lot and I dont recall a 5 star not offering these basics for qutte a while now. International 5 star chains are trying to find further amenities and conveniences in rooms to differ their selves from the 4 stars. Today everyone has good beddings, minibar, flat screen etc. And more importantly, we only had one evening turn down service out of 3 evenings. And during the regular day cleaning, they did not even fold our pj's and just left them as they were. Again, these are the small touches where five star hotels need to show that they are five stars. Although what I mentioned above is done even on a 3 star. As a guest I dont care if it is a busy period or not, I want to get the service that is required frm a 5 star. All in all, we had a good stay but when I go back to berlin, and if I am paying and not my company, I would only consider steigenberger if they have a very very good offer.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201ccouldn't be more happy\u201d", "Author": "DutchTravelagent", "ReviewID": "UR125862464", "Content": "I visited the ITB Trade fair from 7 untill the 9th of March 2012 and chose this hotel after reading reviews and see the excellent location near the Ged\u00e4chtniskirche, Kurf\u00fcrstendamm and Europa Center (Irish Pub!)

Needless to say, I was stressed out big time because of this, and because the flight I had ment to book a ticket for was the red eye flight I had to wait til the next day for my new flight. This led me to booking my first stay at a Steigenberger. When arriving at this hotel I met an extremely friendly and professional member og the staff, who provided me with a great Executive room and helped me out with everything when I booked my new flight, from helping me finding the cheapest flight, to printing my new documents and so on, I was truly impressed and greatful for all this help. Thank you! The experience descriced above then led me to book an Exceutive room at a Steigenberger hotel, when me and my friends went to Berlin for a music festival from nov.4 - nov 7. For this trip, two of us, were straying at his hotel and the third one had arranged to stay with at a friends private residence We all arrived in Berlin with an early plane at 9 am, and decided to drop of our luggage at the Steigenbergen for storage and to check in later. When arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by very friendly staff from the very start, providing us with maps over the local area and recomendatins for things to do, while waiting for our room to be ready for check-in. It is important to take note that at that point there where was also a significant number of other guests checking in and out in the lobby area. However, just minutes after having provided us with maps, strored our luggage etc. Our incredibly friendly and professonial host at the counter Mr. Marcel Dost, had arranged for us to be able to check in within the hour. The three of us, then decided to wait in the Piano Bar, after just 40 mintes Mr.Dost, personally delivered our keycards to us in the Piano Bar, and arranged for our luggage to be delievered to our room, when we were to leave the Bar. The third one of us who was originally going to stay at a friends place, was so impressed by this amazing service and welcoming that he decided to book a room for one night. We could mention loads of other details describing this fantastic level of service, but need only say that during the rest of the stay, were provided with the same warmth, professional and friendly service from all members of staff. Not to forget the fantastic treatment we were given by the ever so nice staff at the charming spa/pool/sauna, perfect place to detox after a long night out.

There is a lot to like, but \u2013 overall I would not stay here again. I admire their bending over backwards, service wise, they really try hard to please. But\u2026 They have lower floors (3rd thru 4th) are of 4 star quality, then \u201cexecutive 5th floor\u201d - 4.5 stars at the most. 6th floor is supposedly better than 5th \u2013 haven\u2019t been there. Guide books say Berlin is a relatively inexpensive capital where 5 star hotels can be had for $150/nt. We had a reservation for a quiet room for 9 nights (light sleepers) @ a supposedly great pre-paid price thru DHR of $175 for a double. What we got was a tiny room on the 3rd floor right next to the elevator, thus a very noisy environment with a small bathroom with shower only. We requested to be moved to a quiet room \u2013 the only one available was on the 5th floor (at $28 premium per nt.). This room was a little bigger, bathroom very nice, 2 sinks, with only a bathtub, super slippery for shower taking. The toilet flush was a stupid button in the wall \u2013 so difficult to push that I had to use both thumbs and still often couldn\u2019t do it. We like separate beds, so we had the two twins separated \u2013 these were the smallest, shortest beds I\u2019ve seen. With tiny but very thick comforters, hotter than hell, no sheets, no blankets. When I asked the front desk for blankets they sent sheets. Had to look up the word in the dictionary \u2013 decke \u2013 this time it worked. So \u2013 falling off the bed every time I rolled over and losing my tiny covers \u2013 we did not sleep at all. Their breakfast is top shelf, never had better, but the crowds! Well, they must be popular. My other big complaint \u2013 they do not have a concierge. AND they don\u2019t have a rack with tour company brochures downstairs like all the hotels I\u2019ve been to \u2013 so if you have not done your homework for sightseeing, good luck. They SAY they have a concierge, but that person does not have a separate desk. You are supposed to ask the front desk all the questions and they ALL claim to be concierge. All the answers I got from them (after standing in a line with check in/out crowd) were wrong. Like about Reichstag viewing reservations \u2013 they said apply 1 day prior, website said \u2013 2 days. I once asked in the morning what the weather forecast was for the next day (making plans) and the lady said \u201cI think tomorrow is going to be like today\u201d. I THINK? You are in front of a computer, go online and check it for me, I am not really asking what you think. So \u2013 in conclusion \u2013 I feel duped. It is not a 5 star hotel, but they sure charge you for it. And \u2013 as far as the location \u2013 the area around Gandarmen Markt, with the elegant stores, cafes, museums, is a lot nicer. Ku\u2019dam is full of all kinds of crowds that you might not appreciate being around, some being tattooed skinheads panhandling, with a dog in tow.

That said, this hotel was an excellent choice for us. It is a well managed and well maintained property. I chose this property over the Kempinski Hotel Bristol and had no regrets. Service from the staff at the front desk and in the Executive Lounge was excellent. Staff were always friendly, helpful and courteous. We had a very minor hiccup with the check-in process: we were not given our access keys to the Executive Lounge right at check-in but a staff member delivered those keys shortly afterwards to our party after their discovery of the oversight. In my room, there was no bar soap at the sink the first night--a minor oversight which was corrected the following day. Rooms were very attractive and well cleaned. One exception was a stain present on the cushion of my desk chair, but I suppose they had done the best they could to eliminate the stain at the time with little success. Housekeeping was otherwise efficient and friendly when encountered. Nightly turn-down service was appreciated. I loved waking up in the morning and having the view over Los Angeles Platz.

WiFi connection in my room was very weak, which was surprising considering I was in the center of the building not too far from the elevator. My party greatly appreciated the included free internet access. Food offerings in the Executive Lounge were very good. It is well worth the extra fee if one considers that breakfast alone downstairs would otherwise have cost EUR 23 per person. Breakfast was, however, repetitive every day in the Lounge but the selection of offerings was diverse enough and the quality was very good. I sampled tea-time offering on one day and hors d'oevres on another day and was pleased both times. I never made use of the spa. One member of my party wanted to swim, but the swimming pool was too small (10 m diameter circular pool) for any serious exercise. There is no other exercise equipment that I was aware of on the premises, however I was told that a day pass to a local fitness facility could be purchased.

The hotel is in a really convenient location - less than 10 minutes walk from the zoo which was where the airport bus terminated (2 euros 30 - what a bargain and very quick too!) The station at the zoo provides links to both the underground and the overground railways and the whole of the Berlin transport network is clean, efficient and cheap. We did not have breakfast at the hotel but used the local cafes which were excellent value and very good indeed. There are many good restaurants in the locality too as well as superb shops. If I have any criticism at all it would be that the pool, although lovely and with a very relaxing environment, is a little small. With more than 3 people in it is crowded. We had to pick our times to use it but it was popular most of the time. We had a fantastic time in Berlin - everything worked well (except for the weather on the first day!!). We would definitely return to this hotel - it was extremely clean, quiet, well located, with very comfortable beds and helpful and friendly staff - what more could you ask for?", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "PickyTravellerGuy", "ReviewID": "UR116056444", "Content": "The Steigenberger Berlin was perfect.

There are also a couple of excellent places to eat on Rankestrasse next to the hotel, check out the Imbiss near Breitscheidplatz for authentic Currywurst & a traditional German restuarant (sadly I can't remember the name, but it's easily spottable) where you can get Eisbein (pork knuckle).

If you happen to be there in summer, there are also evening organ concerts in the DOM which is really worth going due to good acoustic and ambience. The only tourist spot which requires some queuing would be the Bundestag (the parliament building). Make sure you have sun screen or umbrella during sunny days as the queue could get quite long.

So we confirmed our reservation and took the plane! We arrived pretty late in the evening, tired after two flights. We took the bus TXL 109 Zoologischer Garten via Ku\u2019dam from Tegel airport 5,40 eur/2 pers, aprox 15 min to Ku\u2019dam (Erotic Museum), went back 200 mp on Joachim-something strasse then Augsburgerstrasse. The first morning, at 9:20, a drilling machine starts its concert!!! It seems in was right below my feet! They worked even on Saturday! They even check in people on 4th floor!!!!! The hotel is situated just behind Karstadt department store. We managed to avoid the bell capitain (thank you again, mika_berry2009!) and checked in quickly at 5th floor. About the room: basics, 1 bathrobe for 2 pers, occuerd smell from ventilation system, nice and modern bathroom, dust in the corners, plenty of sunlight though a large window, dirty walls, small holes in the curtain, incredible comfortable pillows, spartan amenities, old TVset (no flat TV or dvd player or coffee machine or news papers), CNN, Euronews, something in French, probably the best location for eating, shopping and exploring too, nice lobby, cold staff, decent breakfast (but 27 eur/pers is waaay too much), kind of wireless internet. After 2 nights we realized we should have upgrade the room, but we were afraid of changing the level of noise and the and view, considering the volcano eruption in Island, we weren\u2019t sure of staying until the end of reservation. So, if you want a decent room, I think you should book a superior or executive room from the beginning. I think we had a standard room (even I didn`t see such a room on their website), because we didn`t have coffee/tea facility. Where to eat: Italian restaurant Vapiano on Augsburgerstrasse, German restaurant Ranke 2 on Rankestrasse.. The nearest U-bahn station is Augsburgerstrasse, near a mini-market open daily 7-22 (get out of the hotel, take left on Augsburgerstrasse, walk 100 -150 m).

There was a bell person who kept chatting and gesturing to the reception staff when he was checking us in, who was a bit of a nightmare. While we were asking the reception staff for a quiet room etc he kept winking at the reception staff and then wanted to chat with us. He asked us \"so are you from Egypt?\" and laughed. He seemed to be the one who was from Egypt and we just smiled and said no we were not from Egypt. He took my suitcase, and when he latched onto my suitcase he used his foot, kicking my suitcase to turn it around so that he could push it. Shocked by this but too tired to raise any issue we went into the elevator to go to the room where he kept taunting us saying \"oh I'm from Tokyo! I'm from Tokyo\" (I am obviously the one from Asia so he was mocking me? Not too sure). He took his tip and disappeared. We did tell the reception that we were not happy with the room and the way we were taunted in the elevator by the bell guy (who was old but I didn't think his age should give him the right to pick up a customer's ethnicity and joke about it. Especially when people are tired from a trip and just longing for some peace and quiet racial jokes tend not sound very funny, well, at least to me). Back to the aloof reception staff. He gave us a room right in the middle of full-blown , serious renovation work. The carpet in front of our room was taped over with grey sheets. We were too tired so we got into the room and spent an hour but found the smell and noise unbearable. We told the reception about the smell (chemicals?), construction noise and workers loud chatting outside the room, but he insisted that there shouldn't be any renovation work on the floor he checked us in. He reluctantly moved us to another floor. The room was pretty nice, clean and there's a Nespresso machine, which was a big plus for me. And the cleaning staff was very nice.

There were fantastic shops along K'Dam and the bombed church, Helmut Newton museum (really good) and Zoo were within walking distance.

Zoologishcher garten to the hotel is about 5 minutes walk at the most so I couldn\u2019t recommend this more. Check-in at the hotel was quick and we got shown to the room that was hassle free.

The staff were very helpful from reception to the cleaners and the concierge who were all very friendly and went out of their way to help on every occasion.

KaDeWe is only five minutes away and is a must for a visit just for its food hall. The standard of public transport in Berlin is superb and the connections from this area are excellent. From the station you can catch a train to the central station (for Brandenburg and Reichstag) or Alexanderplatz (For the TV tower) and the various buses and subways are excellent to all parts of the city. All the city bus tours stop in Kurferstendamm aswell so is very easy to get one aswell as using it to get around the city.

Several bars and restaurants located nearby offered good value meals and drinks.

Second, location was key in my decision as i wanted easy access to public transportation, a friendly neighborhood for the wife to walk the dog, shopping, food both the fast and the sit in variants and enclosed parking for the car. Last I was using previous customer reviews to help sway my decision. Now the hotel for the price was only okay. As mentioned in previous reviews there may have been a renovation or something at one point as the lobby and entry into the hotel was magnificent but when we entered our room it seemed like the forgotten one...actually the forgotten floor or more specific one of the non smoker floors. Maybe this is just Steigenberger quality or Berlin flare but the room didn't really meet my expectations of a 5 star hotel of such a prestigious European chain. Wood cabinetry seemed dated, tv was antiquated (still don't get why not just use LCD screens at places like this) and the bed was actually the Euro standard of two separate beds put together to form \"one\". Surely they would just have one piece queen/king mattresses, no? The best part of the room for me was the bathroom. Seemed as if it actually got the makeover. Nice granite countertops with dual sinks for me and the lady and a nice deep bath/shower. Also of note is that this hotel does allow dogs at the rate of 15 Euro a night, which is fine with us because we love travelling with our 7 month old Boston Terrier. Overall i rate this as only a decent hotel as far as specific facilites go to match star rating. When it comes to location and access it's near the top as it puts you smack dab in the center of the main shopping boulevard and a quick step to the U/S Bahns and even the bus station (local hub at Zoological Gardens).

We had reserved the Executive Rooms which offered breakfast, a high floor hotel room, free coctails and a king size bed. This was all confirmed but when we went to the room we found we were in a two double bed room. And let me stress the double beds were each smaller than a full size bed. We returned to the front desk to get the room we requested which was 1 king size bed. We had the distinct impression there was a bit of homophobia based on the questioning look of the older clerk who obviously had an issue with this request. Nevetheless we received the room only to find out a King size bed at this hotel is really only a queen size bed. The room was clean but dated with tan walls, typical artwork and an outdated television. However the bathroom was quite nice and modern with marble and glass and high pressure spray. Like many modern hotels here the glass door to the shower covers only half of the tub and therefore water sprays on the floor when in use because the tub is not large enough to offer this option. Upon our return later that night we were promptly given the extra towels and ice we requested. The hotel bartender was extremely good serving dirty martini's perfectly and even offering me a full glass of olives when I asked for extras. Our six or seven drinks totaled over $100 USD but the service and quality was very good. They provided live music with a singer at the piano which was nice however she played with some electrical system that included light drums and threw off the quality of a piano bar. She also sang old basics like Rain Drops Keep Falling On My Head which was pretty dated. While there we checked out the Marriott near Postdamer Platz and I have to say it will be our next choice.

This is a great location from which to explore the city. The hotel itself is in cosmopolitan west Berlin, back-to-back with Ku'damm and two minutes walk from KaDeWe. Less than five minutes walk in the opposite direction is Zoo Station with links to all the main sites of east Berlin. Museum Island is about 10 minutes train ride followed by a short walk away. The Steigenberger is a good 4-star hotel, with comfortable rooms and friendly, professional staff you would expect at a hotel of this standard. However, we took the tip of another contributor to Trip Advisor and booked an Executive Room and we would highly recommend this to anyone thinking of staying here. All Executive Rooms are on the top floor and you have to insert your key-card in the lift to be able to access the floor. We would say the rooms are not especially superior, but access to the Executive Lounge makes the difference. Complimentary breakfast is served here until 11 (don't worry if you book \"room only\", you will still get breakfast), high tea is available 3 till 5 (tea, coffee, cakes, etc) and drinks and \"nibbles\" between 5 and 9, including endless supplies of beers, wine and champagne. All of this is complimentary and provided with first class service in the comfort of a very tranquil lounge. The evening champagne is lovely after a day's site seeing and before getting ready for the trip to the restaurant. Talking of which, if you're looking for something special we had an excellent meal at Borchardt [--] - take the u-bahn from Zoo to Stadmitte. One more thing, check out \"Original Berlin Walks\" for their \"Discover Berlin\" tour - an excellent way of getting an overview of the city. We also did the Sachenhausen Tour. We booked ours when we we booked the hotel via Expedia (best rates). We also bought a three day \"Welcome Card\" giving all travel in the city and discounts on museums, etc. Good value.

The bathroom had no bath only a shower, which I prefer, it was decorated to a very high standard and was well supplied with shower gels etc. Some people often complain about hard pillows, it's probably subjective but I found these pillows very comfortable and smelt of fresh linen.

The location was excellent close to the shops and nightlife in the Ku Damm area but situated in a quiet side street. This meant we could have a quiet meal and drinks outside the hotel at the chairs and tables provided during the warm September evenings we experienced. The hotel had a pasta party for marathon runners and their friends the night before the race. On the morning of the race the hotel opened their restaurant for breakfast early from 6am to facilitate marathon runners. This was well appreciated although I was not able to make full use of the excellent fare on offer as I had to run 26.2 miles a short time later. I did make up for this on the following two mornings sampling both the cold and hot breakfasts together with the wide selection of breads and pastries. A friend of mine stayed at the Intercontinental and their restaurant did not oblige with an early opening and he had to grab two bananas for breakfast at the first water/food station on the marathon route. I found the hotel facilities to be first class although i did not experience the pool or sauna, maybe next time. One small detail missing was the absence of a tea/coffee maker in our room which would have provided a welcoming cup of coffee first thing in the morning. The hotel staff were very polite and helpful. The reception staff handled the mailing of a letter and also forwarded on a camera case that I had inadvertantly left behind in my room. My thanks is also directed to the housemaid who recovered the case from the bottom of a wardrobe. A previous reviewer complained about the maid's haste in trying to clean their rooms. I did not find this to be a problem although the maid called I simply requested that she return later. This was no problem, maybe I should have just put out a do not disturb sign until we were ready to have our room cleaned.

The staff was professional and helpful, although I'm not sure that we were their \"normal\" clientele. The only negative was the directions (on line) from the train station to the hotel. This was the only hotel (out of 13 on our trip) for which the directions were inadequate. The online map is missing street names and implies that the hotel sits alone behind the Europa Center.
