{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Kubu Bali has seen better days Kubu Bali features beautiful grounds and some seclusion away from the busy thoroughfare in Candidasa. However, this property is showing some age and seems poorly managed. Most of the lighting in our room did not work, the bed smelled musty, and the pool needed more than a good skimming. We did enjoy the setting and had fun playing badminton on the premises. I'm not sure if there is a better run accommodation in Candidasa, but this one seems to be suffering from a downturn in business and inadequate investment in upkeep.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR725036494", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nicelynicely"}, {"Content": "If you like Nature       Kubu Pool", "Date": "Mar 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR270017184", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "annadiving"}, {"Content": "Awful fleapit! Kubu gets a really positive review in the Rough Guide stating that it comparable with Tegal Sari in Ubud - where we were previously and had a great stay - so were looking forward to our one night there.It was awful. The room was filthy - moth-eaten curtains, insect nests in the mosquito net, shabby towels, dirty light switches; very poorly lit with the light in the (outdoor) bathroom not working at all. The room was surrounded by ponds that were heavily populated with both extremely noisy frogs and a plethora of mosquitoes.To top it all off the staff were very surly - first time we have encountered this in Bali. The porters complained bitterly about carrying our bags to the room, and the receptionist over-charged us for a transfer the following morning to Padang Bai (10 minutes drive) to the tune of IR100,000!The whole place has a feeling of decay and neglect -needless to say, I wouldn't recommend Kubu!Similarly I wouldn't recommend Candidasa - if you can find somewhere Padang Bai is far nicer, and has a beach!", "Date": "Mar 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR702609169", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Dodgybint"}, {"Content": "Lovely unique hotel       massage bed", "Date": "Mar 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR821060169", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "FREYA69"}, {"Content": "Be Happy in Bali and you will be at the Kubu Bali Resort Just returned from 17 days in Bali of which 4 nights were at the Kubu Bali Hotel. The Hotel is a serene stay in beautiful gardens withy lush gardens, koi ponds and a refreshing pool rimmed with tropical flowers. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a wonderful indoor/outdoor shower, large patio and authentic Balinese furniture. Hotel is complete with wandering Long Talied Maquaques and a 4 1/2' Lizard but only if youre lucky. The hotel is not a 5star hotel but the ammenities it lacked ( hair dryer, tv, wifi, etc) were more than compensated by a truly peaceful stay and a resort staff who seemed unable to do enough to attend to your needs or to make you feel welcome. Having stayed in the 5 stars of Nusa Dua, do yourself a favour and see some true Bali and a stay at ther Kubu Bali Resort.", "Date": "Jul 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR604952650", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Tommyboy-YVR"}, {"Content": "magic hide away Just back from KUBU BALI ,CANDIDASA BALI.Great location in a exotic garden with views over the ocean .Atractive cottages are spread out with privacy in mind.An attentive and friendly staff are always there to assist.While in CANDIDASA try boating / fishing with the local fishermenor snorkling in BLUE LAGOON ,a great experience!Hope to be back again soon.", "Date": "May 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR251903347", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nyoman"}, {"Content": "love the kubu bali hotel We've stayed at this hotel three times and have already booked for next summer. It's a great place to relax and just do nothing for a few days. The gardens are VERY beautiful. The rooms (bungalows) are spacious and comfortable and the private terraces all have great views. The pool area is great, also with a great view. The people who work at the Kubu Bali are all very friendly. You can get a massage for about 70.000 rupiah at your private terrace. Make sure you get Made, she gives great massages!!! Candi Dasa does not have a lot to offer in terms of nightlife. There are a few good restaurants though, like the Watergarden Kafe and Kedai, both with excellent food and very affordable.", "Date": "Jan 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR582581784", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "anouk24"}, {"Content": "ooh the steps!
