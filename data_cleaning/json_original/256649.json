The good: Great room - Star Suite cost quite a bit (!) but was very roomy, had a great luxe look and feel, 3 TV's, amazing couch, lovely bath, nice view of harbour and a few little glitzy touches to make it feel like a proper upmarket 'casino' stay - a la Las Vegas (colour lights in bed headboard, TV in bathroom and amazing mini bar area). Plenty to do - great location to city/harbour attractions, big casino complex including Lyric Theatre - not as nice as Crown but something different and fun. We don't even know how to gamble but had fun in the casino atmosphere. Service - very friendly and professional staff. From housekeeping to room service to casino and front desk - all staff were very helpful, open and friendly yet professional. No attitude or arrogance as found in some large hotels. A plus! Breakfast - elegant and vast continental breakfast (hot food costs extra) in Sean's Kitchen. Pool area - whilst not exactly 5 star - the Turbine's health club was great and not crowded, Great view from the pool. The not so good: The price! The most expensive one night we have paid for in Australia! We were meant to recieve champagne and strawberries on arrival as part of the package and we recieved a bottle of low end white wine and a small bowl of cherries - these things matter when it is a Valentine's Day stay! Range of bath products was a bit minimal considering the amazing bath/bathroom/suite. No specific bath salt or bubble bath offered. Porter and valet staff were very helpful but clearly run off their feet. Delays were experienced. I think for the price - one hot option should have been included with breakfast.

Although I'm not a fan of gambling, it was an eye-opener touring around the jackpot machines, the snooker tables etc. The casino was about the size of 2 football fields and have plenty of restaurants with a variety of cuisine, such as Asian cuisine, very suitable for my rather traditional Chinese grandmother. In addition, the buffet breakfast was wholesome and all of us stuffed our face every morning with the gorgeous amounts of fruits, bread, and Asian and Western selections. The staff was friendly and helpful, maintaing discipline in a hotel in the least imposing way possible. The rooms were spectacular. They had splendid views of the Sydney Harbour, and were immaculately clean. Room service was done impeccably and the chambermaids were courteous and honest. Beds were luxurious with fluffy pillows and warm blankets. I stayed in an apartment with 2 other family members and we felt it was like a home for us. I could live there, and even have a Golden Retriever running about. The location was awesome as well, located near the Sydney harbour with fantastic lightings, pubs, restaurants and tourist locations such as the zoo. In addition, transport was convenient, because the tram was only located at the basement, the tram takes us to Central Station where many trains lead us to different parts of the city. The hotel was also located near Chinatown which was quite boring and had distasteful and oily food, I also loved the gym facilities at Star City, and the gym instructors were amicable and cheerful. The pool was small but the jacuzzis were great with hot water. My only grudge was the lap pool's water being too cold for me, as it was nearing autumn and winter. The rooms definitely do not come cheap, and the convenient store has got rather snobbish helpers, who cannot seem to be bothered about you other than charging your items. But the store has got many Australian snacks such as Tim Tam, and stock up loads of ammenities that everyone may need to use.

I chose to stay in an apartment rather than a standard hotel room as I prefer the extra room and the ability to prepare a light breakfast & snacks. Star City delivered so much more. We had a \"Studio Apartment\", no upgrade as other lucky reviewers have scored. Luckily the bedroom was placed in such a way that it was totally private. We were very happy with the extensive floor space, generous balcony (no furniture, maybe for child safety). As well as view of Sydney harbour, city skyline, the Harbour Bridge, the Maritime Museum, parklands and wharf areas, our apartment had everything we needed including a huge, fully equipped granite kitchen, full laundry, dining suite and a comfy lounge. The very comfortable king size bed with had quality linen, stacks of pillows, a large wardrobe with internal lights that activated when doors were slid open. There were plenty of drawers, cupboards & shelves in every room. Towels were ultra large and thick. Unlike other apartments which are not serviced during your stay, or only every four days, these were cleaned and serviced every day. Any request was met quickly and efficiently. All staff at Star City are obviously chosen carefully and trained well; combining friendliness with quick service, even the burly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153security\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd checking patrons at the base of the escalator to the gaming floors. Although part of the Star City Casino complex, the apartments are accessed through a separate entry of the main thoroughfare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to share lifts with the many, many people who seemed to stream into the casino floors all day and night. Renovation and construction work was going on during our stay, but we heard nothing. In case this all sounds too good to be likely, I had a few gripes, which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain about at the time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are very trivial and more than offset by the good aspects. One was that the kitchen was supplied with only two of each item of crockery and cutlery, obviously to discourage \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extra\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd non-paying guests. The television was not digital, and the extra channels were mainly paid movies ($16.95 per view), sports and hotel promotions. Not important most of the time, but a bit limited. The fairly grotty level below the main complex floor houses a station for Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Light Rail (called a tram, but looks like train to me) which for a fairly hefty fare takes you to various places including Central Station and the lovely suburb of Glebe (visit Glebebooks & Sonoma Caf\u00c3\u00a9). It took perseverance to find this & the bus station, as signs are obscure, and it is easy to lose your sense of direction in the curves and corridors. Finding the shortest route to the nearby ferry terminal was also a challenge. Please note this was not due to directions from the Concierge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I was going it alone. Star City seems to have numerous cafes & restaurants, only one of which (Seans) we tried. The food here is exceptional. Again, finding it was a chore, as I was advised to go through The Poker Room to access it. This I did, with my young & attractive daughter, while a poker tournament was on \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all men, all seemingly able to play & perve at the same time. The main stairway got us out with less scrutiny. I enjoyed my four night stay very much, and would live here if I could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would just bring my own TV, plates & cutlery.

There is a small shop on site, a Subway, a couple of other bars and places to eat on site, but it was only a good 10 minute walk to Darling Harbour, with plenty of restaurants. I would certainly stay in the apartments again, as it was value for money with the four of us.

As we had both lived in Sydney for many years we were looking forward to returning for a weekend of leisure and pleasure. As we had tickets to see Mama Mia we decided to stay 2 nights at Star City as we remembered it was quite flash. We met at the front reception and were quite impressed with the decor etc. We went up to our room on the 11th floor and were instantly dissapointed when we opened the room door. The decor was very plain, and tired looking. The headboards had finger prints and smudges all over them. The view was looking over Pyrmont and ugly rooftops. I rang reception and enquired about a Harbour View room and was told that would be an upgrade which i was happy to pay, i was then told there was not a single room available with a Harbour View. As we both drink a lot of tea (BTW i take spare T.bags everywhere with me and my husband said \"Hey it is a 5* Hotel i am sure they can afford T.Bags\" i discovered we had x 2 English Breakfast T.bags so we asked at the reception for T.bags and the receptionist could give me 1, and said she would send some up to our room, we were sent another x 2 T.bags. ?? 5* i don't know?? We ordered the \"complimentary\" newspaper for both mornings and we did not recieve it both mornings.We thought we could spend the evening in the Star City complex and no need to venture into the city. Well we were wrong there, the complex is undergoing renovations (which should have been done 10 yrs ago) and there were no cafes at the front of the complex, no escillators taking you up to the cafes, just an ugly steel staircase at the side crowded with people coming and going and smokers. Needless to say we did not spend much time in the complex as the only other choice was , Subway, the Irish pub, or the Sports Bar which was not what we wanted on a Friday afternoon/evening. After Mama Mia on the Sat night we decided to go to the Casino. We did not know it was under renovations and not very nice at all. We wanted to sit and chat and have a couple of drinks and we walked around the gambling area and behind a huge curtained off area until we found a new bar area ?? a sports bar as it had a huge screen in a small theatre set up. We found a seat but there was a DJ playing doof doof music so loud we could not hear ourselves shouting??? As we spent most of our time in the Rocks and Circular Quay we will stay in that area next time and give Star City a big miss.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDeluxe Room.

Anyway, before we arrived, my husband telephoned ahead and advised that it was our anniversary and could we guarantee either the best room in its class or to upgrade (at a cost if necessary). He was advised, Yes, and that they would also ensure something sent up to the room! (they sent up \"Champagne\" (obviously not Moet but a Pinot Noir - still nevertheless not bad!)). We arrived at the hotel approx 2 hours before we intended and my husband left me downstairs to wander around while he sorted out the room - the room he was given looked onto a wonderful red brick wall! (Not quite what we had in mind!) Could we upgrade - Yes, for $100 dollars. Ok, not what we had in mind either, but anything had to be better than what we'd originally been given! For the $100 we got an upgrade to room 1121 - which is one of the Star Suites - I cannot describe the room without getting all giddy! I have stopped in some really good hotels in my time, but this was the best room ever! It had leather settee in the living area, and a 4 place table in dining area, plasma tvs throughout - ie in living area, bedroom and in the wall above the bath! A king size bed with a pillow menu!?!?! Absolutely awesome! The kiddies have never had so many baths in the space of 3 days before! Not an expense we intended spending because it does cost quite a lot to stay at this hotel in the first place, but it was so worth it! The staff are wonderful, even if a little forgetful at times - we upgraded to breakfast at the Astral, which compared to the Garden buffet really wasn't worth the extra $10 dollars as there wasn't as much choice, even though you do get items on a little a la carte menu that are cooked to order, and fully included in the upgrade. However, were a little disappointed when we looked at the bill to find that they'd charged us $100 dollars instead of just $30, but they did deduct the who $100 off the bill at the end of the stay! Also, I unfortunately rolled my ankle on a pavement nr to harbourside shopping centre and when my husband telephoned reception on our return, apart from asking if we needed any assistance from a doctor advised where to get bandages from and also promptly brought us up an ice bucket and extra towels to try and get the swelling down. (However I did try to get another bucket of ice on the Saturday night, and was advised that it was a $5 dollar cost!?!?!?!) The Astral restaurant is a lot easier to access than the Garden Buffet,. because you have to either go through to the far end of the casino or (as we did because we had the children with us) you have to go to the lobby, walk about 100 metres, and then try and find the right escalator to get back up to the Buffet! There's a lot more choice there though, even though probably not as posh - (I saw someone thrust a $20 into the waitress's hand before they'd even sat down - bit pretentious I think). The sports club is brilliant - there is a pool that is half in, and half out of the hotel, and there is a spa tub outside (which we used when it was raining - was very very warm) as well as one in the inside part. We didn't use the gym, but it looked pretty well stocked. The views from the pool area were fabulous, as they were from our room! One problem that we did think needed addressing by the hotel is that you cannot gain access directly to the hotel from the front of the casino, which meant you had to walk all the way round the back to the lobby or go through the casino (which we couldn't with the children). All in all, we had a fabulous stay at Star City, and the only problem for us now would be staying there again if we didn't get the upgrade.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delhi", "Title": "\u201cVery good Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Globalisation", "ReviewID": "UR32158283", "Content": "One of the biggest hotels i have ever been to.

The kitchen was full sized and stocked with all necessary crockery, cutlery and kitchenwares. Toaster, kettle, coffee plunger, mircrowave and full sized fridge. Oven & dishwasher. Housekeeping restocked tea, coffee & sugar etc each day. There was also handy stocked salt & pepper shakers.

Hair dryer located in a drawer. Shampoos and conditioners and bath/shower gels were nice quality. Towels and faceclothes etc were plentiful and very thick and plush. Bedroom also contained a good sized LCD tv and desk with net connection. The second bedroom was a queen sized bed with 2 wardrobes and a desk with net connection. The second bathroom was across the way and was spacious with large shower, vanity and toilet, plus washing machine and dryer, ironing board and iron.

The swimming pool was a slight disappointment in that it was quite small and very cold! However, we were so busy that we didn't need to use it more than once anyway! We couldn't have been more pleased with the apartment itself - although it wasn't especially cheap. I think we paid around \u00c2\u00a31250 for 6 nights. Although it felt slightly out on a limb - transport links to the hotel were fantastic. It was a five minute walk to Darling harbour - where there are scores of restaurants, bars, shops and attractions and of course ferries to Circular Quay... Although we were aware of the casino when we came downstairs we were never bothered by any noise from this or any of the many bars and restaurants in the complex itself. If you're expecting beautiful views of Sydney's amazing harbourside you'll have to pay a premium. And if you're wanting cosy and personal service - forget it! But this was just what we as a family of five needed. And we loved it.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northamptonshire", "Title": "\u201cMore than just a hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ll5x", "ReviewID": "UR8032988", "Content": "My family and I stayed at Star City in April 07 for 5 nights and we all agreed it was awesome!

It is very well located in Darling Harbour, which it itself handy for everywhere and great for bars/ restaurants etc. We stayed in an apartment which was large and comfortable. This place came very close to a 4 star review and I should note my husband thinks it should get one. I have however marked it down for the following reasons: 1. We paid extra for a view over the harbour. This is really not worth it, its just a view of high rises and in our case, a construction site directly outside our room. 2. There was a lot of construction work, which caused noise often quite early in the morning 3. The only way to get to the pool due to the construction work was to get a lift down 9 floors, walk across the hotel lobby to another lift and go up 5 floors 4. Most of the gym was shut for construction 5. On the first day of our stay, we attempted to to to the 2 bars recommended by the guide book ( 38o and the one on the top floor) to be told neither opened on Mondays. 6. The mini bar was laughably expensive, more so than I have seen anywhere else Should the hotel not have been undergoing construction, it would have got a 4 start review as it was otherwise good.", "Date": "June 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muscat, Oman", "Title": "\u201cExcellent apartments\u201d", "Author": "ChrisSakhalin", "ReviewID": "UR7842702", "Content": "We stayed in one of the 2 bedroom apartments in March this year.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were told our room was not ready and that they would give us a call as soon as the room actually was ready. Hours passed, still no call. We came back, and they told us the room was ready, but they offered no apology for not calling. To irritate us further, our room came with free buffet breakfast vouchers, which they refused to honour because it 'wasn't in their documentation' even though it was clearly stated while booking online on their official website. Their only suggestion was to find some proof online and show it to them, but they would not cover the expensive internet charges there for doing so. As for the Deluxe Pyrmont View room, it was generally modern and okay. However, the room didn't have a particularly good view and it was not well lit as the lights were oddly placed around the room. The bathroom had a bath/shower which was not comfortable and the toilet paper was attached to the wall only about 10-20 cm above the floor strangely enough. It is also worth noting that the floor level of the Deluxe room, which was apparently 16, may not have actually been as high as 16. Floors 4, 13 and 14 were simply missing and you could not access them. As for the rest of the 7-day stay there, we found the lifts to be infuriatingly slow to arrive at many times, the concierge gave us incorrect information and room service took over an hour to arrive at about 6 p.m. once. A warning to those staying with people under 18 or slightly above that age, the casino forms a large part of that hotel. If you are under 18, you'll usually have to detour around the casino to get to the other side of the hotel rather than going through it. If you are slightly over 18, you'll constantly have to get your ID checked every time you take a shortcut through the casino. The only particularly good things about the hotel that separated it from any other hotel of the same class was that it has good facilities including a casino, restaurants and theatre. The location was also fairly decent, being located near Darling Harbour and having light rail and bus services beneath it. Overall, however, we would not stay there again, we've stayed at far better hotels in Sydney.", "Date": "March 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel great location\u201d", "Author": "Kaypee00", "ReviewID": "UR6837593", "Content": "Spent 3 nights at the Star City before joining a cruise ship.

There is a small swimming pool at the rear of the hotel with a nice warm jacuzzi beside it. Staff were very helpful at reception. We arrived before noon and the room wasn't ready but the concierge looked after our cases and phoned us on the mobile phone when we could get access, allowing us to wander the area and get our brearings. The casino is very busy day and night and worth a visit just to watch a lot of folks lose a lot of money!! The open topped bus tour of Sydney has a stop just outside the (back) door of the complex and it is well worth catching this to see the sights. It is a hop on hop service with an all day ticket.
