Airplane landed before the room was ready at 1pm and hotel stuff quickly responded to my email in english welcoming us to leave our luggage until the room becomes available.

Quad room consists of one queen size bed and one twin bed that has another twin bed underneath (rolls out). With four large suitcases lying around it would become crowdy at night. However, Paris rooms are much smaller than North American ones and we haven't spent much time in there anyways. Washroom with bathtub was quite large and extremely clean. Breakfast was included (which was a bonus as they go around 12-15 Euros per person) and it was basic European baguette, croissants, fruit yogurt, coffee/tea etc. Very fresh and quite good. Internet was a bit of pain as Paris hotels seem to allow only one device (can't have Blackberry and laptop on it at the same time). Try to use free WiFi where available as this is pay-per-use service here. I believe Wifi was charged at 13 Euros per day, but luckily online deal for this hotel had it listed as included and receptionist gave it to us for free during our stay. There is wall-mounted small LCD if you care with some satellite channels (we didn't care much). All in all, hotel is very pleasant, staff friendly and english-speaking. Make sure to at least try to speak French when in Paris. Everyone seems to appreciate the effort. Keep in mind that Paris can get quite windy/rainy, even in July. Luckily we had wind jackets on us.

There is a minibar, TV and AC in the room. WiFi is also available at a rather decent charge compared to other hotels. The hotel is located in a side street and has a rather small lobby area. The elevator also is not for the claustrophobic. Breakfast is available and follows the French style with baguettes, croissants, jam, juice, coffee/tea, and a youghourt served at the table.

The hotel is on an ok street - there weren't many stores / restaurants right on that street, but the location was absolutely incredible. It was 2 blocks from the Trocaderro, which is a wonderful, wonderful place to go in the evening to watch the Eiffel Tower lit up. The tower lights up (in June) at approx. 9:45pm, and then at 10pm for 5 minutes the twinkling lights come on. This occurs once/hour. It was such a nice, short walk we did this both nights and enjoyed it each night!! The Trocodarro Metro stop was approx 1 1/2 blocks away. It is also approx 3 blocks to the Arch de Triumph / Champs Elyses, and is a very pleasant walk. I can't say enough about the location, if you are at all interested in walking around Paris or hopping on the metro to see the sights! The hotel itself was ok. The lobby was small and the man who checked me in was adamant that I needed some type of slip from AAA, even though my room was completely paid for ahead of time.

On each floor there are only a few rooms (maybe 5?). Our room was ok - kind of dark, the beds were very firm, the bathroom was actually better than I was expecting based on my impression of the room. The view from our window was to the back of other ugly buildings. We would take the elevator up, and then walk down. The hall lights are on a timer, so as you walked down towards the next floor the hall was pitch black until you walked a little further down and then the light sensor would turn on the light for that floor. The breakfast was exactly as the previous reviewer had described. It was wonderful and some of the tables looked out onto a small courtyard - it was very pleasant.

We arrived at around 11pm and couldn't gain entry. After a long spell of leaning on the bell for attention (no doubt disturbing other residents) the concierge arrived; from there on things improved. The service was friendly in this clean but no frills hotel. The room was modern but pretty cramped. Importantly however it was exceedingly quiet and a good night's sleep was had - don't be confused by the small uncomfortable pillows - there are better ones myseriously packed away in the wardrobe. The breakfast area is small and there can be a fight for tables; thankfully guests and staff alike were always keen to make room. The breakfast was basic but tasty. Without doubt it's best asset is its location to the Trocadero but I was left to wonder if the Best Western (which sits on top of the Trocadero and looks very smart for 3 stars) would be a better bet. Like any hotel in Paris you will smart when you get the bill; the hotel is fine and probably good value for Paris - would I return?

After flying to Paris we had to then suffer a very hot packed train and a cab journey, so by the time we got to the hotel all we wanted was our room and a shower! When we arrived we were told that the person previously staying in our room was sick and could not leave therefore we had to go round to their sister hotel, there was no apology and they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care less!!! After reading on Trip advisor from someone else that they had been sent round to another hotel, it seems to me they are over booking and then sending people off round the corner! We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy but needed a room for the night so we walked round. What they didn't mention before they sent us on our way was their sister hotel was in the middle of complete refurbishment. The reception area was in a right mess. They bragged that they were given us one of the new refurbished rooms that had just been finished today - dread to think what it looked like before it was refurbished then! The room was tiny and claustrophobic. The bathroom was clean as it was new but still very small - if you sat on the toilet your knees touched the bath pane! No shower curtain so the water went everywhere when you had a shower. The walls are paper thin and we heard constant banging etc all night. It got worse we were rudely awoken by builders starting work at 7am!!! We left as soon as we could that morning and went back to Longchamp the room weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better - very small. Had much difficulty moving in the bathroom - couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit two people in the bathroom at one time. However the room was clean and well kept.

We were allowed to move back the next day. The moral of the story for us is do not pay for this hotel in advance because in the event of a problem like ours you have no redress.

We were not disappointed... The hotel is tucked away on a quiet little street off Ave Raymond Poincare'. There are shops such as a supermarket, pharmacie, p\u00c3\u00a2tisserie, and lovely cafe's all within walking distance. (Just off Place de Mexico was a little mall with a huge supermarket, Sephora, and many other shops, with more shops near Place de Victor Hugo-- including a Starbucks if you are jonesing for a fix.) Just a few blocks away is the Trocadero with the most amazing view of the Tour Eiffel (just cross the street and walk down and voila! you are standing at the foot of the Eiffel Tower!) The Metro is easily accessible via either Trocadero (closest) or Victor Hugo. If you are feeling like a nice walk, mosey over to the Arc de Triomphe and down the Ave Des Champs Elysees. You can then walk straight down, through the Place de la Concorde, the Tuileries, and onto the Louvre. (Its a hike, but so beautiful, it would be sad to miss everything along the way!) The staff were all very helpful, courteous, and accomodating. We booked a triple room for myself, my husband and our 8 year old daughter. The room was HUGE by European standards and even very decently sized by American standards. Everything was spotlessly clean, and housekeeping did a wonderful job. I have no complaints whatsoever about this fine hotel, and would strongly recommend it to visitors to Paris -- we plan to stay at the Hotel Longchamp Elysees on our next visit to Paris! One last thing -- I carelessly forgot to check the desk before checking out, and had left behind my Filofax as well as some other important items. I emailed the staff and got an immediate response that they found the items and would post them asap. I think this is a testimony to the honesty of housekeeping and the general staff.", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Longchamp Elysees", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d583986-Reviews-Hotel_Longchamp_Elysees-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$136 - $296*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">68 rue de Longchamp</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75116</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "583986", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ef/43/ef43a70f5af085a5c751acfb6ab7f2af5large.jpg"}}
