So when iIreach the reception and told them my situation that I dont want to smell the feet of the two people, they said \"all rooms have the same bed configurations. I told them that I just saw a room that has a better configuration and she dared me to tell her the room number. I told them its in the 2nd floor and she said that no rooms are like that. She went up with me to my original and I explained to her that i dont want to sleep smelling the feet of the 2 people infront of me. We argued and argued and she told me to talk to my tour director and walked out on me! Is that what you call service? walking away on a client? Why would I talk to my tour director about this problem? Its the problem of the hotel not the director. I chased her the hallway and raised my voice to her because what she did ( walking out) is not a good way to treat a guest. I went down to the reception again and some guy ( i think it was the manager )talked to me. He gave me options and to make the long story short, we got transfered to another room on the fifth floor with 3 beds side by side to each other.

Ended up being fun though. The bathroom doors were completely see through (although they appear to be frosted)!

There are multiple Aran hotels so we had to be sure to remember that we were at the Mantegna one. The room was very modern, with unusual lighting - of course that was the first thing we checked out. There was a safe and small fridge. The bathroom doors are very se-through at this hotel, which isn't a big deal, unless you're not comfortable with the person you're traveling with. We braved it on our own 1 night and went to Rome on our own from the hotel. It was just me and my 15 year old daughter and I'm so glad we did that, but it was a little adventure. To get to the bus, you need to go past the parking lot security guard, turn left at the 1st street you come to, and then turn left again at the 1st street you come to, and then left again at the 1st street you come to (you would think you could just turn right and avoid all that, but NO - don't do that, you will not get where you want to go!). The area to walk in is not unsafe or scary, but maybe you could call it a little run-down. Not a big deal, but it would have been better to have a guy with us. However, it turned out to be a great adventure, and if you are part of a tour group, I would recommend trying to go out on your own!!!", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "richardson", "Title": "\u201crude staff, no irons, weak air cond.\u201d", "Author": "slambiase", "ReviewID": "UR35051707", "Content": "this was one of the worst business hotels I have been to.
