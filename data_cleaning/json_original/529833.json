It is not a resort type of hotel with a lot of amenities but offers a good base when returning from a full day of sightseeing. The hotel is located in the north west section of Rome....more suburbia than city. There are shops and a pharmacy within walking distance. I found my double room to be peaceful and quiet despite the fact the hotel is near a train station and hospital, To get to the center of Rome where most of the historic sites are we took a taxi to Cornelia Metro Station which passes through most important sites. The staff are helpful and speak English quite well. Good value for money. Would have been nice if there were some coffee/tea making facilities in the rooms especially as there is no restaurant or bar.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Samara, Russia", "Title": "\u201cPoor hotel, far from center\u201d", "Author": "ytrewq2000", "ReviewID": "UR122804637", "Content": "May be some people like this place but we didn't.

A friend suggested this hotel as it is located in his neighborhood. It has been recently renovated and the rooms are spacious, clean and well appointed. The bathrooms are modern and above average for Europe. It is unfortunately located in a residential area and too far from the sites of Rome. I discovered the bus stops just steps away, however, and there is also a train station within a couple of blocks, so one can make an easy connection to the metro system. The worst disadvantage for me is that there are literally no restaurants within walking distance. There are several pizzarias and small markets, but one has to travel by bus or taxi to get to a decent restaurant. The breakfast was quite poor for this class hotel - instant coffee dispensed from a machine, watery juices, poor quality commercial pastries, etc. They did have boiled eggs on one of the three mornings I was there. The staff was great! They were very friendly and very helpful with information about bus routes, getting tickets, finding food, etc. There is a garage, but it is not free.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale-AZ", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, be aware of train(FS) hours\u201d", "Author": "__-___-_____", "ReviewID": "UR46142437", "Content": "Hotel is good in general, staff speak English and are helpful. We started using the train to get us to the metro and then to Rome Center, but we noticed reduced hours after 7PM and on weekends, I think there are 2 trains per hour after 7PM and 1 per hour after 9PM, same kind of problems during the week end. So use the bus instead, two buses take you to the metro, they are always there, just avoid them on rush hour. Also be aware that it takes about 45min to go from the hotel to Rome Center ( Coleseum for instance ), it is a big city so this is normal, just take this into consideration.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales", "Title": "\u201cNot For The Light Sleepers!!\u201d", "Author": "AnnaLouiseTwin", "ReviewID": "UR46015105", "Content": "On the main thoroughway to the main hospital so do not book if you like nice peaceful sleeps!

The room was clean and had a lovely balcolny. There was little for our children to do- no kids channels on the tv, but there was a little lounge area where they could sit and play - we brought our own packs of cards. Unfortunatley the air con broke on 2nd night and it did get hot. There is a supermarket just around the corner which was great for stocking up on pizzas, bottles of water, bread, biscuits etc. These picnics saved us a fortune and were worth carrying. The bus service in to Cornelia and then on to the metro was a lot quicker and more frequent than the train. The hotel staff were friendly,but not particurlarly helpful - Another family who we met there told us about the supermarked and the bus.
