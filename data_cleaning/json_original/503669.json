{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cheap, clean, safe, central. I'm cheap....but I do have my standards when it comes to cleanliness  service. Every time I stayed at the Tourist-Inn I was very happy with just that and the price, considering how centrally located it is. I stayed 3 times in total, so it could not have been luck! Location: It is a less then a 10 minute walk away from Centraal train station and there is plenty of sight-seeing, shopping, restaurants, convenience stores, coffeshops etc. everywhere around it. Rooms:I had a private room each time and yes, they are very small (not suited for your honeymoon) but do have dressers, an efficient sized/ modern equipped bathroom/shower, flat panel LCD TVs mounted on the wall and remote controlled AC and a comfortable bed. All rooms are smoke free, smoking is only allowed in the lobby. But some of the private rooms on the top floor have access to the roof patio, which is quite nice if you are a smoker. So make sure you ask for one.Noise:The hotel is one street over from a main street, so you do NOT hear the loud car, bus and tram traffic. Eventhough there are also dorm-style rooms at this hotel, I never encountered a loud party crowd while I was there. Other:There is breakfast in the lobby, but I have never tried it, so I can't comment. Towels are self-pick up from a service room next to the elevators, you can just grab as many as you like. Towels are old, but always clean. There is also a luggage storage room next to that. From what I was able to tell, the hotel is safe, all the people walking in and out looked kosher to me, a mix of families and globetrotters. No junkies, no dealers, no hookers/pimps, no panhandling as far as I could tell ;-) Unfortunately this hotel is small and books out fast, so make sure you start checking availablity early!Bottom Line: This is a reasonable, simple, clean, safe, no B.S. place to stay in the middle of Amsterdam. I'm sure I'll come back to it.", "Date": "Aug 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR554687113", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Beavis2008"}, {"Content": "Basic, clean, Very happy!

This hotel although it was budget - meaning the room was small and the breakfast was basic and it was a good price - it was a great place to stay for it's location. It is very central and is a great place to sightsee from. The room was clean and tidy when we arrived but they only came in once to empty our bin once which was a bit poor, but when you are sightseeing you don't really spend that much time there anyway. The breakfast was basic but it ended far to early - 9.30am is not holiday time! Bed and pillows were comfy and the tv had plenty of channels. It also has a place to leave you bags once you have checked out if your flight is later in the day. All in all I would stay there again.", "Date": "May 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR562473938", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Tamms200"}, {"Content": "Over 21?

Not too many reasons to complain about this low budget hotel; the only big minus was NOISE from the street. Apart from that think it's quite a reasonable hostel right in the centre of Amsterdam and a 5-minute walk to the central station.

I can only speak for the rooms at the front of the hotel, as the busy road in front makes it impossible to have a decent nights sleep or that mid-afternoon kip that we all enjoy from time-to-time. Saying that, the ignorance of the guest making their way through the corridors at night didn't help either!Though our bedroom served its purpose (read into that what you may!), the room itself was basic - small double bed, cramped furnishings and a bathroom, though nicely tiled, that was so small it could easily fit inside an 'airing' cupboard.The position off the hotel is two streets back from the main high street (Damrak) and within easy walking distance of Central Station. The Red Light district was a bit of a trek making it somewhat of a chore to get back when your half-cut!*%$Good points: It has an automatic front door (Im trying my best here).Bad points: Too noisy!

The hotel was very nice and clean and the staff were very helpful! The best thing about the hotel is its location, it is just off the maibn street the Damrak and it is set right in the middle of the city.

Our room (1 double bed) was very small, but modern and clean. Housekeeping service is not provided during your short stays unless specifically requested.
