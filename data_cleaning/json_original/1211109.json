The hotel was OK, the room was reasonable. The bathroom however... Was atrocious. I had the bathroom door closed when I went to bed, and woke up in the middle of the night to use the loo. I opened the door and the smell coming from it was the nastiest I'd ever smelt. If you had to ask me to describe the smell, take garbage, mixed with vomit, sprinkle a little cleaner on top and that's about as best as I can describe it. It was enough to almost make me throw up, and was VERY overpowering. I had to go to the window and air the room out it was that bad.... The bath had brown water stains, the bidet was brown and rusted, and I'm sure this is where the smell was coming from. Breakfast was ok, staff were friendly at the check-in desk.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cvery bad\u201d", "Author": "alecaro9", "ReviewID": "UR102465517", "Content": "In the hotel averything was of the '70, dust too.

The building and lobby area made me nervous enough, but I was still optimistic that the room might be serviceable as most places in Spain tend to be... We had a room on the 6th floor which had not been renovated since the hotel was built - probably in the early 60's. I think staying in a jail might have offered a cleaner and more comfortable experience. What to expect: bare, dirty floors peeling paint on walls old linens, curtains and threadbare towels beat up furniture a tiny tv poor WIFI that must be paid for by the hour general filth and years of dirt encrusted in a tiny bath at least 2 kinds of mold that I could identify in the shower I had to check for bedbugs, but the sheets appeared clean at least. Not that I slept that night, given the tv noise and smoke wafting in from another room. The staff seemed friendly, but this can't make up for the egregiously poor conditions.

The hotel satisfied and somewhat exceeded my expectations. WHAT TO EXPECT: - A clean room. - Excellent service. WHAT NOT TO EXPECT: - An aesthetically pleasing room. THE BOTTOM LINE: You will be very satisfied if you stay here and expect nothing more than a clean room and good service. When I arrived, the receptionist (Juan Jos\u00e9) was extremely helpful. He gave me a map of the city, explained how to get to my destinations and what my travel options were, then assisted me with planning my trip back to the airport via the metro. Late that night, I was woken up by a noisy neighbour, so I called Juan and he immediately took care of the problem and ensured that I got a good night's sleep. I felt that he was genuinely concerned with ensuring that I had a good stay, which is better service than I have received at some 5-star hotels. If you don't come here with illusions of grandeur, then you will be pleasantly surprised. Please let me know if you have any questions. I hope this helps and wish happy travels to all!", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gmr", "Title": "\u201cTo sleep...

The hotel is right outside the Principe Pio metro station, which is very convenient for a newcomer. The staff was very courteous and helpful, my room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast and wireless internet are not included, but other, more expensive hotels in Madrid seemed to have the same situation, as my co-workers found out, so 6 Euros for 24 hours of wireless didn't seem like a bad deal.

To put it simply, this hotel has barely changed since it was built, and is in great need of an update. The rooms are of a good size, but are very old. The sheets on my bed had small rips in them and have obviously been used for a few years too many. Lighting is fairly poor. The television was very small, lacked a remote, often lost sound, and had a very limited number of available channels. The rooms (and linens) had a bad smell as well. The bathroom was also quite old and dark, though had no big problems. One of the biggest problems I experienced while staying here were the paper-thin walls. We could easily hear the television program in the room next to us. The fact that many of the floors are made of stone doesn\u2019t help this situation. While I did not experience this problem myself, many in my group had some of the planks supporting their beds randomly snap in half! The room where breakfast is served was actually kind of new, but the breakfast itself is nothing to write home about. The selection of foods was fairly poor, and even the breakfast was dirty. For example, some of the butter packets were covered in melted chocolate. There is absolutely no reason why this should happen. I can't comment on the public restaurant in the hotel. No free Wi-Fi, though there was one (albeit slow) public computer for Internet access (1 Euro for 10 minutes of service). The hotel is across the street from a subway station which is convenient, but perhaps the only good quality I could find here. Do yourself a favor and don't stay here. I have no idea why this qualifies as a three-star hotel.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "San Antonio De La Florida Hotel Madrid", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1211109-Reviews-San_Antonio_De_La_Florida_Hotel_Madrid-Madrid.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Paseo De La Florida 13</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1211109", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/73/37/7337c4ffba93e868b7052135df3856f82large.jpg"}}
