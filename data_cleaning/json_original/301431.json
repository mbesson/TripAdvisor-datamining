Still the room condition was no better, the electric kettle was not working and we had to struggle with its plug early morning, The sink drainage was clogged and has bad odor in the morning after the door was closed all night. We left the room the next morning and came back at 6 pm.to find the room unmade. The house keeper said the DND was on! It was the switch next to the light switch at the door which we closed it upon departure with good intention to save electricity like we do at home when we left the. That switch had no sign of what it was(same as the volume button in the bathroom which we learned that it was TV volume, in the toilet?). Clearly the hotel needs to communicate more to its customer by putting a sign sticker since there was no directory direction aside the TV channel. The only good thing in this hotel was the helpful ,, eager concierge . I stayed at this hotel a few years ago on business trip, accommodation arranged by the embassy and received wonderful treatment, with lady guided me to my room and the room with nice view so I chose to come back, to different experiences, learning that booking through internet you are nobody and get the worse hotel room they have.

They were all friendly and very eager to please; they made the stay as pleasant as possible. Having said that, this hotel is old and in dire need of refurbishment. This Regent does not in any way reflect Regent properties I've stayed at in other parts of the world, and the fact that it's somehow attached to the 4 Seasons brand, absolutely confounds me. We stayed in a suite on the Regency level and the room carpet and furnishings were tired and scarce, with a very small bathroom. The Regency Club had visibly soiled sofas which to my estimation was inexcusable for a hotel that claims such a high pedigree. The deck off the Regency Club had tattered furniture that was dirty and not welcoming whatsoever. There was no deck furniture at all on either deck of our suite; again, unforgivable with The Regent and 4 Seasons names attached. This hotel is closer to a Holiday Inn than it is a Regent, and bears no comparison to any 4 Seasons I've been to. I had Easter Brunch at The 4 Seasons Hotel in Singapore, and the comparison to The Regent couldn't have been more stark. In short, I would not return to this Regent, and would suggest looking elsewhere if you want first class deluxe accommodations, because this hotel fails on all parts other than its great staff.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cNoisy room in a lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "runsandjumps", "ReviewID": "UR127336142", "Content": "What a grande dame this hotel is.

What a shame then that our room was so noisy. We wanted to book the standard room which at the time of booking was available but we were 'upgraded' and paid more for the deluxe room. When we saw the construction site opposite I tried to downgrade (at the same rate) but was told it wasn't available.

An added bonus was that there was no extra charge for the bed for my daughter. On checking in we were pleasantly surprised when the receptionist gave our daughter a cuddly toy. She was delighted with it and it was the start of a great stay in the Regent Hotel. On going to our room we found that all the tables, desks etc had been fitted with plastic corner protectors. This is something which I have never seen before and it certainly impressed me. To crown it all off there was even a child's bathrobe for my daughter to wear. The Regent and their staff treat their younger guests very well. The room was very spacious even with the extra bed and extremely comfortable. The bathroom was stocked with L'Occitane toiletries much to my wife's delight. The mini bar had a good selection of items but we did not use it as Singapore prices are quite prohibitive for these types of goods. We ate in the hotel on our arrival in Basilico Restaurant and it was delicious. We had an assortment of pizzas and service was prompt and efficient. Some travelers have said the hotel is dated maybe it is. However it is just the decor that is. The place is extremely clean and well maintained throughout. I would go as far as to say the hotel has a luxury feel to it. The staff are what make the hotel. Everyone we met was friendly and helpful and really made us feel welcome.

We were greeted with a nice fragnant upon entering the hotel and our 1st impression of the hotel was good. Check-in was easy and was given a room on the 11th floor, a non-smoking room. Althought I have asked for a room to be away from the lift, I did not expect to be given a room at the end of a long corridor. No big deal for the young, but not for those who have some knee problems. Rooms were big even after having put-in an additional single bed besides the King-bed. The bathroom is of average size, but clean. Honestly, I would have preferred a bathroom with showers instead of a bathtub. I love that the toiletries were from the L'Occitant range. There were plenty of towels and 2 bathrobes and 1 for the small kid. Turn-down was also provided for the night. Breakfast are served from 6:30 to 10:30, on those days when we ate at their coffee-house, the food were cold and the selection limited. For a 4-star hotel, it is really not acceptable. The most hilarious thing for me was on the 2nd day when I ordered sunny-side up eggs, the cook broked the yolks...twice!! On Christmas day, we were surprised when we returned to our room after a long day out exploring Singapore, there were 2 plates of cookies waiting for us in our room. It is really a nice touch, thank you Regent.

I didn't mind too much (as I got to shopping on the way). I did appreciate the level of concern the Regent took out for me. I also enjoyed the afternoon tea in the main floor area. I didn't mind the excessive noise, as I have a little one at home, and it provided a nice 'white noise' for me while I had tea and read. The service was exceptional too because I was able to just look up and have the waiters attention to refill the tea or request another type of sandwich.

We tried finding hotels we havent been before and we found The Regent. We took the suite and here's the overall experience: SIZE: For a singapore hotel, this hotel is big in terms of size. The lobby is very spacious and space-generous. INTERIOR: The interior is old-style, but don't get me wrong, doesn't mean its bad. It is an old hotel, but they did tremendous job on maintaining it. So even though it 'looks' old, it doesn't 'feel' old. Its very clean, and everything seems to be in place and well-placed. STAFF - SERVICE: The staffs here are super helpful. Arriving at the receptionist I was served by this young lady (she was pregnant at that time, sorry i forgot her name) and she's very helpful. The room wasn't ready when we arrive, yet my wife needs to feed our baby, so she quickly arrange a room in the fitness and spa center for us to use freely, without even telling us how long we can use it (small gesture, big appreciation). At the 2nd night we heard a loud noise coming from the room above us, some guys seems to be having party and i think they opened the balcony window so the noise spreads out well. It was around 22.00 PM and our baby was sleeping. I called to reception, told them if there's anything they can do about the noise, and the next 3 minutes later, the manager himself come to our room (a young man, sorry again i forgot his name) to check the noise himself. He apologize and said will take care of it right away (he seems pissed by the noise and i can see he works fast by the way he walks, heheh...very good). 5 minutes later, the noise is GONE. And 5 minutes after that, the manager calls again and ask if everything ok now, and said if the noise happens again, he'll ask the guest to leave the hotel and he had also placed some securities around that room to make sure the noise won't come again. It didn't :) So yeah, when it comes to service, this is one of the best among the many hotels I've been. FACILITIES: I didn't use any of their facilities like pool, etc, but the in-room of the suite are good. Looking at the size, i dont think they have a problem with other facilities. ROOM: The suite is nice. Clean, good comfy fluffy bed and pillows. One of the beds is a bit shaky and when i checked its because one of the bed-feet is broken, but it wasn't a big deal cause its not that bad. They saw us bringing a baby, so when we enter the room, a baby bathtub is already in the bathroom, a set of baby products is in the cot (we ordered a cot). We have 2 big LCDs (1 in bedroom, 1 in living room). The living room comes with TV + Home theatre set. The bottled water is provided like bottomless. They checked every morning if u need more things for the room, and since we need lots of water for the baby things, we asked a lot of bottled water, and without any problem, we got many :) LOCATION: This is the only thing that made me not giving them the rest of the 0.5 stars. The downside: It took you at least 15 mins walk down to orchard for MRT. We took taxi around so no problem bout the transport. But if you plan to take MRT, it would be quite a walk. But then again, singapore is a walking city / country. Its just not convenient when its rainy season (which was the season we were having when we stayed here) Not many restaurants around too. The Upside: Its only 15 mins walk to orchard! OVERALL: Will recommend, will stay here again. Good for family, biz, couples, solo, whatever. Thanking the staff (who might be reading this) for the service, and I apologize for not remembering those great staffs' names. Btw, I forgot to bring home my mac charger, and called their hotel the next night (I'm back at Jakarta) and they looked for it, called me, found it, kept it, and I asked my friend to take it for me, done.

We drove in on a Friday 30th Sept 2011 and checked out on Monday 3rd Oct - no problem getting complimentary parking coupons from the Concierge. Our request for a non-smoking quiet room on a higher floor was granted without fuss (1018). The room was decorated with warm colours and toiletries were \"L'Occitane\" products. This package came with an upgrade to the Deluxe room. There was a slight problem with the drainage in the tub the 2nd day but it was very efficiently dealt with when we called Housekeeping. We were very comfortable relaxing in the room which came with a study table and large screen TV, good supply of tea bags. A big bonus was the free internet service with came with the package. Bed was great for sleeping - nice big pillows. Its a good idea to give Housekeeping a call to make up the room when you go for breakfast. They attended to that efficiently. One thing that stood out for us at the Regent was the friendliness of the staff. A far cry from a 6 Star hotel down the road which is often cold and impersonal. So the smiles and pleasant service at The Regent truly made us very welcome. - The efficiency of the breakfast staff in clearing the plates on our table was very good. Staff Lin Chang stood out in this area - very sharp and quick. The breakfast spread served the best French Toast we have ever tasted (but it rotates with waffles & pancake on diff days - the french toast was served on Sat). Unfortunately our request for French Toast the next day could not be met. We wish they could have been a little more flexible in this area. The chef stationed at the bread section wasnt busy so we wished she could have been more flexible. I asked her on Sun and the friendly staff went to asked her on Mon on our behalf - flat no. Perhaps it was a different chef who prepared the French Toast on Sat. These little things make a big difference - nevertheless we do understand its a big hotel and they can choose not to grant personal requests. They served japanese rice & miso soup - but it was rather strange and didnt make sense for many of the condiments and pickles to be placed at another station near the fruits. Most of us wouldnt know there were other condiments for the rice. The Congee was fine on Sat morning but was too thick and goeey the next 2 days. The baked bacon (tad salty but tender) and honey ham were very nicely done. Enjoyed the freshly squeezed orange juice that came with the coffee. The Room package included breakfast - if it didnt, then we think $47 would have been too steep and we wouldnt have dined there every morning. The Regent created a warm and welcoming ambience for us - most refreshing compared to many other hotels here.

The new room was a king room with a king size bed (surprise! :)) and a little larger than the first one! So all in all I would rate the service outstanding.

The bathrooms were nice and the L\u2019Occitane soaps are awesome! Internet was pretty good and free for the first 3 nights.

The personal at the reception desk was very friendly and tried to resolve the issue, but unfortunately did not have other rooms available to switch us to without the construction site.

The receptionists with the marle grey suits, pink blouses with two \"pearl\" buttons greet you by name and in a few minutes you are checked-in and escorted to the large atrium with the pentagonal lift well. Look up and enjoy the the large piece of art dropping from this cavernous space. The lifts are golden bubbles of see through delight as you smoothly ascend to your floor - reminding me a of a 1990's movie scene. I was upgraded to the governor's suite. It was so large that I started laughing aloud. the bed was volumptously comfortable, the bathroom large and well stocked with deliciously soft and large towels, L'Occitaine bath products, more than ample closet space, a profusion of beiges and pastels that at first reminded me of a scene from an American movie about presidents. I felt I needed an advisor or a character from Dallas to appear with a vodka martini and big hair ala Joan Collins. The reception room had a wooden table for 6, lounge area, tv and the usual amenities amd a guest toilet. Dilma tea and a Nespresso machine - but alas no George Clooney. The rooms were comfortable, clean and spacious - so if you need to get away from the claustraphobia of shopping, or the tourist traps you will more than likely enjoy the quietness of your room. I had a lovely view and a balcony to sit and sip a Singapore sling or a G&T. Kick off your shoes and rest your travel weary feet on the soft carpet as you lounge on the setee. Staff are an asset. Genuienly friendly, curteous and not pretentious. From the doormen, luggage service, reception, breakfast areas - it was a pleasure to talk to the staff - to feel human again. Excellent and consistent service. They listened first to what you needed / requested and then delivered. Gym: smallish but adequately equippied with some trainers on hand to help you with the weights etc or for a bit of eye candy whilst you are dripping with sweat running. Water, coffee, towels etc are all provided in the gym. Pool was outdoor and more of the lounge style - not for laps but for frolickling or sitting on the deck chairs enjoying a book or the papers. Internet access is provided in the business centre - a comfortable quite spot. 3 pc's provided with a fax /printer, setee. Breakfast is more like a feast - everything is provided - from Asian style breakfasts to European style. I asked for something that was a little unusual and with no fuss or quizzical looks it was made for me. One staff member came by and chatted to me about my travels - that was a welcome break from the dreary news in the papers. In-room dinning at most places can be a torturous experience. Here it was not and the in-room dining staff were fanstatic - the food was par excellence and the service - silver service on a trolley. A waiter appeared, laid out the dinning table with precision and efficiency, and the food - I requested a particular way I wanted my meal prepared - it was prepared exactly how I requested. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal - however no George Clooney to end the meal with. Location: Not on the main drag of Orchard road but if you are in Singapore for a few days, being away from the heady racausness of Orchard Road is a bonus. Hotel is a short stroll from Orchard road. I had an early check-out - 4am and had requested a taxi the previous day. Taxi was ready and waiting for me.

When I entered my room, there was a ladder in the doorway and a hole in the ceiling. I was told that the doorbell was out of order and they were trying to fix it. The duty manager offered to change my room and asked me to wait in the room for her call. A few minutes came by and the repair man and his (I presume) supervisor came and said they were told they could work on the room until 7pm, but since I've checked into the room anyway, they will remove the ladder and I can stay. So I assumed that the duty manager had told the staff about this arrangement, and I left the room to explore the area, leaving my duffel bag in the room, a wet swimsuit on the chair to dry, and my passport in the safe. When I returned at 7pm, my bag and swimsuit were gone! I called the operator and she relayed the message from the duty manager (who couldn't be available at the time to talk to me) that they had \"told me already\" that they would change my room, and they \"tried calling but I didn't pick up\" (my phone was turned off to avoid roaming charges), and so they decided to remove my baggage and wait for me to contact them on my return. Not only did they not leave a message to let me know what had happened, they never apologised for removing my things without my permission, prior knowledge or presence. The operator said they'll have the bell boy send up the luggage asap, and after 10 minutes of waiting around (and my friend circling outside the front entrance in his car because he wasn't allowed to park and wait for me), I called the operator again and she said she had already \"pleaded\" with the bell boy to bring it to me. I thought that's what bell boys do right? They had to PLEAD with him!? I offered to get the luggage myself if it was that troublesome to transfer a piece of luggage from G/F to 4/F. The operator said it's all the duty manager's idea so I asked to see her. Anyway, the luggage arrived and shortly afterwards the duty manager came. Whilst I was trying to explain to her that it's unacceptable to have your luggage removed from your room after checking in without letting the customer's approval, she tried to speak over me and said things like \"I see your point of view, I see where you're coming from\". In my speak, that means she doesn't agree with me that the hotel staff was at fault here. No apologies, nothing, she tried to brush the whole thing away. Why couldn't they have checked if the room was ready first before letting someone in? The internal communication between the staff was non-existent. After this experience, anything else didn't matter that much, but I'll give a brief summary: so-so location (at the top of Orchard road, but far from other tourist attractions), old-fashioned building (reminds me of the ones in mainland China, faux glam and old-school renovation), reasonably appetising buffet breakfast, small pool, terrible service.

The food was good...not great...but honestly a bit overpriced as I spent $100 on my dinner there, and I was still hungry after. Good thing there's a really nice bakery downstairs at the lobby level, and a food court at the mall just next door....easily accessible by a side door and just across the walkway. I agree with other reviewers about not getting complimentary internet as most other hotels I've stayed at have it for free. But then again, S$15 for the day is not so bad really. Just one important note however. If you decide to log on to your phone as well as your laptop, this is considered separate payments even though it's on the same room account. The hotel should make this clear to their guests or else you end up paying double.....or more.... depending on the number of devices you've logged on to the same account. I explained this to the front desk and told them that I only logged on to my phone for only a few seconds and then switched to my laptop for regular use, and they happily removed the second charge from my bill on check out.

Hotel services were extremely well maintained and the service was excellent. I liked the fact that the rooms were serviced twice a day with a morning cleaning and evening turn-down services.

The gym was well-equipped and I enjoyed the round outdoor pool. The only meal I had at the hotel was breakfast. The buffet breakfast is offered in the restaurant on the second floor and it has a large variety of options. Once again, the service was excellent and the restaurant is pleasant and relaxing. The only downside was that it was quite expensive - $47 (Singapore dollars) for breakfast was hard to justify. Overall - a good hotel but I did not have a sense that I was receiving value for money.

The Regent is right next door to the Tanglin Mall which has a very nice market (grocery store) in he basement. Also in the basement is a foodcourt that serves very good inexpensive food. In this mall there are also a few spa's. My wife and I had massages at Mt. Sapola, it was more reasonable that the spa at the hotel.

A nice Regent Club perk: free same-day pressing for shirts, slacks, & suits. This came in handy to keep my clothes in good shape. The Bad: The price seemed really high at ~SGD$400/night after service charge + GST. Many of the other 5-star hotels on Orchard have rates under SGD$300. I was told the internet service provider had changed during my stay. I noticed that the connection was sluggish during the latter half of my stay.

The Ugly: I was on a business trip, so I stayed for 20 days at The Regent. The laundry bill was really expensive. A pair of socks cost $5 to launder...OUCH!

At least, the bedrooms were renovated to a more current style and was furnished with a 40\" sony bravia. The bed is large and very comfortable complete with down pillows & covers. The bathroom was quite small and dated. The location of the toilet paper was a little incovenient. but I absolutely loved the complimentary L'Occitane toiletries! It was a little strange not finding any comp toothbrush, paste, and razors. But we didn't mind as we always brought our own. Housekeeping was a pleasant and welcome surprise with a daily cleaning and turning down of our bed. We even had a fresh change of towels everyday. In the past, other hotels would limit this every other day or if you request it. The fitness center is located in the 2/F and is a wee bit tiny. Trainers are friendly and once you register, they give you a towel, earphones for the tv, and direct you to the beverage station where you can help yourself with complimentary chilled powerdrinks, coffee/tea, and a water station. Breakfast was excellent! We were courteously greeted every morning with a relaxing smile, even if the restaurant was teeming with people. Upon seating, we were given a choice of our own pot of coffee or tea and offered orange juice to start. The breakfast spread was large and had a variety of Asian & Western dishes. The cold station was located in the center serving an assortment of juices,milk, fruits in season, salads, cheese, and breakfast cereals. The bread station offered varied types of bread with different types of spreads (butter, margarine, cheeses), cold cuts, and hot pancakes/French toast and the like. The cooking stations had a daily ham carving & sausages. Eggs cooked were cooked to order in any style you want; as well, as the noodle soups were finished to order. Regular breakfast fare were 3 kinds of dimsum, daily change of breakfast potatoes, beans, breakfast sausages, miso soup, congee, daily change of delicious Peranakan dishes, etc. There were also a few regular Japanese dishes spread on the table. The dining staff was very professional and efficient--quickly clearing plates, re-setting, and always wearing a smile. They were friendly without being overly familiar. My husband and I celebrated my birthday with a wonderful lunch over at Iggy's. The 4-course lunch was superb and service was impeccable. You feel very special when dining in close quarters enough to feel a strange intimacy with those around you, yet still feel private. Despite it's fine dining service, smart casual is an acceptable attire. Next time I go back to Iggy's, I'll make sure to try their 9-course dinner. The Regent is a short walk to Orchard Road but my husband and I chose to take a taxi whenever we left the hotel. The doorman is very helpful, cheerful, and quite funny. Tips are frowned upon in Singapore and is considered an insult. If there was a time I'd generously tip hotel staff, it would be in this hotel. Guest relations and service were excellent! Concierge was very helpful providing maps, schedules of church services, and suggestions on what was the best way to go around. We were even warned of \"unusual crowds\" in certain areas, due to the National Day rehearsals. When we asked when National Day was, she beamed and politely answered that it was a whole month away.

All in all, though, a very nicely appointed room that left me and my wife satisfied, and the bed assures you a nice rest and deep sleep. We had breakfast at the Basilico Restaurant. The spread for the buffet was good and covered local and international food - with a dedicated Japanese station. Service was good (even though we waited for our tea 15 minutes!) and cordial, quality of the food superior. The hotel is atrium-style, and the views you can get from the elevator while going up are breathtaking. Also, the hotel is landscaped much more nicely that the Oriental (always in Singapore)! The gym was ok, small in size but well equipped, steam room and sauna in the locker room (an oddity: no male/female separation for the sauna). The pool is not big but nicely set, and here the service is top notch, with nice sunbeds and free water/fruit/cold towels provided. Check-in and check-out were easy and fast. Another small oddity: when I arrived with the taxi I was greeted by a door...woman! She tried (the poor girl!) to take care of my suitcase, but it was way too heavy for her to lift! :) Another small oddity. All in all though, we enjoyed our stay thoroughly and would recommend this place wholeheartedly, especially given the good rates you can easily find online. Also, location-wise the hotel is literally steps from Orchard roads and the myriad of malls you can find there, and it is also walking distance from the superb botanic gardens.

We were travelling with our two year old child and the hotel provided a cot and baby toiletries (even a robe!) all for free. Breakfast for our child was free too. The buffet breakfast is served in their Italian restaurant with Chinese, Japanese and Malay dishes as well as the standard continental and full American dishes-eggs are cooked to order. The staff were all very friendly and very accommodating - always went the extra mile to help. The only thing I would add is that if you have any requests for the concierge,it is better to pop down to the lobby in person or on your way out rather than to phone them as the phone lines always seem to be busy. The pool and shower facilities were top class. There is a kids'club every Sunday at their Italian restaurant which is very well run (with a bouncy castle and other games!) as well as a lavish afternoon tea at weekends where you can get macaroons with your name written on them! Overall, very fun for families with very young children and older kids too. The tea making facilities in the room are also a bonus if you have children. Tanglin Mall next door has lots of shops for children and families, plus a lavish supermarket and many restaurants. The Traders Hotel next door also has a great cafe restaurant which caters well to families.

I would recomend the 'Something to Go' Deli, we used this alot when we wanted an economical snack (Singapore can eat into your bank balance very quickly!) and we also treated ourselves to the afternoon tea, excellent value at $42 but allow enough time, we had only 2 hours and it was only just long enough.

You really could stay in the restaurant all day eating. It\u2019s outstanding and the service is equally as good. Rooms are also very nice and the maid service is exceptional. Whilst many hotels will service your room during the day and turn down your bed at night, what the Regent offers is two complete housekeeping services including bed turn down every day. In fact this pretty much sums up the hotel. From the lobby to the restaurants to the bathroom products and even to the elevators, the place is very opulent and almost over the top classy! I had read that the Regent is a little far away from all the \u2018action\u2019 however I actually think this is one of its positives. Anyway, In reality, it\u2019s only a 5-10 minute walk to the centre of Orchid Road or a $6 or $7 SGD taxi ride to everywhere else.

We loved everything about the hotel. The entrance and lobby is very welcoming and truly elegant. Check in was quick and the Executive Suite was great with our two small kids. We had a bedroom for the adults and a living room for the kids. Yes the room is not too modern but everything is in good quality and working perfect, no worries about that. Breakfast is excellent aswell and you can even have it outside by the pool which you wont find in so many Singapore First Class Hotels. The Pool is on the small side, but we did not want to swim a race or so in it. Its very quiet, and big enough to my point of view. The only thing i have to say is that i had a massage and it was the worst i ever had, the spa itself is already really worn out, but the old massage therapeut topped it all. I did not enjoy it a single bit. Something has to be done about that!

The tub however was quite wide and the shower located so it was possible to stand upright under it. The TV and selection of channels was below par for a 5-star hotel. We only tried roomservice once (Sunday morning at 1 am). The service was very quick and quality of food very good.

I would suggest having them arrange a car (40 sing per hour) to take you around town, we had them take us to Clark Quay for a river ride and then over to Raffles for lunch.

Bathroom was quite sufficient, but mostly spartan in terms of the bath products provided. The room is basic 90s style with old style hotel phone, but at least the room came with high speed internet and an ethernet plug for the laptop. TV channels weren't bad, but the TV was quite small.

Very international breakfast with typical eggs, pastries, and continental choices, but also dim sum/dumplings and other Asian and Indian selections. It was a huge feast., The conference facilities were actually top notch with plenty of high class and roomy meeting spaces on numerous floors. Although the hotel layout is quite awkward, the terraced layout makes for a very large feeling hotel and it seems there's lots of explore. The hotel also abounds with choices for restaurants and you can see the nice pool from the Capers restaurant dining area (maybe a little weird for swimmers). The level of service here is just okay. I was constantly interrupted by house keeping throughout the day and wish their service was a little more discreet in timing/presence. They had over 8 check-in staff at the counter, but none of them offered to show me to m room. The check-in lady also did not point out where the elevators were and assumed I had known. The bell boy was very efficient however and my suitcases came up to my room in less than 10 minutes. The conference sevice staff were very efficient and friendly.

My bags arrived shortly afterwards, and again the bellboy was genuinely keen to make sure that I could see where everything was and that I had all I needed. All staff then greeted me by name throughout my stay. (How did they know?) Quality of the room was exceptionally high and the bed extremely comfortable. It's probably ten minutes' walk from Orchard Rd proper, which you should bear in mind if you want to make use of Singapore's amazing Metro system, although there may well be buses passing by. But the short distance translates into a much quieter and restful location. Didn't make use of any facilities - bar the breakfast - as my stay in Singapore was so short. Breakfast was marred for me by a very loud tape of awful saxophone 'easy listening' music, but that's my only complaint. The hotel lobby reaches to the top floor - twelve storeys. My room was on the top floor and the walk across the bridge from the lifts was vertigo-inducing the first couple of times I crossed it. However, the first time, the front desk clerk immediately offered me a room on the lower floor. If you feel this might be a problem for you, you should request a room on a lower floor.

On entering the ice-cold room, I found that the air-conditioning was set at 0 degrees and the windows were covered in condensation. The carpet in the room was well past its use-by date, clearly evidenced by too many shampoo treatments over the years. The room was gloomy, with the exception of one orchid plant working overtime to breathe life into an otherwise soulless room. The soft furnishings were also well worn and the bathroom wasn't much better, with a shower above the bath and a low-cost shower curtain. The hand basin had, at some stage, suffered porcelain damage and had subsequently been repaired in a DIY fashion by the hotel's handyman. The Club's selection of wines was below average and, when I enquired about a sparkling wine for an aperitif, I was told this was not available. The hotel boasts about its recently refurbished Club, however I found the seating worn, crammed and uncomfortable. I was discouraged from venturing onto the deck as it had rained earlier in the day and the staff must have decided it was too much trouble to wipe down the outdoor furniture. I opted to take breakfast in the restaurant, rather than the cramped confines of the Club. I found the buffet breakfast to be mediocre and service lacking. I'm delighted that I was subjected to this hotel for just one night and what a difference 10 years has made from my last most memorable experience of The Regent Singapore.", "Date": "August 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newark, Nottinghamshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel at a great price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5350446", "Content": "We stayed in a Four Seasons Exec Suite for a one night stopover on our way to Oz. The room was great - lovely bedroom, lounge area, 2 bathrooms, 2 TVs, balcony etc. Fab toiletries too! We upgraded a couple of days before from a standard room to this one for an additional \u00a320 - so it is well worth looking for offers with the hotel directly. Position - not far from the Singapore Airlines bus route which takes you all around Singapore for next to nothing. Too far to walk to the main going out areas, but close to Botanical Gardens which we walked back from. Taxis from the more touristy areas of Singapore to this hotel are really cheap. Service - excellent! From the doorman to the reception staff to the room service guy. This really impressed me, and I'm used to 4 & 5 star international hotels. Room service options were limited late at night, but very tasty! Cleanliness - very good, no complaints here. One tip - ask for a late check-out - our deal included use of the room til 6pm on day of departure if available - very handy for tired travellers. Lobby, bar, lounge areas are all very nice; the only downside to the hotel is that it does look bland when you are on one of the higher floors, but this is really an insignificant point.

Everything from the service of the door staff to the cleaning staff was A1 ! Hubby was on a business trip for 7 days and I managed to persuade him that it would be excellent if I accompanied him! From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, nothing was too much trouble. Our flight had arrived at 6 am so we presumed that we would have to wait until midday to check-in - but no -after a short time sorting out the necessaries (which gave me a chance to admire the breathtaking lobby with its fountains and glass lifts) we were taken to our room which was absolutely beautiful! Stunning marbelled floors/bathroom - huge comfortable bed - large tv - tea/coffee - lovely furniture and the normal mini-bar ( as usual very expensive). I must admit that I was worried about 'being on my own' whilst hubby was at work - but you are as safe on your own in Singapore at 4am (should you want to party till then) as you are at 4pm. All the restaurants were excellent and breakfast featured a good choice of multi-national fayre. One little hiccup was the laundry service - most of my clothes came back 2 sizes too small! (but this might have had something to do with the amount I ate!) other than that everything about the 'Regent' was perfect! Shopping on Orchard Road is only 10 mins walk away or Taxis ( unbelievably cheap!) are readily available.

The standard of the service - from everyone we met - was superb. On arrival I picked up my case and was told jocularly by the bell captain that no-one carried their case in The Regent. After check in the baggage was whisked up to our room almost as quickly as we were. The receptionist accompanied us to the lift, something we seldom, if ever, experience outside Singapore. The room was large and was well appointed although the bathroom was quite small. I really liked the fact that all (or at least most) rooms opened onto balconies overlooking the atrium as I felt that this considerably enhanced security in addition to giving a nice aspect on leaving the room. The Concierge was extremely helpful. The pool was a reasonable size and pleasant. Here also, the standard of service was immaculate. We had room service one night. We were told the food would arrive by a specific time (only a few minutes) and it did. The bar was pleasant although expensive but I am afraid that I did not like the group who were performing. The hotel is about 8-10 minutes walk from the top end of Orchard Road which means fairly easy access to the various facilities there. It is also next door to a reasonable shopping mall with a good supermarket and ATMs. Happy hour is available in nearby bars which helps reduce the ridiculous price of beer in Singapore. My only small criticism was that I found it impossible to get really hot water late in the evening. All in all we had an excellent stay and, from our experience, we would thoroughly recommend the hotel", "Date": "January 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Regent Singapore", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d301431-Reviews-The_Regent_Singapore-Singapore.html", "Price": "$221 - $439*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1 Cuscaden Rd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">249715</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "301431", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f9/4c/f94c7d05628d9ba471378872c83d345a8large.jpg"}}
