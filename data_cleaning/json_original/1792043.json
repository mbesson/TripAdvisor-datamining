Unlike some reviewers I found the staff, including those on the front desk to be very friendly and helpful and they did offer to assist with my luggage. This hotel did have two drawbacks in my view. First, there were no drawers or shelves for clothes and I hate living out of a suitcase. Second there was no comfortable place to just sit and read.

Big mistake - what is going on in this place? When we checked in the receptionist could not work out how to swipe our credit card. The room and bathroom were very nice. We thought we would have a coffee in the room and called reception for some fresh milk and another cup (the room only had one). Eventually someone arrived with a fistful of coffeemate artificial whitener sachets, and no cup. On the second attempt we received 2 cups but no milk. What sort of hotel can't provide a jug of fresh milk? We had hot showers, found that there was no hair dryer and waited a while for one to be delivered. It's a great location for eating out and when we got back we decided to use our vouchers for compimentary cocktails in the rooftop bar. Could I have a glass of wine (at half the price) instead of a cocktail? No, as I was sternly told, the vouchers were not transferable. We had an early start the next morning and asked reception to book a taxi for 6.45am. We later confirmed with them that they knew it was am and not pm. Up early next morning, after a broken night's sleep with all the noise from the bar and its patrons, to find that the water was cold. I told the receptionist this and she just went on tapping at her computer. Furious, I asked her again why the shower water was cold. All she said was \"we apologise for the inconvenience\" and went on typing. There was no explanation and no concern about the impact on us and other guests. A man checking out at the same time confirmed that he had no hot water either. Perhaps they are saving money by not turning the water heaters on early? There was no sign of our taxi, and the receptionist had no record of a booking. One of the other receptionists got up from having a cigarette whilst sitting in the gutter at the front door, and went inside to check.

We then left and told reception that we were leaving so please attend to the room. We got back at 5.30 and the guy was still trying to get it done, so obviously even though we received apologies at the time, it was not enough to get it done without delay and minimise the inconvenience to us. When we checked out, I went to reception to ask about transit to the airport to order a cab and confirm the time needed.

We even had trouble figuring out the knobs on the showers.. I had a cold shower the next morning as te heater was not working. Okay So those are the negative. This hotel is not that bad. Excellent location plenty of bars and cafe around. The heart of Chinatown is just behind. The clean white exterior of the hotel depicts chic and trendy. The price that I paid for was worth it. So what if they got negative points. You can't always have the best of both worlds. My advice to the management, pls provide your guest more info about your hotel. :)", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "bangkok", "Title": "\u201cIt'd be nicer, if only they let me in..............\u201d", "Author": "poccoBangkok", "ReviewID": "UR89234707", "Content": "Well, I am a designer based in Bangkok, but have projects in China and Singapore as well. Every time I have a chance to visit my projects, I prefer to stay at smaller Boutique Hotels instead of Big Brand name ones. Those of my favorites include The New Majestic Hotel in Singapore, JIA Hotel, Shanghai, and The China Club, Beijing. Lately, I heard of the new hotel in Singapore, called The Club by Harry's Hospitality, so I checked it out. The hotel is pretty chic and nice. I tried it once, not bad, actually. But not this time....... This week, I have another meeting in Singapore, so I booked the Signature Room (their bigger ones) for one night at 235 SG$++. Good deal. Chic and Big room for only 235 SG$!!! I was pretty excited. I arrived Singapore at 1pm, then I went to my project to supervise the Construction first. After a long tired day, I'd like to check in at the Club. When I arrived, the Reception asked for my passport. Then she asked me how many night I'd stay this time. One night, I told her. Things seemed pretty usual up to this point, then she apologized to me, saying that there'd be no room for me tonight. What the..... Her excuse was that 4 couples of their guests got Food Poisoning. So they had to extend their stays (that means 4 rooms'd not be available). I was thinking \"Yeah, right. 8 Adults got Food Poisoning at the same time in the Clean-as-Hell Singapore?????\", but didn't say it out loud. Moody I was, so the reception asked the Assistant Manager to come out. The Assistant Manager is an energetic guy. First he bragged that he already book the next door hotel, Scarlet Hotel, for me. Even better, he got me a great deal, an Executive Room with only 215 SG&! Sounds great, right? An Executive Room with only 215 SG&! Well, it wasn't that great after I carried all my bags to the next door, and found out later than an Executive Room is the smallest room (or the second smallest), and 215SG$ is their normal Rate, not special. I could book it myself. The Food Poisoning is not my problem. I am not even sure whether it is real or they just had an overbooking situation and needed some excuse to kick me out. Why I gotta find another hotel, and why I gotta stay at the smaller room???? At almost the same price??? This is ridiculous. Well, finally to the owner of the Club, I do love your Hotel Design. But if you think you could survive with the Design alone, I wish you a good luck........", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing - if you like to go to sleep at night, don't bother staying here.\u201d", "Author": "MrsandMrsC", "ReviewID": "UR85354975", "Content": "We were so excited to be staying at this new hotel...but from start to finish it was disappointing. The card machine would not let us use our cards (we had 4 different ones between us) to pay, so we had to ring back home to get a family member to use theirs instead?!?! Not sure what happened there. The room was on the 3rd floor, it seemed lovely, very trendy, big, etc. Except the 'Club' right above our room didn't stop pumping out music until 3am. We could hear it all, from screams of laughter to high heels stomping across the floor. AWFUL. We were not warned about this before hand, so weren't very happy that we'd paid for a Signature room when a basic on the first floor would have been better. The next night was even worse, the music didn't stop till 4am - there was cigarette smoke coming through the air vents, more noise and was unbearable. We phoned reception who sent a staff member up with cotton wool balls as they didn't have any ear plugs, and pulled all the curtains around the room to try and muffle the room. It didn't help and I felt sorry for the staff member who was embarrassed and said 'I'm sorry there's nothing we can do'. They knew it was our honeymoon, but that aside, you're paying top dollar to stay somewhere and you expect to get a good nights kip - but that is not the case here. We also noticed some 'stains' on the actual bedstead. GROSS!!! We told the staff and they changed the sheets???????? We gave up complaining and spent as much time as we could out of the hotel.

I didnt like: that the tv didnt work (apparently, it isnt the hotels's problem.. it's the cable provider.. and they shrugged their shoulders. In my opinion, if all your rooms are having TV connectivity problems.. Shouldnt you at least try to rectify the issue?) I also didn't see any other guests besides myself and my partner! (Or maybe that's cause we hardly left the room?) So if you like exclusivity/spookiness, this one's for you!
