As we went for 7 days and had no accomodation booked we had no choice but to go to a hostal type place which was horrible as we booked a twin room and ended up in a form with 4 others for 3 nights. No fault of Hotel Kooyk. We then checked back in for our last 2 nights before leaving the early hours of this morning. Before going i was very worried about what i had read about rats, vermin, cleanliness etc. The hotel was very clean, there were no rats or vermin anywhere, the staff were very pleasent and helpful. Breakfast wasn't the greatest, ham,cheese,bread,toast,chocolate spread,jam,marmalade etc. But it was something to eat and the most beautiful coffee.

We then decided to go look for the shared shower, which we discovered was one shower for the whole floor (about 30 people) which consisted of a cupboard filled with bugs and a door which did not lock. Being 3 girls we were not happy about the door not locking but had no other options. The toilet which was also shared by the whole floor was also covered in urine and bugs and did not get cleaned in the whole time we stayed (although i seen nothing getting cleaned so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why I was surprised).

This hotel is awesome, for what it costs!! My husband and I, and our son and daughter in law have stayed here many times, since the 1990's!! Pierre and Mary - the owners have actually become good friends of ours, because thats what kind of people they are - they have a great sense of humor, and they make you feel right at home, they are good down to earth people. It's a beautiful Amsterdam hotel, with old world charm, I always felt like a guest at someones' home!!. The breakfasts are really nice, lots of good food, and hot coffee and everyone is always friendly, willing to help you in any way they can. Lately, they have even updated some of their rooms and some have private toilets now. We really loved the room facing the courtyard, because we could go out late at night, and have a really good afternoon nap the next day, as it's so quiet, you wouldn't even know it's in a city!! On the other side of the hotel, you have a beautiful view of the canal. We always found everything clean, and maybe it is old, but that's part of the charm of this place. The city of Amsterdam is old - it's been around for a long time - why stay at a hotel that feels like it could be any city on earth?? The toilets and showers are shared, but it is a budget hotel, not everyone wants to spend a few hundred euros a night , for a place to sleep, I sure don't. There is so much to do in Amsterdam, why would you want to spend your days in your room , anyway?? We had inquired at the American Hotel, which is right around the corner , the cost of their rooms, and it was at the time, about 6 times as much as the Kooyk a night - it may be more, now, I don't know!! It's in a great location and you can walk just a short ways to the tram and get anywhere you want. Surrounded by beautiful parks, flowers and grass, and the canal, that's what I remember.

It was not hard to find at all. Its location is fantastic, especially for the price. When we arrived we were slightly scared by the door, we couldn't open it (you need the card to your room) and waited around for about 10 minutes until someone came to the door. When we were greeted by a lovely Dutch guy we were no longer worried! The reception area is clean and full of vouchers which as we were on a cheap visit was amazing! We were allocated our room which was on the first floor - with the view of the canal! I sent the hotel an email before hand explaining that it was my boyfriends 21st birthday so we got a very nice upgraded room free of charge! This shows just how kind the owners are to this place. The room was really spacious with a small sink and tele in there and they even supplied towels ... did not expect this! The shared shower was a bit of a pain as there was no room to get changed at all, it was a case of dashing back to the room in your towel but the showers are pretty close to all rooms, ours was the furthest away and it still only took, what, 5 seconds to head back to the room?! The breakfast in the morning was simple but my boyfriend loved it! I unfortunately can't eat wheat so i couldn't enjoy any toast or sandwiches and don't like egg but the unlimited fruit juice was nice! Maybe a suggestion of yogurts or fresh fruit would be good for people like me?! Overall, this hotel was absolutely brilliant for the money i paid for it. The location is fab and at the end of the day ... who stays in the hotel room for long anyway when you've gone to visit a city?!

We paid 70 euros per night over a weekend in December. I wish we had stumped up an extra 20 euros as we would have got a lot more for our money. NONE of the rooms have their own toilet or shower. All rooms are shared bathrooms. We stayed on the ground floor and had to share a very small toilet (think of a closet) and shower with approximately 7 other people. When booking this wasn't mentioned so be careful. Come 7:30am all hell breaks loose. Pipes banging, toilets trying* to flush, tables moving, people stomping it was very hard to sleep after that. Definitely not a place for light sleepers. *The worst thing about the shared toilet was the length of time it took to refill the tank, we are talking at least 5 mins, so don't even consider a mercy flush or you will have a huge queue outside the door. The best part of my stay was some poor dutch girl coming down to reception in her PJ's and slippers, stating to the hotel guy \"there is a small something in my room\" while holding her fingers 7 - 9 inches apart. Either someone left an item from the Red Light District in the room, or the rodent mentioned in some previous reviews has returned, I suspect the latter. Can't comment on the breakfast, didn't have any. All in all for the money this place is pretty bad. I would not stay there again or tell a friend to.

Ultimately, I would have to say that I got exactly what I was looking for. There is no doubt that this hotel is very basic. The steep stairs (very steep!) make access difficult, especially with luggage, but were not a particular problem for me. The room was just about ok. Small and cramped, and the posituioning of the sink and furniture could have used a bit more thought. But the room was clean enough (no problems with bugs etc, or dampness, unlike some other reviewers). The hotel was fairly quiet (though I suspect that this is partly luck of the draw, but I also suspect it does not attract the rowdy boozer types). I had no problems sleeping. The bed wasn't the most comfortable, but was ok. Biggest problem with the room was that the door kept sticking, so that there was no way for me to go in or out of my room quietly, and I was constantly concerned about not being able to open the door at all! The shared facilities were equally basic. The toilets on each floor all seemed to have something missing - either soap for the sink, or towel, or spare toilet rolls. Breakfast was very good for a hotel of this quality. Boiled eggs, toast, cheese, meats, tea, coffee, all replensished frequently. Internet access was available, nominally for a fee, though I used it a number of times, and was not always charged. The best thing about this hotel would have to be the staff. All of them were very friendly and helpful. I was stuck there for several days more than intended due to the volcano, and found the manager in particular very helpful and reassuring in that time. The location is fine. Easily reached from Centraal station by trams 1, 2 or 5. Plenty of shops, bars and restaurants in the area, and not too far to walk to the centre, if you choose not to take the tram. Also just a few minutes walk from the Vondelpark, which was very pleasant for a morning walk after breakfast, followed by a cup of tea at the lakeside cafe in the centre of the park while watching the herons.

I was pleasantly suprised though. We arrived a bit later than expected, and were greeted by a very friendly man who checked us in quickly and gave us our key.

The toilet was small, but how big do you need it to be really?

(Beds must have been really uncomfortable for us to lie in that late huh?) This was my fourth stay at the Leidseplein, and most hotels seem to be much of a muchness.

Thankfully, some irritated customers probably demanded it to be fixed and it was the next day. Then, 2nd day, the toilet flushing line was broken, yes, again, so i had to climb onto the toilet seat to flush the toilet. Nevermind tht. It was miriculously fixed with a rope the next day, hurrah! no need to climb onto toilet seats again. And we had to leave pretty early last day, so we couldn't get our breakfast ready by then. FIne, it was a fault on my part for overlooking that when booking the flight tickets. I tried to explain and asked the dinner lady (the same angry lady at the reception) in a very nice manner, whether she could maybe prepare a sandwich for us before we left in the morning. She reprimanded me and was RUDE becoz it was my fault, (as if i didn't know). Nevermind that, at least i tried to get my money's worth, since i DID pay for the breakfast. She promised half heartedly to prepare it, and then on the day itself, she just did not bother. Nevermind tht. Since amsterdam was a really nice place for a relaxing trip.. we weren't fussed about it, until we saw this website and realised tht we weren't the only ones who were not satisfied with the service at this budget hotel. Hmm, 72 euros per nite per room. Price isn't worth it. I personally wouldn't go back there again. maybe i will, if they change to NICER staff who don't make you uncomfortable and UNwelcomed.", "Date": "July 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Point Arena, CA", "Title": "\u201cQuirky and cozy\u201d", "Author": "caitlinette", "ReviewID": "UR4957439", "Content": "I haven't read the other reviews of this hotel yet, but I've seen some of the opening lines -- rude owner, icy shower, etc. The owner, Pierre, was absolutely friendly to us.

Our room was nice and big, with a seating area as well as sleeping areas, plenty of storage and a sink with hot and cold water. The plug sockets were a bit wobbly though, but after a bit of wiggling we were able to use them. We had clean towels to use and the room got cleaned/beds made and the towels replaced each day. The beds were comfortable too. We had a great view of the canal and the toilet was just across the corridor, and another one just down the corridor, although these were small they were clean and had plenty of toilet paper all the time. The showers were ok, and although I never had a hot one, some of the others did - I guess it just depended on which one you went in. The staff were friendly and spoke good english although found it a bit difficult to split our bill - and there is a surcharge for paying by card, so it would be easier to pay all as one group. She also came to our room later to claim the 90 cents that she had left off the bill!! Note also that there is a 10 Euro deposit you have to pay for your key which you get back at the end of your stay. We were able to leave our bags there after checkout (in one of the corridors) until we wanted to pick them up.

However, upon reading some of the reviews from this website that described the Owner's overly tempermental reactions to apparently justifiable complaints (reviews from Nov. 9 2004, especially Oct. 25 2004, and March 4 2003) I decided that I did not want to try my luck with such a hotelier, and booked the same 6 nights for 20 euros less with Hotel Abba instead, whose numerous positive reviews on this website tipped the balance of chance in favour of a better overall experience. (Someone needs to tell this guy that he's being reviewed and it's not all good!) I have been to Amsterdam many times. Travellers from the States (I'm American by the way, living in the UK) should understand that in general, these budget hotels are situated in very old (hundreds of years in many cases) buildings and that the general architecture of these row houses is vertical (very vertigo staircases) with extremely small (by modern standards) rooms! They do what they can with what they've got. So please don't have culture shock in this regard. If you're coming to Old World Europe, there's bound to be Old World character! However, rudeness by current Owners, saggy beds, and general uncleanliness is avoidable, and I choose to avoid these types of confrontations. I'm sure the breakfast is lovely, but if something goes wrong, I wouldn't want to have to approach an indignant and tempermental Owner, no matter how little I'm paying for the room!

We were also told that there was a 5% surcharge for using a credit card--information not revealed when making the initial reservation. Room: The room was spartan and dingy, with a strong odor of cleanser attempting to cover the pervasive smell of mildew. The sink didn't drain properly, and the other bathroom facilities did not fare much better. Although the room seemed superficially clean, I remained unconvinced that it was actually clean. Security was also somewhat sketchy. Experience: Our room was very noisy, despite the hotel's location on a quiet canal. Other guests caused disruptions throughout the night, which were not addressed by the absent hotel staff. We avoided our hotel as much as possible, and would have moved to another hotel if it wouldn't have involved forfeiting the entire \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70 price. Just not worth the hassle and pain.

We managed to book a nice italian restaurant in advance for the fri night called 'Fantasia Pizzeria' REALLY close to the hotel. The rooms were ok, but what can you expect from a budget hotel?!!! We had clean sheets, hot and cold water in rooms and they provided us with towels. Fortunatly we did not discover any bed bugs ear wigs or other insects of that sort as written in previous reviews! However we were shocked on arrival to find a mouse trapped in a bin in the corridor, but that was the ONLY one we saw. The toilets were all in working order and the showers were fine.
