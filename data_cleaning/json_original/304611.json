For this 4D3N stay, we went for our first choice since a long time ago, i.e. the Royal Plaza on Scotts. We left KL rather late (lunchtime) and only reached Singapore at 1700 hrs. After leaving the luggage with the bellboy and parking the car in the adjacent garage, we did our check-in at the reception. Unfortunately, the two rooms we booked were not ready at the time and the male receptionist recommended us to proceed to one of the nearby cafes for a drink while waiting. He also told me that he would send a text once the rooms were ready. Eventually, after sitting down for a cuppa at McCafe, just next door, we headed for our two rooms at 1750 hrs, both of which were adjacent to each other on a rather low Level 4 (no connecting door though). The room my wife and I stayed in (no. 404) was quite nicely done up, with a queen-sized bed as well as LCD TV stuck on the wall. Next to the window + single-seater sofa was an elongated table, which can double up as both a workstation as well as dressing table. There was also a cupboard (not built-in, btw) where the hangers as well as iron, kettle + tea, and safe box were kept. The toilet was spacious enough but unlike the bigger Premier and Club Rooms, there was no attached bathtub and only a shower was provided (with a combo rain + hand shower). Also, we should not forget the hotel's famous minibar, where everything is free (hotel-branded mineral water, one packet of Oreo biscuits, two cans each of Coca-Cola and Tiger beer, and a Minute Maid orange juice) and refilled daily! No other hotel offers such a convenient feature, whether it is a budget or 5-star type, throughout my various holidays in Malaysia, Singapore, and overseas. And as expected the view is a disappointment, since we were only on Level 4 of a 15-floor building, and faced the rear of the Pacific Plaza next door. Interestingly, the RP's room was the first one which has no coffee packets bundled together with the kettle. Instead, this was made available by a Nespresso machine, which was the first time I've seen in a room. I had to ensure there is sufficient water and after placing a capsule (three variants are available, including espresso), I just needed to press a button and voila, the coffee is churned out automatically! Such a convenient feature, which renders boiling of hot water for making coffee no longer necessary but to make tea (there is Japanese green tea and the usual English one), we still have to boil water in the kettle, like usual. Unlike my previous stay in another hotel in Singapore last November, the RP is very generous with its Internet access. There is no charge to access the Web in our room and I could either use WiFi or connect a broadband cable to the notebook. What makes things better is when I went for a swim and took the iPod touch along, there was also some Internet connection at the poolside, which is such a great convenience to check Twitter or online news, on-the-go! Speaking of the pool, since it's located on Level 5 and atop the podium block housing the DFS store, it was a small-looking square type and adjacent to a 24-hour gym and the Balmoral meeting room. However, once in the water, the pool is actually bigger than expected and doing a 30-lap swim can take around 15-20 minutes, which is quite sufficient for a morning workout. We have also heard loads of good reviews about the buffet offered at the RP's Carousel Restaurant and there were four sessions daily (Breakfast, Lunch, Hi-Tea, Dinner). Unfortunately, we were not able to sample the offerings there due to lack of time and furthermore, our rooms do not come with breakfast (we went for the promo price for Malaysian travelers). This is something for me to seriously look at, during a future return trip to Singapore! However, what made us go for the RP is its excellent location and super-affordable price, a combo not found anywhere in Singapore! For a price of SGD168 net per night, we are able to stay right in the middle of the Orchard Road shopping precinct and to get anywhere else, there is also the MRT at the RP's doorstep, although we drove down to SG from Malaysia. In addition to the popular nearby malls like ION Orchard, Ngee Ann City, Tangs Plaza, and Paragon, the famous Isetan was just next door and the store was having a sale period during our stay, what perfect timing! As for food, in addition to the cafes next door (Starbucks, McD's + McCafe), there was a myriad of sit-down options as well, including the Food Opera in ION Orchard as well as Wisma Atria's Food Republic and various restaurants in Ngee Ann. In conclusion, the RP is indeed one of the better hotels in town and with a very affordable price, coupled with a superb location in Orchard precinct, we will surely be making it our preferred accommodation option for any trip to Singapore!", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Great Place...\u201d", "Author": "yuszry", "ReviewID": "UR126022160", "Content": "Been staying here since I was a small boy and that was about 18 years ago and it never disappoint me.

(as this being a non smoking hotel the balcony is great for those of us that do not wish to stand next to Starbucks to smoke). The big disappointment was at checking out I waited for about 15 minutes to sort out payment ,the receptionist said all was payed and have a safe trip home. HOWEVER I received an email 3 days later saying as I didn't check out at reception (when I did) they have had to charge my card for a certain amount that was higher than what was originally quoted. They charged my card before my acceptance (not very professional ) . I feel kinda cheated as this was part of our honeymoon , and we only get married once. I can't recommend this hotel ,and am disapointed that I do not wish to stay there again, as the location is just fab.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montgomery, AL", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location\u201d", "Author": "Christopher D", "ReviewID": "UR125810543", "Content": "While a little pricey, the hotel was well worth it.

Decided to splurge on a club room and again it was a good decision, saved us a lot of time and money. Guests staying on the club floors have access to lounge with breakfast, snacks and drinks (including alcohol beverages) included in the rate. The afternoon snacks and drinks are served between 5 and 7pm and turned out to be really impressive and delicious, a lot of them gourmet-style, with veggie options, desserts and a new set of dishes every day - we were really impressed, probably the best \u201cclub\u201d deal we\u2019ve ever tried in a hotel. Initially we thought we wouldn\u2019t visit the lounge too often as at 5-7pm we would be normally still out sightseeing, however with the heat/ weather conditions in Singapore, the timings were actually perfect for a bit of rest & snack/light dinner. We love eating out in the evenings when on holiday, but we enjoyed the club food so much that we didn\u2019t need big dinners afterwards - saved us a fortune! All in all would highly recommend the club level when booking. The room we had may look a bit plain and small on photos, but it\u2019s actually very comfortable and has all you need, the pics simply don\u2019t do it justice. The free water & drinks in the mini-bar and free internet in the room also adds a lot of value for the travellers. The location of the hotel is great and would recommend to stay in the area if this is your first time in Singapore and don\u2019t know where to stay. It is in the middle of the shopping district, but it\u2019s great for sightseeing too as metro/subway is just round the corner (2 mins) and will take you everywhere in the city and to the outskirts. We only took taxi to get to the Zoo to save the time -it cost us approx. 20S$ and used the bus to get to the Botanic Gardens (few bus stops from the hotel), other than that it was the subway all the way, very quick and convenient. The staff at the hotel are very professional yet friendly and helpful, a real asset to the hotel! They even got us a little gift (cute lollipops) when they heard it\u2019s our honeymoon. Also the buffet breakfast served at the hotel was really nice with great options and loads of space for everybody (they even have a separate Indian food counter!). I would recommend the downstairs restaurant over the club lounge for breakfast actually, as the choice in the club was limited, especially for vegetarians. The staff got me some veggie food from downstairs in no time which was fantastic and again a superb service, but after that we just preferred to eat downstairs. So my only suggestion to the hotel management would be provide more options, including veggie ones, to the club lounge breakfast menu. All in all we had a fantastic stay in Royal Plaza on Scotts, wouldn\u2019t hesitate for a minute to book them again when in the amazing Singapore!

The concierge/porters were very efficient and promptly took my luggage out of the taxi's boot upon arrival. Upon check-in, I was informed that I was upgraded, which was a pleasant surprise! The rooms have been refurbished since my last stay. My room was comfortable and clean. The neutral tones used to furnish the room were very soothing and the work space and lighting were excellent! I also loved that the hotel gives you a choice of pillows! The free WiFi was a huge benefit for me as I needed to connect and email during my stay. Many of the Singapore hotels still charge a (sometimes hefty) fee for an internet connection. The hotel also offers free local calls. The free minibar was also a plus and the Nespresso machine was a great bonus when I needed an afternoon caffeine hit!

It was so spacious, beautifully decorated and luxurious -with every amenity and comfort imaginable and more -that it really took upmarket hotel accommodation to a whole new unprecedented level. The bathroom had a lovely shower and a seperate bath and was nice and spacious with a glass window (with a blind you could pull down) seperating it from the main room. Everything about this room was just totally breathtaking and stunning and it totally exceeded my expectations, even given the fact that I already knew the very high standards that this hotel delivered. I have stayed in some amazingly beautiful hotel rooms both before and since but this one is really up there with the very best and possibly even takes the cake in terms of ambience, comfort, enjoyment and luxury. The complimentary wi-fi and the free mini-bar was another thing I cherished during my stay here. It was a privilege to stay in that room and an experience that left me with many fond memories that I continue to cherish until this day The staff were as warm, friendly, hospitable and professional and helpful to a fault as they were on my last visit. More than a few remembered me from last time and were very welcoming and friendly on my return visit, almost in the same way they would greet a long lost friend. Those whom I didn't know also treated me like a friend and took a personal interest in my well-being. I think the staff here are some of the best I've ever encountered in my lifetime I had already dined at the Carousel so I knew it was a great restaurant but I took high tea there and was again absolutely blown away by the variety of savory and sweet treats they had on offer. I think this would have to be one of the most comprehensive buffets I have ever seen anywhere in the world and it was all delicious. Having a Starbucks just outside that seems to be open all hours a day -I once got a drink past midnight -also helps!! The only slight downside was the door staff seemed a bit slow in getting me a taxi on my final exit from the hotel to go to the airport and this probably made me a bit later than I would have been for my flight (although I was running late anyway). But even this was an exception to the rule -all the other times I have very impressed by the speed and efficiency of the door staff in booking a taxi and instructing them where to go and the service has been second to none. And in all fairness, I do wonder whether the mishap on my final departure from this hotel was their fault. I am inclined to suspect that it may have been some problem with the taxi service since it had never happened before I immensely enjoyed my second time in this hotel -it was an absolute pleasure and privilege to stay here and the rooms, the staff and the whole hotel itself is really second to none. I didn't think it could exceed the enjoyment and pleasure of my first visit here but it did. I always hate leaving this place and am profoundly sad when I do and can't wait to return.

We thought it would be a nice way to end our trip, particularly in light of the positive reviews received by this hotel in the past. We arrived slightly after noon on New Year's Day and found ourselves in a lobby more chaotic than the Chinatown market. Every desk at reception (more than 5) was several people deep. We waited in line for about 20-30 minutes and was told our room was not ready yet but that they would be happy to call us when it was available, sometime after 2pm. As the hotel's check-in time is 2pm, this was not an issue for us, so we left our bags and took advantage of the hotel's great location near Orchard Road to find some good places to eat and shop. We never received a call telling us that our room was ready, but headed back to the hotel after 2pm. We waited in line again for 20-30 minutes. When we reached someone at Reception, we were told our room was ready and made our way there. Despite my request for two twin beds, we found ourselves in a room with a double bed instead. I tried calling reception and could not get through -- no one even answered the phone the three times I called. The bellman suggested we go down to the lobby and talk in person to someone at the Reception desk as it was very busy. We went downstairs and waited in line again for another 20-30 minutes. We were informed that our request for 2 twin beds was a request only and was subject to availability. Therefore, the hotel was not required to provide us with two beds. As much as I love my friend, after more than 3 weeks of traveling together, I was not in the mood for some extra closeness. We pushed back a bit and were told that they could make a 2-bed room available for us, but not for at least another 2 hours. Even though it was past check-in time, that was all they could do, but they would be happy to send a text when the room was available. I then asked if we could have extended check out to enjoy our stay a bit longer the following day, as our plans to relax around the hotel were clearly not going to be realized if we were forced to check in to our hotel room hours after check in time. We were told no, as they were very busy, we had to be sure to be out of the room before noon. I thought it was very inconsiderate of them to not have our room ready for our arrival but insist that we leave them enough time to make it ready for the guests who arrived after our departure. We came back to the hotel again around 4:30pm (we had still not received a text or phone call letting us know that our room was ready but were done with shopping at this point), waitied in line again for about 30 minutes, and was told our room was indeed ready. We went to the room only to find ourselves in another room with only one bed. After notifying the hotel staff of this, we were informed that the double bed could be separated into 2 twin beds. I'm not sure why they didn't do this for our first room, but at least it was better than switching rooms again. We waited for housekeeping to arrive and called the concierge to make reservations that evening for the night safari. There was no answer the first time we called. The second time we called, we got through to someone and thought we had made our reservations. No information was provided volunarily by the concierge; useful information such as when to meet our tour, where to meet our tour, etc., was only provided after I asked the relevant questions. Once our bed situation was resolved, we decided to go sit by the pool. It's not a very exciting pool but it is perfectly acceptable. We returned to the room in time to prepare for our evening tour and headed to the lobby to meet the bus. When we arrived in the lobby and informed the concierge that we were ready, he told us that he had not booked our tour because it was full. We had no message in our room and were not told that there had been any problem booking our tour until we thought the tour was going to depart. Normally, you would think we would be out of luck. But after asking many questions, we discovered we did not need to do the night safari via the tour and could instead travel there ourselves via taxi for less than it cost for us to take the tour. I really wish the concierge had volunteered this information; it would have been a proactive and service-oriented way to mitigate our disappointment in not getting on the tour we thought we would be taking. The rest of our stay went without further incident, except that the lines were again very long for check-out. When I asked about express check-out, I was told that this would not be possible unless I had completed a form for it during check in. Why didn't they offer the form during check in then? It was, needless to say, all a bit frustrating. The hotel is in a great location and the shower was great. And maybe the service at the hotel would be ok if they had not been so busy during the holiday. But the service we received was terribly disappointing, and I doubt I would ever stay here again, particularly given the cost of the accommodations.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value and Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "Jimmy69Brisbane", "ReviewID": "UR122507752", "Content": "I have just spent two nights at the Royal Plaza on Scotts here in Singapore.

Its obvious that the hotel has invested in some staff development course for its employes in key positions. The staff are young, eager to please and if management does the right thing by identifying and retaining the services of these individuals, in time, they would rival the quality of service offered by the likes of Ritz Carlton, St Regis and the Shangri-la. Little areas such as sweeping the supposed cobwebs off the ceiling or dry mopping the floor at the foyer area should perhaps be done at a time when guest traffic is at a minimum. if they do have to proceed, then perhaps they could be more mindful of guest who happen to be passing by.

The Royal plaza although a bit expensive (around \u00a3162/night) was totally worth the money as the location made it possible for us to visit most places without hassle. The room was kept clean and the fridge was stocked everyday by housekeeping which was awesome as it was very hot while we were there and being able to get some cool water was absolutely wonderful. The hotel is close to the ION and there is tons of shopping options thanks for being so close to Orchard Road (Singapore's retail and entertainment hub) The Far East plaza is right across the road and had cheap eats and some shopping options. There is a Starbucks right outside the hotel and a patisserie and noodle/fast food restaurant opposite Starbucks the building next to the hotel also houses a Supermarket in the basement which can be very useful sometimes. If you really want to try the local flare (food) the Newton Hawker Center (really famous) is only a ten minute walk from the hotel (walk on Scotts street away from Orchard Road). My husband truly enjoyed all the food there and one of the stall owners was really nice to amend a dish which is cooked with egg to omit it so that I too could enjoy the food. The entire meal for the two of us with drinks came to about \u00a35. Getting to the Singapore Zoo from the hotel is a breeze. The Singapore Attractions Express has a stop on Scotts Road. The hotel staff is more than happy to direct you in this matter. Also if not interested in taking a bus, taxis seem to be another great alternative as the fares are not high and (from what we experienced) the drivers friendly. The only complaint I have in this respect is that since you cannot hail a taxi as you would in New York or London most hotel taxi stands are crowded during rush hours and late night and you may have to wait to get a taxi. Also another great way to get around Singapore is the MRT (subway) and the Orchard Road station is right at your door step. Be advised the station can get crowded although the trains were not. It is very easy to get to all the tourist destinations with very few changes and a great way to see Singapore. The hotel also has a decent gym and a pool. Nothing to write home about but does the job. The only place I would advise people to stay away from when it comes to the hotel is the Heat UltraLounge (a lounge in the hotel). Although ver chic it left a lot to be desired specially with the price tag. We ordered Nachos and I kid you not when we got them there were a total of 8 chips on the plate. The plate in front of me looked exactly like the picture on their ultra chic iPad menu. I was a little shocked to say the least but hey it wasn't like I was lied to so I quietly paid the bill.

Another flat screen TV is provided. Plenty of wardrobe space, iron/board and safe in convenient location. Soft bathrobes available. The bathroom is well-appointed with separate shower and CHOPARD amenities. One is encouraged to re-use towels and the entire hotel is non-smoking, a great GREEN effort. With the suite comes the use of the CLUB floor(15th), a well-layed-out facility with great and attentive staff. The food and beverage offer, such as breakfast and evening cocktails is superb in variety and taste/presentation. The view over the American Club and Tanglin Club is very pleasing. The all-day-dining restaurant has a very large offer on international dishes, presented fresh and cooked in front the guests. The latest offering a a section with MOLECULAR food items, which were really tasty and creative.Again, the staff are outstanding and eager to serve and please. As it is Christmas season, the Lobby decor is again something very special and creative as it depicts a toy fair theme with moving parts, going away from the traditional Christmas tree(which are present at other places in this hotel though).

However that said, the lobby was pleasant and we were met by a staff member and directed to reception. We had booked a club room so was then taken to the designated checkin which was handled very efficiently. The first room they gave us was overlooking the car park, but changed without fuss to one with a better outlook. The room was pleasant and the bathroom rather nice I thought. We loved the club lounge with afternoon tea and evening drinks. The lounge food was very good and replenished frequently, with drink service being very efficient as well. The atmosphere in the lounge was very very nice and the staff there particularly pleasant. If you can afford it, I would recommend upgrading to the Club level as it was certainly worth the extra. We did not have breakfast in the lounge as people had said the selection was better downstairs in the general restaurant and we found it to be excellent. The seafood buffet is also great and has won awards. The key thing with this hotel is the friendly, efficient staff, good breakfast and a very convenient location.

(My stay has not ended yet! Currently typing out this review on the sofa in the hotel room.) Firstly, driving into the driveway to get to the carpark was a headache! A few tour buses were waiting for the tourists, which was perfectly fine. But a JB car was parked in the only lane left, with the hazard light switched on. A line of 8 -9 cars were formed just because of this car. Not only did the hotel staff not advice the driver to shift his car, the hotel staff simply walked away even after seeing the jam it has caused. After waiting for 20 mins, the tour buses drove off, then we could finally make our way to the car park. Next, Check-in was fast and the concierge was nice enough to upgrade us to a Club room as it was our anniversary. :) After a rest, we went down to purchase a cake for our friend's birthday party in the evening. Walked into Carousel (cafe) and was mesmerized by their wide selection of exquisite cakes. We decided on a salted caramel with toffee cake (looked superb and yummy) and informed the cafe staff that we would like to purchase it. Upon knowing we are hotel guests, she asked us for our room number and told us to collect it later when we are going out in the evening. We thought that was a great gesture as we need not place the cake in our room or fear that it will melt before the party. However, when we went down in the evening to pick up the cake for the party, the lady told us the cake we chose was sold. We asked if she had kept the cake aside knowing that we wanted it, she simply walked away to talk to another colleague. Then that colleague came over and said:\" What's done is done. Your cake is not available. You can choose from the remaining cakes (only 4 left, as compared to the previous 12).\" Without even apologising, the lady went to attend to other guests. Such great service!!!!!!! The next morning, we went down to the cafe for our buffet breakfast. It was rather crowded. Had to wait for about 15 mins, amidst a crowd asking for the price of the buffet and etc., we were taken to our seats. The waiter asked us for our preference of hot drinks and we ordered tea. After which, he laid out the napkins (to indicate the seat was taken), and we went to the buffet line. After getting some omelette and lovely sausages, we came back and realised our seats were taken. Walked over to the hotel staff to inform him that our seats were taken. He (looked super tired at 9.30 in the morning) looked into the air and walked away. Repeated the question a few times, and he still did not seem to respond. Another staff came over and got us a new seat. Apparently, the \"sleepy, blur, tired\" staff had gave our seats away. We looked at the japanese ladies seated at our seats, and I guess they must be wondering why they had tea even before they ordered and napkins all unfolded. GREAT service once again!!!!!!!!! Customer service is very important in the hotel industry!

The bathroom sink would not hold water properly, continuously leaking into the drain, making it hard to shave.

There is only the \"Ultra Lounge\" which has a loud, annoying music combo in there most of the time and a few drunken tourists or the \"Club Lounge\" which was expensive and only opens occasionally.

The beds are comfortable and the maid service is thorough and effective, so the rooms are clean and sheets fresh. The rooms are a decent size, the internet connection is reliable and fast, the decor is a bit bland but not offensive. Finally make sure you book through a \"deal site\", via Tripadvisor/Expedia or some other site as the hotels own website just charges full price and there are free upgrades and discount available via the portals.

Originally got a room on the 15th floor but moved to a room on the 13th floor, as there was a deep humming noise that really bothered me (but not my husband). The very nice guy at the reception who helped us told me that they do get complaints occasionally, since the 15th floor is the top floor and all the air vents/conditioner etc are on the roof, that's where the humming sound originates from. Anyway after we moved I slept really well, the bed was super-comfortable. The room was a bit smallish--32m2 isn't that small but they have huge and rather awkwardly-placed furniture that make the room feel smaller than it is. As others have written the breakfast buffet is excellent (though not much vegetables, except for salad greens) though I thought the service was better during the week (on Sat morning we didn't get served coffee). The Club facility was also good, they let us hang out in the lounge after check-out (waiting for our evening flight) which we benefitted from. The location of the hotel is great--close to all the shops on Orchard. One thing I didn't like was that they made us give a \"deposit\" of the full payment of the rooms + 50 $ per night, right at check-in. This is because we didn't have a credit card (only debit card) and we were paying in cash. This was a major inconvenience and I'd never had to pay so much \"deposit\"!!! I am not sure if I would stay at this hotel again on my next trip to Singapore--this hotel like other hotels in the area are terribly overpriced!

The room reservation was also kind enough to grant me an upgrade due to my iPrefer membership. The 2 Executive Suites I had were well maintained, very clean, and very roomy at 64 square metre, although some of the furniture looked worn out. A long couch big enough for an adult to sleep on in the living room was a luxurious touch. The bed was super comfy too! And mini bar was free - the issue with this i will address later. There's also complimentary wifi in the rooms, and I was given a complimentary fruit platter plus some chocolates, nice! There is also the cute nespresso machine in the suite which came in handy. Breakfast at Carousel was excellent in terms of quality and quantity, eat here! The C;ub Lounge on the 15th floor serves TWG teas and machine coffee but you get complimentary high tea from 3-5pm - British high tea but refillable. Come 5:30pm - 8pm you get alcoholic drinks plus a small variety of tapas-like bites. Quality was just alright for me. Didnt try the pool but popped by to have a look - it was rather empty although on a weekend and also small-ish in size. The following are issues to me though: Rude attitude at lobby area \u2013 one of my guests was waiting for me at the lobby couch when he was approached by a staff member who asked me if he was a hotel guest. When he replied he was waiting from some friends to check in together, he was told he was not allowed to wait there if he is not a guest. I think he didn\u2019t quite get the idea that my friend was not a guest YET but GOING to be one. When asked why, the staff member said they encounter some members of the public sleeping at the couches but my friend was obviously not sleeping at that time. I suspect the staff member realized at some point thereafter and came back to apologize to my friend but I feel it should not have happened in the first place, as it would have been a rude shock to anyone. In any case, it didn\u2019t seem logical in the first place that members of the public were not allowed to be at the lobby. L'Occitane toiletries / housekeeping issues \u2013 when I was granted the upgrade, I was given a list of entitlement for Suite guests which included my favorite - L'Occitane toiletries. But when I saw there were only the hotel\u2019s in-house toiletries in both rooms, I made a call to housekeeping to ask and was told some checks would be made. Half an hour later I was still waiting in the room and decided to call again and this time spoke to a different person who told me the same thing, that checks would be made. 10mins later, my doorbell rang and a lady from the housekeeping brought up this pack of Chopard toiletries and asked if this was what I was asking for. I said no and showed her the print-out of the email \u2013 she said the hotel does not have such brands. I was planning to visit the Club Lounge after that and brought up the toiletries to see if anyone can help. The staff at the lounge said that all suites are given the Chopard toiletries now and the hotel doesn\u2019t hold the brand, but said he will check for me and someone will call me back at my room. About half an hour later, the housekeeping brought me the packs of L'Occitane toiletries. I find it very odd that what the hotel apparently did not have could magically appear after making some calls. I am really fine with having house-brand toiletries, but if it is stated that that is one of the perks of the suites then I look forward to the extra treat. If the hotel cannot commit to having that particular brand of toiletries available, then it is better not to state the brand and just say \u2018luxury toiletries\u2019. Otherwise the above incident will make me wonder if hotel is trying to hold on to the toiletries for some reason and not provide unless the guests repeatedly asks for it. The ipod dock was also missing in my room but I did not ask about that since I had no use for it. But again, for someone who was expecting it, it would have been a disappointment. Bottled water \u2013 I called to ask for 4 more bottled water (on top of whatever is in the mini bar) for my room as I get thirsty quite often. Shortly, a staff brought me the 4 bottles and told me it would be chargeable at $5 per bottle, and I thought he was kidding from the way he said it. I later called the housekeeping only to be told that yes, it is indeed $5 per bottle. I know the min-bar is free and I would understand if the hotel wants to charge for any additional soft drinks etc but I have never heard of anyone charging $5 per bottle, it is ridiculous. And why was it that I was not told when I requested for it? Plus there is no signage in the room anywhere to inform guests about it. Ultimately, the housekeeping agreed to waive the charges and let me have them at no charge when I expressed my displeasure and asked for someone to collect the 4 bottles back. But this also means that a guest who did not know because there was no way they could have known will get a rude shock upon check out. I seriously think the hotel should review this. If not, the hotel should just simply revert to the good old standard of charging for everything except bottled water. And in fact, I was informed that the mini bar is replenished once a day and I had assumed it meant it will be topped up maximum once a day AFTER I have consumed the first round of the contents. The word \u2018replenished\u2019 is misleading and should be rephrased. A minor issue was that there was supposed to be a personalised check in at Royal Club Lounge for Suite guests / Royal Touch member but I never got that, nor was I ever acknowledged for being a member throughout my stay. Again, I would have been fine except that I was expecting it as it was listed all in the same email. The hotel has to improve on its member acknowledgement. The conclusion is that while the hardware is perfectly okay, it is the software i had issues with.

I have to say that I have had a good experience for all of my previous visits, but my most recent experience was a mixture of good and bad. Just to recount my experience\u2026 The check-in took a while but I did not really mind, since I was not in a hurry. But, even though I had already indicated in my online reservation that I would like to have a king size bed, the staff at the front desk asked me the same question again. I suppose she might have just wanted to be certain, but it made me think whether she is even aware of what I had requested for in my online reservation. When I entered into the hotel room, I realised that the room had two single beds rather than one king-sized bed. So I called room service (as I did not know what number I should call for the front desk) and had my call transferred to the front desk, but after waiting for several minutes, no one picked up my call. So I called room service again and was advised to return to the front desk to resolve the matter in person. When I informed the staff at the front desk of the mistake, she informed me that the two single beds should have been combined together to form a king-sized bed. I am not certain if that is the norm (combining two beds together to form a king-sized bed), for I have always requested for a king size bed in my previous visits and was not aware of any instance where the king size bed was actually two single beds combined into one. As I prefer to have an actual king-sized bed, I was provided with another room at level 4. I was not overly concerned about having to move from a room at level 8 to level 4, since the hotel is not exactly known for its view. Having finally settled in the room, I tried to turn on the television with the remote, but the television would not turn on as the power was switched off. I tried to locate the switch on my own, but couldn't find it, so I had no choice but to call room service again and an technical engineer (I believe that is what they were called) promptly came and turned on the power for me. Feeling silly, I apologised to the technical engineer for being a bother and he explained to me that the power should not have been switched off in the first place. Then, as I was moving around the room, I stepped on something and when I took a closer look, I was a tad horrified to find that it was the dried-up body of a bug of some sort. Needless to say, I wore slippers in the room from that point on. Besides the bug, one of the power switch near the floor was left turned on (perhaps by the cleaning crew who neglected to turn it off after their cleaning). It is not a issue for me, but it could be rather dangerous if the power switch is left on in a room with young children. Lastly, when I had my breakfast at Carousel the next morning, the staff was kind enough to inform me that the buffet will close in about 15 minutes (it was my fault for coming for breakfast only around 10 am). The variety in the buffet was good and the food was not bad (although the omelette was a tad bland for my taste). But, it was rather hard to get a refill for my tea, as it seemed the staff members in the Carousal were otherwise occupied with clearing items and preparing for the lunch crowd. Overall, my recent experience in the hotel was mixed. Although the hotel is in a very good location and its staff are generally helpful and polite, I think there are still areas for improvement.

Everyday the minibar is supplied with complimentary 2 bottles of water, 1 bottle orange juice, 2 cans Tiger beer, 1 can Coke regular, 1 can Coke light, 2 Oreo. There's a coffee machine by Nespresso, 6 free capsules of coffee being supplied everyday (2-strong, 2-mild, 2-decaf). Aside from that, teabags and Milo are supplied. Aren't we pampered? There's a security SAFE that u can use, easy to operate. TV has variety of channels, though there's no Sports channel, where I was longing to watch the French Open but to no avail. Beware: at night the AIR-CON could be a bit noisy. FREE WIFI available! Very important. The room also has iron and ironing board and blow drier. They also have gym, though not so big, it is functional. They have Sauna and swimmingpool but no lifeguard, so you swim at your own risk. Children below 12 are not allowed to use the pool. Towels available at the pool area. As we were checked in floor 14, we can have breakfast at Carousel or Royal CLub Lounge. But we never tried having breakfast at Carousel as we expect there would be alot of people. We opted for the Royal Club Lounge where life is peaceful with friendly smiling staff, though the menu has limited selection, nice presentation but poor taste. At night you can go to the bar where a very nice Filipino band plays all music from different genre. You can also make request but dont ecpect that it will be played. We ordered cheese platter but was a little disappointed that the one showed in the picture (menu) is different from what we got.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taguig City, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cGood location; value-for-money!\u201d", "Author": "ManilaSoulMates", "ReviewID": "UR111209056", "Content": "On our way back to Manila from Melbourne, we stayed 4 days in Singapore so that my teenage nephew and niece (both 1st-timers in Singapore) could explore the city and enjoy the new Universal Studios theme park in Sentosa.

I was booked here during my business trip to Singapore in Mar 2010. I was attending a press junket and the company that invited us booked us here. I haven't really done a lot of business trips alone but somehow I felt comfortable here, much to my surprise. There are some reviews here noting the rooms are small but I did not find that to be the case, certainly not for ONE PERSON. Sure we could have been booked in something bigger than the standard room, I couldn't tell, but I certainly had a big bed... plenty of room enough for me. I had a confortable work space as well. This is a business hotel so most people who stay here are probably out during the day and are working at night before they sleep. So the FREE minibar might have been stocked just as such, which some consider very meager, but I did not mind it at all. There are tons of places to go to should you need anything, and the hotel is certainly within walking distance to a 7-11 even. The hotel is actually on Scotts road, near the Orchard road intersection. It is just walking distance from places like the Wheelock Place (which has a Borders bookstore!) and Ion Orchard and many other malls. Walking around at night, you can enjoy a completely different look to the city, too! Sure there places near the hotel are not the kind for backpackers' type who may prefer less expensive meals, shopping items and street food-type fare (Louis Vuitton, Emporio Armani and other big name brands are also just a few minutes away), but if you want that, then this area isn't what you are looking for. The rooms had Internet (or at least my room did), although it wasn't wireless. It's got a bathtub (excellent for a relaxing night after working the whole day). Carousel, the restaurant at the lobby had good food. The staff was friendly to us, even during peak hours when we ate there. Sure the club on the second floor wasn't that big, but hey, if you want a swinging party place with hundreds of people, you shouldn't go to a hotel club. I like that it doesn't have a lot of room for too many people. The only thing I didn't like much was that their lobby seemed to be crowded. There were people milling around by the entrance (near the restaurant entrance actually) and I wasn't quite sure they were hotel guests. And sure the view is mostly of other buildings and perhaps side streets, but again, this isn't the place you should book if you are on a nature-tripping mood (go Google something else!). While this isn't the type of place I would stay at for a leisure trip (I perhaps would like a more homey hotel, or a resort... or something with a more affordable price range too), but if I'm ever invited to a business trip to these parts again, I would certainly hope the company taking us there would have a mind to book us here.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nice, France", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly adequate but anonymous....\u201d", "Author": "Eddie06", "ReviewID": "UR106081219", "Content": "Given the wide choice of business hotels on and off Orchard Road this is nothing to remember.

Cons: - Room was a bit small, perhaps because space is of a premium in Singapore.

There was a roller shade, but it didn't do much to block the light. - Feather pillows are a bit soft and become flat in the middle of the night. - This is minor, but the amenities did not include hair conditioner.

We had to be in the Orchard Road area, and once again, we found that the best deal in the Orchard-Scotts area was Royal Plaza. It\u2019s more expensive than before, but the price is the most competitive. We booked a superior room (no breakfast) through the website. Booking through booking.com would have been only S$1 cheaper. Wi-and LAN are still free, and now there are even more nearby sidewalk cafes where one can eat breakfast (see photo of the hotel\u2019s \u201cRP\u201d logo taken from Starbucks where they serve a good continental breakfast including fruit). The hotel manager sent a thoughtful e-mail welcoming us back to the Royal Plaza, and check-in was prompt and friendly. We were surprised to be upgraded to a suite on the 7th floor. Room The amenities were so enticing that we can understand why guests are willing to pay the extra amount for two rooms (each with its own TV and air conditioning controls) instead of one. The bed was larger, and it seemed more comfortable, and the bathroom was larger with the bathtub located in the extra-large shower. The refrigerator was good sized, and the two beers, two soft drinks, orange drink, and two bottles of water were replenished daily. There was no night light, but we just opened the curtains a bit for light. The coffee maker was sophisticated. It was easy to operate the air conditioning. The room and bathroom were kept extremely clean. Newspapers are left by the door or they are available at the elevator lobby. Lobby The lobby can get quite crowded at times, but it is large, and it seems to be able to accommodate large groups. We noticed people lining up in the lobby area to take high tea at Carousel coffee shop. To access the elevators one has to pass both the concierge and reception desk. You have to insert your key card in order to use the elevator. Wi-fi The wi-fi signal was good, but it dropped out sometimes, so we used the free LAN which was fast and reliable. We note that most four and five star hotels still charge extra for wi-fi. Quiet enjoyment Our windows faced the Duty Free building, so there was no noise except from the occasional extra-loud motorcycle that even Singapore cannot eradicate completely. Even though there was a connecting door, it was on the working side of the suite, so our room was quiet. Location For guests who use the pedestrian bridge over Scotts Road, the Royal Plaza is almost connected to Far East Plaza\u2019s shops. Even in a rain you can turn right and walk to the Royal Plaza side of Shaw Centre where there are four excellent restaurants right in a row next to each other: Les Amis (maybe too high class for our taste), Aoki Japanese, Bistro du Vin, and La Strada Italian. They are all owned by Les Amis Group. We had dinner at La Strada, and we found the special of the day, lamb shank, especially delicious, but my tortellini stuffed with ricotta and spinach with walnut sauce was also good. They also sold one of our favorite wines by the glass: Moscato d\u2019Asti. The MRT is also at Shaw Centre. You really can\u2019t find a more central location. Service When we arrived, my wife had to unload one suitcase from the back of the taxi while a porter stood by idle. We assume this rarely happens. The reception staff was cheerful, friendly and efficient, and the maids, who seem to be making up rooms constantly, are friendly. Check out was equally efficient and friendly. They froze our ice pack in an area near the reception desk and retrieved it quickly. We are grateful that Royal Plaza at Scotts has maintained their high quality at a comparatively reasonable price.

I have stayed at numerous hotels all over the world and I only have a few things to say about your hotel: Absolutely World First Class, Mind Blowing, extravagant and worth every cent and so much more!!! To start of, the staff of the hotel definitely live up to the motto: \"what can we do for you\". Everywhere I went in the hotel, I was greeted with warm smiles, excellent service and the words, \"what can I do for you\". When I booked for my stay online, I enquired if the hotel could do something special as it was a romantic getaway. When I checked into about 3 plus, the reception staff were really warm, smiley and check in was a breeze. The bell boy standing nearby addressed me by name as he helped me keep the elevator door open and press the correct floor. That was just the start of our adventure. When we arrived at our floor, we were greeted by the sign \"premier\" and the beautiful carpet stretching down the corridor. Though the air circulation could be improved as it smelled like a horse stable. Stepping into the room, we were blown away by the elegant, beautiful design of the room, that it was exactly the same as the pictures online (some hotel rooms do not look the same as the pictures published). We were excited to discover red rose petals scattered around the bathtub (just a suggestion, would be even better with rose petals in a heart shape on the bed). Thank you for the lovely roses at no extra charge. On the study table, was a hand-written note with a gift of 2 GV movie tickets, and suggestions about 2 movies perfect for couples. The personal touch of hand writing and recommendations of the movies was totally unexpected and deeply appreciated. We totally did not expect the tickets, much less the recommendations. The welcome card by Arthur Chua the Manager only increased our happiness. Before we could recover from shock, Rendi called to ask if he could deliver a cake. He came to our room with the cake and introduced himself by giving me his name card, telling me to call him if I needed anything. In all my hotel stays, I never had any manager doing such a thing, much less a cake. The cake was delicious, though too sweet for our liking and could do without the pink bandung flavour around the cake. During my stay, I requested for 2 pairs of chopsticks and spoons and they were delivered on a tray with napkins too. The bed and pillows were so comfortable that my girlfriend wanted to purchase them, and is curious about the brand and models of the mattress and pillows. When we went down to breakfast, at the carousel cafe, we stuffed ourselves the delicious food and were so extremely that we did not eat lunch. All your staff were excellent, In particular, 2 staff in particular stood out to me; one was the lady at the noodle station who was proud of the the noodles she cooked and boasted it was delicious and famous, she was was not bluffing as it was delicious. The other was Alex at the fruit juice station who was still serving in spite of having cut his finger and had a bandage around it. About 1:20pm before my check out timing, I requested for an extension of another hour and your staff were very friendly and professional. The lady receptionist who answered the phone helped me check with her superior before informing me that my request was approved. My check out was a breeze like my check in. To sum it up, as Arthur Chua quoted Walt Disney in the welcome card, \"Do what you do so well that they will want to see it again and bring their friends.\" Royal Plaza has certainly left a lasting impact on me, and I definitely will be back. Please keep up the excellent standard and raise it even higher with your committed, excellent staff and their strong teamwork.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAnother Fantastic Stay\u201d", "Author": "johne88", "ReviewID": "UR101326906", "Content": "My wife and I arrived in Dec 2010 and stayed over Christmas, we visit this hotel each year, usually for 3 weeks.On arrival our bags were whisked away from the taxi by the friendly staff and were waiting in the room for us.

The only difference between the Premiere and the Deluxe rooms is the bathtub and the Nespresso Machine. If you don't see yourself taking a bath or making a Nespresso, save yourself a bit and get the Deluxe room. My work colleague had the Deluxe room and it was still very nice.

Decent sized and very clean. The only think you have to remember is that there are buildings on all sides of the hotel so there's not much of any views. In my case I got nice quiet room upon request, but it faced the apartment building next door, with peeks to the open space at the back. That being said, you have to remember to close either the room's curtains or bath picture window or the neighbors are able to see you do everything in the bathroom! From my experience in the past, some rooms are noisier than others, and some are about 10' away from the building next door, etc. So if you're claustrophobic you should probably try and get a room facing the pool or the back, etc. Otherwise, you should try another hotel if this is a big issue. What I loved about this hotel is that the internet is stable and it's free! Both wifi and wired connections are available in the room and common areas. The gym is small, but adequate for a decent workout....great that they are fixed with monitors to watch TV while you're on the bikes and treadmills. The pool is small, but cozy. The reception is very friendly and helpful, but are manned by a few \"foreigners\" who's English is so so, so you sometimes have to speak slowly and repeat yourself a couple of times. But overall everyone was very nice here....even the doorman who greeted me every time I came and went. The other thing I thought was really convenient is that new cafes and restaurants have opened nearby, with a supermarket in the basement of Shaw Center next door where you can buy pretty much anything to eat and drink. They also have a movie theater there. Also very convenient is that the Orchard MRT is a minute away. I'd definitely come back to stay provided they keep the rates low. Sometimes they go crazy with their room rates here with up to $200 swings from the lows to highs.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Customer Care\u201d", "Author": "G_Aberdeen", "ReviewID": "UR95901219", "Content": "I personally did not stay in this hotel but parents did.

The rooms are your typical business rooms with a clean room, decent bathroom and comfortable bed. It is very important to mention that the rooms come with free wifi and the minibar is consumable.

We got a great rate on wotif and were able to upgrade to a club floor on arrival - all in all a very good deal. You could spend your day eating and drinking in the club lounge if you were so inclined. Evening snacks in particular were varied and tasty, wines poor and selection of spirits just ordinary. The real reason you'd want to upgrade from the cheapest rate is to get breakfast with your room. You can get a limited selection served in the lounge, but head for the full-on experience and brave the crowds at the buffet in the Carousel restaurant. From an egg station to a noodle soup station, a fresh-squeezed juice bar and very good breads, fresh dim sum and tasty Indian food, the buffet is a reflection of multicultural Singapore. The selection changes daily, so there's no risk of getting bored. On the plus side: the hotel is in a great location if you're headed to the malls on Orchard, and close to MRT if you're going elsewhere. Cabs were easy to get on Scotts. Our club room had a great bathroom, spacious shower and bath, with some nice Occitane toiletries. Beds were fantastic, and we liked the idea that there were dressing gowns, a pillow menu, free internet and a free mini-bar (though with just two bottles of water a day, we found ourselves asking for more in the lounge). Staff when you met them were friendly. Housekeeping, front desk and club staff were all very efficient. Gym was small but pleasant, pool was quite popular despite not being very spacious. As mentioned above, breakfast alone is a good reason to stay here. On the less positive side: the lobby is small and during weekends at least always crowded, chaotic, and noisy, not giving a great first impression. Other reviews have mentioned the absence of front door service. Door staff was helpful when they could be, but they are so overwhelmed by demand that you're much better off carrying your own bags and hailing your own cabs. We saw crowds ten people deep waiting for cabs in the drive when all we needed to do was walk out in the street and hail a cab. Concierge service we can't comment on because when we wanted to make a dinner reservation, we were never able to speak to the lone woman who was besieged by requests at the concierge desk. And when we returned later in the day, there was no one there at all. Asking the friendly, knowledgeable staff in the club lounge for advice was a much better way to go (plus we managed to score a last minute table at Andr\u00e9 on our own). Decoration in our club room lacked a little personality (I quite liked curling up in the funky armchair, but there was only one). So yes, stay here if you're looking for something practical and convenient (and if you like breakfast buffets).

You would not find a better location for Orchard Rd Hotels. So many shopping centres so close you can shop, go back and rest, go out again and again. Underneath Tangs is a takeaway with foods, fruit/juice stand that was nice. Carousel Breakfast is incredible. Everything and every culture catered for. Normal cost is $38 per person so try to get it included in your rate - well worth it. We had breakfast, then maybe a drink during day and then dinner at night. No need for lunch. The mini bar refill every day consisted of 2 x Tiger cans, 2 x cokes, 2 x water, 1 orange juide & 2 Oreo's. This is a huge saving. Beers cost around $12 each if buying in bar and cokes etc about $5. Alcohol is VERY expensive. Had standard room for 3 of us (1 fold out bed). Room big enough for 3 adults. Bathroom nice with good amenities. Pool area and gym good and although not a resort style, certainly good for a swim in the humid conditions. MRT pass is excellent and you can top up and if dont use at end of stay, get a refund on whats left. So easy to use and get around. Much easier than Melb or Sydney.Taxi's so cheap also. Sun Tec, Vivo Shopping centre incredible - well worth a visit - allow plenty of time. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Need to get down for breakfast before 9.30 as there is a long line to get in after that. Nice bar area upstairs if you dont have Club rooms. Recommend you visit Sentosa, Marina Bay Sands and do spend the $20 and go to top. Universal was booked out for week in advance which we didnt expect so didnt get to go there. Songs of Sea also booked on night we were on Sentosa.We to Night Safari and a little disappointed. Not as many animals as expected and Taronga and Melb zoo is comparable. Take mosquito repellant and do the train tours first to get idea of layout. Expensive to eat there (for what you get). Took a hop on/off bus tour which would recommend early in your stay to get idea of what to see in Singapore. Goes alot of places and need couple of days if want to see everything. Cannot fault this hotel at all and would recommend highly. You may pay a little more than some Orchard Rd hotels but the extra's like mini bar and breakfast save you so much money overall.

The fact that the hotel wanted to charge me SGD300+ for the privilege firmly put the nail in the coffin. I have stayed at the Royal Plaza regularly whenever staying in Singapore for about the last 4 years whether business or Leisure, partly due to it's excellent location and partly because we had become quite attached to the hotel. Unfortunately we have now decided to go elsewhere as the hotel's service seems to have deteriorated somewhat, possibly due to the fact that the hotel always has high occupancy due to it's location (they are always relatively full so possibly believe they do not need to work too hard to keep their regulars happy). I have three main issues: One of the main issues was during the renovations last year, I had family visiting me in Vietnam and we were going over to Singapore for a break. I was a little disappointed that I was not informed prior to arriving at the hotel that there were extensive renovations taking place. The floor our rooms were situated on seemed to be the hub of the operations and the noise and disruption was a little excessive. The hotel were full so offered no other rooms or any sort of reduced rate, even a SINCERE apology (the reception reluctantly apologised after I complained). Secondly, the hotel provides a free car-park at the back for hotel guests however in January 2010 the car-park was being renovated. This resulted in us having to pay in excess of SGD30 per day for our stay to park our hire car. Again we weren't informed of this at the time of booking! Thirdly, the reservations team are either over-worked or under-trained. On 9/10 occasions there are issues when I try to reserve a room. I always tend to book by email as our company has a corporate rate with the Royal Plaza. Unfortunately simple instructions or requests are normally ignored resulting in incorrect bookings being made. The problem is made worse due to the fact that it is near on impossible to speak to them over the phone and they do not answer emails in a timely manner (if I request a reservation by email, I do not expect to wait several days for a reply). The final straw was when the reservations team ignored my emailed request to upgrade our room using loyalty points. The room was not upgraded and when I looked at my account several weeks ago, my points had since expired. This is enough to convince me to not stay at the Royal Plaza again.

If the have a meeting, the have to food and the plates and and and aside the pool and mayn people are buzzling around. sad and stressful athmosphere. - Check-out-day: we opend the room door and put the suitcases out. 2 (!) bellboys walked along, noone greeted, noone asked if he could help us. - Our flight back was in the late evening. so we planned a relaxing day in Singapore. First problem: they could not provide a safety-box for our important documents. Later on we wanted to have a shower before going to the airport: The just offer a shower in the Sauna. It was really funny: there stood some businessmen, waiting for the one shower, crowded in one small room. That s definetely NOT 5-star standard. and there are many flights in the evening. Anyway, if u just want a room and don t care for view or service, it s a nice hotel. If u expect a little bit more - don t go there.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Batangas City, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cLocation Location Location\u201d", "Author": "RRGT", "ReviewID": "UR66321131", "Content": "Its all about location with the Royal Plaza. Situated near the junction between Orchard and Scotts Road, the Royal Plaza is an ideal base for shopping and dining. I had stayed here before the renovation was carried out and certainly the rooms have improved. Check-in was prompt and I was upgraded to the Club Level room upon arrival. The room size was fairly average and the furnishing was run of the mill. The free minibar as from my previous stay was not really so much of a big deal. A couple of cans of soda and beer were all that was in it along with two bottles of water. One other feature becoming more and more common in hotels I've stayed at recently was likewise present at Royal Plaza. A glass wall separating the bathroom from the bedroom. Blinds were provided to appease the more modest guests I suppose. While the bathroom was not particularly large, it still had a shower stall separate from the bath tub. One feature that I found lacking however was a phone at the bathroom, which I would've thought was a standard feature in most hotels in this category. Breakfast at the Carousel, which apparently is quite a famous buffet restaurant in Singapore, was okay but the lunch and dinner spreads are far better. Our function was held in one of the many meeting rooms available at the hotel. Apart from the seemingly Arctic conditions (which somehow is quite common here in South East Asia to really have the aircon full blast), the facilities and service were certainly adequate. There was quite a queue when I checked out as there were only 2 people at the front desk. As they had previously allowed me to check-out late then I suppose this was forgiveable. One last thing to note about the Royal Plaza is that it is a totally smoke free hotel. So for a non-smoker like me, then it is certainly beneficial, but admittedly can be a turn off for those people who do smoke. Overall, I would say that the Royal Plaza is a very good hotel, albeit at the same price range and location, there are other better hotels available.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cfantastic experience\u201d", "Author": "shahida_roxy86", "ReviewID": "UR65868422", "Content": "I am local and wanted to experience a hotel stay in my country itself.

It has recently been refurbished but whoever the designer was seems to have a love affair with brown and drab. Corridors and rooms are uninviting and look shabby. Normally I stay on a club (higher) floor but travel budget cutbacks consigned me to the incredibly noisy 6th floor with a view of the car park wall next door. Construction noise 24/7 and an A/C that just wouldn't quit. Check-in was quick and friendly enough but no help with bags offered and no directions to the room or guidance about the facilities. Fair enough I suppose, I have stayed there many times and they had me flagged as a repeat guest. The room was freezing but when I raised the temperature on the thermostat it just got more humid. Very uncomfortable throughout my stay. Bathroom small but functional with very good water pressure in the walk-in rain shower. Bed incredibly uncomfortable and whoever thought of putting halogen reading lights in the ceiling that shone directly in your eyes deserves to be fired. The lobby was a cacophony most nights as loud screeching and wailing emanated from the bar on the mezzanine floor. I don't know if it was karaoke or a \"professional\" band but the noise permeated the whole of the ground floor and gave me a headache. There was no respite in the restaurant as the canned \"contemporary\" classical racket competed with the noise from upstairs. Thelarge \"international buffet\" food quality was terrible and the service worse. Tables are much too close together and the resulting squeeze-pasts made for a very unpleasant dining experience. $76 for the buffet and a coke was poor value and you can do so much better in Singapore for less. Prospective guests should take note, the hotel is 100% smoke-free. No bad thing and it was a pleasant change not to have the smell of stale smoke in the corridors. The hotel rightly touts this as a plus-point but what is less widely advertised is that the menu is entirely halal. Great if you are a muslim but when they start substituting veal bacon and chicken n' cheese suasages for pork products in Italian dishes it makes for some pretty disgusting offerings. Breakfast was a joke, stick to the eggs if you want something hot or go for the Asian food. The \"western\" menu with halal substitutes for pork was revolting. The hotel has a small pool and a tired-looking gym as well as a busines center and plenty of conference rooms. If I were forced to stay there again I would pay the extra for a club floor and eat out all the time. Checkout was quick and error-free. The RP rubs shoulders with some first division competition on Scotts Road with a Marriott, Sheraton and Hyatt in close proximity. It was formerly a Crowne Plaza until bought out by an independent operator but it could not even punch its weight in that league. Its location right in the heart of the city is about all it has going for it these days.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Royal Plaza on Scotts Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DeafMacs", "ReviewID": "UR63606793", "Content": "I was in Singapore In December 2004.

I stayed in this hotel a good 5-6 years before and still had good memories of the hotel Checking in was brisk and took less than 10 mins. My spouse had stated in the reservation form that it was my birthday so the hotel took the initative to bring up a small slice of cake with a knife and fork on a plate. That was a nice gesture, thank u very much! Everything went downhill from then. The room was really stuffy and it took at least 3-4 calls to the housekeeping dept before it was answered. (I dont think 4-5pm is a peak time to call?) The aircon repair guy came in, with his shoes on, stomped all over the floor and took a good 15mins fixing the aircon. He then declared that theres nothing much he can do abt the aircon, he went on into some technical terms which i didnt quite understand and to put it quite simply, he simply said the thermostat thingy is spoilt, we could only hv a FIXED TEMP, so would we want LOW, MED OR HIGH? We chose MED since low would be stuffy and HIGH too cold. So thats it. No more temp adjustments for us. I have to tell u, its SUPER COLD in the middle of the night and theres NOTHING i can do abt it becos i cant adjust the temp! Its crazy. W e requested for a complimentary parking coupon from the desk when we headed out at midnite and was handed a ticket that stated: GOOD TO 30/4/10 1159PM. Now, that was weird. The receptionist assured us that we would hv NO PROBLEM going out although we pointed out that the ticket has expired. Guess what. We were stuck at the gantry driving out because as expected, the ticket has expired! The cars were honking behind us and my irritated spouse had to pay the $16+ charges just not to go to the trouble of explaining to security, running back to recption, etc. It was totally TERRIBLE! The next day, a friend came around and brought a birthday cake to me and it took another 8-9 calls before the phone was answered and my request for a clean plate and fork got through. Another 15mins long wait before the plate arrived. Our check out time was at 3pm because we checked in slighly later the day before. Me and my spouse fell asleep after lunch and when we woke up, it was close to 2.45pm. We did a quick call to the reception to apologise and told them we would check out of the room by 3.30pm. The receptionist was VERY UNACCOMODATING! She simply stated curtly that any extension beyond 3pm would be charged at $25 per hour. Now, thats what i call unreasonable. Here we are apologising in a kind manner and she was curt and rude and sounded like we did it on purpose.

The room generally was acceptable, it had all that I needed, Internet (albeit slower than before) and free soda and juice in the minibar. There was no view but it wasn't a necessity. The only major annoyance with the room was that I was next to a guest who had 2 or more rooms near me. They liked to go in and out of their rooms, keeping their doors open, so the doors were slamming every couple of minutes. It's not the hotel's fault, but i would have liked it if they could have placed these guests away from my room. It's really annoying if you have to deal with other people's selfishness.

I travel regularly throughout Asia for business and pleasure and it is very difficult to have a room that is not in some way affected by cigarette smoke, even if you ask for a NS room on a NS floor. So I was delighted to have a go at staying in a hotel that has great pride in announcing that they are the first 100% non-smoking hotel in Singapore. Now I preface this comment by saying that smokers are selfish, weak and inconsiderate people by nature and the hotel has no control over a smoker who signs at check-in that they will respect this hotel policy (which you are required to do) and then ignores it (which they also do regularly on NS floors in other hotels) but this didn't help me much. Without any consequence for smoking in your room there is little incentive, I suppose, for smokers to honour their word. In the room the linen smelt like cigarettes, as did my clothes and the air carried a constant soft smell of second-hand smoke courtesy of the air-conditioning. In the elevator bay the smell is at its strongest. So, the short story is, if you're a non-smoker trying to get a hotel room that doesn't smell like cigarettes, give this place a miss. They simply failed to meet their commitment. Some other bits of information that you may find useful: Gym: It is very small, with limited free weights (heaviest weight is 10kg dumbbells), some machine weights (chest press, shoulder press, leg extension, hamstring curl (broken when I was there for the length of my 1 week stay) and ab curl. Two running machines and a couple of exercise bikes. In peak periods it is impossible to use the room, period, and there isn\u2019t enough room to turn around, let alone exercise, if you are not on a machine. Pool: Unusually small and positioned (along with the gym) in an extension onto the adjacent building. Because of its size you need to be very quick to get a good spot. It is also not lit in the evenings and frankly pretty creepy (according to my partner).

We are definitely not going back to this hotel or recommend anyone to stay there. The size of the club room is very small and it is full of mirrors. The rooms were either facing car park or private condominiums. We observed that the majority of the staffs were not trained to greet guests. They treated us invisible and expected us to greet them 1st. One male employee who was in charge of the inventory of the mini bars in the rooms at the 14th club floor was busying singing away and don\u2019t even bother to greet us. We felt that there was no privacy at this hotel as throughout the whole day, we could see the cleaning staff and their trolley along the corridor all the time. The service at the Club lounge was also very disappointing. We expect that the customer service at club lounge to be better than what we had experienced in RP so far but we were wrong! We had to wait for a long time before the waitress notice our presence and came to attend to us. They do not address guests by their 1st names at all. The quality and quantity of pastries available during the tea time were miserable and we had no choice of selection at all as it was already pre-selected by the chef of the lounge presented in a 3-tier carrier. At the evening cocktail, the finger food available was not fantastic either. Each of the dishes was presented only in a mouth full portion serving. Quality of the food was below par. The \u201cGossip\u201d red and white wine was of a pretty budget range. This gave us an impression that the club lounge was not as generous as other 5 star hotels lounges found in Hyatt and Swissotel. Breakfast at Carousel was average. The selection was also limited. What freaked me out was that my wife told me a waiter had actually whistled at her while she was taking her food. How could a 5 star hotel employ such rude staff? Where is the professionalism of service that is expected of a 5-star hotel? The complimentary mini bar was the joke of the day! We expec7ted it to be full of beverages but there were only 2 cans of beer, a small bottle of orange juice and 2 cans of soft drinks. When we requested for replenishment of drinks in the early morning prior to our checkout at noon, we were told that their \"rules and regulations\" do not allow guests that are checking out to replenish the drinks. What a stingy and shrewd management of this 5 star hotel. The management needs to revamp its customer service. We have been to several hotels and RP is the 1st encounter of its kind. It is totally not flexible and strictly follows by its \u201crules and regulations\u201d. For most of the hotels we have been to, most will either grace a late check out by an hour or 2 or politely reject us if it is fully booked on the day of our checkout. RP strictly do not allow later than 2pm checkout else, it will be chargeable at SGD$25 / hr (subjected to 17% GST tax!). Moreover, there is strictly no replenishment of beverages on day of check out.

First, the location is excellent. It is a short walk to Orchard Road, which is filled with shops and places to eat. The underground crossing is actually easy to navigate after giving it a couple of goes (and reading the signs...). The underground links you to the MRT, Ion shopping centre, Wheelock Plaza, Wisma Atria and Tangs - everywhere! There are plenty of food options around the Royal Plaza, not all junkfood either. Sure, there is a McDonalds and Starbucks, but there also is Canelle, Food Republic and Tangs and Isetan supermarkets / food courts. I'd recommend getting the hotel breakfast included. It was amazing! So much variety - eggs, bacon, sausages, pasteries, waffles and more. The hotel resturaunt may seem expensive, but is not at all 'snooty' and is value for money - especially when having the buffet. The rooms were nice and clean. We had a problem where out power went out, but a quick call to reception and it was fixed. The only complaint I have from this visit is that on one of the days our room wasn't made up - we put the make up room light on at 930/10am and returned to our room at 4pm to find it hadn't yet been made up and we were anxious to get ready to go out to dinner. After calling housekeeping they dropped round some new towels and were ver apologetic - it seems there was a miscommunication. The free mini bar is great - and exactly that - free. If something is free, it shouldn't be complained about! It had 2 tiger beers, 2 coca colas, an orange juice and two bottles of water, and was replenished daily.

It's a lovely hotel, but a bit over-priced in a very busy area. The facilities are good, the staff were friendly but the hotel just feels cold, stuffy and unfriendly. Sterile maybe is a good description. The Concierge guy was really friendly and welcoming and the cleaning lady was nice and chatty and the room was very clean, but the hotel just felt cold. Website says mini bar drinks are free, ahh yeah, 2 beers and a couple of sugary juices. There was no map or list of hotel facilities in my room. I mentioned this on my Comments Sheet when I checked out and got a letter from the Manager saying it was in a drawer in the room. It wasn't. I looked everywhere, in the end I had to go exploring to find the pool, business centre etc. I certainly wouldn't choose this hotel for location. In 2 days I didn't manage to work out how to cross the road. Looks easy, there's an underpass, that branches out into a five way, multi-level, chaotic paedestrian underground city. I just wanted to cross diagonally to get to a particular shop, tried for hours and ended up in more and more shops that I didn't want to be in, with hawkers trying to sell me things I didn't want. Perhaps the hotel could provide guests with a map showing how to cross the road. I wanted to eat and maybe find a Pub for a couple of drinks and socialise with other tourists. The hotel was way too expensive and snooty to eat or drink at, but around the hotel it's fast food outlet after yet hundreds of more fast food outlets. If you want junk food, obesity and a heart attack, Singapore is the place for you. Finally I got a taxi and asked the driver where I could get REAL food. He took me to China Town which is where I'll stay next time I stopover in Singapore. I loved China Town at night. It bussled with friendly activity, the food was authentic and the beer was cold. I can't say Singapore impressed me, it's just a huge busy shopping centre. If I want to go shopping I have shopping centres near where I live where I can buy anything they sell in Singapore.

Fourth, it has surau/mini mosque so for you moslems, it will be easy to know the direction of Kiblat (Mecca). Fifth, Isetan (which I love for the Japanese supermarket & MOS) is just 5 minutes walk.

As in, all the time. Staying hydrated is kind of a good idea, and 2 free bottles of water helps (not so much with making it cheap as making it easy). And if drinking free beer in your room is your thing, you can do that too. - LIVELY LOCATION: Quite a few Singapore hotels seem to be surrounded by offices or dead neighborhoods. Here, you're steps from Orchard Road which is bustling day and night, and Scotts Road picks up a lot of that too. It won't keep you from sleeping (I was on the 4th floor on the side closest the street) but it's great to be able to walk out the door, grab a seat at the open-air Starbucks or McCafe, and watch crowds pass by.

We walked up to the door and our bags were taken from us - the staff really could not do enough for us from arrival to departure we felt looked after. Our room was large with a huge comfy bed. The shower was amazing! The free mini bar went down well - water, beer, juice, coke, diet coke - re stocked every day. The room was serviced every day - even the day we slept in till gone 1. It was the perfect room for us. We found the Hotel to be a perfect location just two stops from the City Hall MRT station(at the Orchard MRT follow signs to Orchard Road not Scotts as Scotts road signs take you up to street level on the other side of Scots Road to the hotel there is a footbridge to cross the road but its quicker to exit the MRT on the same side as the hotel). Breakfast is a huge affair! Loads to choose from, coffee or tea the second you sit down, used plates taken away quickly. We didn't get the chance to use the pool - too busy seeing as much as we could of Singapore and the F1 tho we did wander to check it out and we did intend to spend an afternoon at least there - just didn't fit it in! I think there were about 10 sun beds and the gym was to the side. There were staff around - so I am sure the pool area was as well managed as the rest of the Hotel.

We arrived in the early hours of the morning for a three night stay. Staff were professional and friendly. On arrival, our room was upgraded and we were given a 3pm late checkout on our final day. The location of this hotel is very convenient, right on Orchard Road, 5 min walk to the MRT, and with a very busy bus stop right out front. There is a huge department store opposite, as well as a large shopping plaza. There are also a large range of affordable food stores within 5 mins walk, including major chains. Our room was what we expected, a large bed, desk, desk chair and lounge chair. The room was extraordinarily quiet and we were able to block out all light if we wanted. We appreciated the free beer, soft drinks and water, and enjoyed swimming in the large pool. The only problem we experienced was the strength of the free wireless broadband connection which was not strong enough in our room to be reliable. Unusually, I booked a package with breakfast and was blown away with its size and quality. There was appropriate breakfast food for almost every country, which even included different specialities on different days. In fact, the buffet breakfast at The Royal Plaza on Scotts has ruined us and we will always use hold it up as the gold standard. What I did not know when I booked it was that the restaurant at the Royal Plaza on Scotts has won 'Singapore's Best Buffet Restaurant' category for several years running. I didn't try the other buffets (which included afternoon/high tea and seafood) but I did notice that the restaurant was always packed with people each afternoon and especially in the evenings. The hotel also offers a very affordable three course meal deal in the upstairs bar/restaurant that was also well attended. If you are ever going to book buffet breakfast with your accommodation, this is the hotel to do it. The public transport system in Singapore is fantastic. We bought a rail pass and put $20 Singapore on it. We then used it for our whole stay to catch trains and buses, including our return train trip to the International Airport. In total we only spent $10 and, because we arrived at the airport before 7.30 pm, were able to retrieve all the money we hadn't yet spent. The only problem with the system is that it is not really accessible for people with disabilities. Stairs are used as flood barriers to the rail system and the Singapore people do not stand for people with disabilities despite having specially allocated seats. However, I have found this also to be the case in most of Europe and sometimes even in ustralia. I would definitely recommend this hotel as a very affordable and reliable option, even without the fantastic buffet breakfast.

The bathroom was very large, but I am not so sure a window wall between the bathroom / toilet and the main room is necessary (call me a prude!).

After a week of relaxing in 5 star style and doing nothing, we wanted a hotel that was not too expensive and in a good location - we wanted shops and restaurants on our doorstep. We arrived early in the morning (about 8am) having booked a Deluxe Club Room through Expedia. I had previously emailed the hotel to enquire about an early check in and was advised that this shouldn't be a problem. Despite the fact that our room wasn't ready when we arrived, we were quickly ushered upstairs to the Club Lounge to have some breakfast (which, despite not really being included on that first day, we were given at no cost) whilst we waited for our room. We only waited about an hour before our room was ready, which was perfectly acceptable. The room itself was a pretty standard hotel room, nothing spectacular and not overly large, but it was comfortable and exactly what we were after as we weren't planning on spending a huge amount of time there. A couple of huge bonuses - no smoking ANYWHERE in the hotel, free WIFI throughout (which was easily accessed with a login and password supplied with our room key) and a free mini bar. In fairness, this was pretty limited but did include a couple of Tiger beers, bottles of water, soft drink and orange juice - and was replenished daily. The best thing about RPOS is the location - it's on Scotts Road (obviously) which is right around the corner from Orchard Road and a perfect location to walk straight out your door to all the great shopping that Singapore has to offer. This is exactly why we booked this hotel and we weren't disappointed. All the staff were friendly and it was easy to get a taxi at the hotel anytime of the day - even in the pouring tropical rain! We had the choice of breakfast in the club lounge or restaurant and opted for the club lounge each day - mainly out of convenience. The choice wasn't overly extensive and certainly not as grand as the breakfast spreads at some of the big hotels, but it was fine for us. We had cereal, fruit and some pastries most days.

Right accross the street there is a Hyatt and a few steps down, there is the Marriott. There is also an iSetai mall right next to the hotel with a supermarket on the underground level. The drive time from the airport with little traffic is about 20 min and costed roughly around 20SGD (about 10EUR), which I thought was decent. Its also about within a one hour fast walk to Chinatown and Clarke Quay. service: like anywhere in Southeast Asia, service was just perfect. Check in was brisk, the attendant was very polite, the luggage was delivered to our room in no time, all in all - we didnt deal with staff extensively, but in the events that we did, it went as smooth as possible. the rooms have free wi-fi and minibar (2 waters, 2 beers and 2 soft drinks) restaurant: we were there at Easter and took advantage of the Easter brunch buffet (60SGD per person) which was amazing - there was a great selection of fresh seafood including lobster and crab, mussels, sushi, sashimi as well as a huge selection of other appetizers, main courses and desserts - everything I tried was incredibly fresh - you couldnt tell it was a buffet. I think the same buffet is offered every Fri and Sat evening for the same price and I recommend trying it. Value: I paid about 130USD per night (rate thru Expedia 50 bucks cheaper than the hotel website) which I consider to be a great price for a hotel in Singapore, especially at this location. the negative: rooms and interior: the hotel is not quite new and you can tell by the carpeting and the overall interior 'look'. Everything is perfectly clean and modern (key card elevator access, Plasma TV in room, marble bathroom, soft bedding etc., but the room we were in had this unpleasant hint of a moldy smell due to the incredible humidity that is so common in Singapore. The AC seemed to work fine, but it still felt damp, even the bedding felt a little wet. Additionally, the room we had was pretty dark and overlooking the side of another building - not very nice.

I dread to think what the standard Superior Room was like, because our Deluxe Room was small, drab and really below average. Room was not cheap either so expected more. How they class this as a 5* hotel is beyond me. Really annoying thing was that you had a card key for your room that you also needed to operate the lifts. The card system is useless so you end up having to swipe your card about 20 times just to make the lift work, then another 20 times to actually get into your room! Breakfast buffet was also quite poor, mainly halal food, nothing 'English' .....not that we expected a fry up but lots of peculiar food that you would not contemplate eating for breakfast. Pancakes & maple syrup, croissants or omelette were the only safe option!! Singapore itself is great, but MEGA expensive with exchange rate being so bad. Fantastic shopping if you have money to burn!! Highly recommend Raffles for High Tea in the Tiffin Room. It was SG$39 each (approx \u00a320) but so worth it. You get treated like royalty, actually more informal than you would expect although you have to get quite dressed up, no sandals, shorts, vests, etc. They come round with cake tiers with finger sandwiches, scones & cream cakes on. As many cups of tea as you can possibly drink.....there is also a hot buffet (mainly Chinese food), but then there are more sandwiches, scones & cream cakes laid out and you can just keep helping yourself to as much as you want.

There is a Carls Jr burger joint opposite the hotel and I enjoyed most of my meals there! Overall... not outstanding, but pretty good. Mainly because of the location and the price.

I've stayed in many hotels in Singapore in the past, including the Ritz Carlton, Mandarin Oriental and the Regent. This is my experience with Royal Plaza on Scotts. As I was checking out, the hotel staff said that they were adding 300 singapore dollars more to the bill (approximately 200 USD). When asked why, they said that I had been \"caught\" smoking in the non smoking room, and this was the penalty which they are going to impose on me. I stared incredulously at the staff for a few seconds at this accusation. Now I travel a lot for business, averaging 3 trips a month and have stayed in hotels in dozens of countries. I have never been accused of smoking in a non smoking room. I think the fact that I am a non smoker has helped in this aspect! I asked the staff how they had come to such a conclusion. The reply was a smoky smell had been detected in the room by the cleaning personnel. And, a manager had been sent up into the room when I was not there to confirm this. Aside from the privacy issues which we shall not even get into by that revelation, I told the staff that I was a non smoker. At this, they immediately went to Plan B, which was to say, they asked me if I had had company in my room? Another first for me in any hotel, being quizzed on check out whether I had invited someone to my hotel room. I said no, I did not, not that it was any business of theirs. I tried to be reasonable and calm but I got angry when one of the staff snorted in derision whenever I said that I had NOT smoked in the room. He said that \"everyone says that\" When I said I had not had anyone to the room, they said \"Just so you know, we can check the CCTV footage\". After a heated 20 min discussion, to which they refused to budge despite my protestations of innocence, I gave up and left as I had a plane to catch. When I checked my credit card bill a few weeks later, I saw that they did in fact tack on this extra charge, despite the fact that I had not smoked in the room. These are the disturbing questions: (1) How they can say with 100 percent certainty that someone had smoked in the room? Could not the smoky smell have been there before I arrived? (2) The fact that the staff has said \"everyone says that\" tells me I am not the first one accused of smoking - how many other guests have also been slapped with this extra charge despite not smoking in the room?

Another disappointment was that the pillow arent very comfortable. A little too soft and fluffy and doesnt provide much neck/head support. However, the bed was reasonably comfortable. My breakfast at the Carousel Restaurant in the hotel was quite good. Though the spread was not alot, the quality of the food is quite good. I thought it tasted better than that of the Pan Pacific!

Food is well we usually only have breakfast, but highly recommend it, although sometimse it can be very busy especially on the weekend Heat bar is nice to sit over the window stools and enjoy the world passing by.

They said they would, they even quoted me triple share rate. But wehn wearrived - no third bed was ready and we had to wait for a bed to be made up for us. We told them we were going to come again the following weeknd very late at night and please have athird bed ready! But when we arrived - no triple bed was ready nor a notation to that request!!

Our holiday coincided with the first ever Formula 1 in Singapore when hotel prices went through the roof. Although we had a terrific holiday, this hotel was not my 1st choise, actually my 5th, but the others were booked out for the F1. The outside is unimpressive and looks nothing like a hotel. Right next to a DFS deparment store which looked grander. The entrance area looks impressive, but has no baring on the rooms appearance or rest of the hotel. Reception was efficient & had our booking, all went smoothly. The entire hotel is smoke free. It must also be owned by Muslims as the menus had only 'turkey ham' and 'beef bacon'. There is also a Qaran in the bedside desk. Other than these, there were no other obvious indicators that is was owned/run by muslims. The room was smaller than expected. We got the standard (i think they call it the deluxe!) which doesnt include the free mini-bar and breakfast. That was an option when booking, but the added amount to have breakfast included was ridiculous. When we checked in, we were given the option again of adding breakfast each day at $28 singapore dollars +++. The +++ adds an extra 17% to the total bill for tax and service charge. You cant just have it 1 or 2 days of the breakfast, you must have it the entire stay. If you only want a few days breakfast there, its $32 +++. I do love the all you can eat style breakfast, but I certainly dont eat $37 worth. Esp when nearby local food halls have terrific food for $3! I had forgoten how expensive Singapore is when compared to say Thailand or Malaysia. Our room had 2 large (almost double sized) twin beds with very comfy, thick mattresses and extra long pillows. A large, flat screen TV and small fridge. Hairdryer, safe, iron and ironing board and plenty of mirrors including a full length one. The bathroom was very small too with just a shower. There was a normal sized shower head, and an absolutely enormous one too. Hot water was no problem. We occasionally could hear a door closing nearby, but never heard noise, tv or voices from either neighbouring rooms. The reading lights actually face down from the roof so blind your eyes. Very uncomfortable to read with. The TV has several English channels including 2 movie channels, several sports, BBC, CNN, Discovery, a few in Mandarin, 1 french, 1 Italian, 1 German, 1 from Brunei and a few from Malaysia. There was an adaptor for free internet, although we didnt bring out lap tops. Also a multi-plug adaptor fitted into the wall which was handy. I dont think any of the rooms have a particularity good view. We could see Scotts road by peering out. The windows didnt open and there is no balcony. There is a kettle with tea/coffee facilities of sorts. 2 tea bags, 2 sachets of coffee, 2 sugar sachets and only 1 mini-milk sachet in the fridge. The milk was only topped up on the 4th day and the others bits randomly. I had bought a small carton of milk at a 7 eleven by that stage. They also supplied 2x 600ml water bottles, but again these were random and not supplied every day like I suspect they are supposed to be. They weren't there initially and only turned up on day 2. The room was kept very clean whilst there. Sheets and towels changed when requested. Staff were always curtious, helpful and smiled. There is a buisiness lounge on the 2nd floor. Reception advised us (on day 5 of our stay!) that we were entiltled to 15mins free internet useage each. I ended up using it several times and was told that as long as no one was waiting, I could stay on using it and not restricted to just 15mins. The location of the hotel is very good. 2mins to orchard road & the MRT. Lots of local restaurants and shops to choose from. Room service and restaurant prices were terrible though. The pool was small for a so called 5 star hotel and the surrounding decked area became very full during the day. We requested late check out as our flight wasnt till 9pm. This wasnt granted, even though we offered to pay extra. (Due to the F1 booking out the hotel). We were able to shower in the pool showers, but this had no chair in the shower area, & not any room to relax and wait. We were told that they were considering adding some sort of comfort area for this in the future, as other customers had complained. When or if such a room will be provided, who knows.

After a LONG 18 hour flight from Los Angeles (transit at Taipei), we arrived at Singapore. We only stayed there for one night before heading to our Indonesia diving/snorkeling trip. We were both tired and just wanted to check-in the hotel and rest. We told the receptionist that we want a quiet room and were given an upgrade to their deluxe room with see-through window connecting the bathroom and bedroom. The room is nice with all the 4 star hotel amenities (plasma TV, 320-thread-count Egyptian cotton comforter), but the real standout is the free mini-bar and nice bathtub with separate shower. My girlfriend enjoyed her bubble bath especially after a long flight. The bath tub is decent size, and you can watch TV from the tub (through see-through glass), but can\u2019t hear it too well or change the channel because the TV is not in the bathroom. If you want some privacy in the bathroom, no problem, there is a blind you can pull down in the bathroom to cover the glass. The separate shower is decent size too, you have plenty of room in the shower (compared to Hilton, which is a separate report), and the best is the huge overhead shower head. It\u2019s the size of basketball which has really good water pressure too (very relaxing after a long flight). The free mini bar consists of roughly 10 bottles of drinks (2 tiger bears, 2 water, 2 juices, coke, diet coke, Milo), sorry memory is fading, should\u2019ve taken a picture of it. It is a very nice touch and most hotels would probably charge you $30 for all those drinks. Oh, forgot to mention, you can use their computer at business center for free the first 15 minutes. The only thing I don\u2019t like about Royal Plaza is they charge you $5.20 Singapore dollars for advance booking a taxi for you.

Good things about the hotel 1. Location is awesome: Close to MRT (subway), major shops, food, taxi 2. The free broadband was excellent. Fast, low latency. I was using the supplied Ethernet cable which I would recommend over wireless. 3. The taxi guy out the front was good. 4. 'What can I do for you' service was OK, fairly prompt when requesting ice. 5. The king size bed was super comfy (pillows were not heaven for me or my wife). 6. Was upgraded to the Deluxe Corner room which is slightly larger than Deluxe (thank you for that). Bad things about the hotel 1. Fair is fair, the free minibar is actually free, no catches when it comes to paying. However, there is still a catch! A normal minibar depending where you stay would contain: 2 to 8 snacks 4 to 10 mini spirit bottles 2 to 4 juices 2 to 6 beers (usually 2-3 different types) This absolutely free minibar contains: 0 Snacks 0 mini spirit bottles 2 juices 2 small cans of Tiger beer Altogether that is about 8 SGD worth of drinks. It is NOT false advertising, but definitely deceptive. 2. To top off the free mini-bar being a dud, it wasn't even stocked consistently. I drank my juice the first two days and was then hooked on having a nice morning juice, the next 7 days after that it was never restocked. Poor. 3. The lighting in the room we stayed in (Deluxe Corner) was poor, they need reading lights so you can set the mood for reading/tv/etc. You turn on the overhead bed lights are you blinded by giant Halogen floodlights. 4. Let's face it, even though you don't go on holiday to watch TV, sometimes you end up watching it while you wait for a place to open or while relaxing in the room. Free to air offerings were fine. Pay movies were non-existent even though we wanted to watch something. 5. Hotel has those giant 'king sized' pillows. I asked for foam instead, they took two goes for them to bring something that was actually foam. Still huge, however sufficient to let me and my wife to get some sleep. Could have been a better experience. 6. Shower, we didn't enjoy, needle spray, needs a shower curtain or door, water went all over the floor. 7. An ice machine would be nice so I don't have to call up when I run out, proper drinking glasses rather than toothbrush holder glasses also. 8. The maid forgot to give us a spare toilet roll on more than one occasion (we did run out and had to phone them). 9. Room service isn't just expensive like most hotels, it is insanely expensive.

During checkin we were told it was no problem but at checkout we were charged for breakfast for 2 days, while we requested only one. That was the reason why we booked the hotel without breakfast in first place, because we knew that we were leaving very early in the morning on the second day. The staff wasn't very friendly while dealing with this problem. We were just told it wasn't possible to take breakfast for one day and not the second day, which is one of the most stupid things you can hear after booking a room without breakfast. It is a minor thing but ended up being really annoying.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Concord,CA", "Title": "\u201cWould go back.\u201d", "Author": "tei1988", "ReviewID": "UR19321213", "Content": "Stayed at the RP for 6 nights: was back in Singapore to attend a reunion and visit family.

I'm not sure if I made the right decision on either count. Firstly, I think I was wrong about the location- Singapore tourist life seems to be moving nearer to the harbour nowadays and so, if you wanted to do anything, you had to take the MRT or a taxi. Secondly, I have mixed feelings about the club room. On the plus side- the view was fine, despite what previous reviewers have said; the room was a decent size and there were very good in-room amenities; the club lounge offered a good breakfast and even afternoon tea, which was impressive on the one occasion I could try it. On the negative side- I had chosen a club room specifically so that I would be able to check in to my flight at 10.55pm, the 24 hours advance notice that BA seems to need if you are going to get a decent seat. When I turned up at the lounge at 10.45pm, I was immediately told somewhat curtly by no fewer than two members of staff that they were about to close-even though no mention of a closing time had been made earlier. I enquired further and found that the lounge in fact shut at 11pm. When I said that I would be finished and out by then, this did not seem to go down well. I was as good as my word and left by 11pm but the episode left a bad taste. I said as much in my customer survey. When the Duty manager wanted to see me after I had checked out, I thought that it might be to express some regret for the previous night. Not at all- it was to ask me if I had taken a bath robe, as house keeping had reported one missing fron my room! (I had assumed that I was meant to have only been given one robe, as I was staying on my own).

The hotel is very well located on Scotts Road, just a few mins walk to the Orchard Rd MRT station and all the shops/amenities that Orchard Rd offers. It is essentially a very \u201cbusiness\u201d style hotel, but this isn\u2019t a bad thing! Rates are reasonable by central Singapore standards and the service/standards at the hotel are excellent. There is a complimentary mini-bar in all rooms (OK, so we know they take that into account when setting the room rates, but it FEELS like something for nothing!), which we found very useful! Every day it is stocked with 2 cans of beer, some water, orange juice, Coke/Diet Coke, and another juice drink \u2013 if nothing else, with the heat and humidity in Singapore, we took the water out with us every day and then had a beer upon our return! There is also free Wi-fi access, and they give you a password when you 1st check-in \u2013 I tried to use it on my PSP, which admittedly is NOT ideal for this sort of service, and got access to the network but found response times very slow. Likely to be far better on a laptop, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it being mega-speedy. But for free access, it\u2019s a very good service. The bed was very large and comfy and, as you would expect, standards of cleanliness were excellent. There was also a good range of complimentary toiletries in the bathroom. We didn\u2019t eat at the restaurant there as it was quite expensive (but not more so than all the other good hotel restaurants in that area) and, in the limited time we had, we wanted to try some of the Hawker Markets and go down for a meal to Clarke Quay. There was also entertainment at the 1st floor bar every night, and the resident band were very good. Again, bar prices were quite expensive but not more so than anywhere else on Scotts/Orchard \u2013 we had a couple of cocktails, and at least you could taste what you were paying for, they were pretty lethal!! Some general tips for Singapore: It\u2019s pretty easy to see a good deal and do everything you want to in 3 days, maybe even 2. The tourist travel passes are brilliant \u2013 3 day use of buses and trains for about \u00a310. The MRT system is very easy to navigate and is clean, safe & reliable \u2013 you simply tap your pass on the pad at all the entrance/exit barriers and it lets you through. Same on the buses \u2013 you tap your card against the pads as you enter AND leave the bus. Singapore is probably the cleanest, safest city I\u2019ve ever visited. We didn\u2019t see one instance of graffiti anywhere, and very little litter. One of the best things we did was the Jurong Bird Park \u2013 you take the MRT and bus to get there (plenty of directions/signs available), which is a lot easier than you may think. The bird park is very well laid out, with multiple different \u2018areas\u2019 and places to sit and have a picnic. Don\u2019t forget to buy a tub of food for $2 (about 80p) and feed the lorikeets! A visit over on the cable car to Sentosa is a nice trip out, especially for those with children as there are beaches/activities over there. The botanic gardens are lovely for a walk round/chill out, especially as entry is free. Bars/restaurants around the Boat Quay/Clarke Quay areas are great \u2013 and you can take boat tours along the river from there, which are good value. The newly-opened Singapore Flyer is a big tourist attraction \u2013 beware the queues!!!! My husband booked online before we travelled and paid an extra \u00a35 each to go \u201cExpress\u201d, which gave us a guaranteed time slot and an escort to the front of the queue, via the back corridors! We weren\u2019t sure if it would be worth it until we got there and saw the queue!!!! This was at 7.30pm on a Sat evening and the queue was somewhere between 2 and 3 hours\u2026. Be warned\u2026 Everyone has to make at least a fleeting visit to Raffles Hotel whilst in Singapore \u2013 the Long Bar is well signed and is where you can get a Singapore Sling in the place it was invented!! Be warned, it is NOT cheap, but it\u2019s kinda one of those things you \u201chave\u201d to do\u2026 Oh, and expect it to rain at some point, because you won\u2019t go more than 2 or 3 days at the most without a torrential downpour!!", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Place\u201d", "Author": "Globe-spanner", "ReviewID": "UR16801070", "Content": "This hotel was quite simply very good.

If I were to return to Singapore - this would be my pick again. This was the 10th trip to Singapore and this hotel was probably the best I have stayed, especially the location. Scotts Road is a buzz of activity and so convenient. I had good intentions to travel via the MRT, but in the end travelled everywhere via taxi. Too convenient when there is one waiting right at the front door for you everytime you step out. The staff were very unintrusive, and I did not have a lot to do with them apart from the 2 minute check in and out. The room was small but roomy enough especially since we didnt spend that much time there. We had twin beds which are equivalent to a small double bed. I left a list for housekeeping ( a long list mind you) and they accommodated and gave us everything on the list. Now the little gripes - The kettle in our room was terrible and had to be boiled twice and there was no clock which was a bit of a pain. Take your own hairdryer as the one supplied is attached inside the bedside drawer and the on button had to be held down constantly.... this was very annoying. The curtains are great though - block out which keeps the room nice and dark. I cant rave about the buffet breakfast.... very very ordinary compared to other hotel buffets I have had, but ample enough. I would not pay extra for the breakfast (we had it included in our rate) as there is food very close by. I loved the fact that MCDonalds - MCCafe was right next door as I could get my coffee fix regularly. The buffet finishes at 10am which I think is too early - especially when you are in no rush to get up in the morning as the shops dont open till 10-11am. The free water and drinks was a great bonus as there is not really a supermarket that close to buy these things.

I stayed here on a one night stopover whilst on business. Check-in was ok, I was repeatedly advised that the hotel is strictly non-smoking (which I wouldn't have known becuase I couldn't have seen the half dozen signs in reception telling me and the declaration of a $300 per day \"fee\" for cleaning the room in the event that I did smoke on the check-in form). Despite this I was asked to sign an acceptance of this condition despite it not being mentioned at the time of booking. Regardless I was happy to sign as I do not smoke and hate being in a non-smoking room where somebody has smoked so this was all very acceptable if not unorthodox. The room was pleasant enough, modern furnishing, a bit of a dank smell (combination of aircon and lack of ventilation of fresh air). Window faced onto another building so no sunlight. Internet connection was free so this was a real plus as I was on business. The free minibar is ok (not quite a minibar, more of a mini-minibar but hey it was free so I'll leave it there). The bathroom is quite small and poorly laid out (don't expect to use the bidet as there is no water pressure). The whole bathroom thing got worse the following morning. I rose early to catch my onward flight (6am) to discover that there was no hot water. I thought at first that it would just get warmer and I hopped in. Alas it was freezing for the entire shower so I woke up very quickly. When checking out I mentioned this and was told that I was in a corner room so it takes a while to heat up. There was no apology, no response to \"how long does it take to heat up\" unlike the repeated references to smoking at check-in. I therefore decided to give this hotel a miss for future trips as I like a hot (even a warm) shower in the mornings. Whilst the hotel was quite modern, it appears to lack soul. The service is a bit perfunctory and there was little or no personal touch even when problems occur.

The kids are getting older and probably won't be holidaying with us much longer, so this year we splashed out with a 10-day stay in Singapore and chose the Royal Plaza on Scotts. Despite booking 7 months in advance, this was the only hotel that I could find that had two rooms available on the same dates for such a long stay. I ended up booking directly through their website, which was easy and straightforward. A few weeks before our stay they emailed me, asking if we had any special requirements. I reminded them that we required adjoining rooms and an extra bed in one of the rooms and they confirmed that this had been noted. Upon arrival, check-in was quick and easy. We were put on the 5th floor, handy for the swimming pool. Rooms were adjoining and a reasonable size with king-size beds. Previous experience (on other holidays) led us to expect the kids to argue over who was going to sleep in the crappy, tiny rollaway bed - but no, here in this hotel the bed has a proper mattress and was a standard size single bed, so all children were able to sleep comfortably. The bed was made up ready for our late arrival but we had to remind them to bring an extra set of towels, this was done within minutes of our request. The suitcases were brought up quickly too. The rooms only had showers, not a problem with our older children, but might be if you had little ones to bath each night. The rooms were very clean, bathrooms were always clean, all-in-all we couldn't fault the housekeeping service. The kids loved the way their pj's were folded up neatly for them and teddies placed on pillows! The mini-bars were topped up daily (complimentary beer and soft drinks). On the first day I left a note asking that no beer be put in the kids fridge, instead they replenished the fridge with extra soft drinks. We always had plenty of soft drinks/water bottles to take out with us on our sightseeing trips, so this was very handy. The staff noticed that we were big tea drinkers and always left extra tea bags and milks. We only needed to ring down to reception with one small problem during our stay; the remote control wasn't working and needed new batteries and this was fixed straightaway. There was no view from the window but we were never in the room long enough to worry about that. To use the lifts and to get back to your room from the swimming pool, you have to remember to carry your keycard with you at all times, but they do give you 2 for each room. The swimming pool was about 15metres long, so ok for lap-swimming, ideal for kids cooling off, plenty of sunloungers and towels available. Clean changing rooms and toilets, and a sauna available. A function room is located on the other side of the pool and this was often in use, but for the staff and business people to get to it, they had to walk along the edge of the pool, which seems to me poor planning and could be dangerous due to the permanently wet floor, especially with the waiters walking back and forth with food and crockery. It was a little off-putting sun-bathing in a bikini with gents in business suits walking back and forth during breaks. The hotel rooms were pricey, but no more than other similar hotels in Singapore, and it's a fact of life for those families with 3 children that you always have to fork out for 2 rooms. So to pay $30+ per person for breakfast each morning, wasn't going to happen! We're not fast-food people, but on this occasion it was very handy that there is a McDonald's and a McCafe located just a few metres up the street. Just a bit further up is the entrance to the MRT, very handy. Outside the hotel, getting a taxi was never a problem, with porters always ready to wave one in for you. Going back into the lobby after a day's sightseeing was always welcoming, it looks so bright and clean with very cool air-conditioning and it always looked lovely at night with the candles lit up. Upon check-out there were no discrepancies with the bill, no extra charges to query which is always a relief.

We got upgraded to an deluxe executive room - though we had no need for a desk, we think it might have been bigger than the deluxe room we had originally booked. The first night they delivered a Happy honeymoon cake. It might be a local cake as I have not tasted anything quite like it. But it was absolutely delicious! I loved the crunchy poppyseed layer inside - yum! The bathroom was ultra modern and the range of toiletries great. Robes were comfy as were the slippers. Not sure if all hotels have it, but there was a universal powerpoint in the wall, which came in handy as we didn't realise Singapore had a different plug to Thailand. Big plasma screen TV on the wall. The mini bar was a nice touch - took the bottles of water out whilst exploring/shopping, and then a cold Tiger beer each once we got home :) The best thing about the hotel is the location.

Because I'm already here and don't need to worry about getting a booking I feel I can let you in on a great deal in Singapore.(Can be tough to make a reservation here, as since the recent renovations and their 'Carousel' restaurant winning the best newcomer buffet for 2007 award, this hotel is quickly growing in popularity) I travel with my husband a lot for work, and between us we have visited many other hotels in Singapore before finding this one including: The Meritus Mandarin (incredibly noisy and appalling service) Copthorne Kings (simply awful) Novotel Clarke Quay (OK, but just another hotel nothing special) Marina Mandarin (was OK, but have not gone back) Hilton (needs serious refurbishment and quickly) and many others that I can't even remember now.... So, on with the story. The Royal Plaza on Scotts keeps drawing us back as it represents good value for money (talking about club room deal), is in the centre of town right near Orchard Road for shopping and keeps us both happy. It has recently been refurbished, so all of the rooms feel clean and new with flat screen TV's, king sized beds, a comfy blue velour chair in the corner to throw your clothes over. lol. and the bathrooms feel clean and have a separate bath and shower (a must in my books. I do not take showers in a bath). There is a glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom so the room feels bigger (can pull down a blind don't worry) and everything just works. You get free internet throughout the entire hotel at all hours (wi-fi or cable, with cables provided in the room if you're not up with the latest technology). This level of service is great and means I can relax by the pool with my laptop if I want to. The pool is pretty basic as is the gym, but that's not why we stay here. We come here for the club room food and drinks deal. We always upgrade to the club room for an extra $60 per day for two of us which gets us the following: 6.30am - 10am - Full breakfast either served in the club room upstairs (if you want to avoid the rif-raff) or downstairs in the public breakfast lobby if you want slightly more choices, as the buffet is huge. There is a full cooked section with eggs any way you like, pancakes, waffles, curries, fish, mash potato, noodles, chinese dumplings, congee... you get the picture. A cold section with fruits, cereal, yoghurt and a bakery section with pastries. Coffee and tea is free flowing as are the many juices. 3pm-5pm - Afternoon tea served upstairs in the club room (no rif-raff). More hot food selections like noodles, prawns, fried dumplings as well as cakes, scones, cream, jams, lemon butter, desserts, fruit, water, tea and coffee. BTW, when I say water we're talking bubbly Perrier served in a glass with ice and a slice of lime, not tap. This is the best bit... 5.30pm-8pm - Cocktail time!!! Served in the club room, with all of the other happy guests. Fab hot and cold canapes served on spoons and mini dishes just like at a nice function - all alongside a table of breads, cheeses and desserts. The menu changes every night and for example last night some of the cold spoons were smoked salmon rolls topped with sour cream and chives,thai influenced beef rolls, chicken breast with tomato salsa dressing and the hot dishes were sauteed fish with lemon butter sauce and capers, mini lasagnes and prawn skewers wrapped in turkey bacon with a triad of sauces. AND ALL OF THIS IS SERVED WITH FREE FLOW SPARKLING WINE, WHITE WINE, RED WINE, BEER and BASIC SPIRITS for the 2.5 hour duration. Ths is very exciting to drinkers like us who pay a minimum of AUS$60 for a bottle of wine out at dinner in Singapore. Between the two of us we easily make our club room money back on drinks during cocktail hour and we can't recommend this deal enough for drinkers visiting Singapore. (If you haven't been to Singapore before and you're a foodie from Melbourne, prepare to die at the price of wine and 'high end' food BTW) In fact, we often make reservations for dinner and come 8pm, we cancel because we are completely stuffed from the canapes.... So there you have it. The club room deal just keeps us coming back again and again!

The hotel is situated on Scotts Road at the junction with Orchard Road which is fantastic location. You can shop till you drop on Orchard road which is literally a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Also Orchard MRT (underground trains) station is less than 5 minute walk. From the swift check in which was smooth, went up to our room on the 10th floor. The room was a deluxe room and it was spacious enough with wall mounted flat screen TV, queen size bed, table and chair, wardrobe with bathrobesand free minibar which was replinished daily. The mini bar contained 2 beers, 2 small bottles of water and 4 cans of non-alcoholic drinks. Bathroom was ok size with walk-in shower and free toiletries. You need the room keycard to access your floor as well as your room and also to turn on the electricity in your room. You also got complimentary newspaper every morning. Breakfast was included in our price and this was excellent with lots of fruit, cold meats, western style cooked breakfast as well as continental type breakfast as well as asian type breakfast.Since it was all buffet style you can pick and choose what you wanted. One thing to note is that there is no pork served so you have to eat chicken or turkey sausages! If you have your own laptop, wi-fi is free anywhere in the hotel but if not you can use the busines centre computers for 15 minutes a day free after which they charge you. Did not use the pool, so can't comment. Since our flight was late in the evening, we asked for late checkout but they could give us only a few more hours than normal checkout but they did let us use the concierge service to leave the bags during the day and also the shower facilities next to the pool after we had checked out.

I noted that it was stated on the on-line booking confirmation \"cancellations and/or amendments made within 21 days prior to arrival date will be subject to full charge.\" I felt that this was reasonable again given the busy time for visitors. You can imagine my shock when I received an email from the hotel (yesterday) asking for FULL, NON-REFUNDABLE payment for the whole amount 4,320 SGD by 24th December 2007. THis is for a booking in September 2008. I rang the hotel and expressed my disappointment and told them it was immoral to expect full non-refundable payment some 9 nine months in advance.

I have to say the lobby was impressive and it was nice to wander through the paintings on display. We had a small problem on arrival as we had requested a room with twin beds but were given a room with two beds made up as a king bed. The housekeeping staff were efficient in re-making the beds as we had requested. Our room was on the 7th floor facing a multistorey carpark and the back of another building however since we didn't spend much time in our room, the lack of view wasn't an issue. The free minibar was appreciated at the end of a hot day and having free access to internet service (even for just 15 minutes) was great. We found the room clean and enjoyed the comforts of modern furnishings and bathroom. I would probably have put the hairdryer in a more convenient location - not tucked into a tight spot in the room. It was great to be able to step out of the hotel and be within metres of shops. It's good to learn the underground routes around the Scotts and Orchard Rds area as it keeps you out of the heat and the tropical rain.

Good choice of toileteries and proper bath sized towels. The staff were very friendly and helpful, reception has good staffing levels so check in/out is speedy and efficient. Overall the hotel is well appointed and is in a great location for the professional shopper and tourist but perhaps not the best spot for the \"City Slickers\" as the financial area is about 10 - 15 mins away by cab depending on traffic. As to the downside, I personally prefer a lounge/bar area close to the entrance foyer not on the 1st floor, not only for all we people watchers but to spot friends on arrival. However I reserve my main beef for the restaurant, not because it is buffet only, but because it is Halal. ( It does have a wine list howebver). So all of us who like a great English or American breakfast or just a Continental get used to Turkey or Beef \"Bacon\" not streaky/Canadian and no cold ham, prosciuttio etc either- for obvious reasons the owner, The Sultan of Brunei, is not a fan of these products. Regrettably you'll be hard pressed to find any mention of this on their website and there's me thinking that Singapore is a great example of transparency for SE Asia.

We stayed for two nights in September 2007 and were delighted with all aspects of our stay. Location: The hotel is on Scotts Road, about 200m down from the crossroads with Orchard Road. As such, the hotel is in a perfect location. We arrived at the hotel by taxi from the airport ($25). The MRT (metro) station at Orchard is 5 mins walk away and the efficiency and cleanliness of this system makes getting anywhere in the City from RPS a breeze. Orchard road is shopping heaven and most of the malls are easily reached on foot from RPS. Welcome: We were met at the door by the porters who immediately whisked our bags away and directed us towards the reception desk. Check in was easy and the staff were friendly and efficient. We were given our keys (cards), told about the hotel facilities and offered an upgrade (at a price of $50/night) to a higher standard of room. The fee would also allow us to have breakfast. We declined, and kept our standard room. The Room: Access to the lifts is controlled by your key card, which stops people being able to access the floors they have no business accessing! This is a good security measure. Our room was on the 6th floor. It was spacious and clean with modern decor. We considered the bed there to be one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in. The air conditioning worked well (essential in Singapore!) and the room had a 32\" LCD television mounted on the wall in front of the bed. There was a LAN cable for laptop internet connectivity. The shower room contained a lovely 'rain' shower and was luxuriously appointed. You get shampoo, shower gel and body moisturiser, as well as cotton wool etc. Towels were white, soft and clean. The toilet was clean and there was a modern bowl-style basin. All in all, we were delighted. There is a complimentary mini-bar in every room - our contained juice, soft drinks, water and beer.. and this was replenished daily - a nice touch. Facilities: We didn't use the hotel facilities, but did have a look at the swimming pool. This was fine, but at the time we wanted to use it was full of boisterous American guys splashing around, so we gave it a miss - not the hotel's fault and the pool looked fine. Any problems? Only one, very slight issue... we weren't leaving Singapore until the evening, so checked out in the morning and left our bags. We did a load of shopping and wanted to pack some of the items into our luggage before heading to the airport. The concierge got us the bags, but then asked if we were needing a cab to the airport. We had chosen to get the MRT (quicker during peak times and miles cheaper!) so declined. He would not allow us to sit in reception with our bags and certainly wouldn't let us open them to put our shopping in. I can appreciate that they don't want people opening their stuff up all over the lobby, but all we wanted was to unlock the bag and slip stuff in the top! He did offer to let us go into a room out the back and do it, but we declined and went outside and did it on the pavement instead! Overall: Despite our issue at the end, we loved the hotel and would happily stay there again, and recommend this to anyone.

I'm coming since quite some years to Singapore and I have found my favorite hotel here already (and I didn't change my mind after this stay) - but this time I thought its time to try somthing else. The Royal Plaza location is very good, more or less in the center of Orchard road - just a few steps out of the hotel and you are in the middle of this shopping street. Even though after years I have discovered that nothing is cheap here. At least there are probably few places in the world where you have such a high rate of premium brand stores. Walking on Orchard is simply a good entertainment, even if you buy nothing. So this I consider as a big plus. Food: of course the hotel has a restaurant but on Orchard you find many more. I prefer Hawker food - which are these nice little boothes where you can order many dishes and share with your friends - and the best of it: outside with no aircondition! That Hawker food is typically less expensive and quite original is the other plus. So staying in Scotts you can easily walk either to a newly built Hawker center on Orchard - just follow the road down to the center of Singapore and you find it shortly after the visitor center on the left or you simply follow Scotts road down to Newton Circle - there is one of the most famous Hawker places in SG - but typically very crowded with tourists. For more original good food you better sit in a taxi and ask the taxi driver for more locations. I also like the Old Market very much which is in the business district. An old market hall from the early 1900's. Now lets talk about the hotel: checkin and the service are excellent and much above the standard. Very friendly and competent. The hotel itself looks every time I go there like just been build. I guess constant renovation is the key. The rooms itself are very tiny. The bathroom was my highlight: I don't like having a shower in the bathtub - I want a real shower and this is what you get here. Even the bathroom is very small, it has a nice and big shower with a real glas door to it where you can simply enjoy the morning. The rest of the room by the way is unspectacular. Nicely equipped to a high standard, with plat panel screen attached to the wall. But the most important: a high speed internet access for free. The free minibar you can forget about: 2 little water, 2 beer, 4 soft drinks. I only had water and 2 is in a location like SG simply too less. So I still have to buy it outside and carry it in the hotel. The pool and the gym: I didn't use both, because I had too less time. But I checked the pool area and I have to admid that it is ok, but much bejond my favorite hotel in SG. The pool is small, the pooldeck is even smaller and you have no view over Singapore. For just a bit of swimming ok, but not for spending there a full day. The breakfast: this is really good and can compete with my favorite one. But one big disadvantage: no pork! I like to have bacon in the morning, but here they either serve beef or turkey bacon - both not my tast. Beside this the food is excellent! Lots of egg choises and they make that fresh for you. The best waffles and pancakes I ever had in a hotel (of course at home that's better ;-). Fruits, salats, bread, cerials etc - as much as you like. And not to forget the asian bar with stuff what we consider as dinner. I can eat that for breakfast as well and it was so good! Most obvious I put on some weight :-) Finally I was very pleased with this hotel and by sure I will come back here. But even with this wonderful experience I do not change my favorite hotel in Singapore because of the nicer pool.

(Plese see review for first four days at Raffles The Plaza and a Trip Report is still to come). The last two nights of our trip were spent at Royal Plaza on Scotts (RPS), July 11 and July 12. The excellent customer service began before we even left Australia when, after directly booking their best price for two Premiere rooms (1 X King and 1 X Twin, connecting) on the website, we received both confirmation and welcome emails. Then, within a couple of hours, I happened to stumble upon a significantly cheaper rate on another website (all others I'd seen previously had been more expensive than RPS own website offer) and contacted the hotel asking for their policy on Best Rate Guarantee. Whilst the cheaper price did not fully qualify (as it was not instantly confirmed) the hotel came back to me the next business day and said they would match the rate - this actually saved me about AU$300 as we had booked two rooms for two nights so I was very pleased and had a great feeling about the hotel right from the start. I was already aware that RPS was an \"inner city\" type of hotel which is what we needed for our two days of shopping. No views, but an excellent location near Orchard MRT and across the road from Far East Plaza and the Grand Hyatt with Tangs and Lucky Plaza just around the corner. The hotel is easy to miss from the outside but it is right next to DFS Galleria which has a large shop front. The lobby is very special and one very quickly leaves the bustling feel of the city behind within a few steps. Michelle checked us in and she was very helpful. Initially though the rate she had us booked at was not the cheaper one confirmed days earlier by email so luckily I had a copy of the email with me which she took to confirm the lower rate. Also our connecting room was not going to be vacant until closer to 10pm (it was 5pm at this stage as we had just arrived via ferry from Bintan - another review on this part of trip will follow). She did her best to see if anything else was available but as the hotel was full this was not possible. So we happily checked into one of our rooms and then went off to explore - upon our return just after 9pm our other room was ready and the rate had been sorted out. Michelle was still on duty and handled the situation very well. The hotel has recently been fully refurbished and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. Quite small (enough room to walk around beds, plus built-in good-sized desk and one arm chair) but we were expecting this so were not disappointed. As we had booked Premiere Rooms we had rooms on the 12th floor and each bathroom had a bath. The rain shower was the best shower I have ever had in my life! It was sensational! Much better than the one at Raffles The Plaza! The beds were comfy and pillows great. The flat screen TV was fantastic. The complimentary mini bar - beer, soft drink and water - was the best thing when you're travelling with two teenagers! Loved it! I never did see the pool so can't comment - although I understand it is more of a lap style. The buffet breakfast in The Carousel was very good but not excellent. Service was a bit erratic and toaster did not work well, but the tea (when it eventually arrived) was hot! I suppose we were spoiled by the breakfast at Raffles The Plaza and for many people The Carousel would seem first class. Our second day at RPS was actually my husband's birthday and at 9pm that evening there was a knock on the door and a tray with a spray of singapore orchids and a truly divine cake from the chocolate shop downstairs was delivered as a gift from the Hotel. It was accompanied by a handwritten birthday card. How special was that!! We organised a late check out on one of the rooms from 12 noon - 4pm @ S$20 per hour as our flight did not leave until the evening. This was easily organised when we checked in. Our check out was efficient and friendly without a hitch. All in all a wonderful choice and I will return there on my next trip to Singapore.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "shropshire, uk", "Title": "\u201cexcellent value\u201d", "Author": "jkiwi", "ReviewID": "UR8127341", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel on each leg of our tri[p to New Zealand.

The hotel is located on Scott just off Orchard so it's very close to many conveniences like shopping, food, The Coffee Bean and Tealeaf/Starbuck's location war, and the MRT. Check in was quick and the curb staff was very attentive. Our first impression of our room was that it was tiny so we were disappointed at that. It contained a king bed, a desk with a chair, a sitting chair, a bathroom with a shower, and a walk in closet with mini bar. The mini bar consisted of coffee/tea service and beverages (sodas and bottled water) which was replenished daily. The staff was happy to accomodate us with just water since we don't drink sodas (we left a note with the sodas and they were changed out the next day). The room had a mounted wide screen tv opposite the bed and the usual nice hotel things like iron/board, hairdryer, bathrobes/slippers, daily newspaper, laundry service, daily maid/turndown service. The room was comfortable despite it's size and it was very clean. The nice details were the bed (which had a down comforter, mattress pad, and pillows) and the shower (which was roomy with a handheld and a big rainfall showerhead). It was nice to have the walk in to stow away our luggage and the car seat and the front hall was large enough to keep our stroller handy. One of the disadvantages was that there wasn't a table other than the desk. We have a toddler so when we needed to eat in there was no place to really feed her. And the obvious with a small room was that there was no place for her to roam aside from the closet. Also, when you used the faucet in the bathroom, the drain was really loud and there was a mere 1/2 \" clearance from the toilet and the bathroom door when it was opened so there's some maneuvering to be done to open/close the door depending on where you are in the room. The hotel has a couple of restaurants but we chose to eat outside of the hotel for a couple of reasons. The prices were high and there were better options for us nearby (we are vegetarian). There is also a pool and gym that we never got around to seeing or using. Overall our stay was pleasant. The staff couldn't be more attentive and the location was excellent. Although our room wasn't the best choice for our family, I imagine it would be great for a single person on business. We got a fair deal online so it made the whole experience fine. Some pointers: *the key card is needed to use the elevators. *the key card is needed to keep everything on in the room: There is a holder by the door that powers the lights and tv. *check out the shower knob before you turn it on. There is a midline for off and turning one way gives you the handheld and turning the opposite gives you the showerhead. You can't really feel when you've hit the midline and a few times, while trying to rinse off my child's feet, we walked out of the bathroom with our clothes soaking wet. *there is a charge for local calls (although not much) *internet is free *the building is non smoking", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLoved ROYAL PLAZA ON SCOTTS.

I asked my TA to book me there. She got a rate of AUD 640 for 3 nights with a late check out. BTW RPS charges by the hour for late check outs. I joined IPrefer beforehand as it is their loyalty plan and the website says members receive an upgrade if possible. I was planning on staying again in October. I arrived at 11.00pm and initially they told me that I had to pay for the late check. I showed them the booking details. Then I asked them for the upgrade for IPrefer. That was definitely not forthcoming but they gave me a S$20 voucher for lunch or dinner. You need to ask. However, the restaurant will be closed on Monday as it was their Grand Opening. When I arrived in the room, it was tiny!!. Nothing like the pictures in reviews. By this time it was midnight. I immediately got wireless connection which was great. I then curled up in bed to read my book. Turned the overhead ceiling bed light on and all the lights in room, including the spotlight opposite the bed over the mirror. There are no bedside lamps. There was no way to read without feeling like you were in an interrogation room. Called front desk. They told me to move to other side of the bed and turn that light on. It is impossible to turn that light on unless the master on the other side is on which turns every light in the room on again. If you had a partner sleeping with you, he/she could not turn the light on to go to the bathroom. He would have to wake you to get you to turn the master on. The hotel engineer came up and checked it. He said that was how all the rooms in the hotel were wired. Duty manager phoned and apologised. Agreed this was a OHS issue. Turned lights off - the noise from trucks below and service kept me awake. Complained the next morning and they moved me up a couple of floors to a regular room. Realised that the initial room abutted the service lift and was two/thirds size of reg. room. Therefore the wardrobe was at the back of the bathroom and pushed the bed right down to the window. Still have lighting problem. Hotel provided me with a bed lamp which was perfect, but the wiring for the rooms need to be reconfigured. When I checked in they offered me breakfast at S$20 per day (net net) if bought upfront, otherwise it would be S$37.00. I bought the 3 breakfasts which were OK. However, the restaurant is Halal and the last morning I brought my tube of vegemite (Vegetarian yeast extract) and a waiter told me I couldn't eat it as it was Halal. Next time I will eat outside. I had a lot of appointments on the Monday and went across the street for dinner at the Far East Plaza. After doing a bit of shopping I was buggered. Arrived back at the hotel at 7.00pm to be told I couldn't enter as it was the Grand Opening. (Hotel) Guests arrived from the airport, joggers were waiting, A family had a baby who needed to be fed and changed, I needed to call my daughter before she went to bed in Australia. We all had to wait for half an hour while the festivities went on. Finally, the jogger rebelled and they were forced to let us into the hotel so we could get to our rooms. I think it would have been nice to have in someway included the hotel guests in the opening. On the positive side, the minibar is nice, staff tried to resolve issues and the beds are nice. Just insist you are not give Rm 516 or equivalent. I don't think you should get the worst room in the house because you are checking at a late time. I was always able to get a taxi.

It included complementary buffet breakfast for two, complementary minibar (minibar was a bit of a disappointment as it just included some basic drinks) and free broadband or wi-fi. The hotel was recently renovated (wasn't sure if my room was renovated but it certainly looked new). Service was excellent.

The staff's accommodation of little requests like early/late check-in, changing of some drinks in mini-bar from beer to cola, etc. sure made me feel at home and important. The only disadvantage I can see is that for those who are into heavy shopping, a little walking is required. I usually used the underpass to get from Scotts to Orchard where most of the big stores are (e.g. Takashimaya). One big plus is that I wanted to join the night safari and since I was alone, it would have been too expensive for me to take a cab to go there.

Our room was of ample size and exceptionally clean and comfortable. We had a club room on the 15th floor, which meant the bathroom contained a bath tub as well as large separate (rain) shower. It was well stocked with toiletries which were replenished daily. One oddity is the large plate glass window between the bathroom and the sleeping area - but it has a blind which can be drawn for privacy. There was a good sized desk in the room, a huge bed, a flat screen TV mounted on the wall and a mini bar which is stocked with complimentary soft drinks, water and beer, replenished daily. There were tea and coffee making facilities in the room. There was a hairdryer, ironing board and iron and a safe, but no clock. Although the room was occupied by two people, there was only one bath robe provided (but two pairs of slippers). I have no idea why one bathrobe in a double occupied room seems to be the norm in so many hotels. A club room entitles you to use the club lounge on the 15th floor, where complimentary breakfast (a very wide choice of hot and cold, local and western dishes) and afternoon tea (again hot and cold, local and western dishes) is served. Between 6.00pm and 8.00pm complimentary alcoholic drinks and hot and cold food is available. This is advertised as cocktails and canapes, but in fact you can have any alcoholic drink you want, and the food is more substantial than you might expect. Unless you have a very hearty appetite you could easily survive on the complimentary food provided. There are two PCs in the lounge for guests to use. A word of warning to smokers - this really is a 100% non smoking hotel. There was an ashtray situated outside the hotel for guests to use when we arrived, but it had been removed by the end of our stay. It is not illegal to smoke in the street in Singapore, but it is clearly disliked by many Singaporeans, who make their distaste very clear. The hotel has a bus stop right outside and the MRT underground rail system is just a few minutes walk away. If I am lucky enough to visit Singapore again I will certainly stay in this hotel.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended\u201d", "Author": "Brian66", "ReviewID": "UR7284066", "Content": "It's hard to find a perfect hotel (except maybe the Peninsula in Bangkok), but this one does it's best. We stayed for 11 days which is a fair test. Check in was around midnight and the service was excellent. The entire hotel is non-smoking, which for us was a bonus. The room was a little small but most adequate, with a flat panel TV on the wall, a good work station, bar fridge, coffee and tea kettle and a very comfortable king sized bed. Try to get the odd numbered rooms as they have much better exposure to pool and view. (such as it is in Singapore.) We noticed a small amount of water on the marble floor when we first entered the bathroom. Next morning we called and they sent someone up to repair the leak. This hotel had just finished a major remodel, so you can expect the odd problem. In the end they moved us to the room next door, which had the same bathroom without the leak. I rank a lot of hotels by the shower and the rain shower head in these bathrooms was one of the best I've ever used. The rate included an excellent breakfast buffet, which catered to all the different ethnic meal choices very well. In addition they restocked the bar in our room every day and supplied high speed internet access (that worked) both at no additional charge. One little tip...they are demolishing a building located between the Hyatt and Marriot, which are across the street from the Royal Plaza. Although the noise was considerable 12 hours a day, it was not apparent in our hotel, but must have been terrible in the those two hotels.", "Date": "April 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "aussie", "Title": "\u201cFANTASTIC PLACE! 5* +++++ service!!!! 11 out of 10!!\u201d", "Author": "ktmack89", "ReviewID": "UR7201345", "Content": "Royal Plaza on Scotts!!! Well i havent been to singapore in years and before my daughter started uni, and started back at work- we decided to take a trip to singapore. We were searching through the places- and we saw that this hotel had just undergone major major renovations. THis place is great value!!! Nice rooms- make sure you get the view towards the pool- in singapore the view is always mainly buildings but its better this side. THe staff were brilliant! I would say that they are defintely 5 star +++. They are always lovely- helpful! very helpful!!! The food from the restraurant there- carousel is great- the food and especially the breakfast is fantastic- like you are full for the entire day. THere is just so much to say about this place- its great.... its fantastic. The location was great too- its right near orchard road- and there is the bus stop practically outside, and royal plaza books you taxis when required, there is also the MRT right near by. So if you considering staying in singapore- in a lovely, smoke free hotel- go there- the broadband internet access is great. It is one of Singapores best business hotels- but i truly recommend this for all- it was great. Value for money!!!!

The hotel is in the centre of Singapore\u2019s shopping district and within minutes\u2019 walking distance of several other big name hotels like Marriott, Grand Hyatt and Hilton, but a fraction of the price. This, together with its decent reviews, was one of the main reasons why I booked the hotel. The room was on the old and small side. The carpet was quite stained and tired, and could do with a good shampoo. The TV was small and old, and could do with being replaced. The shower curtain also could have done with being replaced. I wasn\u2019t really expecting that much more for the price, which was GBP 72 per night. I booked a non smoking room with a king bed through Expedia weeks in advance, and for some reason they could only provide us with a non smoking room with 2 twin beds. This was quite annoying. The pool area was a bit small, but quite good though. It looked a lot newer than the actual rooms, and had some very nice touches to it like the finishing around the pool, and the matching pool furniture. The gym equipment looked very high tech and modern as well. I was not a big fan of sitting by the pool though, because there were far too many screaming annoying little children. Location is very good, just minutes walk away from all the major shopping malls on Orchard Rd. There are some bars/clubs that are very close by, like Bar None at Marriott and Brix at the Grand Hyatt, but nightlife in Singapore is scattered around everywhere. Apart from Clarke Quay, it isn\u2019t really concentrated anywhere. To be honest there is nothing to do in Singapore besides go shopping. I would highly recommend Crossroads Cafe at the Marriott. It is a 5 min walk, and I liked it so much that I went everyday. The food was so delicious, and its fun to watch passers by walk up and down Orchard Rd.
