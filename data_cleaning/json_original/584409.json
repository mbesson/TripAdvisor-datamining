There is also no parking and the hotel is in a residential area where you need a permit to park so basically if you drive in from the airport you are stuffed with meter parking about 100m away where you constantly have to go every three hours to buy another ticket .....", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anaheim, CA", "Title": "\u201cA Fine Little Hotel in Sydney\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4496740", "Content": "We spent 3 days at the Medusa Hotel during our first trip to Sydney. The hotel was well maintained and the staff very friendly. We stayed in one of the hotel's Grand Rooms which was large, airy and artfully decorated. Located in Darlinghurst, the hotel is still close enough to the main tourist areas (Circular Quay and Opera House)that one can walk to those places. And because we did not stay in the main harbor area, we discovered more of the city on this first visit than we probably would have otherwise. Of course this hotel did not have all the amenities of the larger properties, but for a boutique hotel of its size, the Medusa is a great place to stay.", "Date": "February 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, compact rooms, large service\u201d", "Author": "redcoward", "ReviewID": "UR4472888", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in this hotel between Christmas and New Year 2005. Our room was very compact - the wardrobe housed everything including the kitchen sink: tv, stereo, kettle, microwave, iron, ironing board and even some room for our clothes.

The in-room guide was the best I have ever seen - good reviews of the area: restaurants, beaches, etc. However, the best feature of this hotel were the staff! Excellent service and great advice on the area.

Gay and Lesbian friendly - and they even have some rooms where you can have your pooch! look out for great priomotional rates.
