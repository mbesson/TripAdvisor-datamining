I stayed three nights at the hotel and upgraded to a deluxe room which is very spacious with a full kitchen. The room rate is very reasonable as making online booking wil give you half price the walk in rate. The location is nice, with a big food supermarket on the ground floor and situated right in the food street (Gui street). Less than 30 minutes by car from the airport and less than 10 minutes walk to either line 2 or 5 subway line. The breakfast is acceptable with sufficient Chinese and Western choice. The service is nice and the broadband access is ok. Not many facilities at the hotel (a very wide selection of TV channels though) but good enough for sleeping at night (though the bed is a bit hard) and spending the day outside. In sum, it is a really good bargain for a 4 star hotel in Beijing.", "Date": "Oct 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR947824243", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JKWD"}, {"Content": "Excellent hotel. Really enjoyed our stay. We stayed for 4 nights in an 'executive room' in September 2007. We paid about \u62e227/night as we found a deal on the internet. I would highly recommend staying here. It is quite modern and the rooms are spacious, comfortable and well furnished. The staff are friendly and helpful (though quite limited English). We didn't eat in the restaurant except for breakfast - this was a buffet with a range of Western and Chinese dishes on offer - OK but nothing special. The hotel is very well located - about 10 mins walk from the metro and on a street full of restaurants - the ones we tried were great.", "Date": "Sep 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR953589774", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "CFH23"}, {"Content": "Probleme de communication   showReview(19649380, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR739401267", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "bon hotel   showReview(16609653, 'full');", "Date": "May 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR177453128", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d652611-r21261873-Beijing_Qianyuan_International_Business_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "652611", "Price": "$71"}}
