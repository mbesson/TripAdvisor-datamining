The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Kurt-Schumacher Platz where the U-Bahn to central Berlin takes 15 minutes and the 128 bus to/from Tegel Airport around the same. There are also some shops and restaurants there but we overlooked them for the city centre. Breakfast can be paid for as and when you want it and costs 10 Euro per person. We never bothered with it so can't comment. The rooms are of a decent size, fairly modern and very clean. If you want luxury look elsewhere, but if all you need is a good value base for sightseeing then I would definately recommend this hotel. I would have preferred to stay in the city centre but for this price that would be impossible other than a hostel or low quality hotel. Any staff we dealt with were friendly and their English was good enough to get what we needed. Aircraft noise is barely audible when windows are closed and we stayed on the side facing the final approach to Berlin Tegel.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aventura, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDidn't keep reservation!\u201d", "Author": "Mike C", "ReviewID": "UR117723469", "Content": "Once we arrived to the hotel, the staff tols us they didnt have any rooms left, even though our room was already paid for!!!!

States it is city centre but it's quite a trek. Easy from airport though, short bus rude plus a walk. Hard to find initially as it's out of the way. Planes can be loud but you get used to them.. Other than planes hotel was relatively quiet and room was nice. It's ok for a short trip but the main negative is the distance to the centre..", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery Good\u201d", "Author": "Seansabazios", "ReviewID": "UR115122055", "Content": "Hotel is in a very good location for Tegel Airport and is 10 minutes on the local underground from the city centre.

Soft and large beds, sleep just fine. Staff are friendly and always willing to help. We did not take breakfast because near shops and cafes.

The location wasn't amazing, the distance to the Kurt Scumacher U-bahn was okay and there were some nice restaurants in the area and of course the Kaufland market pretty much just across the street which will get you almost nything at almost any time. Our breakfast was not included and as we thought 10 euro for breakfast per person was a little too much we tried a few different places down the street but ended up in the Th\u00fcrmann B\u00e4ckerei & Konditorei where we had breakfast for 2, very nice and of course cheaper :) The room was very clean and most of the staff were very attentive and complying. Of course this hotel is situated very close to the Tegel airport which means that planes are crossing over all the time, but it really didn't bother us, when the windows were closed we could hardly hear it. All in all, one of the better hotels we've visited :)", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood price for me\u201d", "Author": "rob_sad", "ReviewID": "UR76510817", "Content": "Hotel doesn't have good location for guests which want to explore the city and is not as close to the airport as should be, but is probably the cheapest.

Hotel is 5 min walk to kurt Schumacher on the u6 line. from there its 10 mins to the main areas. The airport is a 10 mins bus ride. I have heard people complain about the size of the rooms or the location. Yet to me this is foolish. Surely you cant expect a spacious and central room for the price offered by the hotel....I'd say the rooms were sized above average and the staff were very friendly and spoke superb english.
