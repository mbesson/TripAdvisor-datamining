{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Just OK for business travel I've stayed here a couple times in 2008. I live on Kauai but travel to Oahu on business from time to time. The first time I had a high room... just below the top floor. The most recent time I stayed on floor 29.First off, the location will appeal to business travelers only, since it is in downtown Honolulu. Tourists should not stay here. There are few tourist attractions in the area, and there are so many other better places for a tourist to stay on the island.This hotel is wedged somewhere between past its prime and not very nice. It has probably been like this for years though. The building is nice enough... a modern looking high rise with a nice clean lobby. The rooms have seen better days. The two rooms I stayed in were laid out the same, but the furnishings were completely different. In both cases, everything was dated by at least a couple decades. The tile, cabinets, tub, everything. Also, you'll notice evidence of reconfigurations... by this I mean air vents that have been relocated, drywall patched, fixtures have been added, removed, etc. Ordinarily after a hard day at work I'd love to relax in a jacuzzi tub, but something about an old tub from the 70's doesn't really appeal to me. There is a kitchenette, and in my most recent case, the microwave was oddly on a microwave cart in the living area, well outside the kitchenette space.To sum it up, the rooms are out of date, but they are at least clean which is really the most important part to me. And while out of date, nothing is totally trashed. For example, the bedding clearly isn't from the 70's. The one odd thing from my last trip was that all my towels smelled funny. They were clean (I think), but the detergent must have been some odd industrial grade bleach or something.Travelers should be aware that most of the businesses near by close early. For example, the Longs drug store downstairs closes at an unbelievable 6PM. Aloha Tower Marketplace has plenty of dining and shopping though, and it is a reasonable walk of a few blocks.A lot of people stay in Waikiki for business. Depending on where you are working, Waikiki is often less convenient. But, it is a tradeoff, because at executive center you'll feel like you are staying at any old hotel on the mainland... not much of an Aloha theme.", "Date": "Dec 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR811257563", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "irun5k"}, {"Content": "No aloha spirit here! Staying at this hotel after staying on the Big Island will give you some serious culture shock. The Executive Centre Hotel is all business and no aloha. The rooms are fine- the same as any other business hotel, though ours had a spectacular view of the harbour. No windows open, which I HATE, but the canned air didn't smell bad or anything. There is a full sized fridge and a small cook space and a real kitchen sink. It had a tiny washer and dryer, with international symbol instructions that I needed help interpreting. I called the front desk for help, who directed me to the housekeeping department (why?). The housekeeping guy spoke such poor English that he had to send someone up to demonstrate. (My question, for the record, was does the soap go in the right, left, or center compartment?) There is chain-store shopping right at the bottom of the building, including Longs and Ross Dress for Less (which has a huge selection of Hawaiian shirts and dresses for $10-$20, instead of $30+ you'll pay at the tourist shops.) The neighborhood has zero personality and they're working hard to keep it that way. The staff is brusque and business-like. (Someone told me that they were trying to undo the surfeit of personality it had had 10 years before when it was a red light district.) The people who came to clean the room were very nice, though didn't speak English well. What convinced me to never stay there again was the young security guard who told me and an old woman that we couldn't sit on the granite front ledge while we waited for our taxis. Don't you see the sign? You can't sit here. (Sure enough, there was a discreet sign fastened to the side of the building where we were sitting.) After staying a week on the Big Island it was truly shocking to see a young Hawaiian treat an older woman so disrespectfully. I am young and healthy, and standing for 20 minutes wasn't a terrible hardship, but what was the old woman supposed to do? There were no benches. There was no place else to sit. It was clear that the poor guy was was only enforcing hotel policy; the hotel should be ashamed of itself for having such a policy in the first place. Nevermind the inconvenience to me, one of its guests; by chasing off old ladies they are showing Hawaii to be ungracious and lacking in basic courtesy.

It is conviently located, but desperately needs renovation. The taxi dropped me off and the cab driver told me to go down the escalator to check in. THERE IS NO ONE OUT FRONT TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BAGS. The bathroom was clean, but the cabinet, flooring and wallpaper are the absolutely cheeapest you could buy anywhere, and are old. The toilet seat was one of those horribly cheap, thin plastic ones. There was NO exhaust fan in it so the steam from my shower went everywhere. Despite having pushed my thermostat all the way down and the a/c fan on HIGH it was never below 77 in my room. The mattress was very soft and gave me back trouble. Its been YEARS since I stayed in a hotel without a good mattress and didn't think they existed anymore. The continental breakfast is a joke - they put out a bag of whole wheat bread next to a toaster, a bag of bagels, a few muffins and something that looked like pound cake. VEry little fruit - just a few bananas and cheapo red delicious apples. There were machines with what appeared to be orange juice and some other thing but upon tasting it was clear these juices (juice drinks?) were from metal cans. Skip it and go half a block down Bishop St. to Starbucks where you can buy a cup of chopped fresh fruit and excellent juices. There is a Long's drugstore next door and it opens at 6:30 A.M. so you don't need to drag shampoo, conditioner, etc with you when you fly out to Honoloulu, just get it when you arrive. The staff at the front desk did their best for me, but this hotel is just a dump that desperately needs new mattresses, all new bathrooms, new room a/c systems and a lot of other things. GOOD RESTAURANTS NEARBY: salad creations - $6.99 for a big bowl of salad with all the ingredients you want (you pick the type of greens and what you want added), Indigo for a pricey but excellent dinner, a french place across the street from indigo, a cheaper cuban place near the french place.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR947302492", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "LouiesMom"}, {"Content": "Tired, dirty, and sketchy Our client put us up here for a week on business.

Moved to a second room which was tolerable, but very tired. Lots of stains and wear and tear - especially in the bathroom and kitchen. We were staying on the top floor of the hotel, and could hear very loud industrial fans on the roof of the building. Very annoying and disturbed our sleep. The neighborhood of the hotel is kind of sketchy, lots of drugged up and mentally ill homeless, just steps away from the hotel. Its fine during the day, but can get rather sketchy at night, and especially on the weekends, when downtown business crowd disappears. Front desk tries to be friendly, but gave us wrong directions twice. Once I requested a flower shop and was sent on a wild goose chase 10 blocks away...instead was more sucessfull using google map on my blackberry and found a flowershop just across the street from the hotel! Another time, we were sent three blocks away to pick up the bus to go to waikiki and waited 30 minutes until we discovered that the bus we were told to take didn't pick-up where we were told to go...instead the bus we needed stopped directly in front of the hotel.

We waited until the last minitute and was leary of staying at a place that did not show pictures of the facility on line. I read the reviews of other trip advisor members and they were mixed, some good some bad. We (my husband, myself, teenager son and another couple). decided to stay only 2 nights, even though we had a government discount rate. From the outside of the building, I thought the worst and was glad we were only staying 2 out of 5 nights. We stayed on the 38th floor. When the elevator door opened the hallway was really narrow and smelled a little mildew and again I thought, it's only 2 nights. When we opened the door to our spacious 1 bedroom suite I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were large, the carpet appeared new, the king bed room had a great view of the mountains and the bed itself was really comfortable and inviting. The living room had a small sofa, but large enough to accomodate a cot for our growing teenager. The other 3 nights were stayed at a well known updcale popular hotel on Waikiki Beach. Other than the location on the beach, we wished we had stayed at the resortquest. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to other family and friends. The only mishap was the water stopped running the day we were checking out. The staff and manager got right on it and reimburst us $150 for the inconvience. Thankfully I had taken care of my personal hygiene much earlier in the morning. We only had to wait for 1 1/2-2 hrs. for the problem to resolve.

If anything can ruin a stay in Hawaii, it is a hotel that is dirty, outdated, with an uncaring staff. The decor of this hotel is straight out of the 1980s. That wouldn't be a problem if it were clean and well maintained. But it wasn't. The carpet was stained and some of the lights didn't work. It is not near the beach and thus there aren't a lot of places to eat after normal working hours. The parking garage was difficult to get around and in some spaces if you are over 5 feet tall watch your head getting out of the vehicle. Perhaps worst of all, my coworker and I got stuck in the elevator for 70 minutes. Once we were finally freed, no one from the hotel asked if we were okay or apologized. And when I complained about the poor customer service still no apology. They did not seem to care at all. I don't know if that is common and thus they don't consider it a situation that requires an apology or at least an Are you okay?.

I won't go into details - I'll just give you highlights (lowlights?):Positives: Relatively inexpensive for Oahu, nice views of the city, very spacious room.Negatives: Oh where to begin ...1. The rooms are outdated and have a funky smell to them. The carpeting looked like it hadn't been vaccumed in years. TVs were small and very old. Outlets in bathroom did not work. Lightbulbs in bedroom were burned out. Bed was small and very uncomfortable. Kitchette was flat-out disgusting - I would have rather eaten off the street.2. The parking garage is unorganized and safety hazards abound. When emerging from and entering the garage, it is very difficult to see oncoming cars and pedestrians. My husband met me on the last day of my stay here before we moved to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (stay there - it's worth any extra $$$) and I was assured by the front desk that he'd be charged $12 for parking there as a non-hotel guest. He was charged $38 for parking less than 12 hours.3. Check-in is difficult as there is no place to park your car and you must go down an escalator from the street and then back-up the escalator to your (double-parked) car, up to the parking garage, down the elevator to the lobby, and then finally up a different elevator to your room. If you've stayed there, you know what I mean. It's a mess.4. Finally - and most upsetting - was the fact that a co-worker and I were stuck in the elevator for over an hour. It was extremely scary as the elevator was jerking and bucking for several minutes. The front desk worker contacted Security, who we had many conversations with through the little speaker in there, and did their best to get a technician to us ASAP. However, when the elevator doors finally opened, no one was there. I guess that wasn't a big deal, but when we walked over to the front desk to let them know that we were out and safe, the man did not even look up. We asked if we needed to do anything, and all he did was shake his head. NO ONE from the hotel EVER apologized or asked if we were OK. If that doesn't speak volumes to their customer service, I don't know what would. Bottom line: Do NOT stay here. Pay an extra $20-30 and stay some where nice.

The location is terrific and the staff was very friendly. However, the 39th floor ocean view suite I was upgraded to (since the room with a king bed I thought I had guaranteed turned out to be just a request) was last updated in the 80s with dark brown appliances, coppertone tiles in the bath and kitchen, dark brown matching tub and sinks and what started out as oak cabinetry that had since been painted several times with thick coats of latex paint. Not the kind of thing you expect to see in an upscale ocean view suite. From what I understand, many of the rooms at this hotel are privately owned and Resort Quest only manages them.

We stayed here for one night on a stopover to Kauai. This hotel is located in downtown, not far away from the Aloha Tower. It was a quiet location and perfect for our 1-night stay. We went in to Waikiki, but appreciated the quiet location downtown. We had a beautiful view of the harbor. Our room was very large and well-equipped. It had an entry foyer, a kitchen, living room, separate bedroom and full bath with jacuzzi tub. The juices available for purchase in the full refridgerator were only $1.50 per can! After a long flight, our party of 3 arrived at the hotel to find that the roll-away bed that we requested was not available. We were not advised that the roll-away bed was a request only and that one was not guaranteed to be available. (One may ask, why would the hotel think the customer would ask for a roll-away bed, if they don't really need one?) The hotel initially attempted to accommodate us by offering a room with double beds. This would not work for us, because 2 people in our party were over 6 feet tall. Darrin at the front desk was sympathetic to our dilemna and booked us an additional room on the same floor at no additional charge!!! Now that's customer service! NOTICE: The bedding options for the rooms are: 1 king or queen or 2 doubles. There are no sleeper sofas. If you REALLY need a roll-away bed (you have a third person or 2 of your party won't fit well in a double bed because they are over 6 feet tall), one may not be available. You should either book 2 rooms (expensive) or book someplace else. The continental breakfast is ok if you just need a quick bite to eat. There is also a McDonald's on the corner. I tried the he Hawaiian breakfast at McDonald's for fun (2 huge scoops of rice, Spam, porteguese sausage, and one other item that I can't remember.) Large!!! I would stay again. I'd love to explore Chinatown nearby and the downtown historical sites.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR304881986", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "gail_wilson"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel but Not For the Beach Bum I must admit that I did not want to stay here. When my supervisor told me I was going to Hawaii, I had planned/wanted to stay in Waikiki. Yet to stay within budget, my plans got redirected to the Aston Hotel Downtown Honolulu. After my stay however, I will always have a place in my heart for the Aston Hotel in Honolulu. I was sent to Hawaii for a 2 month long business trip and had the pleasure of staying at this hotel. This hotel is wonderful for those working in the downtown area. It is not in Waikiki (about a 10 min. bus ride) so if you are looking for a place with all the Waikiki happenings you should stay there. During the first two weeks of my stay I was in a suite with a beautiful mountain view. The smoke from a neighboring apartment became too much for me and I lucked out and was placed in an ocean view room. Both rooms were suites with a washer/dryer, kitchen, separate living room and a nice sized bedroom. I had modern furnishings in both suites with flat screen televisions in the living room and bedroom and dark brown wood furniture throughout the apartment. There are floor to ceiling windows which are great for seeing the mountains or the ocean on either side. It was beautiful going to bed and falling asleep with a view of the ocean or coming back to my room and watching the sunsets. It was fantastic!As far as the surrounding area, I found Chinatown to be interesting and a great place to buy a random selection of things. Aloha Tower is within walking distance and has several nice restaurants as well as a food court. There is a plaza by the hotel that has shops and restaurants and further down is a Safeway if you feel like cooking in the kitchen. The Bus stops right outside the hotel where you will be able to ride to Waikiki or Ala Moana Beach/Shopping Center. Other bus lines are within walking distance for making trips to Aloha Stadium and Pearl Harbor. There are also museums and other historical points of interest within walking distance as well. I made out well without a car but you must be a little adventurous. If you are a traveler who is unaccustomed to walking much or driving/riding the bus this place isn't for you and Waikiki may be a better bet. Personally, I enjoyed the location removed from the craziness of Waikiki and actually liked this hotel.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR183733110", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "chariega"}, {"Content": "Didn't care for it... This hotel occupies the upper floors of a downtown high rise. The accommodations weren't what I expect from an all-suite hotel -- no living room or seating area outside the bedroom to watch TV. Rooms are spacious but minimally furnished; standard room has a large kitchen dining area with only a small dining table. The bedroom, separated from the dining area by a doorless wall, has a bed, the TV and chair. The kitchen has a fridge and trash compactor; microwave available on request for a fee, and even the in-room coffee has a fee. The public area was beneath street-level, windowless and rather dreary. The check-in desk occupies a corner of the office building lobby, which was usually deserted during the weekend I stayed there. Use of the fitness center, accessible from the office building floors, required a special key from the front desk, although the info on it in the guest guide fails to mention this. The swimming pool is also accessible via the office building. Wouldn't be comfortable using them on the weekend, at least, since the office building floors were deserted.Maybe if you're conducting business downtown during the week, this would be an OK choice. But ANY dining on the weekends -- and these options are limited -- requires a walk of several blocks or a drive to pay parking. The hotel restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch on weekdays, although the hotel lounge offers a free continental breakfast -- fruit, juice, bread and pastry, coffee - that sufficed.This place is a considerable distance from Waikiki, where the beaches, shopping, hotels, restaurants, etc. of Honolulu are located. It took me about an hour to drive through the traffic to get to Waikiki early Saturday night. There's no concierge service to speak of; in response to an inquiry at the check-in desk, I was simply handed one of the standard local guide magazines.Finally, and this is what led me to check out early and move to a hotel in Waikiki, I was not happy with security. My first night I was awakened in the middle of the night by a knock at the door, purported to be the delivery of pizza, that I hadn't ordered. The hotel elevator required a swipe of the keycard to access my floor, so the next morning I inquired at the check-in desk about how someone had gained access. I was told that they just card delivery people up since they can't know who ordered something. Maybe call the room?Bottom line - the out of the way location, modest accommodations, and unease about security caused me to check out early in favor of more appealing accommodations for my business trip.", "Date": "Aug 13, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR767641913", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kmacMD"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Harbour Views! We enjoyed our stay of 11 nights in April, 2005 on the way to San Francisco. After the initial dilemna of how to get our luggage to the lower level where the reception was located, we were warmly welcomed and shown to our room on Level 28. From this room, we had wonderful views of Honolulu Harbour and surrounding streets which, at night, were stunning. The suite was very comfortable and spacious and the kitchenette allowed us the flexibility of doing some home cooking and stocking up on supplies from Longs Drugs and Safeway Supermarket, both handy to the hotel. Chinatown was just down the road and Waikiki was a short trip away on The Bus which we used with a pass available from ABC Stores conveniently located on almost every corner in Waikiki. This bus service, right at the hotel, was convenient to trip around the island, to the North Shore and to Pearl Harbour. From Day 1, when our clothes dryer didn't work, the manager had it replaced with a new one - that's service!

The Aston is located in downtown Honolulu on Bishop Street, a few blocks from the Aloha Tower. I usually stay in the Waikki area when traveling to Hawai'i on business, but most of these hotels were booked due to a large convention in Honolulu during my stay.On the plus side, the room was clean and spacious and included a refrigerator, microwave oven, and dinnerware. The Honolulu paper was delivered each day. The Aston assigned me a parking space in the adjoining parking garage, eliminating any problem finding an available space in a busy garage. The staff were very friendly, professional and helpful during my stay.On the minus side, there was no restaurant in the hotel. A continental breakfast was served in a common room on the 40th floor, and it consisted of coffee, juice, breads and rolls. In-room Internet access was available via DSL modem for $10-11 additional per day. Wireless Internet access was also available in the common room on the 40th floor, and this room was locked after hours. You can get a room key (good for one day) at the front desk, and another guest explained the process to me.In short, a decent place to stay, but it lacks the amenities that a first-rate lodging for business travelers should provide. These same amenities are readily provided at many hotels in the Waikki area, and this area has much more to offer to the visitor.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR463294207", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Hiistory-Buff"}, {"Content": "Great location       Aston at the Executive Centre", "Date": "Mar 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR572859157", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Barbarella"}, {"Content": "Okay, but only during weekdays   showReview(3297668, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR650118328", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Didn't think it was THAT great   showReview(3276837, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 16, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR926128399", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "px64"}, {"Content": "Haven in Honolulu!
