Just be advised that this facility is connected to the Holiday Inn and they even share the reception desk. Depending from which direction you come, you may not see signs for the Grand City hotel.

When you make a reservation here you'll be given a spacious room but don't expect any modern or fancy furnishing and character. It is very simple and basic 3-star standard (even though some hotel-searchers call this hotel 4-star - it is definitely not), a typically sleep-only, no frills place. What makes this hotel a good choice is: spacious and clean rooms, clean and comfortable beds and facilities, friendly and helpful staff, easy access with public transport to many parts of Berlin (read below). All disadvantages I would call rather small and insignificant like no safe and no minibar in the rooms (but there is a beverage and snack machine in the corridor), unattractive area with no cafes or restaurants (except hotel ones), basic and a little bit outdated furnishing. Overall rating for Grand City East hotel depends of what you expect from this place. Objectively - it's not a pretty, cozy hotel with a unique character, place where you can spend all day. But what makes this hotel really \"Grand\" is not a furnishing but price and its relation to the value - I can say that we paid \"hostel\" price for a hotel private room - 27 EUR/day for a double room without breakfast. If you can book it for a comparable amount don't think too much - take it! Finding Grand City East is really very easy but because I see some people had a problem with it, here are some tips: 1. From the Alexanderplatz take tram M5 (direction Zingster Str.) or M6 (direction Riesaer Str.) After 15-minutes ride gett of on \"Hohensch\u00f6nhauser Str./Wei\u00dfenseer Weg\" stop (M5) or \"Altenhofer Str.\" (M6). Don't panic when tram leaves the Landsberger Alee and turns into Oderbruchstr. - it's ok. 2. If you get off on \"Hohensch\u00f6nhauser Str./Wei\u00dfenseer Weg\" stop you'll see wide street perpendicular to this on which you got off - it's Wei\u00dfenseer Weg and on the otherside of this street you should see Renault car showroom. Hotel is just after this place (going Wei\u00dfenseer Weg you'll se three tower blocks - Grand City East sign is on the first of them. If you get off on \"Altenhofer Str.\" (M6) you have to come across parking and go with a small street. After 2-3 minutes of walk you'll be in place. 3. Check-in. Even though you book a room in a Grand City East Hotel, first you have to go to the middle building of Holiday Inn Hotel and there you'll check in. 4. Even though the hotel isn't in a centre of Berlin it's very good communicated with a lot of parts of the city. You know already how to get to Alexanderplatz. This hotel will be also great for people who come to the shows in o2 Arena. A direct tram (M13) from the crossroad of Landsberger Allee/Wei\u00dfenseer Weg will you take you on place. You can also chose M5 or M6, go to Petersburger Str. and then change into M10 going to Warschauer Str. If you take this tram in opposite direction you'll go to the Prenlzauer Berg - nice district full of cafes, restaurants and streets to wander. All important information concerned public transport you will find on the www.bvg.de - it's a homeweb of Berlin Public Transport Service (also in English) 5. Our room was without breakfast and as I mentioned I didn't see any place to eat in the surrounding of the hotel. But if you're going to the Alexanderplatz you may get off on the way on Petersburger Str. Here you will find Kaiser market with a fresh sandwiches or bakery shop next to it where you can also eat a breakast for a 3-5 EUR.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kapellen, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cHoliday Inn??\u201d", "Author": "reymerswael", "ReviewID": "UR120870605", "Content": "We had trouble finding the place.

Firstly, it is REALLY easy to find - take the 10-15 minute journey on tram M5 or M6 from Alexanderplatz and alight at hohenschoenhausstrasse, turn left when you get out of the tram, cross at the crossing then turn right on to Landsberger Allee. You will see the big building with \"Grand City Hotel\" behind the Renault building and you need to check in at the \"Holiday Inn\" Reception even though you are staying at Grand City. The room itself was in excellent condition considering it is a three star hotel and only cost \u00a372 for both of us for three nights (booked via cheaphotels.co.uk). It was spacious and light with two twin beds next to each other which were very comfortable. It even had a small kitchenette with a microwave and fridge, which was very useful as the breakfast is very expensive (17 euros!) so we just went to a supermarket and ate in the room. Wifi is available in the room at a charge. I think the only slight negatives I have is that I found the room quite warm and as we were staying on the 14th floor you could only open the window slightly. Also, the housekeeping staff cleaned the bathroom and did the beds but did not take the rubbish out on any of the days, which would have been nice! All in all, Grand City Hotel Berlin East represented incredible value for money and I would definitely stay there again.

I loved the place and will recommend it, but have these slightly negative comments to add to the general image of a great stay. A few notes; a non-smoking room was not available in the lowest price-range, so I \"had to\" buy an upgrade for 8 euro. The transport to the city-center is a bit more troublesome, than the hotel website gives you the impression of. I chose to walk to the nearest S-Bahn and from there take to trains to Alexanderplatz. I was happy enough taking my time, but the trains could easily take 30 minutes, if you just missed a train, when you arrive at the S Bahn near the hotel. The internet was troublesome. I could connect to the network 90% of the time, but most of the time I got a very poor download-rate, i.e. I couldn't load a newspaper. It always worked smoothly in the lobby.

After walking around the hotel trying to find check in for GC, we found the GC tower entrance and were directed to the Holiday Inn reception desk. We were allocated a twin room, when we had booked a King sized bed. Upon returning to reception we were moved but advised it was only a double as they did not have King beds in the hotel. The room was spacious, including double bed (with twin duvets as the hotel don't have doubles), TV (English channel - CNN), sink, fridge, microwave and basic bathroom with poor towels. There were two computers in the reception area which could be used for web access, else WiFi was 5 Euro an hour or 9.90 for a day.

There is a metro system that drops you almost in front of the hotel, but it takes a while to get back and forth and depending on which place you're coming from at the end of the day, you have to transfer at least once. (Also, the public transportation system in Berlin is kind of confusing.) The second issue I had was that the hotel did not provide, soap, shampoo, lotion, or anything else I would have expected of such a large corporate establishment. Maybe they will in the future. That being said, if you have your own toiletries and don't mind being out all day, this is a great hotel! Advice: Our room had a fridge and microwave. Turn right out of the hotel and at the corner (down a small hallway and then down an escalator), there is a grocery store. We bought snacks and sandwich stuff there. Also, when using the metro, do NOT go to the one directly in front of the grocery store.
