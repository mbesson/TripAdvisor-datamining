We had a very enjoyable trip, and the BW Hibiscus played a big role in our positive experience there. It is not a 5 star hotel, but I rated it 5 dots when compared with similar motels in that style and price range. In fact, the price was more than reasonable when compared to other places in Key West, and on top of that, it included free parking, WiFi, and breakfast. If you have not visited Key West, here is a little info that might help you decide where to stay. There are many small, medium and large hotels in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downtown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area. There are also lots of cute cottage style B&Bs. In addition, there are a number of hotels away from downtown - especially in the airport area. These hotels are too far from the bars, shops etc. to walk. You will either need to drive, or take a cab. Parking in downtown Key West is hard to come by, and usually is pretty expensive, unless you luck into a rare free space. The hard-to-find meters go for about $1.50 per hour, I think. On the other hand, if you stay at the BW Hibiscus, parking is free there, and the spaces are easily accessed and ample in number as far as I could tell. The BW Hibiscus is located on the south end of town very near South Point. It is a block east of the main drag, Duval Street, which runs north-south. The rowdy end of Duval is the north end from about 0 (the pier area) to 600 Duval Street. The BW Hibiscus is located about 1.1 mile from the pier at the southernmost end of Simonton Street, just one block east of Duval Street. Although there are shops and bars all along Duval (and some of the other streets as well), you will walk about 0.6 mile from the BW Hibiscus to where the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd starts on Duval. Plan to walk a lot and wear comfy shoes. The south end of town appeared fairly quiet, and a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep should not be in jeopardy at the BW Hibiscus. The hotel itself is clean and freshly painted on the outside. It was being painted during our stay on Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day 2012, but there were no problems resulting from the painting, and by now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure it is very pleasantly painted in various pastel shades. Our room was on the second of two floors, and was larger than most studio suites in modern hotels. It had two queen beds, a sitting area, a refrigerator, complimentary WiFi, an old style 26-32\" TV that we never watched, a better than average complimentary continental breakfast, and free parking. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t park under the loaded coconut tree in back (see photo).... We had requested a smoke-free room due to allergies, and although the entire hotel is non-smoking, the staff put is in Room 214, which has hardwood (laminate) flooring as a precaution. The room was clean, and odor-free. The queen beds were comfortable and the room was quite large. Outside our door was a nice view of the pool area. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if we will return to Key West - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long way to drive for a margarita - but if we do, we will stay at the BW Hibiscus.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice, peaceful\u201d", "Author": "JudyChicagoland", "ReviewID": "UR124900817", "Content": "This hotel was on the quiet side of Duval Street.

If there had been any noisy late night revellers this could have been a problem, but in our case it was fine. Location is just a short 5 min. walk to the quiet end of Duval street, and about a further 20 minutes up Duval to the 'Sunset Celebrations', getting louder and noisier as you go north on Duval. Decent size pool in the central courtyard. Free buffet breakfast, not fantastic but well adequate. There is a small beach just south of the Hotel on Duval, but did not try it. The first night we ate at an italian restaurant on the southern end of Duval. Think it was called La Trattoria. Nice meal, good service, would go again. 2nd night ate at Camille's just up Simonton. Had a voucher from the hotel for free Key Lime Pie. Meal here was really nice. Last night tried another Italian next door to Camilles. OK, but not up to the standard of the other 2.

It was about a mile each way to the end of Duval, but flat and easy to walk. Also, there are tons of restaurants and bars to stop into on the way if you need a rest. The room was clean and much larger than we expected. The hotel was quiet, and there was always room at the pool. Continental breakfast was simple but ok. We ate there twice during our stay. Nice option to take breakfast to the outside tables near the pool. The only con\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about our stay were that the shades on the windows were wooden slats. While they added a touch of Key West to the ambience of the room, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close all the way and there was a light right outside our room at night that was very bright. It was ok for us, but if anyone is a light sleeper and needs total darkness, this would have been a problem. Also, something was wrong with the shower/hot water. Every 20 seconds or so it would go from hot to freezing (and I mean freezing) cold and then back to hot 20 seconds later. My husband said he moved it to hotter when it was freezing and it worked for him. I did it once and it came back scalding, so I just kept jumping out of the spray when it turned freezing and waited for it to go back to normal. Made for very quick showers LOL!! To my regret, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention it to the hotel management. I was afraid they would ask us to move, and we were already unpacked with a weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of stuff all put away. I also thought it might just be bad timing and we were just trying to shower when everyone else was. But, when we were up at 4am on our last morning to leave and it happened then, I figure it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t timing. We would definitely stay at this hotel again, and would recommend it to anyone going to Key West.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus", "Title": "\u201cGood for the price\u201d", "Author": "goldilox2677", "ReviewID": "UR121261159", "Content": "We stayed at this motel because of price and location over Thanksgiving. The pool is big and heated (somewhat) and there is a nice hot tub to relax in after a day of sightseeing. It's on the quiet end, which is nice if you aren't someone who loves the 'woo hooing' of Duval at 1 a.m. :) but it's a bit of a walk from Duval, so you will need a car or scooter or a bike for getting around to those places (cab rides are steep). Some cons are damp room which smelled somewhat like mildew and a very loud air conditioner. The rooms are dated and the tiles in the bathrooms should be scrubbed. Also, taking a shower was a bit of a roulette game of hot or cold. Randomly, the water would turn to freezing cold and back to scalding hot while you were trying to shower, which was unpleasant. All in all, this is a good motel for the price (we only paid about $622.00 for 5 nights which is quite reasonable for a holiday in Key West considering the nice pool).

First off, I have to say that when I see a complaint about bed bugs on this site, I get very wary when the reviewer has only has that 1 contribution under their belt. Secondly, I expect to see some pictures posted of the bugs or maybe actual bites or perhaps even a certified report from the CDC. We did not see any bed bugs (or any types of bugs at all, for that matter) nor get bitten by any during our 5-night stay. Ok, now that that's out of the way.... Rita at the front desk was very gracious and allowed us to change our room type upon check in. I originally thought I wanted a renovated room on the first floor (the renovated rooms have tile flooring), but we changed our minds and stayed in room #223, a second floor, corner unit. I do not believe the room has been completely remodeled but the ambiance was fine. If you need a king bed room, you need to try to pull some strings as they only have 6 I believe. Parking is onsite and free, which is a real asset in Key West. The buildings themselves are built out of concrete block and thus the rooms are very quiet. The room had two double beds, a TV armoire that had three drawers, a long bureau with six big drawers, and two big arm chairs with a small table by the AC unit. One thing worth mentioning is that the AC unit is big and nice, but it's a wall unit (not central AC). The AC was not so noisy that I couldn't sleep though, and I am a bit of a light sleeper. The bathroom setup was great. In the full bathroom there was a sink and even a grab bar in the shower/tub combo if you needed it. There was an OPENING WINDOW in the bathroom which is really unheard of in hotel rooms nowadays and just awesome when you needed to introduce some fresh air into the room. The exhaust fan worked great. Then outside of the bathroom there was a vanity area with yet another sink and a big counter to put all of your toiletries on. The real bonus for me was the small fridge and microwave. Both worked perfectly and the fridge was VERY QUIET. I was afraid it was going to be grunting all night but it was barely noticeable. Iron worked great as did the hair dryer and the coffee maker. The pool area was never so crowded that we couldn't get loungers together. The temp in the pool was always just right, probably around 84 degrees. There is also a hot tub but I didn't venture into it. A nice treat were the large pool towels that the hotel supplied, which we found on the shelf in the closet. There is no pool bar but we didn't care about that, as it kinda keeps the riff raff out. As for the location, it served us just fine. It is at the corner of United and Simonton down towards the Southernmost end of the key (the quiet end). We were far enough from the tourist traps of Mallory Square and Front Street but close enough to the fun nightlife on Duval. We rented bikes around the corner and used those for a couple of days - what a great way to see Key West. If you are coming to Key West for a night or two, you might want to stay closer to the action but we are old people trapped in young bodies and preferred the quieter, more low-key location of the Hibiscus. Service was great. We only asked for housekeeping twice and that's what we got (there is the usual card you slide into the key swipe, asking for either privacy or housekeeping). At no time did we receive service when we didn't want it nor get anyone knocking on our door when we had the privacy sign displayed. Didn't take advantage of the free breakfast that often but it was ample. Our friends stayed in a first floor remodeled room, I think #117. The remodeled rooms do look nice - very modern with dark wood furniture. On the first night, their AC was so loud that they had to complain the next morning. Well the hotel completely replaced the entire AC unit that day when they were out sightseeing! How's that for service?! We were very sad to leave this place.

There is no bar on the property. The hotel is only one block from the south side of Duval Street (Duval and United) and really close to an great restaurant for breakfast (Banana Cafe) on Duval. There is ample parking if you have a rental car and a scooter rental only a block away. There is also a MAC machine at a bank right across the road. It is about a 3/4 mile walk to Mallory square from this hotel but you pass a lot of great bars and stores on Duval St., and some really nice houses and hidden restaurants on Whitehead St. (one block past Duval) and Simonton St. (which boarders the hotel) on your way there.

A huge, immaculately clean room right in innertown Key West with free parking, a passable breakfast thrown in, and an especially friendly, helpful staff--under a hundred bucks a night--what's to complain?? But some Tripadvisors just love to complain...now here's this chap that whines about the type of TV in his room...what kind of pathetic individual goes to Key West and sits around watching TV? The only TV you need to watch in Key West is at the very beginning of the day--the Weather Channel-- might help you schedule your time-- then get out and enjoy this fabulous old town. This same sad sack wants \"an outdoor bar by the pool\" so he doesn't have to go for a drink to the \"hotel across the street\". Ya sure: if he's talking about the Southernmos-t Hotel complex, he's talking two or three times the Best Western rate. Jeez, bring your own bottle(s) and be thankful that you have two clean, functioning ice machines on the property, with several poolside tables just waiting for you to enjoy your drinks out under the swaying palms. Now here's this other person who found ants in the room. In the era of the bedbug menace, ants seem harmless enough, and there's certainly no need to worry about bedbugs at this sparklingly clean spot. Wife and I did notice, just in one tiny area of the room, some very tiny ants a couple of times.Probably depends on the location of your room. The only other area of the property where we noticed these tiny critters was around a large pillar quite near our particular room, so we were probably blocking their accustomed pathways. You come to Key West partly because you will be in a lush subtropical area. We've stayed at far plusher hotels down in the Caribbean and had the occasional visit from giant flying cockroaches. These harmless critters all go with the territory...you just coexist. Now one thing mentioned by a previous Tripadvisor that we did notice is that while we loved the adjustable louvres on the windows, they do let in rather too much light at night. Light sleepers might find this a problem, though they would otherwise appreciate the overall quietness of the property and the good mattresses. Pool area was beautiful and the deck surround seemed adequate for the number of guests, there were always deck lounges free. While the breakfast area was cramped, you do have the delightful al fresco option of talking your food outside to one of the poolside tables. Breakfast included a couple of hot items and was kept stocked right up to closing time of 10:00am. We have been staying for several years at the nearby El Patio Motel, a few blocks further southeast from the BW Hibiscus. In fact, we stayed at El Patio earlier this year and were happy. We decided to give the BW Hibiscus a try because on this latest visit, we were offered a much better rate, especially with the breakfast included.

The hotel has all outside entrances and no elevator. We arrived in the morning and stopped to see when we would be able to check in.

Since there is no elevator, I had to drag my wheeled suitcase up the stairs. We had a room with 2 queen beds - it was a good size room and was clean. The room had a microwave and refrigerator along with a table and chairs. There was a sink and counter outside the bathroom along with one in the bathroom. This was a nice plus. There was a group ( 6-8) young men and women 3 doors down from us who were in a \"party\" mode. They were fairly noisey for a while, then left and returned late at night. I wear ear plugs when I sleep and my husband has a hearing aid - but if I didn't have the ear plugs in the noise would have been unbearable. The motel had a continenetal breakfast that I do not recommend - hard boiled eggs, cold sausage gravy and biscuits, cereal and fruit. There is a nice size swimming pool and whirlpool in the inner courtyard with plenty of lounge chairs. The motel is 1 block from Duval St. and about 3 blocks from the southernmost point. If you plan to go to Mallory Square, you are in for about 14 block walk. To me the $179 a night over priced but I know things are more expensive in Key West.

This was the only reasonably priced hotel my mother could find when booking our trip, plus it was one of the only places that still had rooms available for the night we were going to be in Key West. After hearing where we were staying, I immediately went to tripadvisor and looked it up. I was a little worried after reading the review about the lady who found a worm in her bed. We found this hotel to be ABSOLUTLEY WONDERFUL. As stated before, we traveled with my parents, so we had a total of two rooms. Both rooms were HUGE and located on the 2nd floor. The bath was also HUGE. The bathroom had the usual shower, toilet, and sink; however there was an additional sink and vanity outside of the bathroom door so that two people could get ready at the same time. Both rooms had a little refrigerator. The complimentary breakfast consisted of biscuits with sausage gravy, bagels, toast, fruit, jams & jellies, coffee, hot tea, cereal, and I'm sure I'm forgetting what else they had. We were able to purchase tickets for the Key West Trolley Tour right at the front desk. There are also two computers with complimentary internet access in the lobby. Some reviews have mentioned that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a far walk to Duval Street, but we found the walk to be just fine. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re 30 and my parents are in their 60\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and none of us complained about the walk. Honestly, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only two blocks over. Also, when we checked in our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready, so the front desk kept our bags for us. Our boat wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leaving until 6pm the next day so the front desk kept our bags again after we checked out so that we could walk around and enjoy the town without rolling our luggage behind us. The staff was friendly and courteous and went out of their way to ensure we had a nice trip.

Both the pool and jacuzzi are heated, so it is open all year long! The pool closes at midnight, which is great for late night fun!! It serves continental breakfast from 7am to 10 am, which consists of the standard bagels/muffins, coffee/juice, eggs, fruits, and biscuits with gravy. They also have two computers available for people to check their emails and confirm their flights, which was very useful to us. We had a lovely meal at Duffy's, which is about four blocks north on Duval street (one block west of Simonton) and the restaurant is nowhere as pricy as those near Mallory Square. We also rented bicycles from the nearby Moped Hospital, which does most of its business renting out mopeds. The bikes were a little beat up and dated, but they do the job. It was fun riding around the small island, but at night it might be dangerous sharing the streets with cars driving by. We actually saw a car hit a bicyclist as it was turning into a parking lot, knocking the guy down. Luckily no one was hurt and the bicycle was still operational. Mallory Square is very festive and every night there is tons of people looking to go out and have fun. The drag shows looked interesting, but we did not go in. We had dinner at Caroline's on Duval street and the food was pretty good and moderately priced. The walk from the hotel to Mallory Square was a pleasant 10 minute, which is fine for us to walk and shop and buy ice cream on the way room. There is a nice ice cream store called Flamingo Crossing, that was really good ice cream! We were there twice in the two nights that we were at Key West. The beaches were nice and the water is very warm (even in december). However, due to the fine sand, the water by the beach is quite dusty. It was very pleasant nonetheless. We also went snorkeling with Sunset watersports, which has snorkeling trips for 3 hours for 35 dollars a person, which I thought was a good deal, and it included unlimited beverages. Of course, no beer until after snorkeling is finished. People are very relaxed and laid back here. We met some very nice locals, who were eager to interact with tourists and chitchat with us. In New York City, where we are from, that would never happen. On the way home, we took one of the pink taxi's to the airport, which has a standard rate of $8 per person for the airport from the hotel. We actually walked from the airport to the hotel (about 20-30 min walk) after we dropped the car off to Avis the first day. It was tolerable since we were walking by the shore and the beach the entire time. Very lovely. I would visit Key West again and stay at this hotel.

We arrived at about 1PM and was told that the room was not ready. We had booked a AAA rate of $89 per night. The front desk person asked for our AAA card and we did not have it. We didn't really think about bringing it as we usually empty our wallets/purses of un needed cards and never before had we been asked to actually present our AAA card. Normally we just enter the numbers when making the reservation and it locks us in. The guy was a little rude about it too. I get it, we should have brought it. He really rubbed us the wrong way with his attitude. I was going to have someone go to our house and fax a copy of our card just to prove to this guy we weren't trying to scam, but I had beer to drink on Duval, so we paid the extra $10 per night. It is a motel type place with exterior corridors, no private balcony. The room was nice and large. King bed with 4 pillows. The A/C worked great.

There was a nice sized bathroom with a toilet, sink and tub/shower. Outside of that was a good sized vanity area with a sink as well. Lots of room for toiletries! The pool was very nice, although since it is small, it really heats up and was not even really refreshing. Plenty of chairs and loungers. Breakfast was not the high spot. It is a mediocre continental breakfast. Everything seemed to be frozen and out of a box. Certainly would get you started, but we like a more hearty breakfast. This Pittsburgh boy needs his meat. KW has so many great breakfast places, we didn't really mind going out anyway. They have a computer in the lobby that you can use. It is hooked up to a printer so if you want to print coupons or boarding passes, you can. The hotel also offers free wireless high-speed internet in the rooms. The location is good. 1 block from Duval down by the Southernmost point. There is a nice little convenience store/deli across the street that is good for getting a six pack, some chips and a good Cuban sandwich. We walked A LOT staying on that end of Duval, but that did not bother us. If we were too tired, sore, or drunk we would take a cab (which were not expensive).

But we were too busy taking advantage of the motel's easy access to the town of Key West! We were so excited to have finally arrived at our destination, that we immediately set down our suitcases in the HUGE room (two queen beds w/kitchenette), and set off in one direction, not knowing where we'd end up. It happened to be south and towards the \"most southern point of Key West\" where a small line of tourists had formed to get photographed at the site, and we took advantage of the photo opportunity as well. Along the way we strolled past attractive homes with lush tropical vegetation, and often got a friendly nod or hello from passersby. The Best Western Hisbiscus proved to be a perfect location for us. In our short (too short!) stay there on June 1st and 2nd, we traversed up and down all of Duvall and its sidestreets. Mallory Square at the far end of Duvall is just a mile away and anyone in decent shape (and with good walking shoes) can make the walk easily. There is also a scooter rental nearby which we took advantage of one afternoon. The area around the motel was quiet and the hotel grounds around the pool area were beautifully landscaped which made for two relaxing mornings to sit out and enjoy their more than adequate continental breakfast before we set out for the day. With three females in our family, we really appreciated the roominess of our accommodations and having three sinks and multiple mirrors when getting ready in the morning or going out for the evening! For less than $110/night, this was a great value!!! The rooms were clean, the beds comfortable, and I loved the shutters on the windows instead of blinds.

While I did not see the interior of the rooms a the BM, the BW-Hib pool and area were far nicer and larger than the BM's, just fyi if you find yourself comparing these hotels... The room, 2nd floor, had a king bed and the room was very spacious. There is no smoking in any of the rooms so there was no foul smoke stench - yeah... the room had a sink and vanity outside of the bathroom which also had a full sink and counter too. Made it easier in the AM to get ready having two sinks. The room (225) was not facing the pool directly, but was on the interior section of the hotel (non street facing). The room had a mini fridge which made bring back snacks, pop, water etc convenient. Housekeeping left towels and plenty of shampoo and soap every time. The towels are on the rough side if you are use to plush towels. As others have stated, the pool area is large, the pool goes from 3 feet to 8.5 feet deep. Note that the only smoking section of the hotel is in the pool area, so you do have to deal with 2nd hand smoke when the wind blows. Yes I am an ex-smoker so I am super sensitive to the odor... The pool area is active, but large enough not to feel over crowded. Unfortunately, during our stay, a large group of young adults (late 20's - mid 30's) were there at the same time. They had a habit of going down to the pool early in the AM and putting items on the chairs and tables with umbrellas and leaving to reserve the prime locations. When they did show up, they even brought down an ipod radio so the rest of the pool area could listen to their music. They had a couple of guys that were 'loud' and made sure everyone in the area knew what they were talking about... no clue and just no class. The reason to bring this up is that the BW-Hib is one of the nicest & affordable hotels, so you will have individuals staying at the same location that are on the lookout for a cheap stay and to party hard... The hotel servers a continental breakfast: toast, mini-muffins, bagels, waffles, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, juice & coffee. Enough to tide you over for a day at the pool or walking Duval... The hotel is located two blocks away from the 'most southern point' landmark. Duval Street is two miles and the BW-H is at the far end... Sloppy Joes, Captain Tony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the Hog's Breath saloon(s) are at the other end of Duval so be aware. Everything is within walking distance.

This time, it was just my husband and I for a long weekend. The interesting part of our trip was that I was using BW points for our stay, but was unable to book two consecutive nights -- so stayed on our first night (Friday), then checked out and stayed at the Crown Plaza La Concha for Saturday -- and then back to the Hibiscus for Sunday night. Having never actually done this before, I was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly this went. Once again, we loved the Hibiscus. I have to agree with the previous reviewer -- the updates to the hotel are wonderful. New windows and shades, new carpeting and all new bathroom fixtures. The pool area has been re-done, and I have to agree...you need to be very, very careful when entering the lobby area from the pool area -- very slippery. I almost always slipped when entering (granted, I was wearing flip-flops and it had rained, but there was definitely something up in that area as it appears that the new decking dipped and water collected there...just be warned and be careful). They also have upgraded the room key cards (in the past, the cards seemed to de-magnetize on a regular basis). There also seem to be more security cameras located about the pool area and the parking area -- but I might just not have noticed it before. The rooms were spotless and well appointed. Plenty of towels and decent toiletries, microwave and mini-fridge, free package of micro popcorn, in-room safes, ice machines and a well-appointed breakfast buffet (bagels, bread, waffles, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, apples, bananas and very good mini-danishes). I think there is coffee available all day (as well as a coffee machine in the room) and free internet in the lobby with a printer. Plus free wireless in the rooms and the pool area. Another nice perk is the free parking. All hotel rooms are non-smoking but you can smoke anywhere outside. The front desk personnel was extremely helpful and the maintenance staff was always present and cleaning and fixing things. You can also get towels for the pool right at the front desk. One thing I have noticed with this property is that if you book well in advance you can score great rates....if you wait, the rates increase by a large amount. This hotel does require that you pay for your first night in advance and show the credit card you used at the time of check-in. This caused us a slight problem on our first visit in 2006 when the card I had used to make the reservation was changed from an MBNA VISA to a Bank of America American Express (not by choice), but they seamlessly credited the old card number and re-charged the new one at the time of our arrival. Not sure why they do this, but perhaps they get a large number of no-shows? not sure, but it's not really a big deal. Just something to be aware of. You can easily walk to most of old town and it's nice to return to the Hibiscus at night. There is a good convenience store right down the street next to the Blue Marlin Hotel -- very good snack bar and subs. Also, we discovered a new Cuban restaurant up Caroline Street (away from Duval) -- El Siboney. Wonderful, inexpensive food. Open daily 11 - 9:30pm -- cash only. We would definitely stay here again. Our only complaint was that on our first night, there was a large group of people that were quite loud and obviously drinking heavily. They were concentrated at one of the tables around the pool area and made quite a ruckus -- throwing each other into the pool -- yelling up to their friends in rooms surrounding the pool. Management twice had to come out to tell them to get rid of their glass beer bottles and liquor bottles. The good thing was that they obviously were either out that night or passed out in their rooms as we never heard or saw them again, but it was not as pleasant that afternoon as it was later that weekend in the pool area. Plus, I witnessed an extremely rude encounter between a customer and a member of the cleaning staff. The cleaning staff does not speak english very well, but if you try, you can easily communicate with them and they truly do a wonderful job. This woman was the rudest person I have ever seen and I was horrified by the way she spoke to the maid who kept saying she didn't understand English. I guess this same unpleasant woman did not understand that the reason there is a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign in your room is so that you can put this outside and then the maids won't knock and try and clean the rooms if you don't want to be disturbed (perhaps she cannot read English?!) It was quite a display of bad manners on the customer's part and I was embarrassed to witness it, especially when I know full well how hard the maids work at this place. Despite the bad manners of some of the folks that were staying there on our first night, we highly recommend this hotel -- you can tell that everyone involved cares about keeping it wonderful.

The lobby has been done and is all brand new, very nice. And, it appears all of the rooms have been redone. Brand new shades, all fixtures were nice, bathroom nice & spacious along with a second sink mirror etc. Even the pool area has been redone. All new furniture in the last year, along with a deck. I will mention 2 things... one, the new deck was slippery and our 3 year old almost slipped and fell twice which could have resulted in a serious accident. It didn't seem slippery to me or anyone else but just an FYI....I just had him \"waddle\"... Second, the breakfast area is a bit small. But, that's it.

Based on other reviews I saw on here, I decided to book it. First let me start by saying that the construction by the pool is pretty much done. I never saw anyone working on it - I just saw one orange cone in an area that looked like some construction was recently done. The pool area was very nice - very clean & lots of chairs. The water was a little warm though (between 80-90 is my guess), considering it was 90 degrees outside w/ a heat index of 100! I never went in the hot tub, but someone commented that it was about the same temp as the regular pool. The room I happened to get was sort of a suite (Room 130). You walked in to sort of a sitting area, with a couch and 2 chairs. I would think there would be a TV out there (there was even a cable or antenna hook up out there), but there wasn't. The bedroom was on the right, with its own door. The room was HUGE! There was a dresser w/ a TV on it, 2 queen beds, a large closet & a ton of open room. It would be perfect for a family because you could close the door. There was a mini kitchen w/ a little sink, fridge and microwave, along with a coffee maker. They provide a bag of microwave popcorn & some coffee. For the bathroom, there was a sink in between the kitchen & the bathroom, and then a separate bathroom. The bathroom itself was kind of small, considering the size of the rest of the room! But, we had 4 large towels, I think 5 hand towels and 4 or 5 washclothes. There were 3 bars of handsoap and another bar of body soap. I've never seen so many towels & things of soap in a hotel (usually I need to ask for extras!). As far as the people that complained about a mildew smell - this whole room had tile floor. I'm not sure if it was recently renovated, but I thought it was a good idea in that kind of climate to not even bother with carpet. And the tile floor seemed to keep the place a little cooler. It did seem a little dusty though. The air conditioning worked great. There was a digital thermostat on the bedroom wall. We pretty much kept it around 75 the whole time. I only went for breakfast one time, but I thought they had a pretty decent spread. They had sweet rolls, cereal, white & wheat toast, frozen waffles, hard boiled eggs, bagels and a couple other things. They had a few toasters, so I had no problem with toasting my waffles. They also have a computer in the lobby with a printer, which was handy for buying Trolley Tickets. They also have tickets available at the front desk, but they only accept cash for them. The only problem with the place was we did have ants - although they were very tiny ants (that were quite quick!). There were ants on one of the bedroom walls (opposite the beds) & in the kitchen. By the second night, the kitchen ants had spread to the sink that was outside of the bathroom. I called the front desk around midnight, asking if they had a can of bug spray. Within a couple minutes, the guy came to our door with a can of ant & roach spray. We sprayed the place down & the ants were immediately dead. (And the stuff didn't smell bad either!). The ants didn't come back to the areas we sprayed, although, we ended up finding more later. Overall, I would say it's a nice place for the price. They do need to do something about the ants, but it seemed that they were aware of the problem - so maybe the maids should just get used to spraying the stuff in between guests. The next cheapest accomodations in Key West were around $50/night more, so to me it's all kind of relative!", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGood stay\u201d", "Author": "ecsmom", "ReviewID": "UR8079208", "Content": "We stayed at BWH from July 2-7.

We had stopped here before on cruise ships for the day. The Hibiscus during our stay was going through some construction around the pool, installing a new pump system I was told by the desk clerk. The actual work area was walled off from the pool area, but the noise was still there during working hours. Our grandkids didn't seems ot mind, nor did we. The pool area itself was recently redone with new decking. Its very nice and will be much better once all the construction is completed. The pool has trees around it, but could have used more umbrellas to shade from the sun, at my age I don't want too much sun . . .the water was warm and the kids had a great time. All rooms have Wifi which worked fine for us and the hotel has a continental breakfast, which was the usual stuff. The breakfast room was very small and could be bigger, but it as nicely decorated. Our room was clean and seemed renovated . . .with new curtains and bed coverings. The shower needed a new shower head as it was a trickle . . .but we survived. The A/C worked just fine. The Best Western Hibiscus is within walking distance to restaurants. We tried Camilles for breakfast one morning , a block away, it was good, but again I thought over priced, compared to prices on the mainland. I'm sure thats part of the pricing having to truck everything in . . .We were attending a wedding at the Casa Marina which was under going massive construction. I'm glad we were at the Hibiscus.

Breakfast was enough to keep you going for the morning, but the room tended to get a little crowded later on. The lobby also contained a PC for free internet access which was much appreciated. The hotel is located a block away from Duval Street, so is away from the main centre of Key West and the nightlife, meaning you could come home at night and not be disturbed. The northern end of Duval Street is about a 30 minute walk away, but scooters or bikes can be hired from the hotel forecourt if you don't fancy the walk.

It also had the distinction of being more expensive than either of the two previous hotels (the Key West factor I presume).

We liked the cuban sandwiches at the deli/grocery across the way for lunch. We asked about dinner restaurants away from Duval street, but didn't get any help; found one by luck on the bay side that was decent.

The only downside to the hotel is the grumpy, moody, misrable staff and the fact that they take the first night in advance dispite booking direct.

Jamaican Me Hungry was excellent as was The Rooftop Cafe(Rooftop's Key Lime Pie is excellent). You have got to go to Flying Monkeys bar and have a Frozen White Russian. I had to have one everyday.

We had booked the seniors rate - they put us in a room on the top floor and facing the street. We had 3 large suitcases and this place has no elevators! Upon enquiring for a room that was more accessible we were told we'd have to pay the full price to get them - out of neccessity we did this (not pleased with this as its the first time we've come across this type of bait and switch tactic at a hotel). The pool area is very nice and plenty of chairs to suntan and relax. Very nice setting. Many people would hang out at night and sit around there. The rooms are old, have a strong musty odour. They are VERY large though and the cleaning staff did a great job. However, they are old rooms as this motel is not new. We did have problems with the musty smell and developed runny noses as a result. This magically cleared up the day we checked out. So be forewarned. Food - the breakfast is a joke. Its a small nook (can't even call it a room, next to reception where you can get some muffins, danish, donuts in the morning before 9:00). I don;t have a problem with eating out by the pool as thats a gorgeous place to be but the food is so bad and the space so tight that its not possible for more than one person to get in. Everything except the muffins tasted terrible. If you like breakfast go to a restaurant and have a nice one. Service - apart from the cleaning staff don't expect much. When we asked for an extra blanket the clerk asked why and spent about 3 mins telling us that this was a non-standard request!! It seemed he was doing us a huge favour. Location - this is what set it apart from other cheap choices. Free parking and right next to the southernmost point. You still have to drive down to the more happening part of town, or catch a taxi ($8). But it beats living in the newer part of town which lacks character. Yes, you can walk all those blocks, we did it and it took us about an hour at a fast clip - but why would you want to? Would I stay here again - probably not as we had problems with the musty smell (mould??) in the room. People say all hotel rooms in Florida have this problem but after being down there for 1.5 weeks, staying at 4 different hotels I'd have to strongly disagree.
