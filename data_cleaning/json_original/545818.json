I work in a travel agency in Perth Western Australia and was very much impressed with the Puri Raja. The renovation that has been completed for some time now has improved the rooms and grounds very much. The superior room we stayed in was very clean and quite modern. a very minimalist feel but a very functional room with fridge and in room safe. The split system air conditioning kept the room very cool. Bathroom was a good size with shower over the bath. Water pressure was excellent. We loved the small feel of the hotel and never had to fight for sun beds near the pools. We found the pool closest to the lobby to be a bit cooler in temperature than the beach end pool. The beach end pool was a bit like a warm bath sometimes.Food was great. They have the greatest banana pancakes ever for breakfast.

We stayed 3 days in August. The room wasn't too bad but the price was bumped up to US$70 because it's high season. We wanted to stay for 4 nights, but when we booked, they said it was all booked out. When we actually arrived and were checking in, they were expecting us to stay 4 nights, but, I already booked somewhere else for another night because I was told no vacancy. They didn't look happy like 'you booked for 4 nights and now you're cancelling one night' kind of... Maybe all of a sudden they had a vacancy...I don't know, they never came back to inform me that. But, while we were staying the hotel didn't look fully occupied at all (?).Another thing was that I requested for a free transport from the airport before we got there which they refused and said it was US$10 for one way from the airport. So I didn't use it because I knew taxi was cheaper (about US$5 for prepaid taxi at the airport). When I arrived there by taxi, they said they arranged a transport for me at the airport to pick us up (not a free one). Again, they didn't look happy, But, I was annoyed by their self confirming for their own convenience without confirming/informing with their customers. The room was generally clean, but, for our last night, cleaners forgot to replace complimentary mineral water and replacing clean cups/glasses. Don't expect staff would be friendly all the time, maybe it was high season and they were getting enough customers without putting much efforts.One good thing about the hotel though is the it's restaurant where you eat breakfast. It's right on the beach which is quite nice.Don't book any trips at the hotel reception. It's heaps more expensive there. If you book through trip booking kiosks which you can find anywhere in the street in Kuta/Legian/Tuban, you can get big discounts. In Puri Raja, they charge you for the printed prices in the trip brochures.", "Date": "Sep 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR825555635", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "newearth"}, {"Content": "Sssh, keep Puri Raja a secret... Puri Raja \u9225?what a find! I recently spent a week at Puri Raja for the first time on my 7th trip to Bali.Finally! I have found the perfect balance in a hotel. Just like Goldilocks with the three bears\u9225\ue6cft\u9225\u6a9a not too big, not too small - it\u9225\u6a9a just right!In the past I have stayed at other popular resorts like Padma, Santika, Legian Paradiso and Bounty. Puri Raja is quite different to all of these and oh so much better.It\u9225\u6a9a smaller than normal resorts\u9225?72 rooms \u9225?and feels more intimate and personal. 68 Rooms are set out in two levels down a long avenue of immaculately kept gardens with 4 deluxe single storey rooms near the pool. It has a beachfront location at one end of the resort with gorgeous beach/sunset views and quick access to the local colourful streets of Legian at the other end.The rooms are simple, modern and convenient. Facilities are functional, recently updated and sufficient \u9225?air conditioning, tea/coffee, 2 bottles comp water, new-ish TV\u9225\u6a9a with limited cable stations, good water pressure and in-room safe. Beds are comfortable but linen and towels could be a touch \u9225\u6e02righter\u9225?and fresher but they are fine for a 3-star property.The balcony or veranda\u9225\u6a9a welcomed you for a late afternoon drink and a place to read or to sit and watch/chat with the other guests passing by.Most guests during my visit were Aussies and repeat guests. The average age range was early 30\u9225\u6a9a to 50\u9225\u6a9a. This hotel would not be suitable for young party goers but definitely for the young at heart. Wear a smile and you\u9225\u6a92l meet many new friends.Breakfast served at the beachfront restaurant offered a wonderful vista. The breakfast is served cooked to order. This is unusual for many resorts in Bali who normally have breakfast buffets. I have mixed feelings about this. The positives were that the food was fresh and cooked to order but this is offset by time as sometimes service was slow. Sometimes there are mornings where you just want to help yourself and get going with your day.I disliked not having tea/coffee readily accessible \u9225?having to wait for it to be \u9225\u6e1ferved\u9225?was a bit frustrating, especially for refills. My suggestion would be to have a self-serve tea/coffee/juice station. This would at least free staff up to focus on the food orders and give people something to keep them occupied while waiting for breakfast to be cooked.The pool located near reception (street end) was much quieter than the main pool. Rectangular, deep at one end with a few lounges and umbrellas. No food/beverage outlets in this area.The pool at beach end, near restaurant, was much more lively, larger and of varying depths. The swimming noodles provided were popular.There was a swim up pool bar and food/drinks served around the pool were reasonably priced even factoring in the tax/service and of OK quality.There were a number of sun lounge hogs (or should that be \u9225\u6e09ogettes\u9225? who used towels/magazines to reserve lounges in the early morning only to return later in the day to use them. There probably wasn\u9225\u6a9b any need because for the most part it was easy to find a lounge by the pool regardless of the time of day.We didn\u9225\u6a9b order any room service but I guess it was the same service as the restaurant so would have been fine.There\u9225\u6a9a no real extensive tour desk/concierge, day spa, tennis court, kids club or gym so if you really want these services Puri Raja is not for you. The hotel reception staff are friendly and accommodating for transfers, some tour advice and money exchange but if you want greater access to a hotel to provide lots of various services and facilities you should look elsewhere.When I wanted to experience day spa luxury I headed to the Mandara Spa at Hotel Padma where you can visit regardless of whether you are a guest or not. I chose a lengthy treatment package in their outdoor spa villas which was over $100USD.At the other end of the scale, the Lida Spa was a small beauty salon located in the local street just in front of the Melasti Resort that offered great 1 hour massages in simple air conditioned surrounds for about 50,000Rp.One unique feature of the Puri Raja is that it does offer pool side massages and mani/pedi treatments at comparable \u9225\u6e1ftreet\u9225?prices by friendly staff in shady areas around the resort.There are plenty of restaurants in walking distance for dining options that were all great. On the street side a short walk away was Posers, Poco Loco, Indo-National and Le Monde. Along the Legian Beach front Blue Ocean is recommended for a cool vibe, outstanding view and free internet.Puri Raja offers fantastic value for money in a quality resort for those that don\u9225\u6a9b need a full- service resort. It's certainly one of the top hotels for what they charge compared to other 3 star hotels.It\u9225\u6a9a no wonder the resort is often booked out. You could spend a lot more for a lesser standard hotel in Bali. I have in the past!Puri Raja is a fantastic resort that offers value for money for relaxed holiday makers. Let\u9225\u6a9a keep it that way and not let the secret out. Ssshh. I\u9225\u6a92l be back.", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR931082103", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Veebes"}, {"Content": "a hidden oasis wow this place was better than what i thought it was gonna be, i found this hotel by reading everyones reviews on this site ,it really helped me pick a great hotel ,so im hoping it will help you make your decision too.this place was very clean ,they were always tidying the gardens and pathways.it is a smaller block of hotel villa style rooms ,all with balconys upstairs and verandahs downstairs,the rooms were spotless,tv ,fridge with complimentary water,and full of drinks to buy.plenty of storage space for all your shopping and our room had a safe,which was great so we could leave our money and passports in, you pick your own safe code.the bathroom has a bath and shower in one,very nice.if you book with breakfast included you only get the choice of the american breakfast which is, fruit platter or juice,eggs sauasage and bacon,croissant or toast,and ask for nescafe for your coffee coz bali coffee is not the greatest.the front reception is right on the street front in legianand then the hotel is long and narrow shaped and the other end of the hotel is directly acrooss to the beach ,no traffic at the beach end of the hotel as it is blocked off to cars so alot of people go walking along.next door was the melasti hotel and many people staying there wanted to move to the puri raja but this place is apparently booked well in advanced,i was going to choose the melasti but im glad i didnt ,puri raja is just so peacefull and quiet, many of the poeple staying here were older than us and we are in our late 30s,very quiet at nite so i got some great sleep,except for the fireworks that people kept setting off at kuta beach.easiest way to go into kuta was to walk along the beach ,we found that alot easier than trying to dodge all the shop people outside on the streets.there is 2 pools one at the road end where people read and tan ,very quiet pool and the pool at the beach end has the bar and music going.i can keep talking all day about this place ,i was really happy ,all staff friendly and always smiling ,we are planning on staying here again without a doubt.", "Date": "Aug 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR549012625", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kooching"}, {"Content": "Central Popular Hotel We have just returned from two weeks at the Puri Raja Hotel.

It took them 8 hours to return to actually clean our room again after we had complained. It was extremely difficult to explain to the staff why it wasnt on for them to come into out room without us leaving a sign on the door.The overall set up of the hotel is pretty good as far as prettyness  goes. There are no lounge charis etc at the front of the hotel that you can sit on, relax and look out onto the beach without getting bothered by the locals.My husband almost broke his arm on the steps which are covered but stupidly designed water pours down them if it rains  they are not anti slip. We plan to return to Bali next year and we definately will not be staying at the Puri Raja. Your better of paying a little bit more to stay at the Mandira or Padma or head further towards Kuta and stay in a hotel thats cheaper than the Pur Raja and you wont be so dissapointed with what you paid for.", "Date": "Jun 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR625083058", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "jkm1"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel, Great Location We stayed at the Puri Raja this May, It was recomended by our travel agent due to the new referbishment.

The restuarant open 24 hours and nice food. The hotel has 2 swimming pools, both very clean and relaxing.

I travelled with my husband (we're in our 40's) and 3 teenage children. We went with another couple and their teenage son. I booked it on the internet, not expecting a great deal as it was reasonably cheap. We were pleasantly surprised! Great helpful staff who were great fun and very flexible, beautiful gardens, nice, roomy, clean, refurbished rooms, (don't know what the other person was talking about with hard mattresses on the bed in his review - we didn't have a problem) Our rooms were close to the pool (at the beach end), I would definitely suggest getting a room at that end rather than the street end.Meals and drinks etc were good and cheap enough for the kids to order frequently without giving us a heart attack at the end when we had to pay our bill on checkout.There were mainly aussies there who we met and had a great time with. We didn't find it noisy or loud and annoying like the other person did, and I am a couple of years older than them. Maybe we had a more behaved crowd. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a buffet breakfast, but there was still a good choice and it was quick. Hotel was probably about 60% full so maybe that was why it was better. A manicure and pedicure whilst sitting at the pool only cost $7.00 for both - a bargain. The DVD shop right out the front across the road was fantastic, give them your list and any others you want and pick up before you leave, they will test every single dvd for you and give you only good quality ones, we haven't had one dodgy dvd yet - all great quality so far. We have stayed at quite a few places in Bali and this was one of the best. We will definitely go back to Bali and stay there again - providing they keep their prices reasonable!", "Date": "Feb 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR231283360", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "relaxingholidays"}, {"Content": "Puri Raja - Would stay there again !

The place is now full of Australians  it's just over the top, too much loud talking  carry on for my liking (but you get what you pay for) we normally stay out of the rat race, further up the beach so I guess this is what you get when you are amongst it all. Location is great, walking distance to everything, so that is a definate plus. We stayed over the New Years Period Dec 2006 to Jan 2007  if you like paper thin walls, curtains that dont block out the light in the morning  far too much closeness to other people for my liking then this is for you.Breakfast, well, forget the buffet  if you want to sit down  wait half an hour for a coffee let alone any food  choose either fruit or fruit juce, crossant/danish or hot breakfast, then go for it (I do want to say tho that the hotel was at 100% capacity for new years so maybe the service is better through the year). Anyway, we wont be going back. Maybe I just work too hard or am getting too old (45), but for me now this is not the place, probably in my 20's I'd have a rave review.Everything in the rooms are VERY Clean, but the TV only has a few channels  only one English speaking (no movie channel, despite management saying there is satellite TV).", "Date": "Jan 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR439592164", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Tes"}, {"Content": "Puri Raja Hotel Leignin Bali The Puri Raja Hotel has just been done up, it is a beautiful place, Small with mostly Australian and New Zealand people staying there, it is our 7 time staying there, we find the staff very friendly, the place is clean and the room are a very good size. There are two pools one has a pool bar and is down where the restuarant is which over looks the beach and the other is at the front of the hotel. The meals there are beautiful and the prices are great. We have just come back from spending Christmas and the New Year there and hope that next year we are able to go again. I think we spent christmas and the New year with half of Perth as they were all staying at the hotel. What a party we had New Years Eve at the hotel. Thank You Puri Raja Hotel and Staff for a wonderful night.You are only a 10 to 15 minute walk into Kuta along the beach, and there are loads of places to eat around where the hotel is.
