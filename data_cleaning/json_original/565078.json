The room was spacious for Venice standards. The beds were comfortable. There was a gorgeous view of the Venice lagoon out the window. We consider ourselves budget travelers and we could not believe that we could afford a room with such an amazing view. We liked to just sit and take in the view in the mornings before the streets start to fill with tourists and peddlers. Also, the bathroom was very clean and luxurious for our standards. The front desk was very helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. On the day we were leaving, we checked out and headed for the water bus (vapretto). Because it was rush hour, there was a massive crowd of Venetian residents trying to cram themselves onto what was already a crowded vehicle. We got separated from the people we were traveling with and one member of our group ended up onto the water bus and the rest of us didn't. The canals of Venice doesn't lend itself very well to chasing after the water bus, so we were panicking. We ended up going back to the hotel and we were let back into the room we already checked out of to make an international phone call(for free) to the group member we lost, so in the end we were able to make arrangements to meet back at the hotel. We were endlessly grateful to the hotel for lending us a hand in this situation. Two tips I wanted to share: - When you leave the hotel, turning right will lead you to all the touristy areas with the typical tourist-trap restaurants. Turning left will lead you to a more residential area of restaurants with lower prices and better food. - Getting to the hotel from the train station using the water bus was easy. We took Line 1 and got a boat tour of Venice along the way. However, if you need to catch a train leaving Venice for which you have a reservation, you want to leave 90 min to a hour to be safe. In our case, we were meticulous in checking the vapretto schedules the night before and figured we were catching one that would get us to the train station on time. What actually happened was that if the fog is too heavy, the vapretto won't come at all with no notice. By the time we figured this out, it was too late. Also, a water taxi is more reliable (there is a stand right outside the hotel). We inquired about one and it seemed like there is alot of negotiation room for the price.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin ireland", "Title": "\u201cloved this little hotel, its fabulous\u201d", "Author": "niamhy09", "ReviewID": "UR72906769", "Content": "I stayed here with my partner for a few days and really enjoyed it, staff were lovely rooms really comfortable, we actually got engaged while looking out over the canal on the balcony as it was just so beautiful, would recomened it to any one going to venice as its perfect.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cCharming little boutique hotel with a great location\u201d", "Author": "Kris69Mumbai", "ReviewID": "UR62569526", "Content": "Venice is breathtaking and it was enhanced by the hotel.

We chose this hotel due to its location and the free offers of a city map, entry to a casio and, most important, a trip to the glass factories on Murano. We flew with easyjet direct to Marco Polo airport and took a vaporetto (water bus) from the airport to Venice. Please see to hotel website for details. The water bus took a route past some smaller islands, with a stop at the Lido before going around the Castello district for the Arsenal stop which took about 1 hour. The hotel was easy to find despite the fact it was dark when we arrived. We received a warm welcome, our free map and a quick briefing on breakfast arrangements and were shown straight to our room on the first floor. We had booked a double room with a Lagoon view and it was perfect. The view was fantastic, the room clean and quite spacious with Tea/Coffee making facilities. The bathroom too was clean and spacious with a bath/shower, toiletries and a large heated towel rack. The Continential Breakfast was served in a room at the end of the corridor and although it is substantial, it can be alittle repetative after a few days as it is the same fair everyday. On our first day in Venice, we purchased a Chorus pass from the tourist office in the left hand corner of San Marco Piazza as look down the square with the Basilica behind you. The Hotel is only a 5min Walk from this amazing site. The Chorus pass allows you to visit 16 of the best Churches in Venice and is a great way to explore this beautiful city. Best advice would be to start as early as possible if you wish to get your monies worth and a map is essential to avoid getting badly lost and to plot a route to the churches that interest you most. We managed to vist 6 in total, one of which was closed so please also check opening times if it is a church you really want to go in. We took over 200 photos of Venice just walking around finding these churches. On our second day, we did 3 excursions with a company called Venice Events ( 1827 San Marco, 30124 - Venice, Italy) which was a guided tour of the Basilica di San Marco including the Pala d' Oro, a guided tour of the Palazzo Ducale including the prison over the Bridge of Sighs and a gondola ride around some of the lesser known canals and waterways. On our last day, we did our fourth excursion with Venice Events which was a guided tour of the Grand canal in a water taxi with a real Venitian resident, and our trip to the glass factories on Murano which was organised by the hotel. Murano was the one place that my girl really wanted to visit and it was great to see the glass blowers making the piecies of glass and to feel the heat of the furnaces. General Stuff There are many restaurants and cafes in Venice to choose from with generally good food and good friendly service. Our fav restaurant was a Trattitore in the first alleyway on the right as you leave the hotel towards San Marco Square. Be aware of the restaurants that the hotel recommends, particularly by Jack. The couple who went with us to Murano did not like the food or service and the restaurant he recommended and other trip advisors have mentioned this as well. Look out for the ' hidden charges' on restaurant menus especially the cover charges. We only had one problem with a bill at a restaurant who had a four hour happy hour with 50% off your bill. Extra drinks and food we did not have appeared on it and when questioned about this, with out even saying ok I'll check with the waiter, it was removed from the bill without an apology or a smile which leads me to think they do this quite regularly hence no argument about changing the bill. Generally speaking, there are quite a few 'hidden charges' on things e.g. extra charges in the Basilica to view the Pala d' Oro or the free trip to Murano by the hotel, it is only one way! You have to make your own way back. Be aware. Overall, Venice is a great city, clean and very safe.

The room was lovely and warm, which was great, because you don't go to Venice in January for the warm weather! The service in A Tribute to Music was some of the best I've seen in any hotel I've stayed in. We arrived earlier than the check in time, so Martina on the check in desk took our bags until check in time. This is standard in most hotels, but she then recommended somewhere for us to go for lunch. After a 7am flight from Dublin, we were ready for a decent bite to eat. It was a perfect spot to go. A local cafe that served the best sandwiches. When we returned to check in, our bags were in our room and we got a tour of the hotel. Later that evening, we were ready to head out for dinner. We asked the guy on the desk (Jack) where he could suggest. We said that we would prefer somewhere off the beaten track where we could try somewhere that the locals would go, as opposed to the tourist trap places. He recommended a great place with the best seafood, Il Nuovo Galeon. Really decent wine list too! I've read a few reviews complaining about the standard of the breakfasts in this hotel. I found the breakfast to be everything that you would expect from a continental breakfast, We found that it set us up for the many miles that we were to walk each day around Venice. We didn't need lunch until late afternoon most days after having breakfast at 8am. The coffee was great too. I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough.

Sometimes I stay at an old favourite like Ca Formenta or Villa Igea whilst other times I try somewhere new. More often than not some where new disappoints and I'd wished that I had stay at an old favourite instead. This certainly was not the case with A Tribute to Music which I now must add to my list of favourite places to stay. Because of the time of year I went I got a really good rate for my stay, but I did note that at other times it could be a tad expensive From the outside, the hotel looks very anominous; in fact you would not recognise it as one. The hotel reception area is very small and at first you may be a little disappointed, but just wait until you get into your room. All the rooms are named after musicians/composers and each floor represents a different style of music, such as Classical (e.g. Vivaldi), Blues and Jazz (e.g. Louis Armstrong) and Pop (e.g. Rolling Stones) although this is not reflected at all in the rooms' decoration, bathroom, fittings and furniture which are all high class Venetian in style, beautifully finished. I had the Miles Davies Room on the second floor. It was most definitely the best bedroom I have ever had in Venice, even beating the Villa Igea. Oh what joy to come in late in the afternoon after a hard day's sightseeing, fling open the two huge windows, sit on the bed and watch life go by on the Riva and all the activity, comings and goings of the boats as they off loaded or collected their little groups of tourists whilst eating a wonderful Italian ice cream purchased on the way back to the hotel. The view is lovely and you get both the sunrise and sunset effects on the buildings across to San Gorgio Maggiore, Guidecca with the Redentore Church and then back to the Salute at the junction of the Grand Canal and the Guidecca Canal. You almost don't want to be bothered to venture out of your room but sit there all day gazing at the view. I was really lucky with the weather this time and had wall to wall blue sky and sunshine (although a bit chilly) for all the 6 days I was in Venice, amazing for mid-March. And if you perchance to wake during the night, a look out of the window beguiles with a full moon( if you are lucky as I was) and its reflection rippling across the water of the Bacino from San Giorgio Maggiore. I guess you could be a bit disappointed with the breakfast room (looks like it was originally a smallish bedroom and bathroom converted into the breakfast room). Nevertheless breakfast which is served at your table has a certain charm and the waitresses (who also were the bedroom maids, I think) were very friendly and efficient. In your room, there is a small fridge containing bottled water, coke, couple of tins of beer which I think are complimentary - but check with Reception. As other reviewers have said, this hotel is very convenient for all the sites and for transport around Venice and to/from the airport. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The rooms are spotlessly clean. The bath had a handheld shower which was very powerful. In these credit crunch times beware that if you use the public loos in Venice the price is 1 euro 50 (i.e. \u00c2\u00a31.50), food in some restaurants is extremely poor value and quality. For a special day out and something different, I recommend taking the boat to Torcello (from the Riva , one an hour). You have to change at Burano but the change of boats is synchronised so you don't have to hang about for a connection. Go and look at the spectacular mosaics in the ancient church there and then, before leaving atmospheric and quiet Torcello, have a perfect lunch, with perfect service in lovely settings at a reasonable price at the Villa 600 Restaurant which faces more or less the small rustic Cipriani Hotel and Restaurant by the bridge leading to the Church (offshoot of the glitzy Cipriani in Venice). Torcello seems miles away from the tourist hustle and bustle of Venice. A place to chill out. You can then get the litle shuttle boat back to Burano and spend the rest of the afternoon exploring this old fishing islands with the colourful houses.", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cPerfect choice\u201d", "Author": "meeEngland", "ReviewID": "UR26971291", "Content": "I spent a lot of time looking for a suitable hotel for our visit to Venice and I could not have chosen a better hotel. My husband and I took my father-in-law for his birthday treat to Venice 22-23 March 2009. We had visited Venice before but he hadn't. We knew roughly where we wanted to go: a short walking distance from a Vaparetto stop, near the main sites, a good view of Venice and a hotel that wasn't too big. We got all that and more in 'A Tribute to Music' hotel. It is about 2 mins walk from the Arsenale stop and 5 mins from the S Marco Zaccaria stop so a perfect location. I had booked two rooms with a lagoon view and what a view we got! It must be one of the best views in Venice as in front of us was the island of San Giorgio Maggiore and the lagoon of San Marco. The rooms were larger than I expected, beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. The bathroom felt new and extremely clean and everything worked well. We had a warm welcome straight away as we walked into my father-in-law's room - a bottle of the best Prosecco wine with three glasses waiting for us to celebrate his birthday (it was after all his 90th)!! Thank you so much for that, in case we didn't express that enough during our visit. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Martina, the young lady at the reception, went out of her way to make us welcome (she even made us a cup of tea when we went to collect our luggage which we could leave all day in the hotel after checking out). She speaks excellent English and French. The breakfast was good , just as 'reilina' below describes. My father-in-law didn't want to leave the hotel, he thought it was perfect and everything possible was thought of. It obviously made me happy too as I had to book the hotel for us amongst so many in Venice.

When I had only a weekend to show a friend everything she wanted to see in Venice, we decided we needed a very nice, relaxing, centrally-located hotel to facilitate our need to get a lot done in two very short days. Residenza A Tribute to Music not only met, but exceeded our expectations, especially for the price. The rooms have definite style (See photos). We booked a less expensive courtyard room view since we'd be spending most of our time outside anyway, but the rooms with water views that we saw being cleaned looked superb, and were much larger than our already adequately sized room. Martina at the front desk welcomed us, gave us maps, directions, and showed us where to find a quick bite for lunch, and consistently just answered all our little questions throughout the weekend. She really made us feel like valued guests. The location of the hotel is not directly on San Marco, but a short 5 minute walk away. It is central enough that you do not have to wade through seas of tourists just to get to and from the hotel. Although it is not at all loud at night since the busier activity is up the road, it is located on the main street along the lagoon. This made two girls traveling alone feel much more comfortable, since unlike the smaller side streets of Venice, you will always see people out and about on your way home, so you do not have to be uneasy about returning late from a restaurant. Additionally, the hotel had someone at the desk 24 hours, and you had to ring to enter, day or night, and retrieve your key from them, and you had to unlock your floor in the elevator. The security was certainly extensive. Also, the breakfast was superb. The breads were fresh, the hot chocolate superb, and the offerings very extensive for an Italian breakfast (such as cold cuts and cheese, in addition to the breads, toasts, croissants, fruits, and cereals). The lady serving breakfast was very patient with our attempts at Italian and did not keep us waiting. Overall, I have no complaints about the Residenza A Tribute to Music. It is an oasis in a city full of less than remarkable and highly overpriced hotels. If you are looking for good local food and wine in an unpretentious restaurant, I recommend the Bistrot de Venise. It is about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel just north of Piazza San Marco, and definitely worth checking out.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh21", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Edinburgh21", "ReviewID": "UR22242216", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from a 2 night stay at A Tribute To Music Hotel in Venice.

The reality proved to be somewhat different. Arriving at the hotel at 6 p.m on Sunday evening, we were initially told that we could have the option of a suite at the same price as the room that we had booked. When we queried the details and it transpired that the accommodation was in a building some distance away, we stated our wish to remain in the hotel with the lagoon-view room that we had reserved. We were then told that no such room was available. Given the late hour, the distance we had travelled and the unknown city, we felt that we had no option but to reluctantly accept the situation. We were then introduced to Brenda, who we were told would prepare our breakfast in the morning. Subsequently, we were led across a bridge and along the canal-side to an apartment (described on our bill as \"B and B La Corte dei Doge\"). A section of this apartment formed our accommodation, the other rooms being locked. We approached the accommodation from the street-entrance by a somewhat dingy narrow staircase, and entered from the staircase by a door that apparently didn't lock. We did have a key to turn in our room and were told that we shouldn't be concerned as 'Venice is a safe city' and from the hallway, we had a telephone link with the hotel. We were shown the kitchen where breakfast would be served and asked to say there and then what time we wanted breakfast, and on deciding on 9 a.m we were told that Brenda would arrive at 8.30am to cook for us. Next morning, there was no sign of Brenda, but at 9 a.m a young woman appeared with a carrier bag and asked us to wait. Her preparations were complete within five minutes. Breakfast comprised cereal (just one type, no choice), a glass of fruit juice apiece (again, no choice), a few far-from-fresh rolls and croissants, small pots of yoghurt, a few small foil wrapped sections of cheese, tinned fruit salad and a plate containing slices of cold meat. This was accompanied by a cup of instant coffee each (obviously a cheap brand labelled 'coffee with cereal') and no option of a refill. As we ate, the young lady hovered about, which didn't exactly encourage us to linger over our food, and when we finished, she promptly cleared away and locked up after us. On each subsequent day, the same plate of meat and bowl of fruit salad were brought out, the rolls were replenished but were still not fresh. All in all, breakfast was reminiscent of a cheap backpacker's hostel and nothing like the 3-star experience shown on the web-site. Our room room was clean, with quite spacious en-suite facilities, a good view over the waterfront and the lagoon and a large comfortable bed, but we encountered a number of practical problems. Twice in three days the toilet in our en-suite bathroom failed to flush. On the first occasion, on the Monday evening, a call to reception elicited the initial response that it wouldn't be possible to get someone to look at it until tomorrow! Persistence finally got \"the technician\" to call within ten minutes. Response was rather quicker when we complained about the same problem a day later. In addition, the screws in door handles were loose, a matter of particular concern in our somewhat isolated position and, more worryingly, there appeared to be no fire precautions whatsoever - no instructions, no fire-escape, no smoke detectors, no fire extinguisher. We decided that nothing should cloud our experience of Venice and, after our initial complaint, we determined to make the most of our time there but we are in no doubt that we received a considerably inferior service to that offered at the time of booking.

I booked the room based on Trip Advisor reviews. The room was a Superior Triple on the third floor (2nd per European standards). It was nicely furnished but lacked anything to distinguish it as superior, besides some cheap slippers. There was hardly any soap- two packets for three people for two nights- and it was very cheap. No other supplies in the bathroom. I travel a lot and I have to say that it is nice to get toiletries like a real container of shampoo or lotion instead of the plastic packets. The beds were covered with pretty damask covers but they were extremely perfumed and the smell bothered all three of us- we had a hard time falling asleep because of it and it was dusty. I had the covers removed the next day and then the overly perfumed smell went away. But when I saw the blanket on my bed was dirty- it had a stain on it which was, let's just say, rather disgusting, it became apparent that it had not been washed before we came to sleep in the room. The bathroom was alright. Some of the towels were nice, others very warn with strings hanging off of them. The tub looks nice but was extremely narrow (and I am petite) and difficult to even wash oneself in. There is no shower curtain or place to hand the shower so you have to take a tub. My parents (in their seventies) found this difficult and awkward. The windows have very old hardware on them and were hard to open and close and seemed as if they were about to fall apart. I had business to do on the trip and I chose the hotel partly because they had free wireless. Well, it didn't work and I spent several hours (time in venice majorly wasted) trying to make it work- part of which was with the help of my husband on the cell phone (money lost) since the man at the desk, though he tried to be helpful, was unable to ever get it going with either the wireless or a cable. I had just traveled to Seattle and around Washington state for three weeks using wireless everywhere with no problem. That was a major bummer. The good: The staff were friendly and helpful. They recommended a restaurant we didn't like for lunch the first day, but that was because the one they like to recommend was closed. They lent us an umbrella and a new guidebook to use during the whole time. The mattresses were very comfortable. The location was really great right on the water about a ten minute walk from St. Marks, with a water view of the boats. I didn't find it too loud but some people might. The price was reasonable for Venice. Regarding Restaurants: The 'Cleopatra' had tolerable food but not very good, and a terrible atmosphere with the TV blaring. They charged us a cover but never brought any bread. Il Vecio Portale was stupendous. Absolutely fantastic food and great service. The chef Pino was gracious, friendly and brought us wonderful food. The price was very reasonable and the meal made our time in Venice. They have a great menu, and there were many locals dining as well as some tourists. I had the ravioli stuffed with delicate white fish in a shrimp sauce- wonderful. Their caponata (eggplant) dish was excellent. We also ate at 'Giorgione' which was a good meal - I had an excellent Orata grilled fish. My father had excellent fried calamari with polenta. But they stuck us at a table which was butted up against the cooler and very uncomfortable and bad atmosphere in an otherwise delightful restaurant.

The rooms at the front look out over the lagoon and the quayside- which has the downside of making it noisy from early morning as the hordes of tourists pass by from the cruise ships-- but its worth putting up with the noise for the view from bed. The two small problems are the fact that the only shower fitting is in the bath not fitted above so you can't stand and shower, and the very cramped breakfast room- which actually makes breakfast a stressful event even though the beakfast is very acceptable.

All the staff were really friendly and helpful and it was nice to see staff who actually seemed interested in their job and their appearance, and the bosses Daniele and Martina who you will meet at breakfast could not have been nicer.

Our friends told us about the hotel last fall, but I waited too long to make reservations and the place was booked. I looked elsewhere and everything else in the St Mark's area was so expensive. I kept checking back at their website and they must have had a cancellation because a room became available so I snagged it. Consequently, I couldn't request a lagoon view room but the courtyard we overlooked was charming. The room was oh so beautiful and so very clean! The hand held shower with no shower curtain was my only complaint. Martina, the receptionist, was so helpful! Prior to our arrival I had inquired about a tour at the Doges Palace. Martina got all the info and then even made reservations for me! She truly went above and beyond usual hotel staff helpfulness. Breakfast is the usual rolls, packaged crackers and cookies, cheeses, meats and the most delicious chocolate croissants!Very filling. The front door is locked, you must be buzzed in and the front desk is staffed 24/7. The hotel is small, and as I found out fills quickly during high season so book early! The location is just 2 blocks away from St. Mark's Square, but it's out of the high rent district so it's quite affordable. It was actually the least expensive room we stayed at in 4 cities in Italy!
