I didn't know the area, wish I did. Wish I had taken the bad reviews seriously. Husband and I checked in mid afternoon ... while checking in, a guy comes in with an obviously dressed prostitute asking to rent a room for an hour ... REALLY? Of course the desk guy did ... and the man renting the room stated that he did this last week (to the clerk). Should've been first clue. We got our room, it wasn't great ... bathroom window would not close, mold around the bathtub and windows. A/C did not cool down. We went out to dinner ... came back, room STILL HOT. So husband went down and they did give us another room ... a few doors down. So we move down, settle in ... still mold but the a/c works. Then the noise starts, it was more like a feaking apartment complex than a hotel, parties in the parking lot, loud noisy guests ... I will say the bed was pretty comfy. The next day we decided to head to Banning ... note: we paid for 3 nights, we had that room reserved for 3 nights. Decided to stay in Banning overnight ... went back at almost midnight on Sunday (again our room was paid for until Monday) our room key would not work. We tried for 10 minutes ... nothing. Good thing we took our suitcases with us. Husband went and rang the night bell non stop for 10 minutes and NOBODY answered. It was drizzly and we were tired, so we went next door to Best Western Lamplighter Inn & Suites ... got a room. Had no choice. Next morning hubs went to check us out of HoJo's and they did credit us for that Sunday night but they were adamant that they WERE there ... 2 of them ... well then why the heck didn't you answer? So we ended up paying 87.00 for a few hours sleep at Best Western (which, by the way was wonderful). I would never stay there again ... never.

The beds are so hard I could use them as a table to eat from. The toilet stuck and I had to fix it, cause it was continuously running. The pool looked much larger in the pic, but that is fine for the moment. The pic of the rooms are very deceiving. They look nice in the pics and the rooms looked bigger than they are. We got 2 very small pillows. There are light bulbs that need to be replaced. There are smudges on the walls and they have missing paint. The ceiling has black mold on it. I was told by the operator that Sea World was real close. But it is quite far away. You have to go through the college parking lot to get from the hotel to Sea World. Sadly this is not what I was expecting. I just hope the one near Disneyland is better than this. We came for a nice visit and a relaxing time hoping to have a nice place to stay. I can say a few real nice things about this hotel. It has a huge fridge and has a safety box. I really hope the breakfast is as good as the operator said it was. I am not sure who cleans these rooms, but maybe they need to spend just a few more min dust off the old spider webs off the ceiling and dusting the counter space. The carpet needs to be vacuumed a bit better and I know there is a spray that gets rid of pet and smoke smells. Maybe they need to invest into some. I have stayed in places costing the same and they were much nicer that this. You often get what you pay for. The hotel was cheap and shoddy for the price we paid.

They smelled of mildew, funk, and porta potty after the \"number 2\". The bed was even worse, but it was just the comforter. After removing the comforter, the sheets were okay. Third, the heater was a switch (a light switch) and a huge unit which over powered the space that it occupied. It had a cord which was taped together with electrical tape. I was afraid to turn it on, but I was not willing to freeze. Finally, the shower...it took almost 30 minutes for the shower to get to a decent temperature to even attempt to put your body in. The tub was yellow stained and the towels were crispy. They felt like they were laundered by hand and line dried.

The manager is hard to understand but polite and we had no problems getting a room without reservations. When I checked into the room the overall first impression was OK, nothing more. Standard crappy little motel for the night. Understandable. The beds were OK for a motel, very soft. The television worked without any problems. One major problem was the incredibly disgusting stench that was inside the room, luckily we ha a Glade Plugin, it was bearable for a night but it definitely smelled. The bathroom had serious issues, more specifically the toilet. It looked like someone tried to pull it from the ground, when being used it felt like you were rattling around on a rollercoaster. By all means I would say without a doubt that it is a safety hazard. During our stay we discovered that someone at one time tried to break into the room because the door frame was pulled away.
