This was our fourth hotel in the Holiday Inn / HI Express group on our West Coast trip. Arrived for a 3 night stay and paid cash at check in. On arriving at our room it was located at the rear in a block which resembled a cheap motel. Door to room exposed to the outdoors, we felt so exposed and unsafe there. There was always someone hanging around out on the street and even down by the outside stairwell leading up to our room, just didnt feel safe there and wouldnt have gone out at night in the dark, you could hear peoples every word talking outside. Anyone can see what you are taking into your room, we had 2 large full suitcases(which I had to struggle up 2 flights of stairs with), laptop bag, camera bag, satnav case etc so anyone watching could think we were good targets to rob. There were no security cameras and no safe in room and we were basically right next to the main road at a rear exit. The room itsself had a damp musty smell also. I went to complain and said I wanted to be moved into the main hotel. Afterall, I booked this hotel last June, a full 10 months ago and still got dumped in an outbuilding! We couldnt be moved until the next day so since it was late afternoon we decided to just go out and eat and have an earlier night. I carried everything back down to the car as I wasnt happy at leaving it in the room, one kick to the door would have got anyone in. True to their word, we were moved at 930am the next day into the main hotel, what a difference, like night and day. We felt now that we were staying in a hotel. Far nicer room by far and no smell whatsoever. We spent two really comfortable nights here. I felt totally safe and secure now. Then my next problem arose on the morning I was leaving. I had a quick check online at my credit card and noticed they had taken full payment authorisation for my stay although I paid cash in full on arrival, I was none best pleased and I was informed by reception that it was a mistake and that the authorisation would drop off in a couple of days. It actually took a full week to drop off! When I got home to the UK, I fired off a complaint to the IHG group. To their credit they responded quick with a full apology and an upgrade to a Gold priority member. . If I had been in the Hotel, I would have given an excellent score. I have given an average score as the 2 nights I did spend in the hotel building were very comfortable indeed and they did move me when promised so credit where credits due. Massive letdown though with the first night and the fact they wanted to charge me twice drags my score down to an average. If I were to book here again so far in advance I would probably email the hotel direct after booking to request a room in the hotel building. I felt 100 safe and secure there, didnt feel safe or secure at all in the motel like block", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chantilly, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGood property in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "VirginiaJon", "ReviewID": "UR126830477", "Content": "I attended a meeting at this hotel.

On arrival we checked in very efficiently and were presented with 6 complimentary drinks vouchers and 6 breakfast vouchers, we used 2 of the drinks vouchers when we had a meal in the onsite Point Loma cafe, the food was fine but not exceptional, on the other 2 nights we had dinner in the downtown area, Anthonys being one of them of course. Having read the reviews about the breakfast we did not use the vouchers and organised our own continental type fare for which the fridge in the room came in handy. We were in the rear block looking at the houses and hotels behind the HI, not as good as looking at the marina but fine all the same, we sat on the small balconey on Friday evening and watched the world go by with a drink. The onsite small store sold the basics and we found it handy, also for members of the IHG reward scheme, Priority Club there is a room which has been made into a lounge for Gold and Platinum members(1326) it has a TV, computer with printer, bowl of fruit and snack bars, some visitors may find it handy.

The shuttle begins running at 5am pretty much on call or at about 15 minute intervals for the less than 2 mile run to the terminals. The other nice thing about the location is th access to Shelter Island for restaurants and nightlife. A short walk across Scott St. will bring you to several good long standing seafood restaurants. The hotel itself is quite nice with a restaurant, bar and convenience store on premises. The staff is friendly and professional, and the rooms completely in standard with the Holiday Inn brand.

I had done all my research on the Holiday Inn by the Bay including their long term parking. After arriving at the hotel we were so rummy after 9 hours in the car, some things did not seem as I remembered reading, but oh well. We checked in at 2PM and the room was not ready yet but we were told that it would be around 45 minutes. We asked where the restaurant Anthony's (reservations that night) was and was told by the desk clerk that it was four miles down the road. That should have been my first clue that we were in the wrong place? Asking about places closer, the desk clerk pointed out other restaurants around the area, but did not give us their pre-printed restaurant guide until I went back and bugged her again about something else. She would only giving me the information I wanted and nothing more. I told her the kids were starving and if there were any fast foods places we could walk to, we were pointed in the direction. So, we headed off and noticed they have a little store on the property so we went in there. They offered premade sandwiches (which could hold them over) which we bought along with sodas. The store has all kinds of beverages, snacks, liquor and souvenir type stuff. You can get a sweatshirt there too. They have a nice (dining like) table and chair in the lobby where we could sit. They also have in the lobby a computer kiosk where you can print boarding passes. If I remember correctly I think I saw flight schedules displayed? About 45 minutes later, I went back to the desk to see if the room was ready. I got the keys, told them we had made reservations for the long term parking and the male desk clerk (very good) gave me a ticket to put in the window. Grabbed the bags out of the car and headed to the room. I had booked a two room suite with a bay view at a great AAA rate of 161.00 (not including tax). The \"living area\" of the room was very spacious with a full size sofa, chair, large sofa table, wetbar with sink and microwave. The living room also had a full bathroom. The TV was a large flatscreen. The bedroom area faced the bay and had a king bed, small table and chair and a large flatscreen TV. The dressing area was large although the vanity was small. The bathtub/shower and toilet were in a small room. The rooms appeared to have been updated recently, everything seemed fresh. After getting in the room and opening the blinds there was no balcony (second clue?) but oh well, maybe we would have had to wait longer, and I'm too tired to bug the desk clerk again. But I'm thinking to myself, \"this does not look familiar, too many boats for a big ship to dock, the reviewers must know something I don't\". After resting a few hours, we jay-walked across the street to Jimmy's Famous Steakhouse. They do not take reservations, but the congenial host said to call about 15 minutes before we wanted to come in and they would hold a table for us. We headed over after our call and were seated immediately. We had an excellent meal and not crazy expensive either. Back to the hotel and off to bed. The bed was extremely comfortable with soft sheets. The kids pulled out the sofa bed and saif it was pretty comfortable. The next morning we heard fog horns, so yeah the ship is coming in. I peeked out the window, fog so thick you couldn't see across the street, darn it. A few hours later the fog lifted but I still could not see the ship. So I get dressed and head down stairs to get coffee at the restaurant (mini pot in room too) and stop by the front desk and ask the same not so helpful clerk, \"I though you could see the ship from here?\" At that point she looked at me patetically and said, \"no that's the Holiday Inn by the Bay\". Duh, what a dope I am. I head back to the room to tell my husband and kids and I messed up, but at least we got a goods night's sleep, not hearing trains all night! They all forgave me and the kids (both teenagers) were excited the we were all going to order room service for breakfast. The food arrived hot, portions were very large and it was one of the best value room service meals I have had. The room service menu is quite good, although the restaurant itself is nice but small. I looked at their menu and they have something for everyone. Anyway, we left the car there at $5.00 a day vs. the $9.00 we would have paid in the other lot. We were shuttled to the ship the next morning and told what to do when we returned. After we arrived back to the port and were off the ship by 9:30, we opted to taxi back to the hotel. The fee with tip was only $20.00, we were back at the car (still in great shape) and on the road home by 10:05am. Even though I made the reservation at the wrong hotel it turned out to be a pretty good choice, even with the not so helpful clerk. The room was nice and comfortable and the parking was easy and very inexpensive. I would think twice about driving down again but if we did, we would certainly consider staying here again.

When the complimenatry hotel's van picked me up at San Diego International airport, about 3 miles away, my skepticism kicked-in because this particular property is an older design, circa 1950's. But, this mangement company has maintained this beautiful property and it was a trip down nostagia-way with a few updated, modern conveniences such as: Complimenatry WiFi, USA Today newspaper, Free Lunch, Dinner and Drink coupons everyday of my stay. Note: I did not have to spend any additional monies for food or beverage my entire stay. My room was located on the second floor overlooking the pool. The pool area was beautiful. Full of flowers, palm trees, grass so soft you wanted to walk bare foot! In fact, all the flowers, plants and trees, property wide (not just the pool area) had signage on them educating you on all the foilage. It was a great touch because as my wife was admiring a plant you never see back-home, the first question she had was: \"What is the name of the plant?\" The pool area, pool and hot-tub were professionally maintained; clean, towels in a self-serve cabana, waterfalls, flowers and most important, the hot-tub actually worked (water-jets) and it was HOT! As I entered my room, I was very impressed with the accommodations. Two queen-size beds with the most comfortable mattress and pillows I have ever slept on in years. In fact, I bought 4-pillows (only $10 each;couldn't believe the price!) from the hotel and they are shipping them to me at no charge. Plenty of big, soft towels, 46\" flat screen HD-TV with complimentary HBO, refrigerator, Free WiFi, and the biggest standard hotel room I've stayed in years. This hotel is conveient to everything. Harbor Island is only 3 miles(great restaurants here), and downtown San Diego is about 6 miles. In fact, the hotel's van took us there at no charge and saved us money on a cab fare! My business meeting was held in the Catering Department of the hotel. The Catering staff did a great job in taking care of our group. From a clean meeting room, to A/V equipment that was set-up and worked without a hitch, to fresh, hot coffee and cookies. I (we) really appreciated the Catering staff. The restaurant was not large, but it was fast, efficient and I was impressed on how many \"locals\" used this dining facility...when \"locals\" visit on a regular basis, you know that it's great...and it was! Great breakfast, large portions and a staff that was very friendly and helpful. The entire staff seemed to come from the same mold, everyone was helpful, friendly and always went out-of-the-way to assit you. Lola, the overnight desk clerk was as good as it gets. By the way, the property also has a wonderful bar that opens up into the pool area. They had live music and the complimentary drink coupons were very helpful although we did spend money on snacks! The Gift Shop had everything we needed and more. So, if you forgot something, chances are they have it! Wow, we really enjoyed our stay and appreciated the trip down memory lane. This Holiday Inn reminded me of a 1957 Chevy that had been restored and when we saw the green-colored spot-lights that illuminated the hotel's property, it stuck a deep memory of what Holiday Inn's looked in the 50's and 60's. The only negatives were two items: 1) If you stayed on the traditional two-story building as we did, there isn't an elevator for handicapped or if you had many pieces of luggage, as we did, it was a little work getting up-the-stairs. 2) The rooms did not have microwaves; we like microwaves to heat up leftovers and we love our popcorn! But, if I get to San Diego again, I will stay at this wonderfully maintained, customer friendly and \"modern\" hotel.

Go out the door, across the way, through the parking lot, out the door, up the lift.. blah blah WHAT?! It\u2019s 9:00 p.m. We are hungry and tired. Whilst trying to find our room, we ended up in the catering area and managed to nearly crash a wedding. To get to our room, you had to walk through the abandoned meeting room corridor, which is just a bit freaky. I think our room was quite possibly the farthest away it could have been. The room itself was simply and basic. The bathroom could use a re-model; it looks like it came out of my grandma\u2019s house. Nevermind. We dropped our stuff off, only to need to make our way back through the maze to the restaurant located up front (separate review on restaurant). I will say, the bed was nice and comfy, so that was a plus. At least I got a good night\u2019s sleep. We were so far away from anything in the hotel that it was dead quiet and didn\u2019t even hear the wedding that was partying into the night. We booked the hotel primarily because of its free airport shuttle. What kind of hotel is this where I can\u2019t even call to let them know that I\u2019ll be needing the shuttle soon? I tried to ring up downstairs to let them know we\u2019d need the shuttle in about 15 minutes (the time it would take us to turn off the lights and trek to the front desk.) I was told we would just need to turn up and wait. Thank goodness it was so bloody early (5:30 a.m.) that there 1) wouldn\u2019t be any traffic on the road and 2) we were starting our day early enough. We ended up having to wait about 20 bloody minutes for the shuttle, which was annoying. I probably could have speedwalked to the airport in that amount of time, if I wasn\u2019t so darn tired from my trekking around the hotel, to and fro, the night before. Only stay here 1) if you don\u2019t care what your room is like 2) you don\u2019t mind a bit of a fitness work out trying to find your room and 3) your need to be near the airport", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cKids loved the view\u201d", "Author": "B T", "ReviewID": "UR117448967", "Content": "We found this through a travel site for a great price.

We called from the Tourist Information stand at the airport, and the hotel\u2019s shuttle arrived within 15 minutes. We got a king room on the 3rd floor on the second building.

We didn't realize there was a fridge until the morning we were leaving, otherwise I would have brought some water to keep chilled. The room comes with a coffee maker, sub-standard coffee, hair dryer and an iron & ironing board in the small closet. There wasn't anything spectacular about the room, but nothing terrible either. I only have two minor complaints. 1: the air vent was constantly rattling and I couldn't sleep the first night. I didn't even have the fan or air on so I don't know what that was about. 2: the TV never had a clear picture regardless of the channel. My colleague's TV was fuzzy also (like reception with the old rabbit ears), so it must have just been the way the whole hotel gets their TV.

I was checking in at the front desk and was told I'd been allocated a non-smoking room as my preference hadn't been passed on by my travel agent at which point I thought karma was biting back. The man on the desk was extremely helpful and switched me to a smoking room with no trouble at all and when I explained that my suitcase would possibly be delivered to the hotel that night again there was no problem and he said they would call if this happened. I got to my room which was good sized, very clean, and the bed was heavenly, fantastic memory foam mattress and they do indeed give you a range of pillows to choose from - for the sleep deprived this was a gift from the gods. Fell into such a deep sleep that when I woke in the morning I realised I had missed a call - woohoo my suitcase was here. Went to the front desk to collect the case and to put my passport and what not in the safe, couldn't have asked for more friendly and helpful assistance. The Point Loma Cafe was my next stop for breakfast - All the people there are fantastic, everyone is quick with a smile and extremely efficient. The French Toast is to die for and ended up being my only brekkie choice, portions are large and things are extremely well priced. Used it a couple of times for dinner both for sitting in and room service - for a picky eater like me this is indeed high praise. A huge thank you to everyone in the Point Loma Cafe for their contribution to my fantastic mornings. I used the free internet access regularly and didn't experience any problems accessing or lagging when I was online and I was using it from my room, the cafe, car park, etc. There were several sections of the car park, all of which were spacious and well lit so although female and travelling alone I wasn't wary of parking and walking to my room, I even got a call one night from security to let me know I had left on my interior light, I can only imagine my face if they hadn't contacted me and I had a flat battery the next morning. I booked this hotel due to its proximity to the Zoo and Sea World and I wasn't disappointed, it took less than ten minutes to drive to either from the hotel. I was delighted that I could opt into the good housekeeping scheme and leave a card on the bed to say that I didn't need my bedding or towels changed every night, this is a great scheme but I was happy that it was optional and there was no pressure to participate. If you are staying here and have the chance I would also recommend Seaport Village which is just along the beautiful harbor drive, less than a ten minute drive, and the Seal Tour on their Amphibious Bus is great fun. Would I go back here? In a heartbeat. I think people sometimes underestimate the value of fantastic staff and here I didn't meet anyone who wouldn't merit the full 5 stars.

If you are taking a cruise out of San Diego, you'll be able to basically walk out of your hotel room and on to the ship. I think this is where this hotel gets a lot of its business. Moreover, the hotel is within walking distance to some great things to do. The Midway aircraft carrier, Seaport Village, the old sailing ships, not too far from the Gaslamp Quarter. And, you're only a few miles from Old Town. Now for the bad. I'm no snob, but this hotel needs some serious updating. We rec'd a room on the second floor, right next to the elevator and ice machine. Needless to say, some in our family didn't get a very good night's sleep. There was a bunch of young kids across the hall partying it up into the wee hours, yelling and carrying on. Did the hotel staff just not care? The two beds in our room were small. I thought it would be two queens but it was more like two fulls or doubles. The room itself was very small. I also have little doubt that we rec'd such a poor location due to the fact that we booked on priceline. I've heard that this is common. Finally, be prepared to pay $22 to park your car.

Food was pretty good; as part of Holiday Inn's \"Rewards\"-type program, I received a $20 off breakfast (per day) coupon, which came in very handy! Pizza Nova across the street was tasty; try their lunch special (pizza or pasta and a salad). Otherwise, can be abit pricey, but beautiful view of the marina. Further up a block, is Point Loma Seafood. The most beautiful fresh fish I have ever seen! They have a 'sushi bar' which will make some selections for you to enjoy on the patio, plus they have seafood to order to takeout. Nothing fancy, but it was packed at lunch! They have fish, clams, shrimp, crab, calamari, etc., of which you can have in a sandwich, on a platter, in a salad, or in a taco, with sides of fried, onion rings, cole slaw, etc. Had the Boston chowder in a breadbowl for lunch, then walked back for a calamari plate dinner. Fresh, tender calamari strips were delicious! And, for less than $9.00, a great deal! Had I known this was so close, I would have come the previous day and tried more on the menu. They also have smoked fish that you can have on a sandwich or buy to take with you. We heard the line is out the parking lot at lunchtime and I believe it! Well worth the trip tho, IMO. Propertywise, the Bayside is finishing up some upgrades; i didn't see/use the pool or putting green. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Pluses? Free shuttle to airport, $20 off breakfast (Rewards club perk), great staff. Minuses? Pricey coffee shop on premises, rooms abit small. Would I return? Yes, but I would checkout their sister property nearby at Humphrey's.", "Date": "March 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, B.C.", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed the Bayside\u201d", "Author": "JoyousTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR6553559", "Content": "We spent 7 nights at the Bayside during the final week of December. Our hotel was perfect for our needs, and is only a few minutes from the airport. We were on the 5th floor, with a view of the Bay, and it was quite quiet. The mattress was very comfortable. We appreciated the many extras e.g. free parking, weekday newspapers, free safety deposit box for our passports, weight/health room, small fridge to store our snacks for breakfast, nine hole putting etc. The staff were very helpful and polite on all matters. When we booked for various tours, the cost was always a few dollars less with extras e.g. Sea World we paid a few dollars less than the cost of 1 day and received a 2 day pass. At $52 a person U.S. that means something. The front desk also provides a double-sided page listing clear directions for driving to 23 points of interest to the tourist. The connecting restaurant, Point Loma Cafe, while looking average, had outstanding food and service, and at very reasonable cost. The excellent trolley bus tour of San Diego had a pick up outside of our hotel. We will definitely be returning. By the way, we chose this hotel after reading many reviews for several hotels on Trip Advisor.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Holiday at the Holiday Inn\u201d", "Author": "KGB_4", "ReviewID": "UR6093165", "Content": "My partner and I drove from LA to San Diego without a booking or map and found the Holiday Inn Bayside quite by accident. What a find! Super friendly and helpful staff. Lovely restaurant and bar. Spacious clean room. All the facilites we needed. Our rooms were made up every day and restocked with coffee etc. We didn't have a view of the water but had a balcony to sit out on overlooking the pool that was very relaxing. Point Loma / Bayside is the perfect location to base yourself in San Diego. 5 minute drive to all the sites and the hotel had easy to follow driving directions to them. And free parking. There's a great pizza restaurant across the road (Nova) and the next block along has shops and a full compliment of junk food take-a-way places if you're into that sort of thing. The best part was the price considering we didn't book or members of any clubs etc, and because we liked it so much we stayed an extra 2 nights. The staff were very accomodating and very helpful. We wish we could have stayed even longer! And a tip if you intend to go to TJ - park on the US side and walk. It's 10 mins and you avoid all the queues and traffic.", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire, England", "Title": "\u201cNot bad at all\u201d", "Author": "LeePee24", "ReviewID": "UR6017492", "Content": "Hotel is in a good location and depending what side your room is on the views can either be great are quite boring.
