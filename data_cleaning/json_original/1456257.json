The hotel gave us an upgrade to an ocean-view room, which was lovely. The room, while not a suite, was very spacious. The huge metal tub was a treat, the bed was very comfortable, and the rain-style shower head was nice. The rooms are situated in villas, with about eight rooms to a villa, so we never had a lot of people coming and going near our room. It gave more privacy, which was nice. The resort has one main restaurant, a small cafe, and a poolside menu. We ate several items from the poolside menu, all of which were good. As with any high-end resort, there is a bit of sticker shock at first ($12 for mojitos and other \"fancy\" drinks). We fell in love with the passionfruit mojitos! We ate breakfast every day at the main restaurant, Mix on the Beach. The breakfast food was excellent, as was the fresh French press coffee. We also enjoyed several services at the Away Spa, which is small but very nicely done. The \"cafe con coco\" body scrub and massage in the beach-view room was the highlight of our stay. A few other positives: the W lounge at the local airport was a nice respite after several hours of travel; the onsite Avis car rental and Blackbeard's Sport shop were a huge convenience; the \"iguana tanning deck\" gave a fascinating view of some local wildlife; the concierge was a huge help in setting up tours and making reservations. Only a couple of \"cons\": the late night room service choices are disappointing - you're better off getting snacks somewhere else; also housekeeping didn't pick up our room service trays until we asked. The \"sunset sip\" isn't really worth doing unless you happen to be near the lobby anyway. Keep in mind, too, that everything here runs on \"island time\" and is more laid back than many urban W hotels.

Sorry Hotel Park City but you have been bumped to #2. I am a man who has high expectations when on holiday because rest & relaxation is my primary goal. This W and the staff but most impressively THE MANAGEMENT created an atmosphere so special and service oriented that I didn't even want to leave the grounds even for an hour. Truth be told, I left twice to eat with the Bride & Groom and could not wait to return to simply enjoy the stunning oasis. The Staff- From the moment we entered the lobby, we were greeted with friendly smiles and a very attractive staff that clearly had marching orders to make sure we have a wonderful stay from beginning to end. The front desk staff, the embassadors, the restaurant staff and the poolside and bar cocktail staff made us feel like VIP from morning to midnight. I admit that I am high-maintance and a bit of a diva (so I'm told by friends) so to have a staff that knows the true value of customer service is paramount for me to rate a vacation spot as AWESOME. The Management- Above all, I was most impressed by the attitude and hands-on approach of the management team of The W at Vieques. I travel enough to know the limitations that high-end resort must experience with such a vast operation in this remote spot but I saw no signs of such handi-cap. I attribute that to the management team and their pride in their position. I'm horrible with names but Greg?? (manager of dinning room) greeted us every morning and evening with a smile and repeatedly ask if we were enjoying our stay or if we needed anything he made many suggestion of things to do on and off site. This guy was delightful to chat with every day and truly impacted the enjoyment of our stay. As much as I would like to think that we were a special guest, I witness Greg doing this to each and every table in the dinning hall and on the patios. He led by example as did the manager of the Bar (silver hair guy) and most notable, Alexandro who gave new meaning to leadership. I had know idea that he was an owner or the owner and yet he was one of the highlights of my stay. He came across as just another guest who had stayed at the resort many times and wanted to make sure the wedding party and I enjoyed every aspect of our stay. It was not until Alexandro had left four days later that I was told what his role was at the W. I wished I could have thanked him in person for creating such an awesome retreat where the service matches the beautiful landscaping and stunning interior decor. The Resort- Wow, the decor is absolutely fabulous and striking from the front gate to the ocean view. I own a real estate firm and I do design and renovations in DC so I love seeing unique and modern use of old or vintage materials. This location gets an A+++ on interior design. You just have to come see the lobby, the dinning area and the rooms with your own eyes because pictures will not do justice. The use of ropes, old wood boards, new wood beams, painted metal evented walls, unique lighting, layered see-through curtains and funky accent furniture and colors all worked well together to create the ultimate pleasure place and retreat. The design of the endless pools and the fire pit created the perfect excuse to just lay back and drink and drink and drink some more in between meals and sun-bathing. Oh yeah..you will not want to leave this resort for most any reason.

I am a frequent traveler and have a good point of reference for what to expect in travel. This hotel is not up to the standards of a W. Hotel is tired in some areas. Tennis courts are quite run down. Trash removal from grounds is an issue. Rooms were nice but there were issues. The sun shade on our porch had a massive hole in it (looked like a bowling ball may have come down from the upper unit.) Food was excellent. Staff at Mix is strong. Pool is okay. Remember, this is a W so bringing the kids is at your own risk. We left ours at home and were glad we did. Unless you are a strong swimmer, best to respect the Atlantic and not swim at either hotel beach. Spa was fine. Attention to detail around trash pickup an issue. Our jacuzzi area was littered with votive candles (used) from what appeared to be previous uses. As I stood at the edge of the manicured lawn, I happened to look down onto the sloped grounds and could clearly see what looked like the contents of a trash can. Ashtrays on the property were not cleaned out. The big issue that we ran into was hotel service. We called ahead and reserved dinner, spa, a certain room location, pillow type and Jeep rental. We double-checked all of it and then showed up. Room was wrong but we chalked that up to a busy hotel, no big deal. We could make-do. The pillows were not swapped out and then we started wondering. We learned mid-way into our stay that they changed our Jeep rental (without telling us) and because we did not take the Jeep on the day they changed it to, lost our rental altogether. Seemed odd but when we tried to work with the hotel they treated us pretty poorly. It was comically-sad how poorly. I even made at least three calls to the Luxury Collection reservations and they contacted the hotel on my part...all to no avail. We are talking horrible gaps in communication and severe lack of ownership at local level. I wanted to chalk it up to local-attitude but the people were transplants from other Ws or Starwood properties. I took our issue(s) to management just to offer them a chance to take some ownership but their response was not what you might expect. Before we went to the hotel, I checked this site for feedback and took the initiative to email the hotel and ask specifically about some of the issues. The reply was well-written and explained that they had worked out all the bugs. When I sent them our feedback, as a courtesy, they went in to \"deflection\" mode. Didn't even address some of the issues. For what it is worth, I asked to speak to the General Manager twice and each representative I asked took the info and then effectively blew my request off. My sense is that you have a nice property, clearly best on the island as far as major flags go. But, the operation is poorly executed. In case you are wondering if I am just a crank, truth be told, I wondered as well but as I reflected on this here is what I concluded. I shared my feedback with the hotel as a courtesy and was rebuffed. I let a week go by (as in to sleep on it) and decided it was still bothering me. You come to your own conclusion. I was happy to pay the Ritz-Carlton prices, but expected value for the premium.

The beaches at the hotel are ok not the best but still very nice. the pools are also amazing and I dont consider myself a pool person. Great atmosphere too! I cannot say enough about the staff at the resort!!! They were professional, friendly and catered to our every request (we had quite a few) even when we requested a room change after the first night due to the frogs (coqui) outside the room only to realize a few days later that the entire island is filled with these frogs and there is no escaping their \"nightly song\". So we were extremely impressed with their customer service. Way to go W!!!!! The food at the resort was a bit overpriced but this was expected so it wasnt a big deal for us, the cafe had pretty good breakfasts but somewhat expensive $6 for a yogurt and $4 for a small plain coffee. The poolside lunch was probably the best food I had at the resort & the most reasonably priced for the quality and quantity. Dinner at the Alan Ducasse inspired restaurant was disappointing...the food wasnt bad...it just wasnt good, it was mediocre...sorry. I really wanted to like it! we were a party of 4 so we got to taste many of the main dishes and appetizers & nothing stood out. To be honest we tried quite a few restaurants all over the island and they were all kinda of the same we were not impressed at all with the food in Vieques. The ONLY exception was Next Course which I can whole heartely recommend, the food was AMAZING!!!

It's a beautiful property and they did a lovely job with the landscaping and the pool area. I like the decor of the rooms, the soaking tubs, and I thought the beds were incredible comfortable. There were some wonderful people at the front desk, and we loved Angel behind the bar but this property should be ranked the number one hotel on the island. These are the two areas that I feel are truly hurting this resort. I will start with the food. Our first meal was by the pool; we had just gotten off the plane and were starving. After looking over the menu, we were shocked not to see ANY local flair on the menu at all. I don't travel to unique and interesting cultures so that I can order a burger and fries. While I understand that you have to have those types of food on the menu, the fact that that's all there is to order was quite disappointing. We then gave MIX a try, and were equally disappointed. Over cooked meats, disappointing wine list, and servers that don't seem to know the preparation or the ingredients in the food they are serving. It was our last meal we had at the resort, as it certainly did not live up to the standards of an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alain Ducasse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant. Fortunately, we rented a car, which you MUST do to explore this beautiful island, and met some local people who finally steered us in the right direction for food. I wouldn't waste your time eating at the resort, besides the absurdly priced food, it's just plain bad. Check out La Vieuense for breakfast or lunch, Bev's lunch menu at Coconuts, and for some delicious authentic local food, check out Bili's, Conuco, and El Patio Restaurant & Bieke's Bistro. Next Course was a lovely spot and we had a decent meal there and the ambiance was pleasant. Duffy's has a great beer selection but to be honest, I would avoid eating anything that's not fried. Ok so back to the W. I found the service overall was just not up to par especially for their motto. You would ask for something and the server would not return or return much later completely forgetting what you had asked for. The resort fee is absolutely absurd. JUST RAISE your room rates. This place just nickel and dimes you for everything. One of the worst offenses of this I saw was during their Sunset SIP. Where they give you a \"free\" half glass cocktail. This lasts from 6-630. I saw guests wander up to the bar and request their free drink at 632 and they were refused. Pissed, they canceled their reservations at MIX and didn't eat or drink at the resort the rest of their stay. After witnessing that, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return for Sunset Sip either, because we were pretty appalled. That was a prefect example of a situation where the refusal of a free punch cocktail lost them hundreds of dollars worth of business, and sadly, they weren't the only people we met at the resort who felt this way. As I read the trip advisor reviews, over and over, complaints about service and food keep surfacing and it astounds me they do nothing to change this. I have seen the W retreat drop from number 2 on Trip Advisor to number 4 since we decided to book our trip there. They really need to take a step back and reevaluate their business model and practices. To me, they could learn a lot from Francis Ford Coppola resorts, he has nailed down the service and the food part to a T. I would like to say I would come back and stay here again, but the nickel and diming and confused unprofessional service would push me to check out renting a house or another resort, especially since we didn't spend any time at the resort except for our first and last day, when we didn't have choice because we didn't have a car.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Brunswick, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWent here for a drink... wish I stayed here.\u201d", "Author": "sailaway22", "ReviewID": "UR127032597", "Content": "Was residing at a friends house while on the island.

During the course of our stay, we also had snacks and drinks by the pool, dinner at the hotel's restaurant and dinner at room service. Our only complaint about any of these meals was the time it took to actually get the food from when we ordered. The W is located on the north coast of the island, so it's exposed to the colder (and wavier) Atlantic Ocean rather than the Carribean. To access those beaches, you will need a jeep to make the 10 mile drive.

This was one of the best trips that we have taken (and we travel frequently), and we will definitely return. The W Retreat was recommended by a friend of ours, Jim Parker, of Caribbean Flying Adventures. Jim has a consulting company for owner/operators of private aircraft, and suggested the W as the top choice in the Caribbean. I wanted this to be a perfect long weekend getaway to celebrate my wife's birthday, and it was that and much more. The W has a reception area at the Vieques airport, which is a really nice touch, and a very comfortable setting while waiting for the hotel shuttle. When we arrived, we were greeted with big smiles, a warm welcome and two glasses of champagne. The bell staff did a great job, and within minutes, we were in our ocean front suite. 1400+ SF gave us room to stretch out. With the sliding glass doors open, we could relax and listen to the sound of the ocean. We really like the chic style of W Hotels, and the resort was a great example of this. We ate dinner at the hotel and really liked the menu. The maitre 'd Cindy and Tim were on top of the wine list, and pulled a few special reserve bottles from the back (we are very much into European wines.) Our waiter, Nenad, was spot on. When we returned to our room, the staff had delivered a birthday cake for my wife. Great touch! The next morning, the manager of the hotel, Greg White, touched based with us, to make sure that my wife enjoyed her birthday. He also arranged for a courtesy amenity at the spa for her. We took in some of the local food and culture in Esperanza, and went horseback riding one morning, and also did the bioluminescent bay. I would highly recommend both. The rest of the time we spent at the hotel and enjoyed every minute. This was one of the few vacations where I really wasn't ready to go home. We have traveled extensively in North America, Central America, South America, Europe and the Caribbean, and I have to say, the W Retreat in Vieques is right at the top of our list.

Being the 3rd time at the hotel, we were able to make comparisons. If we had not been to the resort before, I do not think there would be many negatives about the hotel. I very much recommend this resort to a couple looking for some relaxation in a destination that is still not commercialized what so ever like other carribean islands. The island is pretty incredible itself, with its natural beauty. The private beautiful beaches are reason enough to get to Vieques and we recommend renting a car for at least 1 day to experience them. Secret beach is one of our favorites. Overall, the treatment by the W was really wonderful as we have made relationships there with the staff and were treated very well. We were upgraded to the restreat side of the island which we prefer. You can hear the ocean from the room which makes it so serene. Management is very attentive- Christian, Jimmy are both very welcoming, personable and helpful and we were able to spend some time with them getting to know them. We did have a bad experience with a woman behind the front desk. Not sure of her name but she has very curly short hair, possibly Rosalita? She basically made us go into a publico(taxi) when the W car was taking a couple to the same restaurant as we were going to. At first she said we would be able to get the ride and then she denied us. It was very very poor customer service! I really wish I got her name as I think it was an extremely terrible way to treat guests in a business completely based on customer service and think that she should be noted for this! We had a private 5 course dinner on Paradise Edge which we HIGHLY recommend. Part of the reason we enjoyed our dinner so much was our waiter, Joel who was so knowledgeable and servicing. He taught us a whole bunch about the island and culture which is always something important for us when traveling.He also was very knowledgeable in the food and wine. Request Joel if you can! Also was so excited to see Eugenik as she was one of the few employees we recognized from when we were at the resort for our wedding. It was so nice to see her as always. She is a great bartender and we enjoyed spending time with her every night at the living room bar. Amaryllis was a great waitress as well, very hard working and provided great service, always a smile on her face. There were several cons but not enough to not visit this incredible hotel-- The service at the pool could be better. And we were very upset not to see the purple towels! The airport lounge had no snacks either which was a disappointment since we were looking forward to that after 2 flights. The concierge could be more helpful. The little things were lacking a bit however not enough to not come back. We will be returning to get our dose of relaxation in this beautifully designed hotel that has wonderful food. And ofcourse to see the horses run wild!", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAwesome trip!!!\u201d", "Author": "Edward H", "ReviewID": "UR126523629", "Content": "Me and my wife wife spent four wonderful days at the W in Vieques and had a great time. Since our trip was primarily for R&R thats pretty much what we did. First of all the weather was beautiful seeing we left Detroit at around 40 degrees (end of January) and windy and entered paradise at 80 degrees and sunny! Even though the weather forecast predicted rain everyday it only rained once and only for about 10 minutes. There were two beaches on the property, one was the public beach which was relatively quiet. The other is called Whisper beach which I hear is a nude beach and we didn't bother to check! There was a bar located pretty much right on the beach next to the swimming pools and there were also bbq grills on the beach as well. We stayed in a poolside first floor room and it was very clean and the room service was great (we were worried as we read some of the previous reviews). The only thing that wasnt so pleasant was the overall cost of the resort. It is expensive and we were able to absorb some of the cost as my mother works for a starwood hotel so we were able to stay as starhot members. There is a restaurant on the property but it was also very expensive. There is a cafe' that is less pricey and they serve breakfast and lunch sandwiches. So I would suggest renting a car and having dinner in town, or have the hotel call you a cab after you make a reservation. The cab driver we had was very helpful and took us in town to shop a little bit. All in all had an awesome time! The staff was awesome, the resort was beautiful and we barely left the beach for four days!

The room was immaculate, they did everything to accomodate us, and we were impressed by their willingness to make our stay enjoyable. We prefer smaller hotels, and do not want to be \"herded\" around through meals and activities. This certainly feels that way. My suggestions: rent a jeep during your stay so you can easily get to the beaches (Avis is on site). Pack books...most reading material is in spainish on the island. Do the bio-luminescent bay tour.

Honestly the beaches of Vieques are a great attraction, but this hotel is a destination in itself and you can spend an entire trip, just relaxing and enjoying this chic ocean side retreat. We stayed in one of the pool side rooms, which were wonderful - steps to the pool and ocean, felt as if we had our own beach bungalow. Other reviews mention the service and though it wasnt amazing, it was perfectly fine - keep in mind this is a W, not a Four Seasons -- you need to temper your expectations. Two situations really speak to the inconsistent service at the hotel. The good. While we were eating lunch, workers were power washing nearby, I asked a manager how much longer the process would take and he immediately stopped the work until we were finished. I didn't even have to complain or ask, he just knew what to do. The bad. After kayaking the bio bay, I got a pretty bad splinter lodged in my foot and hobbled back into the hotel lobby. I asked the front desk for a tweezerand was told that they didn't have a medical kit but I could PURCHASE one in the \"ouch kit\" - 12 dollars, in my room. Thought it was awful that a hotel wasn't prepared for any level of medical situation (from a simple splinter to, God forbid, something worse) and furthermore, they attempted to profit from an injury. Luckily a kind guest overheard and let me borrow her tweezer. Tacky.

The beach is nothing special by Vieques standards (all of the beaches in the wildlife reserve are superior), but still not too shabby as beaches go generally. Now for the bad part: service at this hotel is simply unacceptable for a hotel in this price range. At the restaurant, orders often had to placed multiple times. Sometimes drinks simply never arrived. We had a mechanical issue with the room, and had to call 3 times over the course of a day to get it addressed. Each time, there seemed to be no record of the prior request. Bath amenities like shampoo were not replaced when empty, so we had to call and request them specifically. Finally, I had booked a rate that included a free night. This was noted by reception when I checked in. But when I checked out, I was charged for each night. Fortunately, I took a close look at my bill and spotted the error. They did fix my bill without protest, but it would have been very easy for me to miss.

Davo is the quintessential mixologist 's mixologist.

Both times the service was inconsistent but I would still go back. I think it is a combination of \"island time\" and not enough strong support staff, but I CAN say that on my second trip I saw improvements happening in all areas. The Front Desk is friendly but slow and the phones often ring and roll, but beach and pool are great, the food is good and you get the feeling that the people care and are trying - that makes a big difference when you get spotty service.The fact that Vieques is so unique makes it worth it. The entire place, including the rooms, has a funky, cool industrial feel. I personally would love to see an area rug in the rooms b/c I like my hotel rooms to have a bit warmer, brighter feel, but I kept my curtains open during the day to let the sun shine through. The lighting in the rooms took me a day to figure out since there are tons of light fixtures with various on/off switches all around the room. I suppose the solution, outside of some overhead lighting, would be to pull the room key out of the master power slot by the door before going to bed, but I need to charge my phone and laptop at night. I figured it out eventually. The resort now houses an AVIS jeep rental which enriches the experience tenfold because taxis there aren't entirely reliable and exploring the island is a blast.There are so many great beaches throughout the very undeveloped island and horses roam freely in the streets. There isn't a single stoplight anywhere. Esperanza is one of two towns. It is teeny tiny but there are actually a few good places to eat and drink. I had a great meal in town at El Quenepo Restaurant. I love the fact that the hotel has a little snack shop where you can get coffee, breakfast sandwiches, pastries, gifts, drinks, wine, liquor, etc. All of the W Hotels I've been to have very cool gift shops and here is no exception. The gym is better than average, the spa is great and there is a watersports shop where you can get free snorkels sets for the beach. They offer free kayaks and they have bikes to take out and ride around the island, but I am not sure if there is a charge for the bikes. I also recommend leaving more time than you would normally to get bags picked up from your room and for checkout at the desk.Lastly, I suspect most people coming here have heard of the Bio Bay. It sold me on Vieques and it did not disappoint. It haven't confirmed this, but it is supposed to be one of only 7 bio bays in the world and one of the best & brightest. I loved it and the hotel can arrange for you. One last tidbit is that the Cape Air flights from SJU are a quick 15-20 min but the planes are tiny. It is what it is, I guess, and the views are pretty great descending into VQS. The flight back to the states is a bit of a pain since even if you interline your bags through to your home airport, you have to pick them up after landing in SJU and bring them through the USDA agriculture scanner before checking in - with EVERY single other person leaving SJU going to the USA, ugh.

It was early during my current visit so it provided a great opportunity to catch up with old friends and meet new. Here too, the service and the food were both above average. The wine tasting attracted even more people and was equally fun!! I have been to many wine tastings and found this one to be much more free form and fun! The island atmosphere of the \"Great Room\" really lends itself to this type of event, making it nearly impossible to not have a GREAT time. The music was great, the food as well. Greg, the new GM and his team are working hard to earn the W a spot as a \"go to\" place for short and long term visitors to Vieques and I commend them! I am looking forward to my third event of the season, The Vieques Pops on March 3rd. I am sure it will be as well managed as the first two!!!", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cso great\u201d", "Author": "Layla777", "ReviewID": "UR125297949", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights with our two kids.

We extended our stay from 5 to 7 nights total and stayed at the W the whole time. Whether you are happy with the W probably does depend on your expectations and how much time you spend at the resort. A Vieques vacation is about the beaches and you need to rent a car and explore it. We found our ocean view room which also overlooked the pool to be very well-appointed and certainly spacious enough. The grounds, pool areas, and beaches were nice. We found service to be good, certainly slow at times. Our main service issues had to do with housekeeping. They just seemed a bit oblivious to restocking things like shampoo and shower gel when its obvious you have used them up. We called one time and they handed us a huge bag of toiletries and we thus had enough for the rest of our stay. Food is expensive in the main restaurant, we had dinner there once and and breakfast once. We had many more meals utilizing the on-site more casual cafe where you could get good breakfast egg wraps and lunch sandwiches along with things like cereal, oatmeal, salads, etc. We would eat breakfast here, take lunch sandwiches to go and we were on our way to the beach. Keep in mind, to really enjoy your stay and not get frustrated with some of the W's issues, you need to rent a car. The crown jewel beaches are primarily all in the southeastern corner and include La Plata (Silver) Las Chivas (Blue) and smaller ones around and inbetween. I was surprised by the quality of the snorkeling and we saw a sea turtle or stingray on almost every snorkel and one time a spotted eagle ray did a loop around us. If the waters at the W beach look rough, realize that they may be calm and tranquil on the other side of the island, a short 20 min drive away. As for car rental, you need 4 wheel drive and that is pretty much all the car rental companies carry. We rented a jeep from one of the mom and pops in town, Maritzas, needless to say, the tires were crappy and we blew one out at the end of the day. They came to fix it fast but charged ~140 or so for a new tire. Sounds lame when they knew the tires were in less than good shape to begin with. Even the park ranger made a comment about our subpar tires. We returned it and switched to picking up a new Jeep with nice confidence inducing tires at the Avis onsite at the W. For an extra 20-25 day in comparison, we felt it was worth it. We were warned over and over about not leaving anything of value in the car and to actually leave car open and window down as theft has been a problem. At most parking areas, you cannot see your car from the beach. Its a bummer to have be so vigilant but this is something that is not unique to Vieques in comparison to other Caribbean islands. The only issue of likely theft that we did have is I left an old ipod nano in the W gym at the end of the day and my partner left his hat. They were nowhere to be found the next AM and no one turned them in. Its hard not suspect someone on staff. They took a report but it seemed like they were just going thru the motions. Its fine- it was nearing the end of its lifespan anyway. Gret dinners at Next Course and El Quenepo. We also did the bio bay with the clear bottom kayaks which was awesome!", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vieques", "Title": "\u201ctoo bad, missed a golden opportunity\u201d", "Author": "NancyVieques", "ReviewID": "UR125171983", "Content": "Last night promised to be a lovely evening. Left the house looking forward to sharing a night at the W on Vieques with friends, over some wine and appetizers. The event was called for 7 - wine and appetizers was what was advertised. Got there at 7:30 and found about 60 people, who were also there to share in this, what promised to be a lovely event. Paid my $15 and donned my plastic bracelet and proceeded to greet other guests and look for some food and beverages. The beverages were easy to spot. There was white wine and red wine, and out on the patio some sparkling wine. Much enjoyed. Then onto the food. Found a sushi bar with rolls of sushi being prepared. Thought that this was meant for the guests at the event, but was told that they were to be ordered from a waitress, for a separate charge. Looked around and saw one or two people who came out of the back area carrying trays - they were trays of cut up fruit and cheese, but one needed to act quickly because there was not much forth-coming. At one point, about 8:15 I went to the bar and asked about the promised appetizers and was told that they had nothing to do with that - were just serving wine. After a short while some appetizers did appear - 2 kinds - one with chicken and one with shrimp - nothing else to eat, no crackers not even napkins were made available. I mean cutting back on paper products is one thing - but cocktail napkins at an event where food is advertised. Then again, there really wasn't much food to speak of. Too bad - there were many people who I talked with that this was their first experience with the W on Vieques. And others whom I spoke with who had been there before and came with expectations that were in line with their prior experience - low. These were all local people who if treated properly could have returned many times over as well as being in a position to recommend the W to their guests and visitors to Vieques. I am very dissapointed in this experience, and if it had only been my own, then I might not have bothered to write this review, but it was the experience of many last night. Another facet to this is that alcohol was being served at a time when many had not had dinner. I heard many saying how irresponsible this event was to have so little food - not even crackers and cheese, while serviing alcohol. Again, I say too bad for your greediness.

First the positives - our room was spacious and nice (although a bit more eclectic than I would expect of the W). The lobby was also beautiful, and a nice place to lounge with a drink at night after dinner. Now the negatives - the food options were SO sparse. The lunch menu had very few items on it.. seriously, i'm talking like 6 items. When I go to a resort, I generally want to laze about the pool all day and have lunch there. By the second day I was already bored with the lunch menu. Another big food related problem - breakfast was only served until 11. Maybe not a problem for most, but due to my jetlag and generally being on vacation mode... I didnt want to wake up and rush to breakfast. The result: Even if you get to the restaurant at 11:15AM, breakfast no longer offered. For a hotel that talks a big game about Whatever, Whenever... the fact that I can't have an omlette when I want one is a bit ridiculous. I know all hotels have their rules, but if you make a huge deal about Whatever, Whenever, you should be able to back it up when someone requests something as simple as an egg and some toast. The little market cafe they have had breakfast sandwiches but they were greasy and the service there was very poor. I ordered a sandwich at the bar one day and asked for it without Mayonnaise and was told they couldnt do it.... awesome. So to sum it up, this experience totally put me off W Resorts. I know theyre trying to be chic and trendy by having one restaurant and limited food items... but the whole thing just didnt work. I wish I had gone to another island (with nicer beaches...

Last year we went to Culebra, and this year we tried Vieques. We stayed at the W on the recommendations of friends who had travelled in years prior, and in part because my girlfriend with whom I was adventuring is a regular Starwood hotels guest. I guess we expected Paradise, with a capital P, but we were both left wanting. I won't talk about the prop planes required to get to the island (although it IS less expensive to fly from Isla Grande airport in San Juan than the main terminal) or the W lounge at the island because they weren't the resort, per se. But you can read about that in other reviews. I will tell you that a nearly full day of travel is committed to reaching Vieques from most destinations and when we arrived, somewhat exhausted, the aesthetics of the W did not disappoint. Nor can I attest to many activities \"off\" resort except to mention the biobays, which are certainly worth a visit. We were there to focus on R&R during our short stay. The resort itself is beautifully landscaped and built into the low coastal elevations of the island in a completely complimentary and discreet fashion. It is not one high rise or main building, but rather the resort is composed of several smaller buildings which lazily horseshoe around the beach and pools. Golf carts will take you to and from your building - and do so on arrival - but it is an easy walk between villa and beach and main house. We were there for 3 nights - on arrival we were upgraded (I think?) from fabulous to spectacular room, or vice versa. I can't tell you what that meant, but our room in villa 8 had ocean views and opened up to the pools. It was a very spacious room, nicely outfitted with two beds (per our request), a shower and separate free standing tub. For the significant square footage, however, there was a decided lack of shelving and storage space. An armoir, yes, for hanging clothes, but no drawers and a tiny, tiny shelf next to the sink for toiletries. A big deal? No. A nuisance? Almost immediately. 2 girls, 2 sets of toiletries and clothes - you do the math. Our room was quiet - we didn't hear resort noise, other guests, etc when we were inside. There is a balcony with a thoughtful drying rack of sorts for wet bathing suits and towels, and the water pressure in the shower was outstanding. Otherwise, we weren't there much. Wifi is pretty and was easy to use in the room. Verizon has hideous service on the island (and in PR in general) but my friend's AT&T worked well. There was a very well equipped fitness center which we used daily, and it was connected to the spa, which we never ended up using. Here's why: the resort is SUPER expensive. Not unlike Vegas, it seems like simply breathing can cost you $$. So let's streamline this into a quick pro/con list to make it easier. Pros: *Resort is gorgeously landscaped and well laid out. Our villa was clean (small ant problem in my girlfriend's bed but I think that's the nature of island living, not W cleaning standards and it wasn't problematic, just surprising....) and spacious. *The pools are beautiful with ample lounge chairs even on busy days and options to lie out at the beach, either pool, or in the grasses around the pool. All with sweeping views. Towels are thick and there are plenty of them. *The concierge/front desk was always available and friendly - most staff was very accommodating. Kevin set us up with dinner reservations and biobay tours in advance - I appreciated that. *While there were some small children, I never felt that this had become a \"family\" destination and thus remained quiet and a perfect oasis in which to read and doze Cons/drawbacks/things to think about: *The W is EXPENSIVE. Friends of ours who live near San Juan came for a weekend once and were horrified. Morning coffee from the cafe next to the gym was $5.85. For regular coffee. Sangria is $45 for a pitcher...and pitchers go quickly when you're sitting by the pool each day. Our lunch/bar tab routinely ended up in the $100+ range...for ceviche or salad plus drinks. Yes - its fresh and pretty good, but its NOT great, and certainly was overpriced each and every time for what it was. We had some serious sticker shock. The W doesn't advertise their bar menu, served in what's called the Living Room, on the casual couches and lounge area between the indoor bar and the outdoor, more formal, dining area. Its available, though, in the main dining rooms. In other words, you can have a burger, or smaller plates, but they're not going to tell you that. We ate there one night and were underwhelmed. Bartender said, \"sit anywhere.\" Server came to the table we were sitting at (empty tables everywhere that evening) and told us that table was reserved. The particular one we were sitting at. So we moved, no problem, but the table remained empty for the length of our dinner. Odd, and he wasn't nice about it. He tried to upsell at every given moment, and when the table next to ours (different server) ordered a burger, and I asked about it (I really wanted a burger that night...) he tried to talk us out of the more casual menu. Big problem? No. But for a resort who's motto is whatever, whenever...come on, guys. Give me my whatever in the dining room instead of the living room, you know? Especially for the $20 I'm about to pay for it. Food, overall, was underwhelming. I guess you pay to eat it in paradise. *Service was lovely, but not impeccable, the server at dinner that night notwithstanding. We requested a late check out on departure day so we could return to the room to change post pool but before flight. They would not extend this courtesy to us, however, we were told - they would have to charge us for an additional day. So, no whenever there either. The golf cart that trucked our bags from main house up to our villa on arrival was conspicuously absent on check out...despite calling twice. We lugged our own bags down. Fine for a high rise in a nondescript city. Not fine for a luxury resort. So - there were kinks. Overall enjoyable, but certainly not 5 star, and definitely overpriced for all that it was, excepting the view. I'd recommend it, but only if you know what you're getting into. Honestly, I'd prefer to rent a home for a week, on island, as we did the prior year in Culebra, rent a car, and perhaps spend a day poolside at the W while taking better advantage of the island and all it has to offer.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "katia o", "ReviewID": "UR124094347", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights in November with our 5 year old daughter and my in laws.

The pool, outdoor area and fire pit are also gorgeous. We did get a room upgrade and we loved the room but it was far from the lobby and the main pool so next time I might ask for something closer. We did call for golf cart service at times and it was always fast and friendly. My in-laws were near our room but had a plunge pool right outside their villa. It was fantastic for evening swims as it was very warm, very private and beautifully lit from under the water. We had one dinner at the main restaurant. We thought it was OK but not exceptional. We also ate breakfast many times at the W cafe which was basic but decent value. I was happy with my smoothie and breakfast wrap. We rented a car at the dealership across the road. It was convenient and not too expensive. Driving in the day is fine but freaky at night as the roads are narrow and twisty and there are no street lights. The town of Isabella had a restaurant that was really a hole in the wall with an Argentinian chef. The food was great so we went a few times. Esperanza has some casual but good spots too. It is worth renting a car as the taxi shuttles charge per person! The beach was nice and there were lots of pool chairs, towels and water although it wasn't too busy when we were there. My daughter is used to being with grown ups and enjoyed the pool and the beach but there were very few other children and no amenities for children at all (no sand or pool toys, no marshmellows to roast at the fire etc.) If your kids are used to more child friendly resorts, they might be disappointed. We liked the music playing and the staff were very friendly. We did the bio bay excursion which was fantastic although the bus ride out to the bay was horrible! No one warned us that the roads were so bad and that we would be in an old school bus without any shocks! Anyways, it was still worth it. We also drove out to the other beaches. The red beach was lovely though there are no amenities at all so bring your own towels, water, etc. One final tip, we flew to the Island from the smaller airport near Old San Juan. The price of the flight from this airport was half ($60 one way instead of $120). I would recommend this if you are staying a few days in San Juan anyways (we were). If not, it still might be worth the 25 minute cab ride depending on how many people you are with", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "austin, texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "milbed", "ReviewID": "UR124039233", "Content": "We spent 5 nights from Jan 26, and we were a little nervous after reading some negative reviews.

Let me be one of the first people to tell you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is not a truly family friendly resort. While we were there we saw at the most three very well behaved children. At the same time, there was a Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Secret Fashion Shoot telling me these are the types of people that visit the W Vieques. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a place for spring breakers, groups of friends, families, unless you plan to spend lots of money. No wristband check for alcohol \u00e2\u20ac\u201c let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s put it that way. This is for people with swagger. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to leave.

Not too bad if you asked me. I would not want to be nickled and dimed on each of these, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem with it.

We did enjoy the hotel and I don't think we would consider staying anywhere else when we return. Staff was friendly and helpful, did not have any problems with service, but we were away from the hotel most of the time. Room was large and we had an ocean front room - which was fabulous. Housekeeping was consistent, and the room was always clean when we returned. On occasion we saw horses grazing and galloping through the property - but that is consistent with the rest of the island. When you check in, you should probably ask for 3 card-keys since the electricity in the room depends on a card being plugged into the wall - and there were many times I left the room and didn't want to turn the lights off for my wife when I ran errands, but her wallet was in the large safe with her key. BTW, the safe uses a 6 digit code - not the 4 digit code I've used at every other hotel I've ever stayed- and the safe instructions do not indicate a 6 digit code required - maintenance guy fiddled around for 15 minutes like he was fixing it - and then asked me to put in a 6 digit code - and hey - it worked. The Adult beach had a lot of mosquitos at dusk that drove us off - but the greens around the property are heavily sprayed, and mosquitos were not an issue there. The room fee did seem excessive - but at least we got free wireless internet, free parking, free towels and free coffee in the a.m. (until 10). We bought a couple of bottles of wine from the local grocery store and would drink those on the balcony or scenic grounds - but a $35 corkage fee if you want to bring it for dinner - the rooms have a wine opener. The W hotel pool was very nice, but the $500 fee to rent a cabana for the day seemed excessive, as did the $20 hamburger - but the pool was a nice place to spend a day reading - we only saw one child at the pool (well behaved) - so was relaxing. The LCD TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had HDMI and RCA connections that were accessible, and there was a DVD player connected. We took everything out of the refrigerator and stocked it with our sodas, wine and beer, and not a problem with being charged for simply moving stuff out. If you have Verizon Wireless (3G or 4G) do not expect any data service anywhere on the island - phone worked but no email or internet unless hooked up to wireless. My wife has ATT and her phone worked everywhere on the island. We had rented a jeep from Martiza's car rental - brand new jeep and no gotcha type issues with them - seemed like a professional operation and easy transportation back and forth to the W. The W lounge at the airport was a little overhyped. No beer or wine, just rum or tequila with a handful of mixers - but we were only there for 10 minutes before the shuttle took us to the hotel. We ate at all the top rated restaurants on the island, and Next Course was definitely my favorite - El Quintempo (sp?) we talked to the owner who was nice, and great view and location. I ordered a pork dish, and wasn't too impressed - I should have stuck with a seafood dish - which my wife fully enjoyed - ceviche at both restaurants were great. We did 2 different biobay tours - the first was the pontoon boat - it was nice, good history of the bay and story of the stars - would be good for grandparents and kids - but when they say the road is bumpy - that's an understatement. The brought water onto the boat you could play with, and let you stick a foot in the water. The next biobay tour we did was the clear canoe (I think Vieques Adventure or something like that) - that is the one you want to do if you're reasonably physically fit - much more interactive with the bay - looks like champagne as your kayak goes through the water. The road here was even bumpier than the pontoon boat road - times you thought the small van would topple over. The canoeing pace was quite fast. Fish jumped into a few boats - most of them harmless and the guide comes over and gets them out for you - not to scare anyone, but we had a toothed fish with a scary name jump in our boat - guide was a little shocked when he realized what he picked up (it's pitch dark until he puts on a flashlight)- and the first time one had jumped into a boat - but it was just a baby and no harm and was good for a story. We would definitely do this again. We took a snorkeling tour with Nan-Sea Charters. Rooster and Mark were our guides, and the other couple failed to show up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so we basically had a private tour. They provided great narration and stories of the island and what we were seeing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c definitely a professional operation with well experienced guides \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we felt completely safe. Since it was a windy day, we stayed close to some of the beaches for the protection since my wife is a fair-weather snorkeler \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we saw enough fish and corals to make it worth going on a boat, versus just swimming out from the beach with our gear.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cExceeded expectations - great expereince\u201d", "Author": "jamie5126", "ReviewID": "UR123180958", "Content": "My wife and I just spent four nights at the W in Vieques.

The pool is fantastic, the beach is private, the rooms are spacious and well-appointed, and the concierge desk is very helpful if you want to arrange activities or excursions. The only downside is that, even with our Starwood points, the trip ended up being very expensive. Aside from the resort fee (which I believe was around $60/day), the restaurants and drinks are pricey, and the \"Whatever Whenever\" service (while awesome) is very expensive. This didn't really bother us since it's a W hotel, and high prices are to be expected, but it's something to keep in mind.

There are semi-private seating areas throughout the hotel, which are wonderful if you're looking to snuggle with your significant other, but potentially awkward if you're by yourself or with a family that includes children or pre-teens. There is also music playing softly throughout the resort, which didn't bother us, but could be annoying to some. Also, unless you plan to spend your entire trip at the resort, I would highly recommend renting a car, and doing so in advance. We took several trips to the nearby beaches (also beautiful) and had a number of meals at local restaurants. All in all, aside from a few minor service glitches and a bit of sticker shock, we had a fantastic time and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxury beach vacation on a very special island.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our Christmas/New Years week trip\u201d", "Author": "sal2009", "ReviewID": "UR122537062", "Content": "I recently stayed at the hotel during the week between Christmas and New Years. Let me first say that I was nervous after reading several poor reviews of the hotel service below....but after my trip, I'd say I was quite pleased and would even return. 1) Airport lounge: Decent place to wait while you wait for shuttle. Shuttle took about 25 minutes to arrive so sat down and had a free cocktail and sandwhich. 2) Checkin: Unable to give us an upgrade despite having status with Starwood...but it was Christmas and they were friendnly. Did have to wait for someone to take me to my room (about 10 minutes...it was dark on the hotel grounds and I wouldn't have been able to find my way) 3) Room: Clean, typical W room. There is no dresser to put your clothes which bugged my partner a bit but not me....there are some shelves where i put mine. 4) Room bathroom: If you are not sleeping with the person sharing your room, you may be a little uncomfortable as it is an open shower and provides minimal to no privacy. Not an issue with me as we were a couple. Never used the bathtub although my bf did. 5) Pool: Nice...had to get up early to get chairs...not uncommon for these caribbean resorts and again it was very busy season....Don't stay at the pool...best part about vieques is the beaches! 6) Spa: Staff was nice. My massage therapist was not great but my facial person was wonderful. Nice spa grounds. No steam room/sauna. 7) Restaurant: Didn't love the dinner menu but was acceptable. Service was good. Breakfast was minimum required to call buffet...there were usual eggs, fruits, bacon, breads, etc. Omelette guy was there every day except one. 8) Bar/Living room area: Probably needed additional staffing...had to wait a bit long for food and drinks and had to flag down the waitress a few times. But when I complained about a wait for food too long there, they took off those charges without fighting too much which made me feel better. 8) Service: Obvious that the staff had been either retooled, had additional training or had more added. Service coach guy was there, helped us...clearly working hard. Never had to wait too long for service at the pool the day we were there. 9) Kids: Please don't bring your kids to this resort....there aren't tons of things for kids to do and I'd say this place is catering more to adults (I mean...look at the layout of the bathrooms alone, bars, etc). There were a few parents with their kids (and nannies...argh!) during this week and all they did was disrupt the adults trying to enjoy their vacation (think=kids splashing being annoying at pool; again, go to the beach...it's better). 10) Resort fee: High for what you get....not much...stuff that would be free anywhere else....don't like it. 11) Blackbeard activity place: You still have to pay for umbrellas and chairs at the Blackbeard Activity place if you want to take them to any beach other than the W beaches (you want to go to other beaches)....not included in your resort fee which i thought was ridiculous. And they didn't have them when i wanted them...had to go back a few times to get them. The woman working there was not very friendly and wasn't able to suggest any beaches for me (I mean, really?? not helpful). 12) Cars: YOU MUST RENT A CAR! 13) Gym: Pretty good...treadmills, gym equipment. So, overall, I'd say that this was a nice trip...the resort is beautiful and almost all of the people were trying to improve the service....I still only give the service 4/5 tho because when you are paying over $600/night for a room, you expect more. People say, it's island time, which I expected and you should as well, but still for the cost, that should not be an excuse. Bottom line: Grounds/facilities/beaches, rooms beautiful....Resort fee ridiculous considering cost of rooms and that beach chairs/umbrellas not included for other beaches...service improving and you will have a good time if you don't mind having a bit of patience.

The bottom line is that this is a breathtaking resort - the views are amazing, the hotel common areas are typical W style, and the rooms are nice. The staff, for the most part, is trying very hard to provide top-notch service under what appears to be very challenging circumstances. Managers from other Starwood properties have been brought in to help and they are also working very hard to insure proper service levels - and taking very generous steps to rectify issues as they develop. That being said, the service level, overall, just isn't where it needs to be for a resort charging $600+ a night (in the high season) for a room. This goes well beyond \"island time\" type issues. A couple of examples, as well as some positive service points are below: 1) Housekeeping is either poorly managed, woefully understaffed, or both. This is also what ends up causing the extensive delays upon checking in (see below). The housekeeping staff is so rushed that basic elements of housekeeping don't get attended to. Towels and robes are collected for cleaning but not replaced. Trash is left in the room and on the patio. Glassware doesn't get replaced. The last night I was there, they placed a bath mat in front of the shower (first time since we checked in) but they left a large muddy footprint on it as well. Garbage from someone else's room (used Q-tipes, etc) sat on the ground outside our room most of the stay. Simple housekeeping quality assurance is clearly not happening. 2) Food and beverage service is horribly lacking. I found the service at the pool and lobby (living room) bars to be very good, if a tad slow (island time). However, the service level in Mix, the only restaurant on-property is poorly lacking. On one occasion, they were out of menus (how does that happen?) for dinner and our table had to share one menu. Service is painstakingly slow (well over an hour for salads) and some of the wait staff are rude and unapologetic. On the positive side, when these issues were identified to management, they were rectified promptly. However, at $600 a night, we should not be put in the position of identifying these sorts of issues. Similar issues were observed with room service. The late night menu has no hot options and is delivered refrigerated by a night bellman. The culture of the island is such that food is not available late night anywhere so, from a local perspective, this is probably a generous service. However, most guests with experience at these types of resorts would likely expect more. Even meals ordered during the day were served cold after an extensive delay. Again, when notified of this, the management took prompt action to compensate us, which was much appreciated. 3) Check-in process. This issue is really a function of poor housekeeping management. However, its the first issue guests encounter and it likely sets the tone for much of guest dissatisfaction with the resort. We waited until almost 6:00 pm (4 hours after arrival) on check-in day to receive a room. Others were still waiting when our room was ready and we saw other guests dealing with the same issue on other days. Management tried to resolve the issue by providing free drinks, etc., but this sort of issue really has a way of agitating guests. I believe that the percentage of people complaining about other service issues would decrease dramatically if people's stays weren't starting on such a sour note. 4) On the positive side, you can tell that management is really working to improve service. I hope they are effective because this property has incredible potential. 5) As noted, the bar staff at the pool and lobby bars are top notch - some of the best and friendliest I've seen at similar resort settings. Drink orders and food preferences were remembered from day to day, etc. All in all, this is a beautiful resort with some service issues that need to be worked out.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Destination wedding location!\u201d", "Author": "mjoma22", "ReviewID": "UR122436228", "Content": "I am shocked to read the negative reviews about the W Vieques.

We arrived just after christmas on the 27th and were expecting the worst having read the reviews...we expected a delayed check in, rude and apathetic service, and a hotel that is all 'style' and no substance. Surprisingly - we experienced the opposite! We arrived at 5pm from San Juan - waited at the 'W' Airport lounge for 10 mins before transport arrived. Nice welcome, cold towels, drinks and food offered. Easy transfer - 5 mins. At Check in we were script welcomed - and then WHAM (sorry, your room is not ready yet..!) Ok we thought - here we go... just what the reviews had said. But, we remained calm, polite and accomodating. We were offered complimentary drinks at the Bar...so, we waited...approx 45 minutes. When the room was ready, the manager came and welcomed us...they upgraded us to a 'Fabulous' room which was FABULOUS. We also saw other guests being delayed at check in...and we can tell you why - they don't have a lot of housekeeping staff, and they are very thorough with the rooms - so, we can understand why it takes time. However, it was worth the wait! The rooms (fabulous level) are great - open, spacious, well designed and appointed Wallpaper style - nice towels, toiletries (Bliss) and comfortable beds. If anything - a little dark, but A/C worked well...free WiFi (SPG card holder) and ample closet space. The property is small and compact - it is not a mega-resort. But, it is also NOT a 'hotel' in the traditional 'W' sense - if you come expecting this, you WILL be disappointed. It is aptly called a 'retreat' and that is what it is...spacious rooms/villas in beautiful landscaped grounds...open reception area with bar, TV lounge, Mix restaurant and patio...Everywhere is a short walk away, and there are two small north facing beaches (Atlantic side -so, waves and undertow!) but a wonderful Pool area. There are lounge chairs quite close together around the two pools (one for dipping) one for swimming) which are open 24 hours a day, no lifeguard. Towels and fresh ice water available at all points/showers near beaches. A few cabanas for hire...and some water chaise loungers w/ parasols. There is a tennis court, on site car rental (Avis) and a dive shop... there is a small W Cafe (for take away coffee, sandwiches and sundries..perfect for 'on the go' breakfast or snacks). Great Gym - clean and A/C...Amazing spa massages and facilities w/ Natura Bisse products. (Go fo the cocoa scrub!) So - what about the service.. We only encountered friendly service - in all the restaurants, ground staff and pool staff. If you have travelled to Greece, Africa, or other parts of the caribbean you will understand how great this hotel is...if you haven't, and your travel experience is in north america, at resorts and hotels with a high staff/guest ratio - you may be disappointed. This is the caribbean...and, just off puerto rico. SO, it is not manhattan! It is not MIami Beach! It is not Mauritius or Hawaii..it is Vieques... kind of laid back, latino-caribbean BUT with a 'W\" style script and promise...which, I think they deliver on 90% of the time. The facts - the Ducasse restaurant provides great choice, quality food and excellent restaurant ambience and service. At times it may be slow - but, if anything it is because at peak times (e.g. Xmas) they can't possibly meet the demands of so many guests all at one time, and certainly not those of the discerning NY variety. (We heard several guests complaining about some of the most ridiculous things ever...'OMG - this cappucino is soooo cold.';' The towels don't smell fresh', etc etc) The staff work hard - we never saw anyone just lounging around, or not being guest responsive. They may not all be wearing false smiles and making inane saccharine 'chit chat' with rich, demanding, NY guests - but, they take it all in and get things done. It might not be the fastest, but it is well meaning and well managed. Anytime we saw a complaint or had a problem ourselves - it was dealt with promptly and professionally. My only gripe, the laundry service is just that... your clothes are washed and returned...no folding, no pressing (irons are in your room) and no dry cleaning. So, if you want basics washed..fine. Anything else - don't do it! When my shirts came back clean (but wrinkled to such an extent even self ironing wasnt possible - they comp'd the whole laundry.. THANK YOU W!) The W cafe team were friendly and helpful, The Dive team very nice and informative. Hiram - the concierge was helpful, courteous and generous with his time to all guests. Couldnt fault a thing...front desk were efficient and helpful. FOOD - Mix is great, the pool food was good too. The Pescadora BBQ on new year's eve was excellent. Make sure you get off property too - that way you don't get bored and get a taste of PR/Viequeno cuisine - not fancy, but tasty. The island is amazing...a gem of a little secret. The W delivers what North Americans on 1 week holiday need...clean facilities, cable TV, fresh towels (which by the way, DID smell nice!) and prompt delivery of cheeseburgers and fries anywhere on the property you desire...oh yes, and coffee...Starbucks style in the lounge or at the Cafe... plus a gym, free wifi and a decent size pool. The rooms around the pool (I think they are the spectacular) looked small, and are not very private... so, if you are in these rooms you may be disappointed. After all, room and room location makes a difference to your holiday. In this case, book the ocean front rooms and you will get what you pay for. At night, the fire pit by the bar is a nice touch...and I suppose that is what W does well - the little touches of urban cool and style (very Wallpaper 2005 design)...The W brand appears everywhere (W-this and W that (WoW, Wet, Whatever/whenever, etc etc). A bit over done - but THAT is the W - branded 'warmth of cool' North American style. A great little spot, perfect for a few days of R&R at a 'retreat' without compromising on many comforts... don't believe the worst reviews...if you are friendly, polite and able to communicate with the management in an adult manner and not make childish demands as if you are in the middle of manhattan - you will get the service you deserve, and hopefully the holiday you dream of! We loved the W Vieques, and want to congratulate the team for their hard work and efforts, at least this traveller appreciates what W have created! And...a special recognition for the W for being so Gay friendly - the most gay friendly hotel we have ever stayed at in the Caribbean, and it showed by the number of same sex couples who felt at home and were welcomed for their business! (if you want to know what it is like to have the opposite - go to Jamaica for a beach break - NOT!) If you want a nice warm holiday in the sun with a touch of latino...this is the island retreat for you!

In fact staff were so gracious I remember their names, Kelly at the front desk and Celestina who held my hand weeks prior to arrival. We found all staff to be friendly and accommodating - from the moment you arrive at the airport lounge. This included the shuttle driver, front desk, gentleman who showed us to our room and provided a brief tour of the facility, staff at the W Cafe, the woman who single handedly managed the Avis desk, Blackbeard's staff, wait staff at the Living Room and Wet (pool side) - fantastic!!

We stayed Saturday to Saturday and rented a car from the on site Avis Monday through Thursday. It was a perfect balance of resort life and island exploration. We had a blast trying to find the perfect beach for snorkeling and would have to say for this trip it would be Green beach and Navio beach. Blue beach was also a top rated beach with us. After the beach we would stop in Esperanza for dinner before heading back to the W. Really enjoyed happy hour and dinner at the Trade Winds in Esperanza.

Later that day, we happened to be dining next to some of the W staff on the other side of the Island and overheard them complaining about their jobs and the guests. Very telling! We tried to book their special seaside dinner for our honeymoon prior to arriving. The W. Staff took 3 weeks to follow up with menu modifications that did nothing but complicate a fairly simple request to swap one entree in the fixed menu. We had ants in our room. I called the front desk and they told me we would have to wait one day for an exterminator. Only when I pressed did they offer to move rooms. The exterminator never came, so we cleaned up the room ourselves. Houskeeping is poor. They cleaned our room at 4-5pm almost every day. They claim cleaning is from 9-5pm, but it's really 3-5 pm. They took our towels and robes, but never replaced them. Clearly not enough staff. We paid for a \"spectacular\" room, yet they claimed they did me a favor by upgrading me to the same room. Garden walkways are dangerous. We almost fell twice because they were too dark. \"Whatever, Whenever\" is more like we answer the phone whenever we feel like it and do whatever it takes to avoid helping you. About half of my calls were answered, a couple of which were to order room service. For a 2,500 bill, they authorized 7,000 in charges to my credit card. Most times those extra authorizations expire, but I am still trying to reach finance. I don't appreciate them occupying that much of my credit. Resort fee is excessive ($65 per night on top of your bill) for what they provide. \"Free Parking\" as part of the resort fee is a bit of red herring since the only cars are the rental cars through the Avis pool at the W. No hot tub. Beach is not as nice as beaches off the resort grounds. The pros: The food and service at the Hotel restaurant is excellent. The menu is limited, but overall high quality food. Resort would benefit from a juice bar or something for health minded people near the pool. More local fruits and vegetables from the region could be incorporated into all meals. The best meal we had was at a restaurant called Quenepo, which is about a 10min cab ride to the harbor of Esperanza. Beautiful grounds. Well maintained. Very nice pool. Great access to outdoor activities on the Island. Blackbeards (The contracted sports shop) was outstanding for snorkling, biking and our tour guide Blaine was awesome! W Manager was sympathetic to the ants and rude front desk staff so he comp'd us dinner and sent champagne to our room.

I was \"upgraded\" from a room with a balcony and a nice view to a ground floor room, half the size of my previous room and right next to the restaurant so everyone could walk right past my glass door which had a nice view of the constructionoutside my room. At least I finally had hot water. The sound proofing was no better and the couple next door made a lot of noise at 2 am. Also, the food was very expensive and very poor quality. I found much better food at half the price when I finally rented a car and got away from the resort.

We ordered room service for breakfast and when it came the order was incorrect, it was less then what we ate the entire time we were down there at the hotel restaurant yet it was double the price, when we said we did not want it the person that brought it up to our room was beyond nasty and when my boyfriend tried to give her a tip she said he can keep it and walked away. There was not one day that we had towels by the pool without having to go to the concierge and go get them, the one day that we wanted to eat dinner in the restaurant we were told that because we did not make reservations it was going to be a 40 minute wait even though we saw about 3 or 4 tables that were open.

Its definitely a cool feel to land on the island, and stay in the special W portion of the airport terminal, while awaiting a ride to the hotel. If you need a car (which is absolutely necessary, in my opinion, to explore the island) make sure to do it several months in advance. Check in is not exactly fast. Once checked in, they insist on giving an overly long tour of the entire grounds. I guess some people like that kind of thing, my wife and I don't. The rooms are beautiful. Kind of a sparse, semi-modern feel. We have only stayed in the ocean front rooms. Unfortunately, these rooms are always >$600 per night. Very expensive. Awesome views, and its great to fall asleep with the sound of the surf and the coqui frogs, but soooo expensive for a basic, non-suite room. The gym is nice. Lots of high end equipment, and my wife had a great time with the yoga classes each morning. Biggest downer? The food. I know other reviews say the same, but they're right. The main restaurant is ridiculously expensive, and not that good. The less formal bar cafe has very basic food that is still incredibly expensive. Your best bet is to find a room with a fridge, and buy food at one of the food grocery stores in one of the two towns. Having said all of that. . .we will continue to return.

We are on our second night here out of a short 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary... This will certainly be our last stay in this property. I am not a W fan, but I have stayed at W's in NYC, Montreal and have booked the W St. Petersburg (Russia) for this summer. I believe that cool ambiance and exclusivity cannot be produced in a chain hotel and cool can't be subjected to a cookie cutter method and I have given up on the W. To be methodical, I will list the few pro's and the many cons PROS: Airport lounge is a nice touch, although it feels like a waste of time to check-in twice Well...That's about it CONS: - Checked in at 330pm only to be told there is not a single room available and to be guided to the pool bar, without any offer of a free drink or anything else... We were called with our room number at 430, so we waited an hour. - Our room is situated in one of the back \"villas\" 1421 and has the great view of a parking lot, the resort's access road and the wall of the building next to it... Honestly? a $400 room with this kind of view? Avoid villas 10-15 - As reviewed before, staff can be pretty clueless. Not more so than the Mix hostess... She told us the wait would be 45 minutes and that our only other option was to eat at the bar, so we went and ordered at the bar only to be called again by the same hostess 10 minutes later with a table opening! She also neglected the fact that there was another menu available for the Living Room lounge which was much more appetizing than the burgers at the bar. - First night, a loud humming electrical noise kept waking me up from next to our room... thinking it was the AC, I turned it off... nothing. When I called in the morning a maintenance worker came and switched off an \"extractor\" at an engine room right next to our room without so much as a sorry... It was apparently been left on by mistake. - Breakfast was OK... although at this price ($30/person buffet) I would have expected an omelette station and better cheese choices than nasty sweaty American processed yellow cheese at the buffet! I doubt any of the guests at a hotel where prices start at $400 will actually eat this kind of cheese at home. I asked the chef if he had some real cheese and he proceeded to recite a litany of french cheeses that were available... The reason why they weren't presented was not available. I opted for a serving of good old Puerto Rican white cheese that could have easily been put at the buffet. - Room key demagnetized twice during our stay - At the pool this afternoon, after a brief rain shower, we asked the pool attendant for 2 towels... and he could only procure one... Never heard of a beach resort running out of towels! - There is an utter lack of information about activities available at the resort, we keep on finding things out by talking to other guests but there is no posted information at all, nor the staff volunteers much beyond the absolutely necessary. - We have enjoyed renting a car and honestly, spending time away from the fake luxury and pretentiousness of the W while enjoying the nice beaches in Vieques and the low key restaurants around the island. I hope you have had enough reading the bad reviews about this place to stop you from booking it... I am sure there are better places to stay in Vieques for a third of the price.

Overall, a beautiful property - gorgeous setting, great pools, nicely designed lobby, bar, patios and restaurant. Excellent gym facility - ample, clean, well-functioning equipment. Service issues persist, however. Some staff were very good, others should be banished from the property as they tarnish W's reputation. It seems that they're inexperienced serving guests who are well-traveled and have high expectations for efficient service. For example, after a full day of traveling, we arrived at 5PM and our room wasn't yet available. We were finally able to get into a different room, and as we were getting our key at the front desk we requested to book one of the tour offerings. The front desk person with whom we had been dealing encouraged us to go to our rooms, relax, and come back later. We were tired and cranky and wanted to book the damn thing then and there so we could be done with it. And yet he persisted on telling us to come back later. Finally, we put our foot down and demanded we could arrange the tour on the spot. How crazy is it that we had to force them to take our money!? That was just one of a handful of annoyances. (And he never did book the damn tour, as we found out the following morning when we double-checked). Food prices at the hotel are exorbitant. We didn't find many places on the island for a good breakfast, but there are lots of great options for lunch and dinner, especially in Esperanza (Duffys, Bananas, Next Course, El Quenepo). Rent a Jeep and give yourself the flexibility to tour the island, whether for meals or for exploring the FABULOUS beaches on the south east side of Vieques. Be sure to do an evening kayaking excursion in the Bio Bay - extremely memorable! Other convenient amenities at the hotel: Avis car rental (saleswoman needed a major attitude adjustment but the Jeeps are in great condition), sports shop with knowledgeable, friendly staff -- and the resort fee covers snorkel rentals which are also in great condition. Last points for Starwood management reading this review: Please turn off that awful music that you've got piped in at every point on the property! It's fine for your city destinations, but when one goes to relax at a gorgeous Caribbean island, it's nice to have a little R&R without the constant beat of lounge music EVERYWHERE.

The management had to bring in other managers from other 'W' hotel locations to help this location with their service. That should tell you something.

You would be better served to leave the hotel instead of eating at the hotel. RENT A CAR!!!! It will end up being much cheaper than using the hotel's car service. The island is very small. Although there are beaches on the southern end of the island, they are remote. By that i mean there are no places to eat, use the bathroom, shop, or do anything. Once you are dropped at the beach, you have no way out until they pick you up. Further, they charge an obscene amount of money to go to the beach. For example, to go to 'Blue Beach', costs 37 dollars per couple or 25 dollars per person. The beach is about 10 minutes away. Rent the car.

The first half of the week we stayed at the W and the remainder of the week at Malecon House (loved it here for different reasons too). Overall we loved the W and had a great experience!!! We consider ourselves seasoned travelers and have been all over the Caribbean. We have stayed in every type of accomodation from five star resorts, private villas, all inclusives to more modest inns. We travel for pleasure not business and because of the variety of places we like to stay, never care about racking up or using any hotel points. With that said, we chose Vieques to explore the incredible beaches and we chose the W in particular to sit and relax in a luxurious/romantic setting. Having stayed at other W properties, we knew what to expect as far as the decor and overall vibe. The resort itself is absolutely gorgeous and exceeded our expectations. Our room was modern (loved the shower and big chair), very spacious and had an incredible ocean view. The resort has impeccably maintained/designed grounds with a wonderful pool setting and breathtaknig views of the ocean. We also enjoyed working out in the gym. The lobby is decorated in the cool/modern typical W fashion but still somehow maintains that relaxed caribbean feel. We enjoyed all of the sitting areas by the pool and lobby, oversized chaises and the firepit at night for cocktails. We had planned to visit the spa but were so content relaxing by the pool we never scheduled any services... Service was great. Having read some conflicting reviews, we were prepared for a mixed bag. Fortunately, we received solid and consistent service from every employee we encountered. Check in was quick, smooth and friendly. Our ambassador Raul gave us a great tour of the resort and our room upon check in. The waitstaff at breakfast were always pleasant and attentive. (As a side note, I did get the sense that the W has been working on addressing some of their service issues because there seemed to be multiple management-type staff who seemed to be visiting from another location at the time we were there). In addition, we had great poolside service. The girl who waited on us daily was always coming by to check on us to see if we needed anything. Great mojitos too! The only area not up to par in my opnion, was the quality of the food. Our package included breakfast at Mix on the Beach. We ordered room service twice and also ate by the pool during the day. On each occasion, the food was average at best (One reason why we went elsewhere for dinner). For the price, it should be much, much better. ie/ not hot enough, brown meat on my turkey sandwich, breakfast meats that had been sitting out on the buffet all morning.. In contrast, we had several GREAT dining experiences elsewhere on the island. Next Course and El Quenepo had top notch service and creative menus with quality, fresh ingredients. We also enjoyed the seafood options at TradeWinds in Esperanza. Overall the W is a fabulous property that exceptionally well designed. We truly enjoyed our stay. To other travelers, I would recommend getting off the resort and renting a jeep at least for a couple of days. It's fun to drive on the island but more importantly, the beaches of Vieques are some of the best my husband and I have ever seen in the Caribbean. Seeing some of the old navy bunkers etc.. also neat. Blue beach is absolutely breathtaking (shallow crystal clear blue, calm water, long walking beach, and isolated). I think it has moved into the top position as our favorite beach of all time. Navio and Red beach are both also beautiful. There's not much to see/do in Isabel II but I'm glad we checked things out there. I always think it's an important experience to see the authentic culture of the island. Take a cab to Esperanza and walk along the Malecon. We were so pleasantly surprised by the number of great eateries, restaurants, and little local island bars and the sunsets are amazing. (Lazy Jack's, Duffy's, Bananas all fun, laid back places for drinks) Suggestions for improvement: The W should consider their own shuttle service at night (include that in the $60/day resort fee)for those who want to get off the resort property, explore Esperanza or have a nice dinner off site. Also, Keep a well stocked bar in the welcome lounge at the airport (selection was very sparse when we landed) ie/ beer, wine, margaritas, sangria...

We sat outside nearer to the bar side of the restaurant, we had pizza which was cold on the inside so we had to send it back and when it came back we still didnt eat it was some cheap nasty frozen pizza.

Upon check-in, I was informed of the $65.00/day resort charge, which I wasn't thrilled about. The girl checking me in wasn't exactly friendly or very informative, either. The couple checking in next to me had a very friendly staff member who promptly asked an \"ambassador\" to show them around the property. The staff member who showed me around the resort was summoned in the middle of doing something else-so he hurriedly told me where a few things were, and deposited me in my room. I had told them specifically in both the airport lounge AND upon check-in when my husband was arriving, so they could pick him up from the airport. I ended up having to call down to the front desk later that evening when he arrived and called me-because the W lounge was unstaffed and no one was there to pick him up. We had a beautiful room, in villa 17. It had an oceanview balcony, 1 full bathroom and a 1/2 bath. We had a living room with mini-bar, kitchen table, and lounge chairs. The bedroom was a good size, with a four-post bed, very comfortable, no problem sleeping! Our room was quiet and private. I definitely wouldn't have wanted a room overlooking the pool...too noisy. They did send us a complimentary bottle of champagne and a dessert plate on our first night there, along with a nice handwritten note, because we were celebrating our anniversary. Two issues with the room: the shower pressure from the rainfall shower head is not good. It took me FOREVER to get the shampoo and conditioner out of my hair (and I have thin, straight hair!) I also hated the bathtub. I'm someone who loves to take baths, and at an upscale property like the \"W,\" I would expect at least a large soaking tub. This bathtub looked like a large aluminum wash tub that cattle or other farm animals drink out of. Really? The restaurant, miX on the Beach, was OK, not great, particularly for the price we paid. Very overpriced. Much better food and drinks can be had elsewhere on the island...you must try Next Course and Sol Food. The W Cafe is also very expensive...beware when going in to grab some coffee, juice, or breakfast. The oceanviews from the restaurant and the outside deck are fabulous, though. The drinks at the pool were incredibly sweet, though I've been told this is a Puerto Rican preference. My \"sangria\" tasted like Hawaiian Punch or Kool-Aid. I also felt like the pool area was minimally staffed, and they couldn't keep up with the drink/food orders. As for the beaches, get off the property and check out the beaches in the Vieques Wildlife Reserve, particularly Blue Beach. Actually, that would be my greatest piece of advice: rent a 4WD from the Avis on-site at the W (we did), or from Maritza's car rental, and get off the property to check out the island!

The only stipulation she gave was that she did not want to go anywhere that I had previously visited, and since we had not taken a vacation in several years, would like to have the time spent on our honeymoon, \"Extended\" if at all possible. Since I am a HUGE \"Starwood\" fan and just recently slept my way back to \"Platinum\" status, I was hoping to keep it in the family. Now, to understand what sparked my interest in the places we ended up choosing you need to better understand my wife. She LOVES \"Water\", especially clean, warm water that you can swim in, and if there happens to be a beach attached to it, even better. Now here is a fun fact that doesn't really make sense, but helps with our travel decisions. We are both in the \"Entertainment\" industry, and would prefer to avoid large crowds if at all possible. We also are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Traditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people, for example, we made up our own vows, and there was no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chicken Dance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to speak of at our reception. I had spent several months asking friends, \"Where is your favorite place you have ever been\"? Or \"If you were going on your honeymoon, where would you like to go\"? Our Second stop \"Costa Rica\", came up repeatedly, but more about that later. Note: Look for: Honeymoon in Paradise Part 2, coming soon. There is one spot that I only heard mentioned once, but just so happened to be the location of a new \"W Resort and Spa\". This being a small island located approximately halfway between \"St. Thomas\" and \"San Juan\" Puerto Rico called \"Vieques\". If St. Thomas is a \"Virgin\" island, then the best way to describe Vieques\" would be \"Extra Virgin\". My friend \"Patricia\" and her BFF Jon have traveled to more places than anyone I know, and when I asked Patricia, \"Trish\", what her favorite was, without missing a breath, she not only said, \"Vieques\", but also said, \"The W, in Vieques PR\". The photos of this wonderful property that I had been viewing on the SPG website were still fresh on my mind, and since I trusted \"Trish\" more than most, Vieques it was. TRANSPORTATION: The first decision I had to make was regarding \"Travel\". Getting to San Juan is easy. In fact, I never realized just how reasonable travel between the USA, and Puerto Rico was. The challenge came when I read that the boat ride was only $2 Ea. (Yes, Two Dollars), and the flight was $200 Ea. I read as much as possible on this topic, and the way I saw it was this. Without a doubt, a 20 min plane ride, vs. a 2.5 hour (X2) boat ride made for a close decision. However, when you factor in a \"Strike\" and several broken down ships, causing the remaining boats to take on some extra stops (their sister island for one), the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Possibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of missing a connecting flight, not to mention it being our Honeymoon, and the decision was easy. The second Transportation question came regarding a \"Rental Car\". It was very clear from virtually everyone I spoke with that having transportation on the Island was a \"Must\". However, what they don't tell you is that it is \"Extremely\" \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, choices are very \"Limited\", and that during the busy season, they often run out. We ended up renting a small 4 wheel drive from Vieques Rentals, and were very happy with our decision. Their representative \"Joey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was extremely nice and we were very glad that we had it. The only thing I will mention here is that driving a car on the island of Vieques is not for everyone. There are only two or three \"Good\" (Although that word barely applies here), roads. Growing up in Michigan was the best training possible for navigating these pothole covered roadways. We ended up with a slow leak at one point, but were as good as new in a few min thanks to the well trained Fix a Flat specialists at the local tire store. THE W RESORT Being a HUGE Starwood Fan, and knowing that we were about to embark on our very first \"Starwood W Resort\" Experience, had me \"Almost\" as excited as the fact that I was about to marry the girl of my dreams. Think about it for a min... You have \"Starwood\" IMO \"The best collection of hotels on the planet\", combined with their \"W\" brand (Which my Best Man and I both love so much we even stayed at The W Lakeshore Chicago for my bachelor party weekend). Combined with a tropical Island that has only been inhabited by tourists for a few years, and what do you get... WOW is an Understatement... From the moment we landed we knew this was going to be something special. How many resorts have their own \"Lounge\" at the airport? (Although IMO it needs a little something more, such as a \"Special\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Welcome\" Island Cocktail, complimentary chair massage tied into the spa, welcome gift, etc). It may have been a slow day, but this is a missed opportunity. Also, it is not very clear where you go when you first get off the plane and when it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to go there. They are 95% there and it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much to go the extra 5%. Soon we were off to the resort itself (About a 5 min drive) in a beautiful new SUV. Both gals who checked us in were extremely nice. Since it was our honeymoon, they upgraded us to a slightly nicer room, and off we went. We faced what they called \"The Quiet Beach\", and the waves sounded like they had been scripted by a relaxation guru. Prior to booking a Starwood \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Property, I read loads of reviews, and one thing that popped up several times was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Music\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which honestly I would much rather hear deep relaxing chill/ house music, than the same 21 songs you hear on the radio all day long. This also adds a much more sophisticated feel to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd properties, and is appreciated by most well traveled people. However I would agree that they need to deepen their selection, so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear the same CD/Tracks play with any noticeable frequency. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd brand has been out for a while now, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they have a good backlog of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Licensed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd material to choose from. Our first morning I was awoken by my \"Bride\" (who almost always sleeps in longer than I). She was gushing with excitement, and couldn't wait for the morning fog to clear from my eyes so I could focus on the photo she had taken on her phone. Apparently, my wife (Who is one of the biggest Horse fans I have ever met), went for a morning walk to see the property, came around a corner, and to her surprise, nearly ran into a pack of wild horses, who had gathered right in the middle of the path. I had heard that there were \"A Few\" wild horses on the Island, but little did we know that there are a few \"Thousand\" wild horses who roam free like deer all over the island. We ended up seeing horses \"Everywhere\" we went; The Beach, The Hotel, The Gas Station, The Road, I mean, \"Everywhere\". It's the craziest thing, and to a horse lover, a dream come true. What made this even more special was that several of them had recently given birth, and there were new born babies stumbling around everywhere. Very Cool. OK, since everyone else isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nearly as excited about my honeymoon as they are about the details, time to get to it: First of all, the W Vieques has one of the nicest hotel Fitness Centers I have ever experienced, and they had a full time person who kept it well stocked with towels, water, and kept it as clean as a whistle. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Snack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd spot (Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the name) located next door to the Fitness Center was lacking in selection, especially if you were looking for a quick \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Healthy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd snack. Again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure that obtaining good, quality produce, and more on an island faced with shipping strikes, combined with being the nicest place on the island, presents its share of challenges, but a nice \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Smoothie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bar with Protein, and vitamin boosts would be nice, as would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fresh Squeezed Juices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When we asked why they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fresh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd items such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Blueberries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the person behind the counter said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Have you seen the price of Blueberries here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to which I wanted to respond, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Have you seen the price of the rooms here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? The Pool is simply incredible, and would give the smaller hotel Pools in Vegas a run for their money. There are chairs positioned in the water that allow you to stay completely dry, while resting only inches from the water. There are also some of the nicest cabanas in the Caribbean, which can be rented upon request. The layout of the Infinity portion of the pool, combined with the chairs virtually floating just above the water, makes this all very surreal. The music being played over the hotel sound system was perfect for the environment Note: If you are looking for the same music you hear every day over the radio at home, sorry, but you have just been given an upgrade. Keep in mind; you are at a \"Retreat\"/\"Spa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Very relaxing, with the best part being that there were even speakers under the water, to further enhance your experience. Nice! The Staff was very friendly, and took very good care of us. The lobby was extremely, FUN. With a pool table, games, bar, and a fire pit located just a few feet outdoors, that set it all off just perfect. However, they do need to do a better job maintaining what they have. Note for mgmt: We searched thru every pool cue stick, and did not find one with a tip. There were also missing pieces from a couple of the games we tried to play. The Food was fantastic. One thing to note here is that our vacation was during the time of year when many of the Island restaurants were closed. Since we were staying for 9 days, we had the opportunity to eat several times for lunch, dinner, snacks, and even room service. The food in the restaurant was so delicious I found myself getting cravings for it. The Chef had a \"Special\" dish that we tried on a number of occasions, and were blown away by how incredible it was. Even some of the appetizers like our favorite \"Hummus\" were done to perfection. We only found three other restaurants that were worth mentioning. Duffy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s - Not really into \"Bar Food\", but this place does it right. The Staff was fantastic, and they played old Music Videos hosted by the legendary Wolfman Jack during Lunch. If you are looking for a Sandwich or happen to be on the other side of the Island and decide that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hungry, Duffy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a \"Safe\" bet: we ended up there twice. \"Next Course\" - We ate dinner here three times (And were very lucky as we heard that it had just re-opened the week prior) and enjoyed it immensely. And lastly, \"El Patio\", which was also very good but had zero atmosphere and a staff who albeit nice, seemed very detached. They did have one of the tastiest Lobsters we had. Be warned, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a shock going from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to virtually \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anywhere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the island, due to its rustic nature. At first glance (Other than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Next Course\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) we had to remind ourselves that we had heard very positive things about the food. Excursions - What to do while visiting the Island. I am a little partial here, as it was my honeymoon, and everything was perfect right? Without a doubt, plan to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Relax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are some of the most beautiful \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beaches\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we had ever seen and my new bride was very happy. The drive from one beach to the next is not for the faint of heart. The roads are littered with Potholes, and often covered by water, but the reward when you finally do reach the beach is worth the price of admission. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after a tropical storm the seaweed washes up on the beach, but the beaches are so amazing, that their beauty shines through. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bioluminescent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Bay was quite possibly the coolest thing I have ever seen, and Vieques has the largest in the world. If you have seen the movie \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Avatar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, then you will have a better idea as to what to expect, but I can say with certainty, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expect the Unexpected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Naked to the human Eye\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd creatures that live it these waters light up when they are disturbed (Which means they are almost always glowing). Even the small whitecaps of the waves glowed, but this was nothing compared to the glow that shined when you paddled the kayak. We went thru a company called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Abes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and they were some of the nicest, most well informed people you can imagine. I would not miss this under any circumstances. One note however, if you are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153High Maintenance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this excursion is probably not for you. Most of the people running the show were incredible, but very ummm, ahhhh \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Earthy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ride was rough to say the least, and from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Crabs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spiders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, we saw many of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creatures. Also, unless you are coming prepared with the proper gear to film these creatures, leave your camera at home, as you will simply increase your chances of losing it. THE STAFF This is where many hotels and restaurants rise to the occasion, or simply fall apart. Having stayed at numerous W Hotels over the years, we had a fairly good idea regarding what to expect, but when you factor in the challenges faced by a hotel of this caliber, on an Island such as this, you had to be a little open minded. When we say that the W Vieques is by far the nicest property on the Island, we aren't kidding. Up until a few years ago, this Island was used by the military for Bombing exercises, and while we were there, the restaurant we chose to eat lunch at our first day (Not at the W), ran out of Lettuce due to a food shortage as a result of a local boat company strike. We never ran into any issues like this at the W, but it helps to illustrate some of the challenges faced by a \"Commercially\" new island. There were also some challenges encountered during our stay at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \"However\", IMO, it's not the \"Issues\" that a hotel or restaurant encounters that make or break a property, but how they choose to deal with those \"Issues\" when they do (And they \"Always\" will) arise. One thing for certain, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is heading in a positive direction. The STAFF was close to perfection, with many going above and beyond the call of Duty. My favorite act of kindness came from a Tall, Curly haired native island boy named, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kevin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I'm not sure what exactly Kevin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s classification would be, as he seemed to do a little of everything, Bellman, Valet, Etc. I had received a bad Sunburn and was in a great deal of pain. Kevin suggested that I might need some Aloe to which I agreed. Since it was afterhours and the onsite surf shop was closed, there was no immediate solution available. What I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know until an hour later when we were heading to dinner, is that Kevin made a quick stop at the store during a run for another customer, and brought me back a gift. I have seen things like this happen under orders from a manager before, but not from an individual (Using his own money, and \"Yes\", I reimbursed him, but he tried to say no). Kevin was also the employee who helped us to ultimately find our Rental car keys. Thank you is an understatement, as the cost \"Per our Rental Agreement\" (Make sure you read your contracts) was $500 if we had in fact \"Lost\" our keys. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until we actually made it to dinner that night that we met \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (General Manager of Mix on the Beach) and we realized that there was a pattern here. Our first encounter came off the heels of a brief tropical burst of rain. My new bride looked at me and said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OMG I feel sorry for that manager\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as he was quickly moving from table to table, finding positive solutions to every customer he encountered. Now I must say that we have owned and operated restaurants, and short of being a good owner, you usually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that type of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the top\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attention to detail from anyone these days. Since he caught our attention, we kept watching and quickly realized just how incredible he really was. Take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The opposite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of your average restaurant manager, who begrudgingly strolls up to your table and offers a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncaring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How is everything tonight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? We watched as he went from table to table, and spent a fair amount of time with each, all the while carefully watching, working with, and assisting his staff toward service perfection. When he finally made it to our table, we experienced firsthand what we had observed from afar, quite simply, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was AWESOME\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! Not only did he make it to each and every table, he started over again, and visited most \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Twice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if not more. Now there is a person that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Truly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cares about his customers! Over the balance of our trip, we had the pleasure of speaking with him several more times and all we can say is that they are VERY fortunate to have such an amazing person on their team. Having stayed in hotels over 150 nights this year alone, I have certainly witnessed the GOOD, THE BAD, and THE UGLY. I tend to give \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the benefit of the doubt as there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Usually\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, things happening behind the scenes that would explain (Not justify) what has taken place. For example, one of the biggest challenges on an island such as this is the labor pool, especially when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already the best in your market. On our last night, we had the pleasure of meeting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd General Manager \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Greg White, and what a great guy. We were fortunate enough to meet both he, and his wonderful assistant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Iris\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during our visit, and would anticipate nothing but positive changes in the future. Early on in our stay we had a couple of issues that arose, and since Greg was attending a conference, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Iris\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stepped in. She has an amazing way about her, acting almost like a counselor, and truly listening to your concerns. Not only did she address these, post haste, but she personally followed up to make certain that the problem had been resolved to our satisfaction. Most of the balance of the staff seemed like really good people, but simply needed better direction, and needed to learn to communicate better. In our opinion, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that there was a problem in the first place that concerns us as much as how it is dealt with once it is brought to the attention of management. One of the biggest reasons we still selected this location in spite of a few bad reviews, was that there was almost no talk of conversations with mgmt. If mgmt is never made aware of a need, how are they supposed to make corrections? From looking at the history of this resort, it has not been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for very long, and the New Management team was still getting their feet wet. Based on what we saw, I would expect very positive changes in the future, as we watch yet another Starwood property go from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd!!", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cLike a Hot Girl Who Doesn't Even Try...\u201d", "Author": "bayleyzebub", "ReviewID": "UR121129347", "Content": "Before I went to the W on Vieques, I read the reviews here, and was surprised just how many people commented on the poor service.

My husband is a platinum SPG member so we stay at these types of resorts frequently. The property is very pretty with a nice view of the sea. The pools, restaurant, bar (living room) and fire pit all have gorgeous, serene views. Despite a loud rattle in the wall that continued off and on throughout our stay, we enjoyed our spacious and unique room. The interior design is just as beautiful as it appears on the web site. But that is where it ends! The management is horrible and the resort is incredibly understaffed. Don't ask for anything and expect to get it in a timely manner - or get it at all. I noted one night that one server was serving 50+ people at the bar / living room area. It took over 1/2 hour for her to take our order. The following day, I saw that two servers were trying to meet the needs of 50+ people at the pool. Impossible! Bring a sweater if you want to enjoy indoor Living Room space. They keep the AC pumping at a really uncomfortable level - especially at night. The drinks are expensive but tasty. We noticed if you ordered the same drink twice you rarely got the same thing. This may bother you if you like consistency. We liked having a drink by the fire pit in the late evening, but it often took over a 1/2 hour to get a drink. We found the restaurant offerings to be lackluster (especially the pool menu), which is a huge bummer because there aren't any other options within walking distance. We spent most of our evenings venturing out to find other restaurants on the island. The shuttles are not included in the $65 per day resort fee, so expect to pay another $20-40 per person per day to travel to other places on the island. We wanted to rent a car to explore on our own but all rental cars were sold out - so reserve early if you want to create your own adventure. We returned to our room one day to shower and dress for dinner only to discover that our room had not been cleaned. No biggie - but just another example of the lack of customer service. Also the welcome dessert plate they left for us the first night along with several beach towels sat on our \"front porch\" for our entire stay. If you go, definitely travel to the town and visit the other restaurants. Blue beach and Red Beach are gorgeous and definitely worth a day trip. As we waited for our puddle jumper back to Puerto Rico on our final day, we visited the airport lounge for some coffee. Since it was only 9 a.m., I was excited to enjoy a cup of coffee before our flight - only to discover on the first sip that it was cold. :(", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGo-to Resort for East Coasters!\u201d", "Author": "JJFigs", "ReviewID": "UR121080732", "Content": "Short Version: the property is aaa-aaaamazing, the Suites are exceptional, beaches & pools were great, the service will frustrate you at times though. I'm sure there are nicer resorts in the world. I'm not sure we are going to spend the time or money to figure out which ones those are after finding W Vieques. This is our resort go-to! Long Version - Room: We got a great upgrade to a two room suite which made a huge difference in my experience. Nonetheless, W quality was better than most W's I've stayed at in the US. Great work on the renovation. If you want to relax, I highly encourage you to get a room away from the pool. - Pool and Beach: The beaches are small, protected (not ideal for walking, but the Adult beach is great for swimming.) The pool was relaxing during the week when there was only 42% occupancy. On the weekend, they had 100% occupancy, DJ and a quasi South Beach feel going - not our cup-of-tea on this trip so we stuck by the beach. - Service: Apparently the owner of the resort has made it her own goal that 65% of the resort is staffed by locals in order to develop a critical mass of hospitality experience on the island - great idea and commendable. The problem is that the service is hit or miss. And when the miss (which they do often) it's by a wide margin. The service is at times unacceptably frustrating given what the resort is charging.

The bad: - $65 per day resort fee is ridiculous, especially when you're staying on points. - No shuttle to either of the towns on the island. The W is too far to walk to anything, and if you want to get anywhere you have to order a taxi, and the taxis are all these giant ten person vans. It would've been nice to have a shuttle that ran a few times per day to the two towns. How hard would that be to set up? - Getting coffee in the morning was an ADVENTURE. They were always running out and the staff seemed very confused by the simplest of requests. Then when they would bring coffee it would be cold. The staff really needs to get their act together around morning coffee. - NO HOT TUB. This blew us away. We were there in March and it was a bit chilly. How can an island resort not have a hot tub?

Upon arrival at the airport on the island, you have access to the W Lounge. It provides complimentary drinks as you wait for the free shuttle to the hotel. The airport is a five minute ride to the hotel. The hotel is at par with any other W. I think it is a very nice modern hotel. The staff was very helpful upon arrival. We received an upgrade with an ocean view. We also had a flat tire at the hotel. One of the staff offerred to change the tire for us. I thought this was beyond what I could have asked or expected. Though we didn't take him up on the offer, it was very much appreciated. The hotel has two beaches, though they are more for laying around than going in the water. In addition, the hotel has a nice pool overlooking the ocean. The hotel plays the music under the water so you can hear as you swim. I thought this was a nice perk. There is a $60 resort fee which includes access to tennis courts and equipment, snorkle gear, and yoga classes. Overall, it was a nice hotel and would recommend staying there if on the island. Some overall comments on the island we researched and helpful to know prior to going: I would recommend flying to the island rather than take a ferry (due to problems with ferry from Fajardo to Vieques) and you will need a car on the island if you plan on getting around (longer distance between things).", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york metro", "Title": "\u201ca slice of paradise\u201d", "Author": "yanks105", "ReviewID": "UR120960679", "Content": "We recently had an opprtunity to visit the relatively new W on Vieques.

Cons: Lighting. If you expect to read at night, better bring a flashlight. The rooms are so poorly lit that you need one to find your phone, let alone enjoy a book. Every guest I spoke to had the same problem, so this wasn't an aberration limited to our room. AirConditioning: The thermostats in the rooms are just props. It was so unbearably cold, that we would turn off the AC completely but it remained cold-and between the omnipresent darkness and the frigid temps, it was pretty much like living in a cave. Again-not just my room but every other guest I spoke to as well. (The \"Living Room\" is also unbearably cold.) Music music music music-everywhere. In the lobby, in the restaurants, by the pool-IN THE POOL-on the beach. You simply couldn't escape it. And it was the same mind-numbing, generic Latin or Brazilian, lounge or house MUZAK, played over and over, all day, ad nauseum. It was like being stuck in an elevator! I suspect this stuff was produced expressly for the W, as none of the songs or singers were recognizable. My theory is that using this kind of crap is a cost saving measure, as it means not having to pay fees to the musical licensing agencies for the use of real songs. Whatever the reason-the music is unbearable, unceasing and oppressive. (It should be mentioned that music in the pool is a fun novelty for about 5 minutes but when you swim underwater, the treble heavy frequencies quickly become not only un-relaxing but positively painful.) Also- the music begins IN THE MORNING. If you have a poolside room, I hope you don't want to sleep late. The worst of it however, is the fact that it is pumped onto the beach. I came to the W to relax. That means ocean breezes and the sound of the surf-not 20 different version of The Girl From Ipanema. SPA you say?? How does an expensive hotel like this NOT have a sauna or a hot tub? (However, if they did, they would most certainly charge for it's use-unthinkable at any hotel I've ever stayed in). Rooms Continued: 1) There is one towel rack in the entire room and it's in the shower. 2) the Light switches are so oddly hidden-it took 2 days to find the one for the shower. 3) The hanging lamp (which produces an annoying yellow glow) has NO on/off switch. To turn it off, I had to climb over an obstacle course of furniture and unplug it manually. A guest I spoke to wasn't as lucky. His lamp was hard-wired in and the only way to turn it off was to unscrew the bulb. 4) No turn down service. 5) The tub and the floor of the shower were NEVER cleaned. 6) Virtually no drawer space-One tiny drawer and one narrow drawer in each of the end tables. We kept our clothes in our luggage on a bench for our entire stay-and mind you-this was a huge room with plenty of space for chests of drawers. 7) The TV (which wasn't getting reception for 2 days), is placed on a stand in a cabinet at a 45 degree angle to the bed. (this is in ALL the rooms) You have to pull it out of the cabinet, swivel it and even then. it's difficult to watch. 8) Internet-not only slow and useless but you have to re-sign up for it every day. 9) No room for toiletries-just a narrow shelf above the bathroom sink. 10) $17 for each new pay-for-view movie. 11) CONDOMS AND LUBRICANTS next to the candy and snacks-it didn't really bother me, I just thought it to be amusing if not somewhat bizarre. However, if i had kids, I'd be really pissed off. Beach-the beach (except for the music of course) is nice but it is not properly staffed. You have to find your own umbrella-move your own chairs and there is no food service on the sand, even though the main outdoor bar is only a staircase away. Food-Crap. Nothing more to say about it-except perhaps that it was expensive crap. If you've never had Mofongo-PLEASE do not order it here. It will forever tarnish your perception of one of PR's great foods. The last indignity-we wanted to print out our boarding pass on our last day. They charge for the use of a printer! (By contrast-I was recently staying at the Murano in Paris -which is also a very pricey hotel, and when i was having computer problems-they actually gave me a computer to use for free for an entire week-THIS is the way to run a hotel.) Pros- 1)the staff does try really hard 2) It's really the only game in town. Now here I must mention that I am not against the hipster hotel format (if that is what the W is striving for) The Standard for instance does it perfectly. Everything about the W however, is totally off and while I suspect that they are trying in part to appeal to the same crowd, they fail on every level. And as a retreat? Not even close. The sad thing is that the staff does try hard to please but there is nothing they can do to compensate for a place that was clearly so ill-conceived from the start and so badly managed by people who continue to make bad decisions and refuse to correct problems that are easily remedied. And mind you-the staff has heard all of these complaints Management simply doesn't care to address and rectify them. Finally-a very expensive hotel that calls itself a \"retreat\", should be just that. At resorts that charge these kinds of prices (and frankly, much less expensive ones as well) the one quality you will always find, is that there is never a compelling reason to want to leave-you love the room and the service, the amenities and the grounds so much, that you have to be torn away to go to town or outside restaurants, other beaches, etc. The W does not have this quality. Here, you instead find yourself constantly compelled to get away from all the crap that I listed, driven out by bad food, noise, cold temperature,malfunctioning internet and TV etc, etc etc..... And IT'S TOO DARK TO READ A BLOODY BOOK!!!!! If you want to go to Vieques-rent a house. the bargains are great. The W is a pig with lipstick.

While the property is very beautiful, hip, and modern, this hotel suffers from severe service issues that dramatically detract from your enjoyment of the property. Upon arriving and claiming our bags at the VQS Airport, we went to the W Lounge where we were greeted and offered a drink. Another couple had arrived on the same flight as us, and the attendant called for a ride from the hotel. Took about 10-15 minutes a staff member to show up with a Jeep, which was a little on the small side for 2 couples. Upon check-in I was extremely disappointed to be welcomed as SPG Gold guest as I had recently qualified for Platinum 2 weeks prior. Now, I would owe this up to a simple technical glitch if I had not called both SPG Customer Service twice AND the hotel directly once to confirm that they could \"see\" my status. I finally was able to get upgraded to a Partial Oceanview Fantastic Suite (meanwhile the Platinum couple ahead of us go the Wow Oceanfront Retreat), and the front desk agent made no attempt at service recovery and even made the situation awkward by whispering behind our backs to other staff members while trying to resolve the issue. We finally settled into our room, which despite having a limited view was very modern and cool. There were still a few hours of sunlight, so we decided to have a couple of drinks by the pool and then enjoy our \"Sunset Sip\", a free cocktail advertised by the hotel. Unfortunately this free drink amounted to a 3 oz shot glass of sangria served with so much attitude by the bar tender and lobby waitress that it made you feel as if asking for the free drink was doing them a disservice. It was an extremely upsetting display by the two of them and at this point we were so disgusted we went upstairs to have some room service and call it a night. The room service food was terrible; fries were overcooked and we were significantly overcharged for two items on the bill. A visit to the front desk the following morning to led to the the charge quickly being taken off; and I did receive an apology for the atitudes of the lobby staff the night before. While the first day was rocky, the rest of the stay was relatively uneventful, but there was a constant stream of \"misses\" by the staff that you could tell they just didn't care. This includes 1) Calling \"Whatever, Whenever\", twice, to have the pool towels at the plunge pool be refreshed, and having the attendent never show up. 2) Asking that the kitchen make a special lunch request (which was simply the pasta dish they had on special the previous night), and despite charging $30, having the dish come out wrong, twice and not offering to fix it the second time. 3) A fellow guest decided to send us a a bottle of Champagne to the room via Room Service, and they simply delivered the bottle warm and without Champagne glasses. We decided to bring it down and enjoy it at the fire and were informed that it would be a $35 corkage fee to drink it at the fire pit. Seriously!?!? 4) Never refreshing the \"Free\" waters in the room; inconsistent turn-down service (only happend 2 out of the five nights of the stay) 5) Charging a $65/day resort fee; which is simply obnoxious, especially for the level of service received. Now, that being said, there were some highs. We did enjoy both breakfast and dinner at Mix, and found the waitstaff there to be very nice and accommodating. The pool is a blast to hang out in, and the beach is nice to look at, but not to sit out on as it is full of ants that like to bite. Service at the pool was generally friendly and quick, but those $13 drinks add up fast. The Meeze (\"Pick 3\") platter was our favorite and got that on multiple occasions. We rented a car onsite from Avis to explore the other beaches on Vieques. They were very pretty; but had gotten pretty badly eroded in the recent hurricane, leaving very narrow strips of sand, that were mostly covered in dried seaweed. The water at the Blue Beach was gorgeous. Dinner at Next Course was delicious and I would definitely recommend. Back to the hotel, overall we just got the feeling that most of the staff were not \"into\" their jobs and took a very \"Whatever\" attitude about everything. There was nobody being proactive about your needs and very few people who seemed to care to make things better. The hotel could be so great but there are serious service issues here that would make me think twice about staying again or recommending to a fellow traveler.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cUrban meets retreat\u201d", "Author": "cheetah72", "ReviewID": "UR120390042", "Content": "My husband and I spent 5 nights at the W.

While I don't want to start with a downside - I would say there is only two - no direct flights (the other i'll get to later). I guess you could argue that is a good thing as less people will go when it requires two legs. But really, the 20 min flight from San Juan to Vieques on Cape Air was fantastic - and a part of the experience. Upon arriving in Vieques you can make yourself comfortable and grab a drink at the W lounge in the airport before being whisked away to the Resort in a private shuttle for guests only. We arrived, checked in, and we're given a tour by a friendly member of staff. He pointed out the restaurant, pool, bar, spa, gym, and the two private beaches (including one that is what they refer to as the 'European' beach - aka the nude beach). The last stop was our room. We had a pool view room - ground floor, steps from the pool and beach. From bed we could enjoy a beautiful view and sunset with partial view of pool and ocean. I enjoyed the ground floor for ease of access to everything. You enter and exit this room via floor to ceiling sliding glass doors rather than the traditional door. This was a huge benefit in my opinion. Being on the second or third floor would afford better ocean views. The room was simple but well appointed. A series of mesh curtains acted as privacy screens. A nice tub and separate shower. Downside number two - we had some hot water issue. No one else in our large group of friends had this - so just a one off case and wouldn't impact my view of the hotel. Service overall is top notch with a friendly and helpful staff. For those looking for a 'gay friendly' place to go I'd also recommend. We were at the W for a same-sex wedding (two men). Outside of the 20-25 men that were at the W for the wedding we also met a handful of other men and women on vacation. The resort was accommodating to everyone. We felt very welcome. This is not a gay party place though. Families and people all over the world on vacation here. I do fear in time this may become a party place for any type of person. I heard already that the next season of the bachelor is being filmed at the resort. Go now before it's over run by spring break and other parties. True we were at a wedding and made lots of noise late on Saturday night and there was a wedding on Sunday night. But hopefully that's not every night.

Most staff are very friendly and helpful. We opted for a poolside room which was also very close to the ocean. We had requested an early check-in - about 1pm - since we had our 2 kids with us and it was nap time. But when we arrived they didn't have our room ready so we had lunch while we waited. The food was fine, not quite hot enough, nothing to rave about and was very expensive - but it's a resort (and that's why we rent a house). Great restaurant staff though. Beautiful, spacious room. Very 'designed'. Our son loved the extra large, round chair and the fact that our room was right in front of the pool. The shower was excellent but the bathtub didn't really drain properly. We discovered one of the lights would not turn off, called for maintenance, they sent someone quickly, and they had to just unscrew the lightbulb.

The staff was helpful and friendly and our room was spacious and very comfortable. Unlike most W's that have pulsing \"club\" music and dim lighting throughout the property, this hotel was a bit more subdued and relaxed. The main pool got quite crowded during the day, but aside from that, we felt like we were the only ones on the property. We had one dinner and one breakfast at the restaurant on property, both of which were delicious, but very expensive and not \"local\" cuisine. We also played tennis, worked out in the gym, took a yoga class and relaxed in one of the many hammocks and double-width lounge chairs on the property. The caveat/complaint I had about the W is that it is located on the opposite side of the island from Esperanza, which is the main town in Vieques. This is NOT a dealbreaker, but you will need to rent a car if you want to eat off the property, which I would recommend. The restaurants in Esperanza are very good (especially El Quenepo) and provide a much better value for your money than the food at the W. You also will want a car to explore the many secluded beaches on the island as the beach at the W was pretty rocky and not good for lounging or walking on. Martineau Car Rental is right outside the property which we used for our trip and got a great deal on a Jeep Wrangler. Overall, this is the best hotel on Vieques and was a great home base for our stay on this hidden gem of an island.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arecibo, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best resorts in PR\u201d", "Author": "familyman80", "ReviewID": "UR118947218", "Content": "I stayed an extended weekend (Friday to Monday) to celebrate our 15 year wedding anniversary. I choose this place because I was not able to leave the Island on a special occasion and has received a lot of local publicity of been above the other resorts in Puerto Rico. Also, this hotel belongs to Starwood and I had some points available for use. I started booking Vieques Air Link (recommended by W personnel), their rate is half of the other two available airlines. The flight was eventless, leaving at time, with no hassle. Upon arrival you get to wait in a W lounge at the Vieques Airport. The lounge is in very good conditions, very comfortable. They have coffee (was cold!), ice, water, sodas, and rum bottles. The trip from the airport to the hotel is less than 5 minutes. Starting from the host at the airport all the way until leaving I received a lot of courteous care, politeness, and a warm contact with the resort personnel. This is a plus to this facility and a reason to return. Good Job! Pedro Jose (PJ) was amazing in his interest and continuous follow up on how things were going for us. Once there we decided to have something for lunch because we were hungry. At the bat we ordered sandwich and a wrap. They had the room already ready for us but we wait until finishing lunch and then headed to the room. The room was first floor with pool view (actually very close), a prime location. The room decor and layout are amazing, very modern style of a boutique hotel; round sofa with LCD TV, doorless shower with overhead discharge, a tub, all very well decorated and with great ambience, the right room to celebrate our anniversary. There is a fridge well packed, as well as non-refrigerated stuff (whiskey, vodka, olives, and martini glasses). The only situation with the room was that the first day the electronic door lock failed and between the evening and the next day morning we had several maintenance interventions to get it fixed. At all times they were on top of it. We never wasted vacation time because of this. Then apparently they time room housekeeping between 6-7PM and we got the service except in the toilet room. The next day after noon I called the lobby and when my wife return to the pool from the room was left amazed with the complete wash-down done to the whole room. At any time we felt been neglected by the hotel personnel. The pool is brand new design, like a cocktail pool, but probably three times longer than a typical one. They set two pools side by side, one higher so that water cascades into the lower level one. The pool is about 4' depth wall to wall, underwater music, lighting, etc. The pool decoration is not fancy feels very comfortable. There is a close-by bar and a hostess walking back and forth all the times. I recommend going with frappes or drinks, I asked for a very, very, very cold beer and I got a warm one. I kind goofed and didn't return to the hostess (I should had) and ended up asking for a glass with ice to pour the beer and choke it down. There are two beaches spots (one for adults only). The hotels beach is north and facing the Atlantic Ocean, therefore there is a lot of sway at the beach line. There are a lot of pebbles therefore walking requires maintaining equilibrium. There is a large slate of rock at the entrance to the water (along the whole beach line). About mid beach there is a spot with sand. Probably this is one of the few downers of the resort. I never went to the adult beach, but seems to be rougher that the other. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the beach. The location of the resort is amazing, the place is very well maintained, very beautiful a lot of places for pictures and relaxing. The lobby is fabulous, akin of a boutique hotel. Outside there is a fire lit after sun down, people gathers to talk and share. There is something that you will not get in any other resort in the Island: watch the stars and sky. The lack of illumination contamination makes the dark sky shine like you never seen before. It's amazing the hotel had not exploited this opportunity! You can get a decent telescope under $500 and they can self-train in astronomy 101 and show people an unforgettable event. In general, food and drinks are expensive. The place eateries are overseen by Chef Alain Ducasse. The food is very good, but not \"orgasmic\" good. I'll write a separate review on the eatery places I went. The eating in the main restaurant can be definitively enhanced to be at par to price. I had as a special occasion a \"Paradise Edge\" experience. They set at sunset a table for two on a very nearby ridge inside the property where you get a 5-course dinner with wine pairing. I have to admit that the location is outstanding, we had a great night, PJ served us and made the night extremely enjoyable. However, it's extremely overpriced considering what you really get ($639 including tax), setting emotions aside you can match other things as enjoyable as the experience (including additional nights there!). My feeling is that it was not enough fulfilling to state that I would do it again. Lastly, although we didn't plan going out of the resort, one night we went to a local restaurant and the hotel arranged transportation and worked extremely well (ask for Jorge) both ways. I was told to consider renting a car and I found out why on my last day. After checkout I had about 1-1/2 hours to spare and decided to go to Isabel II for souvenirs and lunch. Apparently during the day the taxi service is very unreliable. I was told that between noon to 200PM when the ferry arrives, there are no taxis interested. I got stuck in Isabel II for about 1hour (after finding that the place to have lunch was closed!) and had to be bailed out by hotel personnel. To wrap up, I'm considering this resort a place to come back", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cAmazing property, but needs a full time concierge.\u201d", "Author": "Amyowl", "ReviewID": "UR118393401", "Content": "My husband I visited the W Vieques for 5 days in September.

They waived the resort fee and reduced the night stay at the hotel. If you want that secluded feeling, this is the place to go. The wet pool was amazing, and we went swimming very late at night when it was less crowded. You can hear music under the water and it was quite relaxing to swim underneath the stars. They do have an adult beach where you have the option to bath topless, but we didnt go there. The other beach was in front of the wet pool and made for some good tanning and drinks. The food is expensive at the resort, but its to be expected. With that said, the lobster curry was delicious, and the filet was good too. I played this puzzle game in the lounge and was the first to actually solve it, and one of the staff members at the lounge bought me free drink for it.

The people are very friendly and gracious. And, overall, my husband and I had a wonderful trip. That said, the W Retreat and Spa was quite the disappointment. I was skeptical, after reading all of the previous reviews, about staying there. But, it appeared from the recent replies to on-line complaints, that the hotel was under new management and I was hopeful that things would have changed. And, it seemed that some things did change. And, while we encountered some issues that we overlooked early on (i.e., cleanliness of room), one particular issue was unjustifiable. We arrived Labor Day weekend, when the hotel was sold out. In fact, we flew into San Juan and stayed over night, due to the hotel being sold out on our arrival date. So, we experienced a completely sold out hotel for the first few days, followed by a desolate hotel stay. I must say, contrary to many of the other reviews, our best experience was when the hotel was sold out. The staff was friendly. Food and beverage service, pool side was fast, etc., etc. On day two at the \"W\", Labor Day; since the hotel was sold out, we opted to rent a Jeep Wrangler for the day and explore the beautiful island beaches. We had planned to hang poolside, when the crowds were gone the next day, to catch up on some much needed R&R. Big MISTAKE! Yes, just like the movie \"Pretty Woman\". When we arrived poolside, the trendy outdoor music that had been pumping all weekend, was non-existent. One guest, ultimately brought out her Iphone Doc to play music. But, the worst experience ever, was when management decided to close the poolside bar and food service down at 3:45 PM, just as I was ordering my first drink, -- due to \"LOW OCCUPANCY\"! Now, remember, this is a destination location, full serve retreat and spa and we were paying top dollar, to boot. My husband then walked over the the W Cafe to buy some beverages and snacks for the pool, and it too, was already closed at 4:00 PM. Needless to say, the \"complimentary\" 6:00 cocktail hour, never happened either. In fact, we never experienced the complimentary daily cocktail hour, ever. I, then, went inside to ask to speak with a manager about the situation and I was told that a manager was not available, but, they'd let someone know that I requested to speak with a manager. Say what!?! Not one single manager is available!?! My husband and I, reluctantly, packed up our stuff, went back to the room and ordered a rental car, for the remainder of the week. There were no refunds for early check out and/or exchanges in our charter flights that times, that brought us to this small, private island. In other words, any changes to our original reservations, were going to cost more than it was worth. In the meantime, after two hours went by and I still hadn't heard from a manager, I decided to get in touch with someone at Starwood's Corporate HQ. While on vacation! In addition to this last straw, I will say, now, that the rooms were never properly cleaned, either. On our first night, someone's old, bar of Oil of Olay soap was still laying on the shower ledge and an empty bottle of Bliss Sudsy Soap was lying under the bench, next to the bathtub. I scrubbed the black marks out of the tub, before my use. Throughout our stay, robes were never replenished, limited towels and toiletries were replaced, the balcony remained filthy and was never swept, the tub accumulated soap scum and sand, from my days at the beach -- I mean I have better service at home with a once a week housekeeper. And, with the theme of low occupancy, you would think that would have been a good time to put forth the extra effort, to do your job, value the guest and provide the finest service, in line with the rates at hand. We were not paying \"low season\" or \"low occupancy\" rates. Oh, did I mention that we stayed for FIVE days @ at a nightly rate of almost $500/night, with all of the resort fees, taxes, etc. I will say, that corporate responded to my e-mail, immediately, and directly to hotel management and put a fire under someone's butt. And, the response from management the next day, was immediate. However, we already rented a jeep and were off enjoying the beautiful day on a remote beach. When we got back to the room that afternoon, the room was thoroughly cleaned and everything was perfect. We were advised that the manager Greg, even inspected the room first hand. They even took the time to stamp \"W\" in the toilet paper. That was a first.... and last. But, sometimes, it's the little things that can make all the difference. Because, after that one day of what should have been every day cleaning; -- the cleaning of the room went right back to the way it had been. . . When we arrived back from the beach that afternoon, in addition to the room being impeccably cleaned, there was a lovely bottle of champagne and cheese and dried fruit spread sitting on the counter. We were very pleased and satisfied with the attention. What we didn't realize at first, but by the next morning, that the are where the tray was set down, it became infested with ants. We immediately set the tray outside our door and advised the cleaning staff as we left for the day the the room needed to be treated with some sort of bug spray. When we returned from our day at the beach, the tray, infested with ants, remained outside the door, until later that evening! It certainly was a nice gesture, but, one more headache and disappointment . . . I will say, that Iris, bent over backwards to try to make up for the horrific service and it was very much appreciated. She scheduled appointments for us at the spa the next day and comped our services, which was very gracious. She even came over to introduce ourself to us and ask if there was anything else that she could do for us. But, in reality, it was already too late. In the end, the overall experience left a very poor taste in our mouth and tarnished the Starwood Brand, for us, indefinitely. That is, until we spent the last evening of our journey at the St. Regis Bahia Beach resort in Rio Grande, PR. That place was exceptional and restored my faith in the Starwood brand. There is no excuse for the poor service and lack thereof we encountered at the W Veiques. We choose this place as our vacation destination, to celebrate out 15 year wedding anniversary. And, we could have gone any where in the world. But, as much as we loved the island, in the end, I can't say that we would ever return, unless another \"high end\" resort opens up. I commend management for taking action, AFTER corporate contacted them. But, I'm disappointed at the poor management decisions that were put in place to create such a horrific experience, to begin with. \"LOW OCCUPANCY\" is the worst excuse for poor service, ever! If you don't want to service your guests, due to low occupancy, then close the hotel, until high season, when you can get away with charging such rates. On another note, the food at the Alain Ducasse restaurant was average, to say the least. But, I won't get into that. We ordered three of the five/six signature items and they were basic, to say the least. Certainly not what one would expect from a celebrity chef's restaurant. Bottom line, experience Vieques Island, it's wonderful! The \"W\" hotel is the best place to stay, for now, but don't stay more than three days and demand the service that you expect and deserve. If you can't get satisfaction from hotel management, don't hesitate to call or e-mail Starwood's Corporate Office in New York. I'm sure the \"W\" hotel management will reply to this review, stating that they are very sorry and have taken all of these things into consideration and addressed them, moving forward. But, the decisions that were made are still unacceptable and NOBODY should ever have to experience what we did.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisc", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - a few low season glitches\u201d", "Author": "sfmonica", "ReviewID": "UR117999200", "Content": "I was a little concerned about what the service would be like given some past reviews, but we really experienced wonderful staff.

The spa was really relaxing and both my husband & I had excellent deep tissues massages with Rafael and Carla. We did not rent a car, but the hotel was always available to arrange \"publicos\" for us. I believe the only real glitches were a result of it being low season. The W lounge at the airport was no open for our arrival or departure and they seemed to be out of a few food choices (i.e. nutella, anything but white bread, etc.). Not really a big deal, but when you are paying a $60/night resort fee which supposedly includes the air conditioned airport lounge, it is a bit disappointing. Perhaps the resort fee should be lower during the low season? Also, just little things like running out of towels/water by the pool or less than attentive pool servers.

I went with my husband and 1 year old daughter. First of all there weren't many kids at all (just a handful) when we were there and it is mostly an adult retreat/spa. We made sure to keep our daughter well behaved and didn't stay out late with her. People were very friendly and we had a great time with our daughter. So don't worry the place is not overrun with kids. But it IS kid friendly if you need it to be. The location is perfect. Right on the water and there are 2 good beaches. The water was pretty calm when we were there and you could actually see some fish when you snorkeled. The pool area was beautiful and the water was warm and pleasant. There is also a bar at the pool and they take your drinks poolside. I read some reviews before going and while no place is perfect we were very happy with our stay. We thought the staff was friendly and accommodating and never had a problem. As far as some of the complaints like the one lady who was livid that her kids were exposed to \"nudity\" and threatened to involve her lawyer? That lady is crazy. There is an adults only beach which really only means no kids allowed and you can sunbathe topless. That's it. I doubt her room overlooked the beach to the point that all you saw was nudity all the time. The rooms are not that close to the water. That is ridiculous. Plus how old were her kids that she couldn't just explain to them the cultural differences and socially accepted practice of a topless beach? People are not having sex on this beach. Worst case you might see a breast. Big deal. Her attitude was a typical stuffy and prude American attitude. Get over yourself. And then her kids found sex toys or condoms or something in a drawer and she had a heart attack! Are you kidding me? Teach your kids not to go through drawers if they are that young and if they are older teach them about sex! I'm sure your kids didn't care much about the little sealed box in the drawer until you made a big deal out of it. Tell your kids it's for adults only and move on. Then the people that complained there were bugs. Yes you're in Puerto Rico. It's tropical and hot and there are bugs. I guess roaches are gross and I did see one in our room once but I smashed it with a shoe and moved on. The food and drinks are pricey but you're at the W. What do you expect? The water in the room is expensive. So DON'T open it. Buy your own somewhere else. Problem solved. Overall we had a great time. We thought the food was good, the location perfect, the rooms beautiful and the resort grounds were well kept and very pretty. We would definitely go back and recommend the resort to others. Oh and a couple of pointers about Vieques. Rent a car if you're going to be there more than 2 days. Take a snorkeling tour (I couldn't and am sad I missed out on some of the best snorkeling in PR). Do the bioluminescence tour. Don't take the ferry from Fajardo if you can help it. It smells, it's hot and crowded and runs LATE. We almost missed our plane because of it. It's cheap ($2.00) and you get what you pay for. Next time we will definitely take a short $28 flight.

And not to mention, the beach itself is absolutely gorgeous! - Amazing pool area: Two infinity pools are plenty for people to lounge around and sun themselves. It's extremely cool if you put your head underwater for the music coming out of the speakers! - Service poolside: Excellent. Very attentive and fast with drink and food orders. How can you beat drinking a pina colada poolside? - Complimentary drinks: Complementary cocktails served at 6pm. - Decor: The decor and layout here is very hip and trendy. The music is bumping and the main lobby & common areas remind me of a lounge / bar with the communal sofas and pool table. - Free shuttle: The hotel pays for your publico ride coming from the ferry station. And if you're a Platinum member, you get a free personal jeep service to the ferry station when you leave. CONS: - Service (rooms): After coming from St Regis where we had spot-on service, the W seems a bit lacking in that department. We had called to ask for additional toiletries and they never came. Called a second time, they said they tried to deliver it to the room and knocked on the door, someone came out and apparently didn't want the toiletries anymore. This all would've been fine if it had been true. None of us heard the knock and definitely no one opened the door - so either they were lying or they went to the wrong room, even though they should know the room number when they called AND I specifically told them our room number. - Room: We got a upgraded to a suite and at first was very happy with it. The decor was interesting and hip, the bed, and daybed were comfortable. We had a balcony as well, until we discovered a plethora of spiderwebs and little bugs out there. Granted, we were on a tropical island, but I was expecting those to be sweeped pretty frequently. Second and most importantly, we found 2 COCKROACHES in our room scavenging for food!! We called to complain and all we got was a \"sorry about that miss\" and a potential spraydown at the earliest the next morning. Well, we were only there for 1 night, so I must say, it wasn't worth having them come in. - Food: Expensive, but not as expensive as St Regis.

In addition to the outstanding property, I also give the very highest marks to the staff (in particular Lindsay Kelsheimer) who went out of their way to make sure that this celebration was memorable. The short plane ride from San Juan airport to Vieques was really cool. When we landed there was a W lounge right at the airport which was air-conditioned and stocked with cold drinks that we enjoyed while waiting for the driver to arrive. The W van dropped us at the front door and from there the magical experience began. I had exchanged several emails with Lindsay in the months leading up to our arrival and kept my fingers crossed the entire time that everything would come together. Sure enough, Lindsay was there waiting for me when we checked in so right away I took a deep breath and knew that everything was going to be OK. As my wife and friends made their way out to the fire pit/patio for a drink Lindsay pulled me aside and quickly reviewed all the plans we had made prior to arrival. She arranged for us to have a private fish fry and BBQ right on the beach one night, with a chef and wait staff that cooked us an amazing meal. She was also able to make a custom birthday cake which they brought to our table on our last night which was my wife's birthday. Lindsay also checked in with me periodically throughout our stay to make sure that everything was OK and to update me on some of the things that she helped to arrange while we were there (including an afternoon excursion to a private beach with a stopover in a small town right on the water for shopping and a few drinks). The final piece which really amazed me was that they were able to arrange for us to use a private room upstairs where I was able to connect my laptop to an overhead projector and show a music video I had made for my wife. This is another example of their Whatever/Whenever mentality. The actions spoke even louder than the words. I also have to compliment Jonathan Heath, the GM for the property. Despite being on vacation when I emailed him initially, Jonathan got right back to me and was able to arrange for all five couples to be situated in the same building. This was a nice touch. Jonathan also stopped by after-hours to make sure that I was able to get everything connected to show the video. Talk about exceeding expectations! Kudos also goes out to Iris Ortiz (Jonathan's Executive Admin assistant) and Tara Mullane (Catering Manager). Each of them were helpful in making sure that all of the arrangements and plans came off without a hitch. The end result was that my wife had a birthday celebration she will remember for the rest of her life. Our friends also had a blast and haven't stopped talking about it since we got back. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone who is looking for a relaxing trip where the facilities are first class and the staff is top-notch. Led by Lindsay, this group of people are totally customer-focused and would not rest until they were sure every detail had been attended to during our stay. As a result I will tell everyone about this tremendous experience.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort, but get off property as much as possible.\u201d", "Author": "erik48", "ReviewID": "UR116702151", "Content": "There's no question that the W is a spectacular property in terms of its design and hip, chic decor. From the private airport lounge to the main lobby, very spacious and well-appointed room, two pristine beaches and pool area, everything is beautiful and exceptionally well-maintained. The main restaurant, Mix on the Beach, was great, as were the bartenders at the pool bar. The airport lounge with complimentary snacks and beverages and a private concierge provides a warm welcome to the island while waiting for the resort van. Unfortunately, not so with the front desk. The staff is personable and welcoming enough, but the check in process we experienced was excruciatingly slow. The resort insists that an \"ambassador\" provide a tour of the property on the way to the room. We waited about 30 minutes for the tour and finally arrived at our room about 45 minutes after arrival. While it was nice to see where the gym and spa were located along the way, what we really wanted was to get to our room immediately, unpack and enjoy a beverage on the beautiful balcony overlooking the pool. The front desk always seemed to be understaffed. Check out was similarly slow. The front desk service was really just a minor irritation. In the complaint department, we really have only one - the $60 per day resort fee. The published room rates for the W are not at all unreasonable for a resort property of this quality, but the additional fee made this a poor value. Since we don't play tennis and didn't use either the spa or the gym, all we received for $60 daily was transportation to and from the airport - less than two miles away - and \"free\" wireless internet. That amounts to the most expensive taxi ride and internet access in the world. Adding insult to injury was the fact that the small bottles of water in our room were labeled $6. That's just gouging the guests. Had it not been for this incredibly tacky display of greed, I may not even be complaining. This is not to say we didn't enjoy our stay. We certainly did. It's most unfortunate, however, that we found absolutely nothing about the W that reflected the wonderful, unique character of the island of Vieques. It was the island, not the resort, that was the star of this visit - the beautiful, unspoiled, deserted beaches, the horses everywhere, the lively bars and restaurants along the main street of Esperanza, the bio bay, the warm, wonderful people and their stories...

I was assured that as a Gold-level SPG member, my request would be fulfilled, but when I arrived, they gave us a room with a King bed. I called the front desk, and they said that there are no guarantees for room requests, but they would switch me to a different room. Given that the hotel was only about 25% full and my status as a Gold member, I think they should have fulfilled my request the first time. This incident was pretty typical of our overall experience at the W. We would routinely have to wait at the front desk for 10 or more minutes to be helped. There was never anyone at the Away (aka Concierge) desk when we went there for help. The \"Whatever, Whenever\" line would frequently ring 10 or more times before someone answered. More like \"Whatever, Whenever We Feel Like It.\" Also, I don't think the floor in our room was cleaned the whole time we where there (4 nights). Given the lack of infrastructure on the island, and how much the W is charging, they also need to provide more services for their guests..such as a shuttle service to Isabelle Segund and Esperanza, car rental, and a concierge who is actually working to make arrangements for excursions, etc. The W is beautiful, but without improvements in the customer service, it's not worth the price.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful vacation at the tail end of \"off season\"\u201d", "Author": "SarahinBigD", "ReviewID": "UR116408327", "Content": "We had a lovely eight-day vacation at the W Vieques last November and cannot wait until our trip this coming November!

Their motto: \"Whenever, Whatever\" and \"What is your wish\" is totally false! Don't believe it. The problems started at check in. Apparently, they have two beaches, one they call the \"European Beach\" which means the topless beach and the other is the normal family oriented beach that we expect in the USA. We made our reservations through their hotel website using their reservation department just to make sure that nothing was messed up and no Expedia or other agents involved. We reserved and paid for two rooms at this very expensive hotel. The room locations have names such as \"Oasis\", \"Tropical\", \"Fabulous\" etc. We told the reservation specialist at the W that we wanted two ocean front, upper floor rooms and that we were traveling with kids. He was nice and gave the 'What is your wish\" line and the \"Whatever, Whenever\" talk and assured us that we would get the rooms we had just discussed. Arriving at the hotel everyone gives you the \"What is your wish\" line again, however, it is an absolute lie. We were shown where the pool is and the restaurant and what they call the \"Living room\". Then we were shown our room, on the first floor, not upper floor, and they were over looking the \"European Beach\". I explained to them that it was not what we had asked for and I do not want my children across from the topless/nude beach. Both rooms were across from the \"European Beach\". To top that, my daughter found a box of condoms, lubricants and massage oil, SUPPLIED AND PLACED THERE BY THE HOTEL, right next to the granola bar, cashews and almonds next to the refrigerator. I went to the very nasty reservation lady at the front desk and explained the situation and asked for different rooms. She was very rude and told us it was too bad! She said she was sorry that they had not explained the topless beach to us when we made the reservation. I asked for at least one of the rooms to be changed she refused. Meanwhile we had talked to other employees and they assured us that the hotel was only 60% full, we asked another employee and he said that they would only be full 45% the next day. I asked for the manager, the very nasty front desk lady said she was the manager. I asked for the owner of the chain and she said she did not have that information, I asked for the Starwood main number, she could not supply that. I asked to at least be moved the next night, she said they were 100% full and no one was checking out. She finally after much talk did offer us one room in a far away location It was very small, nothing like what they had charged us for, smelled, and had no views. She went on to explain that was where they put the \"cheap rooms\", and \"where they put the people who pay less\". I asked her for her name, and told her that she was exposing my children to nudity and sex objects. She and Starwood would be contacted by my attorney and guess what?! Just at that instant two rooms became available for the next night!!!! We were very stressed by the second day, not knowing whether she really meant it or it was another lie. We were finally moved, our bathroom smelled like urine, but the room was clean. Although these rooms were of a lower category than what we had paid for and reserved, we received no refund because their current rates were higher than when we had made our reservations. The hotel had a deserted feel to it, it was not a lively happy place. There were a few adults here and there and a couple of families with kids. Maybe it becomes more of an active and lively place on the weekends. I do not recommend this hotel for families unless you want your young daughter/son to find massage oil, condoms and lubricants right next to the M&Ms and the granola bars. The Management. Just. Does. Not. Care. Period. Exposing parents and children withour prior knowledge to nudity and sex objects MUST be illegal. But again, the management does not care about you or your kids! They do have a nice pool,the beach is very narrow. They do have a nice lounge at the airport with free drinks and apples, that is were the free sodas end. But I would rather have my daughter find only M&Ms next to the fridge and pay for my own sodas. If you do decide to stay here, make sure you have a very good attorney on call with his/her cell phone number handy, chances are you might need it! Do not believe their motto or their advertising. It should be illegal for them to put sex objects right next to the snacks. How many of us parents expected to look for such a thing and remove them before our kids look for the M&Ms? How often have any of us come across condoms, lubricants and massage oil in a hotel room?

The staff were professional, accomodating and knowledgable. Once we had a better idea of the resort, we immediately changed our plans and spent the remaining week in Vieques.

The food was good, there just wasn't much to choose from that time of night. The resort is located near the airport and has a very nice lounge to wait in before upon arriving and departing. Since the airport is without air conditioning, this was much appreciated. It only takes about 5 minutes to get from the airport to the resort. Check in was a breeze and we had no problem making dinner, spa or activity reservations. However, I heard this is not always the case when there is a retreat or conference going on - so double check this when you book! The resort has a beautiful pool and 2 gorgeous beaches set up with umbrellas and chairs. There are towels and water all over the place. One beach is adults only and I thought it had the softer sand and better swimming. That is where I spent most of my time. :) I booked a package at the spa and was shocked when I arrived 45 minutes early and found they have NO locker room, no sauna, no relaxation room, nothing. You wait in the lobby until your appointment and change inside your treatment room. So odd for such an expensive and seemingly high-end spa. Big mistake if you ask me. The treatments were incredible, though and the technicians really knew what they were doing. The gym is quite large for a hotel and well equipped. Everything is brand new. We played tennis each morning and the courts are in OK condition. Some leaves and water that could easily be taken care of. They also keep a basketball goal on the court that made it hard to play on one of the courts because one player could only back up so much. My husband actually tripped on it. What am I forgetting? Some very tiny gripes: 1) The ladies that work at the W Cafe are very rude. They were the only unpleasant employees we met all week. 2) The W Cafe sells almost nothing useful. Only tiny tubes of sunscreen and no bug repellent. But if you're looking for disgusting, shelf stable cheeses (no crackers though!), you're in luck. 3) Bigger room service menu 4) I wish they would put water and towels out on the tennis courts and keep them clean Overall an incredible experience, would love to go back. A very unique and special property for sure.

Another great perk is that they will pick you up at the airport and the lounge is quite nice to sit in while waiting for your plane. Unfortunately, the service was overall quite poor, particularly in the restaurant (which is the only place around to eat). On our first night, about 10% of tables were full but we were quite rudely turned away saying we need a reservation (front desk should have mentioned that) and we sat outside instead. The restaurant never filled up, and we were out on the patio all evening. You can order from the full menu outside though, so I'd actually recommend sitting near the fire pit to eat. We had two other very poor service experiences in the restaurant during our three day stay. Forgotten/missed orders, cold food, incorrect orders, lack of service, etc. It is such ashame that the W hasn't been able to iron out their service problems, because it is nearly perfect otherwise.

We were returning after 5 years and were interested what the 'W' make over had done. From a design point of view it has had a lot of work done. I do not personally think that the ultra modern design fits naturally with beautiful and rural surroundings, but it is not badly designed by any means. The rooms are a little quirky, with the bathtub being in the middle of the room. I am guessing they are not that well used. The rooms are quite minimalist and not that comfortable (Excluding the fab beds of course). The mini bar is expensive (no surprise) but it is also not replenished. when the local beer is $5 a can and a shop 200 yrds down the road sells it for less than a dollar you would think they would work hard not to make guests look for alternatives. We had ants in our room, they kept themselves to themselves but not very nice and opening the balcony doors let a lot of bugs in and we were quite badly bitten (Not that the hotel can do anything about the bugs, but just a warning). There was also a wedding which played loud music, it stopped at 11pm but we were on a early to bed, early to rise routine as we like the morning cool (One of the reasons we stayed at a 'retreat and spa'), so it was annoying as it was right outside our room. The $60 resort fee perplexed me, I am not sure what it is for. Towels, wifi and tennis I think, (Free in most places) why not just add it on to the room charge and not treat guests like idiots. (A new favourite trick from Starwood hotels) Finally on the gripes, the Alain Ducasse restaurant is simply not as good as many of the independent restaurants on the island and is the most expensive. It is ordinary food at a premium price. On the positives, the sun loungers in the water are very relaxing and have amazing views over the ocean. The staff are polite, some are very helpful (some need some more training though). The gym is great and provides yoga sessions (That I am happy to pay for). The two beaches are nice, with one an adults only beach. At night the resort looks spectacular and the bar scene is very relaxing as the main building literally removes its walls and people gather on the deck in a variety of outdoor furniture including an outdoor fire surrounded by cushions.

Who knew that they'd have to be made in blood? My mother always told me to be sweet and that it wasn't inherent in my nature but the 37 mosquito bites on my body tell a different tale. My friends and I joked that they used me as a shield during our nearly week-long stay on the island. The W was my savior and sanctuary. After battling floor-to-ceiling windows, flying cockamouses, giant centipedes and outdoor showers in our gorgeous Bravos Boys housing - Bungalow 180 - located in the middle of Vieques, I started to feel light-headed from the blood lost and the adrenaline rushes from encountering man-size insects (I think I saw one fly off with a horse). I made the executive decision to vacant our truly gorgeous but very open rental house for the safety, I mean comfort, of the W Vieques. As a loyal cult member of Starwood and especially of the W brand, I know that Whenever, Whatever is bible to the employees. I just didn't expect it to apply to the employees themselves. Many people have complained about the slow service but in the vein of your annoying friends who go to an island and get into the spirit of things, I say, relax mon. Yes the service is slow but where do you have to go? You're stuck on a gorgeous island and the last thing on your mind should be deadlines. And this is coming from a New Yorker who will mow you down in the streets if you stop to look up at buildings. Perhaps I have Stockholm Syndrome as I checked in at 11pm, desperate for a long shower from my extremely dirty and mosquito-ridden bioluminescent bay tour (worth it!) but still needing to arrange for a roll-away bed. Just when I gave up on them bringing me one, 45 minutes later a rap on the door resulted in gratuitous thanks from myself. I felt like the service at the W is like a mediocre boyfriend, you're more grateful when they actually do what they are supposed to. The friendly employees will get you that toothbrush and bring you those toiletries; they wait is just so you're super happy to get it when it finally does come. Or pissed as in some cases. The rooms are separate from the stunning lobby. The decor of the property itself from the rooms to the pool is just exquisite - a true upscale resort feel. And most importantly, the mosquitoes are few and far between (inside). I had an ocean-front room with a deep, retro tub in the middle of my room. The circular couch was fun and comfortable and I fell asleep to the sound of waves. I do agree that the beds do not feel like the W beds I've slept on so many times. It was not as plush and definitely harder. The cleaning service also leaves a little to be desired. The room was clean but slightly sandy. The showers are fitted with rainhead showers and a sliding wooden door offers a rustic privacy. My ocean-front room with a balcony was gigantic. A roll-away bed fit in there with room to spare. Tip: the W also offers double roll-away beds if you get a King Room and need extra beds. I tried the W Cafe and here is where service fell beyond even the island relaxed standards of time. Getting three pre-made sandwiches became an excruciating process. I left my sunglasses upstairs and was able to go back to my room, get my things and still wait another 15 min (30 min total) for the transaction of already made food! And we were in a hurry this time to adhere to a wedding schedule. I think I ripped my bag of chips out of the cashier's hands before he could even get it over the counter to me. If you're thinking about getting married at the W Vieques, I say go for it girlfriend. This was the sixth wedding I've attended this year (and it's only May!) and it was by far the most romantic. None of the 60 guests thought about mosquitoes though we dined in long tables next to the pool outdoors. Instead, we concentrated on the lobster curry and other amazing dishes from Chef Alain Ducasse. The service during the dinner and reception was stellar. Not an empty wineglass or dirty plate sat for more than a minute before the surprisingly efficient wait staff took care of it. The ambiance was incredible - thousands of candles, fresh flowers and water everywhere. We topped things off with an ice cream bar and later, a late-night nacho bar! A wooden deck off to the side offered ample space for dancing. Halfway through the couple's first dance, brilliant fireworks lit up the sky! Incredible work from the W to celebrate the union of my friends. Wet (the W Pool) is always open 24/7 so what could be more fitting than a jump in the pool after dancing? As many weddings happen at the W and I'm sure many guests have the same idea of a late-night dip, I highly suggest requesting a room on the ocean side. Noise travels and we weren't loud, but we weren't quiet by the pool either. The next morning, the W offered complimentary transfers to the airport. Here, island time became an issue as our driver waited a long time for other guests who were sharing our ride making us anxious for our flights but we made it there with plenty of time to space. My impatience was punished when I left my anti-itch medicine behind in the van. Ultimately, if I had to do it all over again, I would have stayed at the W the entire time. It was a pleasant experience but I would definitely want to have gone with a significant other.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, but...\u201d", "Author": "tigergrad00", "ReviewID": "UR110426270", "Content": "We stayed here one night (our anniversary) because we stayed at a friends vacation house the rest of the time and overall our experience was great!

That same day the hotel was real busy and you notice only two waitress serving the pool they were working like crazy with the amount of order going their way, we waited 35 minutes for two sangrias and ask the waitress what was happening and she roll her eyes and told me to many people and not enough employees. That night the same waitress were in the lobby with another one trying to serve 20-30 customers who were there including us an she never got around to serve us (we took off again). We also notice that the room maid only broom the room, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mop them at all, did not check the shower to see if shampoo or soap is needed, did the bed, change a few towel and if you run out of one size of towel good luck seeing that size again, make a few call for more towels and soap. The third day we sat in the hotel restaurant to have dinner, it took 15 minutes to serve us water and we never saw the waitress we just got up without being attended and left, nobody even notice and we went outside the property to eat (we went eating outside every night because of the bad service in the hotel restaurant). The last day we went to breakfast early to beat out the rush, we got our breakfast real fast but the eggs were under cook again we did no complain that time because we were tired of it, but this is a very expensive hotel for things like that to happen.

First of all, let me tell you that I travel a lot (and like high end places) and I am a huge fan of the W brand. I had looked forward to my stay in the W Vieques, and I did have a very nice holiday. However, would I go again after having visited the resort ? Probably not, because I was not WOW-ed at all. First, the pros : - very clean resort grounds with a very nice pool area - nice, spacious and trendy rooms (as one would expect from a W hotel) - excellent and friendly staff - the outdoor campfire in front of the lobby is a nice touch All in all a very nice 4+ star hotel in my opinion. But, there were some contras : - no matter how nice the resort was, I did not have the feeling at all of being in the Caribbean. The vegetation on the resort is not lush at all (maybe it is still immature) and the 2 beaches - although taken well care of - are not your typical exotic dream beaches. In fact, you have to go to other side of the island to convince yourself that your are in a tropical hideaway. - the restaurant does encounter too many problems (we were there in November ; maybe things worked out since then). Service was too slow (and we are Europeans, so used to slow service), one evening they forgot the meal of my partner, the menu is too limited, and portions rather small. Food is very good (but not memorable). Of course, nothing stops you from eating in a restaurant outside the resort, but still, a hotel that claims to be 5 stars should have an excellent trouble-free restaurant. However, I am confident that the restaurant will be solved in the future. - what would really have added some extra value for me, would be the presence of some outdoor hottubes, so that one could take a dip after sunset (like most high end beach resorts have these days). Don't take me wrong. I loved my holiday. And I liked the resort.

We have been to several islands and many luxury hotels and this place had such a wonderfully luxurious, but laid-back vibe that we loved. We would return in a second if we could. We stayed at the resort the first week of May, which apparently is a shoulder/off season, and therefore, thankfully missed many of the crowds that were there just a week or two prior. Maybe that helped to ensure we were better taken care of, because we had amazing service the entire trip. Some people who were particularly great were Imelda, Bree and Rodrigo at the front desk, Mari in the restaurant, a cute petite woman at the bar/living room in the evenings whose name has escaped me (apologies), Ricky, and the crew at Blackbeard Sports who helped us with our gear and diving needs. Others were very good, too, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always remember to get names. The grounds are beautiful and we loved the main pool. We had no wait at check-in and received a great tour of the property. Our room was spectacular (pretty sure that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also what it was called) :) and overlooked the ocean and pool. It was very large, had a great balcony and that horse trough tub which was wonderful for a long soak. I loved all the little decorative hooks on the wall to hang your clothes, beach bags, etc.- very nice touch. I think my only small complaint was that we never seemed to have enough shower gel for all the showers we take on beach vacations-ha. Another nice touch is the free water (with citrus fruits) all over the property. We thought that most of the food was wonderful. Breakfasts were always great. We ordered the buffet once, but since we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tend to eat so much in the morning, we started ordering off the menu and that was much better. Some of the best dishes are only available from the menu. Dinner there was also great both times we went- the specials, in particular, were always perfect. We also recommend going to dinner off-site- there are some really great restaurants on the island (which we found, of course, by reading the tripadvisor forums). We only did lunch a couple of times and they were pretty good- salads and sandwiches. Not too heavy which is great when by the pool. Oh- and the smoothies/shakes are great! The folks at reception were helpful in setting up our biobay tours and anything else for which we needed assistance (restaurant reservations, etc.) And everyone was so friendly. We really felt we had received great service the entire trip. Also, we always dig the music played at W Hotels and one expects that as part of their brand. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hip, loungey feel and the Vieques resort seemed to also have an added island vibe to the music. It was perfect for us when laying by the pool or in the living room. But if that is not your scene, you may not enjoy it as much. But you should know that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the W experience. We did yoga two mornings and really enjoyed it. The rest of the days we used the fitness center which met all of our workout needs (weights and cardio). We also had some spa time (massages and mani/pedi for me) and enjoyed all of it. Really great people in the spa- so friendly. As for the rest of Vieques, definitely try to rent a jeep/car! We read all the forum posts and got one for a few days. It made a great difference to be able to drive to the beautiful Caribbean beaches (particularly those little ones where barely anyone else is- so lovely), to tour the rest of the island, and be able to dine off the resort. Yes, you need to book the jeep very early- as soon as you book your stay. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely worth it for a few days. All in all, our Vieques trip was amazing.

We arrived at the airport, were met by a van rather quickly, and arrived around 2:00. It had been a long day, and the wait to get to our room after check-in was quite long and I wished they had just let us walk there ourselves and not made us wait for the guided tour. However, the grounds are beautiful and the staff is accommodating and lovely. Our room was fine - we didn't have a view, but then again, it was quiet and close to everything. I do wish they had explained that we needed to put our room key into the charge outlet to get the electricity to come on because it was pretty dark! We headed to the pool as soon possible. It was busy that day, and it took awhile to get our food order at the bar, but it was so gorgeous outside that it was easy to be forgiving. We didn't rent a car, so we needed to take a taxi (not individual, but a publico) in the lobby to get to our dinner reservation. All went fine until we tried to get back and the driver never responded. It seems they have specific drivers that they call upon, though some people we spoke to had arranged their own transportation. If I were visiting more than a few days, I'd definitely rent a car so I could have visited many of the Caribbean beaches - apparently that needs to be done months in advance. After an hour wait, and 3 phone calls to the hotel, we made it back. but again, it's the island and it was warm and beautiful outside, and the wait wasn't so bad. The next morning we went to the cafe for coffee and pastries, (not realizing there was complimentary coffee in the main \"living room\" ). We spent much of the day on the beach, which we found to be great. Most people gravitated to the pools, and it seemed that they also plopped their beach towels on the most coveted floating lounge chairs quite early even if they were nowhere in sight, pretty tacky. There weren't many children there; I don't think I would want to have had young kids there - not a lot to do for them, and when they take over the pool, it is kind of annoying if you're there to relax. It was mid-week, so it wasn't as busy as it appears to have been on the week-end. Only once did we need to move our chairs to the end of the beach where there wasn't a speaker in our ears with the resounding bass so often complained about in reviews. We took a kayak out and also took advantage of the inner tubes. It was glorious to bob in the soft waves. The bar staff was great - as was the red sangria. We also enjoyed the solitude of the plunge pool. My favorite time was 7 a.m. once I knew I could grab some coffee and just sit and enjoy the quiet and the view of the ocean. We had a glitch with our biobay reservation, but the concierge was accommodating and made it right. I truly think they want to do the best for their guests, but sometimes island time and lack of resources may prevent that from happening 100%. When we were there, there was a gas shortage, and one of our publico drivers told us he had been up at 4 a.m. to get gas. I did find that different staff gave different advice, and that was confusing at times. But all in all, our stay was glorious. We ate at the breakfast buffet one day, no complaints there, and mostly just enjoyed the beauty of the island. We also took a public to Playa Caracas one day - the place was hopping as it was Holy Week and the locals were partying. It was great to witness the culture, maybe like coming to the states on the 4th of July. I do think they are reading these reviews, because there was a sunset \"happy hour\" with free cocktails from 6 - 6:30, and the music was only intrusive one time.

Our trip was absolutely perfect in every way thanks to all the info I found on this site! About the W, we really enjoyed the property! The grounds are beautiful, the room was fantastic, and the staff simply outstanding! Because of some of the reviews I'd read about the music being too loud, I specifically requested a room away from the pool area. We ended up in one of the villas that overlooked the adult beach. It was perfect. I was a bit worried about the funky chair in the room being unusable based on some reviews I'd read, but I found it to be a great place to lounge and read a book after a sunny day on the beach! The only thing I would change was the chairs on the balcony - they were very uncomfortable. I finally pulled a big pillow off the funky chair and it made the balcony chair a little more comfortable. We only ate at Mix for breakfast. We avoided it for other meals due to the reviews here, however we did have a salad and a burger at the pool which comes from Mix, and it was quite good. The staff were fantastic...really wonderful people who worked very hard to please their guests. The Black Beard store had a great deal on a get-away kit - 2 beach chairs, 2 straw mats, an umbrella, and a cooler for $30. It was everything we needed to go to the beach. We did it for 4 days, and got a discount of $25 a day. One of the days we picked up some food at the W Cafe for our trip to the beach. It was good food - fine for going to the beach. It was convenient, but we found better food in Esperanza to take with us. The pool area was beautiful. We must have been on the island during a lull between spring break and easter because the pool and the beaches were never crowded. I do agree, however, with many of the reviewers here about the music at the pool. It's just unneccesary. I don't know why they pipe it in...I suppose it's to create a certain vibe, but really I think most people would prefer to listen to the ocean or their own preference of music on their iPods. My only negative really was something that was my fault. My husband and I thought it would be cool to do a couples massage. We made the reservation and I didn't even ask how much it would be. I figured it couldn't be much more than $80-90 per person. I usually pay $60-70 on cruises so figured it wouldn't be much more. BIG MISTAKE! The massage area was nice, it was relaxing although I've had much better massages elsewhere. But the real shock was when we checked out afterward...it was $300!!! That's about $150 per person...before tip. What an outrageous price for a sub-par massage. I should have known better...I know that resorts like this charge exorbitant prices for different things...I should have asked. Speaking of exorbitant...the bottles of water in the room are $6 a bottle - for a Fiji bottle - maybe 12 ounces! How ridiculous is that. But, like I said...that's pretty standard at resorts like this. I just don't know who would ever pay $6 for a bottle of crappy Fiji water. We went to the local grocery store and bought a 12-pack of Aquafina for $5.80. It lasted us nearly the week and then we just filled them up with the hotel water. All their water is filtered and tasted as good as Aquafina. So, overall - fantastic time. We are already discussing our next trip back. If we go just the two of us, we'll definitely stay at the W. We'd like to bring our near-adult kids - they'd love Vieques - but if we do that, we'll find more reasonable accomodations... Lastly, I'll add some non-W-specific info to this review. Don't miss the biobay...amazing. Get a jeep - it's the only way to explore and experience the island...truly I asked many locals where they like to eat several told us about a place on 997 maybe 1/2 mile past the hospital and firestation called El Resuelve. It was awesome...authentic PR food. It's not listed here on Tripadvisor, so thought I'd mention it here. Go to as many beaches as you can. They each have a different personality. You'll find the perfect one for you. If you're looking for nightlife - there is some to be had but only on the weekends.

WOW! - I really felt like I was in paradise. Our room was huge with a king sized bed and a balcony - the view from the balcony was like a postcard. We stayed there for 5 days and each day was an amazing experience. The pool bar staff Monica, Billie or rather were fun and made amazing pina coladas! Bree the manager at the front desk was very accommodating and friendly. The staff at Mix on the beach gave the best service where our dining experience was one to remember. We didn't have a reservation and the place was fully booked because Alain Ducasse was there that night but the hostess made sure that we had a table. We had the 5 course taster and it was so delicious (the shrimp cocktail was so good, we had it each time we had dinner there). And yeah, the chef Alain Ducasse was standing right next to our table- very cool! Oh, and the Chakra spa was heaven! I got an hour massage by Karla (I think that's her name) and she was so good, I fell asleep after 10 minutes. After the massage, I was able to shower outside but it was totally private! I loved it!!!! There is also a gym on the property that offers yoga at 8am and 5pm. There's also the W Cafe next to the gym where you can buy pastries, coffee, cigarettes, etc. This was a good find because breakfast at Mix was $38 a person but coffee in the Living Room is free and the pastries at W Cafe is like $4. There are also two beaches: one is called Whisper Beach (Adults Only) and the other the beach for adults and kids. You can kayak on the beach but you have to go to Blackbeards (next to the gym) to get the ores - one hour is free! We rented a Jeep at Maritzas rental that the concierge arranged for us so we were able to explore the island on our own. But if you're not the adventurous type, the W has a van that takes guests daily to Caracas beach (Red beach) from 10:00 am - 4pm. You can also book the Biobay tour (Abe's Snorkling) at the concierge. This tour is amazing!!! If you don't do anything else outside of the W Retreat, please do the Biobay tour as it will totally blow your mind. The trip to Mosquito Bay (Biobay) is a little bumpy as the roads are not paved and very rocky but I think it's part of the adventure. We were sad to leave the W and Vieques. I'm going to miss the the beaches we visited especially the one beach where my partner and I were the only ones there when we visited -- an entire cove for ourselves! Oh, and there's also the Secret Beach or Pata Prieta - love this beach and the 5 fish that played with us all day! LOL.

Fantastic. Also, we found a jeep to be essential. We wanted to explore the island and there are a lot of roads that are unpaved and have deep holes that resemble moon craters. I wouldnt begin to imagine how you would navigate the island by taxi or moped. Jeeps run about $80 a day.

Most would be not an issue at properties that were of a lesser class or cost, but since you hold that W experience to be at the top of the Starwood food chain, then they would be worth mentioning. (A) The pool \"confusion\" over where one can sit and one can not. We were asked (politely) to move our location at the pool on one day and saw that others were asked to if somebody had reserved (paid more for) a cabana and were promised the lounge chairs in front of it .. Awkward for staff and confusion for guests (Maybe RESERVED signs on chairs would help?) The Lap Pool was sometimes overtaken by folks swimming laps for a period of 30, 45 or 60 minutes yet other wanted to cool off and were not sure if they were allowed in this large pool ...those swimming laps continued forth and even bumped into people in their routines. (Maybe time allotments in the AM/PM for those who do this for more than 15 minutes,30 minutes?) (B) Complexity of room key and lighting . The person who took us to our room was not too clear about how the key worked and the locks on the doors. We ended up asking for help the first day to not only use the lights but also to lock / unlock the sliding door and the safe box. (Maybe a simple , detailed info card left in the room to go over these areas for guests would help?) (C) The DAYS events in the lobby... We wre not sure on occasion what ,when , where on the W Hotel events of the day. (Maybe a more visible board of those items?) (D) Dining room service by food staff. I do not have to tell you about this. I am sure it will only get better but waiting for coffee one morning for almost 30 minutes is not acceptable at ay hotel or resort, especially the W . (E) The rental car scenario is one that I know you are working on. I managed to procure one but had to call over 60 days in advance of our visit..and even then at Martineau outside the property I ended up with a larger Jeep than I certainly wanted and paid more money ($90 per day) than I pay in any major cvity in the US. I guess I am to be happy that I at least got a car? If I had been able to get a smaller Jeep, I would have been happier and actually saved over $100 in fees! (F) Lack of a Happy Hour? One of the things that appealed to Mary & I on Islands like ARUBA was the daily presence of a \"happy hour\" at the beach bar or at least one location on the property. Paying $13/$14 for a mixed drink all the time can be a little steep and often drives people to other locations and lounges \"off property\"..especially those that put the bulk of their cost into the travel/ the room/ the car/et Even with the above items, we both found the staff, the quality of the food and the architecture of both our room and the property to be First Class all the way. It is a beautiful place and a wonderful island. We will strongly consider a return visit to Viequez and to the W when the opportunity presents itself. We wish you and the staff , especially Robert at the pool bar, a wonderful season and hope that we see you again in the future.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pfaffikon, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201coutstanding hotel!

I will sum it up by saying the W is like Ikea. It looks good on the surface, but when you get down to the heart and soul of the place it is just a cheap imitation. Food was okay. Very American menu without much creativity and few vegetarian options. Service was slow and inconsistent. Usually one server for everyone at two pools. The two times we ordered from room service they got the order wrong. We waited over an hour for dinner on the patio with many apologies from the server. When it finally arrived our children wanted to go to sleep so most of the dinner was wasted. The amenities were mediocre for a hotel of that class. No washcloths in the hotel. The hair dryers were tiny and cheap. Pay-per-view was down the entire visit. The good things - The location was outstanding. Beautiful view, gorgeous pool and beach. The water - The hotel provides chilled water throughout the grounds flavored with lemons or melon etc. It is so nice to have a tasty option to bottled water. The truth is there is no other 4 star hotel that isn't adult-only on the island so you are left with few choices. In the end we had a nice vacation because the other guests were friendly and laid back.

Overall the resort is very nice but not one I'd return to time and time again when traveling to the Caribbean. For fellow SPG members- we got a great deal on the room and it's a nice option if you're looking for a more secluded Starwood property than those in San Juan and on the main island. We had an ocean view room in one of the buildings surrounding the pool; view was great and the room itself was very clean. The service was excellent and the staff was friendly and attentive. The major negative was out of their control, the weather. Hurricane Tomas came through a few days before our stay so our days were very cloudy and rainy. Our bio bay tour was canceled and we were unable to do a lot of the outdoor activities we were hoping to. The prices were also high, but not out of the realm of what you'd expect traveling to a Caribbean resort. Some suggestions: Grab dinner outside the resort. I am a picky eater to begin with but I found the food options to be boring and monotonous. The local restaurants are fabulous and no more than a 15-20 cab ride away. While there we ate at Trade Winds (Esperanza) and Conuco (Isabel Segunda), both of which were excellent. If you're looking for authentic Puerto Rican cuisine Conuco is a great option. We didn't make it to Coconuts or Next Course but several people also staying at the resort said they were very good. Rent a car for the day (or two) and visit the beaches. They are known to be some of the most beautiful in the Caribbean. We did this on our last day (after the bad weather ended) and visited Red Beach- it was stunning! Just watch out for all the wild horses; you will encounter plenty in your travels around the island. Get to the pool early for a coveted lounge chair in the water.

We booked it using points, and had read the reviews on the site warning us of the inconsistencies to be expected, so we went in with eyes wide open. I think it's easier to list what was good, and what was not so good: What we liked: The property is beautiful. There are two beaches - one is adults only. Both were empty during our stay. Breakfast was excellent. They had a breakfast special daily that changed and was always made with the freshest ingredients and a lot of times had some local flair. I'm not a huge breakfast eater and it was definitely my favorite meal of the day. We liked our room - we booked an oceanfront Fabulous room - so we were on the second floor overlooking the adult beach. It was comfortable and well appointed. Rather than having to pay for every single drop of water you want to consume, there are water coolers around the property with fruits or citrus in them, and glasses. As someone who drinks a lot of water, this was a nice touch. The lounge in the airport is lovely, and can be used both upon arrival and departure. The W cafe provides a nice alternative when you just want a quick snack or meal on the go. The gym was very well appointed and clean. There was a great little shop where you could get beach chairs and towels to go on a day trip to some of the better beaches on the island. They set us up beautifully for a reasonable price with cold drinks, and a cooler. The spa was great - but probably could have used more seating for waiting in between treatments and relaxing. The island of Vieques itself is an untouched gem. It's a pity the W is the only big resort in town - I'd love to go back and stay somewhere else - there aren't a lot of other options though. I say this below, but RENT A CAR. You must book early to secure one - the day you book your trip is advisable. The concierge was great. We worked with two ladies who walked us through a map of the island with advice on where to go, what to see, where to eat. They were terrific. What we didn't like: The music. Or, as one could say, all the noise, noise, noise, noise, noise. I don't know if it is a W thing, but they have speakers around the property spaced at about every 5 feet playing trance music. You can't really find a quiet spot in the entire resort. It absolutely blew our minds that you're in a gorgeous setting with the waves crashing, and music is being piped in basically 18 hours a day. It's not super loud, but I just really prefer peace and quiet, and I know many of the guests felt similarly, as I was not the only guest that repeatedly asked for the music to be turned down or off. You can't sit by the pool without music. At these prices, turn down service should be a non-negotiable. It was available but you had to ask for it *every* single night. We had a room on the quiet side of the resort. I specifically requested this in advance. If you book a room that is close to the pool, I can't imagine how you could get a moment of peace without hearing the previously mentioned music that is always playing. With that said, there is one side of the resort that is quieter, and that is where we stayed. However, it was close enough to the lobby area that when the bar was open late, we could hear the base coming from the main building - and there happened to be an event that same night that was apparently offsite but at a volume level where they eventually had to call the police in. That's certainly not the resort's fault - but the noise level within the resort was definitely within their span of control, and it was just one more issue with the noise pollution issue. We did complain about our displeasure and the hotel did give us a \"Whoops\" credit which we did appreciate, so I did feel that we were listened to, but the overall issue remains and I can only imagine who is directing the music playing. The restaurant (only one for dinner) was fine. But just that. It's expensive and you'd think you'd be getting more at those prices and with big names attached to the meal. It was not memorable. The pool staff needs some serious coaching. They all have attitudes that should be found at a hotel that costs $99 a night on Miami Beach where you're just trying to save some cash. This is not a cheap hotel, and the pool staff was sloppy, kind of rude and neglected basic things like clearing of dishes, tidying of the pool area, etc. It just seemed like it was not being watched at all. The whole team needs to be retrained, if not replaced entirely. We had fun, and enjoyed our time there mostly because we were fully prepared for some issues based on these reviews and since we were paying with points, it wasn't money out of our pocket. I would have been much more unhappy had we been paying $700 a night. The foundation of a fabulous resort is there but I recommend management go stay in a better managed property for a few nights (try Parrot Cay, Turks & Caicos) and see what it really is all about when you have staff that works together and when you're creating an ambiance that caters to your guest and not some vision that an apparently singular individual is trying to create. The guest population was all old enough to not be that interested in a \"scene\" and I felt like that's what this hotel was trying to pretend it was.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morgan, Utah", "Title": "\u201cSo Lovely and So Inconsistent\u201d", "Author": "AndreaJ100", "ReviewID": "UR101263925", "Content": "Loved the location.

There was so much negativity about how bad the horse poop, bugs and beaches were that I was so bummed. However, I loved this vacation! The W is absolutely gorgeous. They spent $157 mil on a 2 year renovation and nothing was spared! Our room was the most the most aesthetically pleasing I have ever stayed in. It is ultra modern and so chic. I took pics of everything on the property for my own design needs to replicate. I am a fitness person and the gym they had was the best I have ever seen in a hotel! They have yoga at 8am and 5pm everyday as well. They have free snorkel gear and kayaks for guests. The W is very expensive (like $38 for weekday breakfast brunch buffet and $13 drinks) so I suggest you go to one of the little stores and buy snacks and liquor/beer and drinks. The fruit/veggie market is every Tuesday and Wednesday right down the road so you can get healthy items there but get there early! My favorite restaurants on the island are: El Quenepo, Coconuts in Isabel, Next Course, a truck on the side of the road on the way to the beaches called Sol Food has the best gourmet like, healthy food I have eaten out of a truck stand, Salads at Trade Winds (just beware of Dotty, the surly server, as she actually was the reason we never went back), Cafe Violeta for rustic out door breakfast dinning. The scuba diving is ok and the outfit we went with was Nan Sea Charters and they did a great job! Love those guys! The bio bay tour is a must! Such a unique experience. All the outfits are about the same so no preference here. No night life that we found on the island (but we weren't looking) except what is at the W. You must rent a car (and pay their outrageous prices) to thoroughly enjoy the island but they do have the publico that will come get you and take you wherever you want to go. I had to call 8 places about a month before my trip and there were only 2 with 1 car left. Soooo, make sure you can get a car before you even book your flight if that is something important to you (martiniques is right across the road from the W so logistically the easiest place to pick your car up). We used Coqui and they were great. They took us back to the W after we dropped the car off at the end. There is no need to get 4x4 as the island is flat and any off the beaten path beaches are reached by boat. Speaking of flights, Cape Air was a nightmare to fly. They just are too busy and have not got the kinks out. I will do another airline the next time I go back. The ferry is even worse from what we heard from the locals. The people on the island are so lovely! They come from everywhere and seem to just fall in love with the place and move there.

Prior to travelling to Vieques, we read everything we could find from history of the island and the people to resort reviews both positive and negative. We arrived at the International Airport and opted to take the ferry to the island. We had the most wonderful driver, her name is Ilca (--), take us to the ferry launch. We had read that it was a very long and expensive ride... Our experience was that it was a delightful ride of about 45 minutes and was priced less than the cab fares we have paid in NYC. During the drive, Ilca gave us a lot of great history of the island and told us about some things that were \"absolute must do's!\" like the rain forest and old town San Juan. The ferry ride was great! For $2 each, we enjoyed what was a 45 minute ferry ride to Vieques. Enrique, from the W, met us in Isabella II as soon as we arrived. He was fantastic! A smiling face and great conversationalist that told us about the W and things to do on the island. The short 15 minute ride to resort was nice. We were surprised to see all the wild horses roaming around on the island. When we arrived at The W, our \"Ambassador\" Luis, was fantastic! Our check-in took only a minute... Luis gave us a great tour of the resort and then took us to our \"Spectacular\" room that was overlooking the pool with a great view of the ocean! The pictures on the W website very accurately if not under estimate the beauty and comfort of the rooms and facilities. The taxi or shuttle service to Isabella and Esperanza was great! Inexpensive at only $10 each way... One day the taxi driver took us all the way to Blue Beach! An absolutely wonderful place for snorkeling and swimming! The sea life was absolutely beautiful! We rented a Jeep from Maritza's Car Rental. I highly recommend that you rent a Jeep and venture out to see the island. The island is small enough that you can really see it all! We went to the old Navy artillery bunkers, Green Beach, Blue Beach, Secret Beach, drove through the mangroves... and went to what became our favorite spot, Navia Beach! You will find that the ocean water on the Caribbean side of the island is much clearer and less choppy than the Atlantic side. We ate at a different restaurant each night. We loved the fun atmosphere at Duffy's, the fun at Lazy Jack's, the food at Trade Winds, lunch at Banana's, Pescadora at the W, etc. The only place we were not really impressed with was El Quenepo. We thought the food was way overpriced and was not really tasty. The Bio Bay is a must do! We did the bio bay experience with Abe's on the kayaks... Cruz and the guys did a fantastic tour! This is something that you MUST experience! Pictures do not turn out... we had an underwater camera and took lots of pictures but the pictures did not do the experience justice at all. If we would have had more time, we would have done this excursion twice. The Ambassador's at the W went far beyond our expectations! I wish I could remember all of their names... In most situations, we didn't even have to ask the questions... it's like they knew what we were thinking and always made the perfect recommendation! Jorge became a good friend to us while we were there... He treated us like family! He even made arrangements for us to go on a last minute gift and trinket buying excursion... Jorge is indeed a great Ambassador for not only the W but the for island of Vieques too. We made it a point to hang out for a little while each night at the fire pit. We met some wonderful people and had great conversation! The pools at the W were unbelieveable! The water was always the perfect temperature and we found the wait staff to be great!

There were always plenty of chairs on the beach and poolside - never had to wait or reserve them & there were plenty of towels. Bar service at the pool was fast and friendly (food was very good). Mix restaurant: breakfast - excellent; did not eat there for lunch; dinner - underwhelming. Living Room bar - great service and fun to hang out at night (we ate off the bar menu for many dinners - much better than Mix for dinner). Resort grounds were beautiful and well kept - amazing views. Hotel beach is OK but be sure to rent a car and see the other, much better, beaches. All the Talent (staff) were extremely helpful and polite - they helped make our stay very enjoyable. The spa was very good - got pedicures and haircut. Fire pit was fun at night. Ate \"pescadora\" on the beach twice - a must. Many other users commented about food/drinks being expensive - yes they are - mixed drinks were in the $12-15 range; breakfast at Mix was about $100/day for 2 people; lunch by the pool was usually $60/day for 2; and dinner at Mix was usually $150+ for 2. There are several much better options for eating out on Vieques that are less expensive if that is a concern. Overall, we had a great vacation at the W and will definitely return and recommend to friends and family. The pictures shown on the W website accurately portray the property - in fact we commented on how the pool area was reset with towels etc. each morning so it looked just like the pics. Things to do while on Vieques: Sail & snorkel on Marauder - great trip! Go to the beaches - Media Luna was a favorite.

Our view of the ocean was great and the soaking tub and shower were very nice as well. We did visit the spa, and got a very nice couples massage, including private outdoor shower with ocean views. Definitely need to book spa reservations way in advance because they were extremely busy.

I typically stay at high end resorts for vacation so have plenty of experience, especially with Starwood properties. The W is a beautiful property and expertly staffed. The resort is on the north shore, so it tends to be windier than the south shore, but there is something to be said for chair side service. Both beaches are beautiful and one of them is children free (and incidentally clothing optional though all were appropriately clothed while we were there). Keep in mind it's a new property and since there is a maturity curve to any hotel, I'd ignore any negative reviews before fall 2010. Some of the reviews about staff surliness point more towards the reviewer as I found everybody (W staff and islanders) to be incredibly friendly and this is true for all of Puerto Rico. We had a minor glitch with dinner as two of the entrees were not available, but that is common on a small island and the food we got was great. We didn't plan early enough to get a car (think July for a February stay), but didn't miss it at all. In talking to other guests with cars, I don't think it is imperative. The hotel runs inexpensive shuttles to some of the better beaches (Red Beach for one) and a cab into Esperanza is $10/person roundtrip. There are also decent bikes available for rental ($35 daily or $10/hour) and since the island is so small it's easy enough to ride around. Absolutely do the bio bay tour. We used Vieques Adventure Company (booked through the hotel the day before). They are the only operator with clear kayaks and that alone makes it worth while. It is an amazing sight and VAC is the best operator to take you there. Overall, I would give the W an eight or nine out of 10.

The W Vieques is one of the most stunningly designed hotels I have ever stayed. Designer Patricia Urquiola has a sense of humor as well as respect for the locals. All the art in the hotel \"living room\" was done by local artists and it's a great place to spend some time reading books, playing games and having a cocktail. The rooms themselves seem to vary greatly. We were lucky to have a king room in the area by the pool (and on the corner even) and the room fantastic. Comfortable, functional and also with a great sense of humor. Hide the TV behind sliding doors and take a bath in a tub designed to look like an old horse drinking trough (again, a nod to the local culture) and sleep behind the netting around the bed. Very comfortable room. The pools are also spectacular and well designed. Prepare to get up early and stake out a spot as they fill up quickly. The food poolside is also really great and maybe the most affordable place to eat on the property. The food at the Alaine Ducasse restaurant was fantastic. We arrived on Thanksgiving and had a fairly traditional turkey dinner but above and beyond anything we expected. The food was memorable to say the least. Now, a few of the bad. Sometimes poolside they don't remember that this is supposed to be a \"retreat\". The music is loud and often runs into the night (even when there is no one at the pool). We called each time and got different responses but most of the time they came and turned it off. Also, and nothing against kids, but the \"retreat\" part can be spoiled a bit by kids running around yelling and splashing while their parents drink and pay no attention. Teens throwing the football in the pool isn't really what we signed up for (again, \"retreat\" means quite to me. Lastly, the \"resort fee\" of $60 a day seems a little outrageous. Now, we took full advantage of it (snorkel gear, umbrella, kayaking in the morning with Mark, who was awesome) but if you arent active, it's seems steep and was something I heard lots of guests complaining about. All being said, would I go back? In a heartbeat. There is way too much good to outweigh any of the small issues. Dont just stay on the property, get out and see Vieques. Great beaches, hole in the wall food stops and wild horses.

I'm so glad I decided to see for myself--the W Vieques is spectacular. We are seasoned vacationers with high expectations and we were not disappointed. We were met at the airport by a W representative, who collected our luggage while we relaxed in the W lounge. As Starwood Preferred Guests, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite upon check-in. (The decor is definitely modern-bohemian; if you are looking for something more traditional Caribbean, this might not be your thing.) The grounds are gorgeous, with breathtaking views of the Atlantic, Puerto Rico and Culebra. The beaches are nice but the surf is a little rough. The double pools are spacious and the temperature is perfect. The one annoyance was that lunch service by the pool was very slow, but everyone was so kind it was hard to be angry. The gym was spotless, with top-of-the-line equipment, and yoga is offered every morning and evening. The concierge staff was great with planning our snorkel/sail, bio bay tour and dinners each night. The Alain Ducasse restaurant was very good, but there are great (dare I say better) restaurants in the quaint Caribbean-side town of Esperanza. The island itself is beautiful, untouched and as yet unspoiled by tourism. From our conversations with residents, they are doing all they can to keep it this way. Wild horses roam like squirrels and the multiple Caribbean beaches are perfect powder-soft crescents with warm turquoise water. Not to be missed: -Bioluminescent bay tour -Caribbean beaches (W runs a shuttle daily to Red Beach) -snorkel trip w/ Sail Vieques -Dinner in Esperanza (El Quenepo and Next Course were amazing.

My husband & I vacationed with our 20 year old twin daughters & our son who is 21 and we all adored the place. Dine wherever you feel like it! We ordered as we sat around the fire pit & moseyed over to a few sofa's & dined living room-style, kicked back with our feet tucked beneath us or stretched out on the sofas.

Largest rooms I've experienced in my travels - we've stayed at several hotels from Starhot's luxury collection and the W is my favorite - completely non-pretentious. The gym is the best offering I've ever seen at a hotel - which is not what the W Vieques is. This is not a hotel, it's a huge, lovely complex. The beaches are not large, so if you're expecting long strolls looking for seashells you will be disappointed. The pool area is fabulous and not at all crowded when we went. Make sure you find the black stone whirlpool - it's on the grounds away from the pool area. We saw several iguanas in the trees as we walked the grounds. Wild horses are everywhere and lovely to hear in the fields. Be sure to try the cappuccino in the cafe - it's as good as the one's I've had in Italy and the Panini's are pretty good too. Libations?

From beginning to end we were not only attended to by the staff, we were pampered. The staff are so accommodating and genuinely \"Whatever, Whenever\". A negative reviewer commented on the disbelief that positive reviews contained so many names of the staff. That is the very soul of this resort. The staff interact with you genuinely. At first, I thought this was just training, however, it rapidly became evident that training only enhanced the individual beauty of each staff member we encountered. Jorge met us at the airport with \"You're on vacaaaation\", Angel and Efrain tended to our every need at breakfast and Robert the pool bartender deserves a special shout for his killer Sangria recipe. We learned that Angel graduated from the University of Iowa after attending on a baseball scholarship, Efrain is a boxer and Jorge is absolutely an ambassador for the island! As far as the quality of the food--never did we have anything less than a very tasty meal. The expense--no more than you would spend at a very nice restaurant at home. One glaring difference from the restaurant at home--the view of the ocean is breathtaking while having your breakfast. The resort grounds are beautiful, I think one of the reviewers commented on the unkempt nature. That is the nature of the resort, unkempt nature. The picture \"illustrating\" this was grass by the pool. This is not indicative of lack of maintenance, it is purposeful. The grounds are immaculate and are constantly being attended to by the staff. They even have automated lawn care by the wild horses that visit regularly. Both beaches are wonderful and have seating, towels and fresh water that are included in the resort fee. Speaking of the resort fee, it is an irritant, however, when considering the value of the things that normally would be a la carte at other resorts, even with a resort fee, it is a very minor irritant. The pools are great, it is generally 85 degrees outside, they really don't need heating and the music underwater is a nice touch. The lighting at night is appropriate, allow your eyes time to adjust and no problems will be encountered. If the lights were brighter away from the Greathouse, it would be distracting from the \"Retreat\" aspect of the resort. Oh, the loud music? Turn it up! The music was NOT loud, it was very volume and area appropriate. I really do not get the negative reviews of this place. I have followed this W from pre-construction (rebranding really) and anxiously anticipated my stay there. My expectations were exceeded in every way. I cannot wait to get back to \"Fantasy Island\"!

As platinum Starwood members, we were very excited to try this new resort. Overall, we were very pleased and recommend this Starwood property for the following reasons: W Plus Reasons- From the moment the W staff greets you at the Vieques airport, you know you're going to adore this hotel. You'll love the free shuttle service to and from the hotel and airport lounge. The W lounge offers free alcoholic drinks, free snacks, and a trendy atmosphere to set the mood for your stay. When you arrive at the hotel you are greeted by staff in a lobby that exudes the W style. You are provided a tour of the resort which includes a viewing of their spectacular pools. Afterwards we were taken to our wonderful upgraded room (Building # 3) which had an ocean view and quiet setting. If you're looking to listen to the ocean rather than hip pool music, request Buildings 1-4. Our room was well appointed and decorated trendy. We loved the open design bathroom which had a great walk-in shower and unique tub (friends or families sharing space may not). We loved spending time in the W Living Room (lobby area). From the free morning coffee to the free sunset happy hour drink, the setting and view were picture perfect. We actually preferred having dinner in Living Room rather than the very expensive Mix on the Beach. Our $17 hamburger and fries was a good alternative to the $200 plus dinner at the Mix. The two private beaches are great for relaxation (adult or family choices). If you're looking to more safely snorkel or swim in the ocean, you should leave the property for better options. The outdoor music volume around the resort is not really a problem as others have mentioned. It's a great feature. We loved the pool table and special TV room in the Living Room. The $65.40 resort fee seems a bit high at first, but once you realized all that it covered, we were \"OK\" with the charge. I am pleased to say the W crowd is diverse and a great mix of guest. It was very nice to see guests from all walks of life (age, culture, race, and sexual orientation) enjoying the resort. The following are comments for W Vieques management: Service- We found ourselves waiting long periods of time for service which is an indication of either understaffing or poorly managed employees. In addition, many employees lacked the basics of good customer service. Many employees were not knowledgable about the island \"things to do\" and could not talk from first hand experience. Mix on the Beach- This restaurant has great potential but is lacking something special. A creation of a \"unique\" atmosphere and a better menu with reasonable pricing might help get people in the door. The restaurant was sparsely populated during the majority of our stay. Consider adding things that would help separate the high-end dining from the regular outdoor living room area. A decorative screen between the lounge area and the dining area, using white table cloths, installing more outdoor landscape scenery and ocean lighting, and other decorative accents that would make you feel like you are getting more value for your dollars spent. Inside and Outside Lighting- The property is gorgeous, however, when the sun goes down the outdoor lighting is so dim you could actually hurt yourself. The guest room lighting also makes reading a difficult feat day or night. Spend a few bucks to replace the solar outdoor lighting (we assume this maybe a \"Green\" status requirement) and add a few reading lights to each room. On Site Car Rental Service- Consider having your own car rental agency on site. The options in town were seedy and difficult to work with. Guest Hints- Take a small plane rather than the public ferry to and from Vieques. Rent a car during your stay to explore the island for a few days. Skip eating dinner at the Mix and eat at El Quenepo (outstanding food-the best on the island), Next Course, and Sol Food (only open for lunch). Plan a few excursions like the Bio-bay (we preferred the pontoon boat rather than the kayaks) and horseback riding (choose the Esperanza Riding Company with Elizabeth over Seagate). Buy your own alcohol at the local grocery store and save a few bucks. Enjoy the morning yoga class and great gym. Spend lots of your non-sun time in the Living Room relaxing and socializing. Visit the ocean point by Building #1 to enjoy a few sunsets. If you're going to spend a day at the beach away from the hotel, choose Red Beach. Not Loving Vieques - The island of Vieques is not the prettiest island. Compared to St. John or Kauai Hawaii, it's a bit of a disappointment. The island has a local government and resident population that is resisting improvements needed to take this island to the next step. Most buildings are in a state of disrepair, roads are inadequate for two way traffic, there is problem with locals dumping trash just about anywhere, and crime is a big problem. These issues and more will have to be addressed if the type of guest that patronizes the W will pay this resort a return visit. Bottom line ...... we loved the W Vieques. It is one of the most relaxing and well appointed Starwood resorts we have visited. With a few minor modifications the resort could be one of the best in the Carribean. If you're looking for a first class oceanfront resort and don't want to leave it during your vacation, this is the place for you. However, the island of Vieques isn't a good pairing for the typical W hotel guest and will make you think twice about returning.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "ansb10", "ReviewID": "UR94757566", "Content": "We were apprehensive about this trip because of all the mixed reviews, but ended up loving the W and Vieques. We did get a great deal (70% off!) and felt it was worth it, maybe some of the bad reviews are from those who paid the rack rate and felt that it wasn't. When you land in the airport, the lounge is a great start. There was hardly a wait for a shuttle, and the hotel grounds are beautiful. At first it seemed huge and we were concerned about the walk, but the distance wasn't bad at all. At night it does get very dark and difficult to navigate, but I think that's partially to reduce light pollution in the area for the Biobay. I would recommend getting your bearings in daylight first. Our room was huge and very clean. Housekeeping came every day while we were out and reloaded our Bliss products, folded and put away clothes, etc. We ate in the restaurant, pool and the bar, and thought the food was good, if not amazing. Things were pricey but we had expected and planned for that beforehand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most of the time we went out to eat in Esperanza or Isabel 2. You absolutely should reserve a car in advance. The hotel beach is pretty, but a little rough, and the pool is great but after one day I could see it getting boring. The music in the pool area didn't bother us at all, we liked it a lot actually. But our room was quiet and set further back, there were rooms that were right on the pool so not sure if they had to listen to the music all night long. The beaches on the south side of the island are amazing. We didn't rent the chair/umbrella/snorkel package, but you can take as many free beach towels as you like every day if you are going exploring. We found the front desk and all the staff wonderful. I can see why Vieques as a destination gets such mixed reviews \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has some beautiful areas but not very many amenities (besides the beautiful beaches). There are very few places to buy anything, only two or three grocery stores, two gas stations, etc. The roads are winding and narrow, and there are no traffic lights. The grocery stores all sell alcohol, so we bought cheaper drinks and snacks and loaded our minifridge with them. We loved it, the locals we met were so friendly and helpful, and it was nice to have all the amenities of W when you wanted it, or the rustic island when you didn't.

We had a wonderful time, the pool, beaches and rooms were gorgeous. This is a very relaxing retreat. There is not much else on the island so if you are going to party, you would need to go into town to Esperanza. We took a sailing trip with snorkeling, see the concierge to set this up. Do not do this on your own, it just creates confusion with transportation and other amenities, and stay away from Captain Bill. He is crazy and not the safest. When he asks if you are a good swimmer, he is really asking if you are an olympian. When we were visiting there was a concert and art show, these were fun little extras. If you want to leave the resort you need to rent a Jeep. You need to do this weeks in advance. Also, pay the extra $ to have the jeep rental fill up with gas. If you do not, you will wait in a 2 hour line to get gas at one of two gas stations on the island. Do not be alarmed at the puddle jumper you need to take from the airport at San Juan. The planes are very small, but the scenery is gorgeous and takes all nerves out of the experience. It takes quite a bit of travel to get to Vieques, this is the only reason I gave it 4 stars, not 5. You are pretty exhausted when you arrive. It is important to remember that they are on island time. Nothing happens on time. Especially the airline to and from Vieques. We waited about 45 mins for our captain to come and take us back to San Juan. This can be especially frustrating when you need to catch a flight in San Juan back to the states. It was the same situation leaving San Juan to Vieques, we waited about an hour in the plane before take off. Very hot and stuffy! Again, this resort is a gem.

Looks like such a great place you cant wait to get out of the shuttle van and go exploring - but following following these events is a kind of an amatuer hour service disaster - despite the beautiful setting, the service was kind of appalling. Let me begin with contrast of being charged $950/night for an ocean view room with some of the comical but mind-boggling quotes from the staff: $950 a night !! \"Uhm ..You shouldn't be sitting here if you want food - it was New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve last - no one is coming in today and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just me. Try room service or wait til dinner?\" (we were sitting in the lobby bar restaurant at 2pm) \"Why does everyone drink such big cups, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to make another.\" -This at breakfast when the coffee urns and creamer/milk were empty for the tenth time - and I finally reported the problem. \"But, I'm sure that this is what you ordered\" this regarding dessert at the restaurant - we ordered two different desserts - there were two of us, but then they delivered three of the same dessert - 3 black forest cakes - 3 of them - and there were just two of us at the table. Trying to get it taken of the check was like explaining how to solve a Rubik\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cube. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know, Papi, but we can only handle a certain number of tables at a time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are short-staffed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This when we tried twice to make reservations at the restaurant only to be told they were fully booked until 10:00 pm - but when arriving at 8:30 for drinks - the restaurant was full of open tables - but we were still not seated b/c the staff, not the restaurant, was at full capacity. If the W can only handle 8 tables during the highest occupancy time of the year, then - why open ? Why design at huge restaurant with seating for 70? - at least charge prices appropriate for a soft opening. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even begin to discuss the ordering service scenario at the pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or mentioned that I paid $150 for a half-assed massage - but the worst of all was the concierge desk. Bottom line is that they were just ill-prepared. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak holiday season \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like their super-bowl weekend - did any of these managers think ahead about increased guests requests?? As pleasant as the staff was - I have never heard the words \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am Sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd more than I heard it come from the mouths of these concierges,. No car rentals. No taxis. No availability on any outings. No I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that restaurant. No, I don't know how you would get to that restaurant. etc...I know it's an island and it has limitations - but Starwood Group is powerful - get a few company cars sent over guys for the holiday season - cmon!! Everything at this W seems to be designed to squeeze as much money from guests to make back opening hotel costs in the most rapid way possible. This is done in such overt ways (9 dollars for bottled water that at most luxury properties would be free, the absurd $60 'beach' fee, the noticeably small portions in the only restaurant guests can eat at - simply b/c with no car rentals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a choice) This combined with almost surreal ineptitude in service, leaves one feeling not only angry but exploited. Not the best word of mouth for a new property. All of this could have been fine if we were at the Inn on the Blue Horizon for $350 a night. But if you charge St. Barts prices- you need to get a handle on service. Period. $950 a night - at any time of the year - means that guests are met in the lobby with drinks, that bottled water is complimentary - that the hotel has several cars at the disposal of guests to be driven to restaurants or excursions - and that there are simply a few well-trained extra servers on hand to handle that kind of occupancy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospitality 101 - and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid the W has bombed in this area On the positive - the staff were all a very pleasant bunch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c really lovely. Inept but super nice. It just appears that they have no managers to train or supervise them. This is all so disconcerting considering the expectation one has of the W brand in combination with such an elegant well-designed property. Rooms are great. Beds ARE comfortable. Pools are great- food is better than expected. A nice diverse crowd of guests. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got the bones to be a fantastic place...so in the end I do have to recommend it as the best place to stay on the island - as I've stayed at three of the others...and this is the best. The location is fine actually and the beach is great - I went swimming every day - they must only close the beach on very windy days - the gym is great . The last thing to say- and I feel the most important thing to say - is to the reviewer who says that it needs to decide if it's a gay resort or a family place... Really? Why would it need to decide that? Surely it can be both. As a family man myself, there with my wife & kids - I will have to disagree that the clients were mostly gay. I was there on Jan 1 too, and there were maybe 5 or 6 gay couples - and in a hotel this size I think they were undoubtedly in the minority. But why does that even matter? Moreover, I can promise you that the gay couple we met were much nicer to my kids and more fun to hang out with than most of the other 'families' that we met. If you don't wish to encounter gays on your W holiday - probably best to plan your holiday at an Econo-lodge in northern Florida.

Our oceanview ground floor room was very comfortable, we did not encounter any problems with hot water or A/C. We did however, have issues with hotel staff. We were unable to rent a car in advance and upon our arrival inquired again about renting a car or scooter and we were told by hotel staff it would be impossible to do so because the island ran out of gas. On our last full day we gave up and decided to rent bicycles from the hotel (for an additional $70) in order to get ourselves to one of the off-site beaches by any means necessary. We went to the front desk to check on our route we noticed a small sign advertising a hotel shuttle to the beach ($12 per person) that had left an hour before, this was after we were informed the day before that hotel \"only provides shuttles to the airport.\" The next day we recieved a message from a staff member proudly announcing they had found a scooter we could rent for the entire day, on the morning of our check out. Insult to injury. Another issue we had was being interrupted on more than one occasion by staff members coming to our room mistakenly. Once a staff member banged loudly on our glass door announcing he was there to check on a complaint about the hot water (we had no such issue) and the next morning another banged on our door frightening us VERY early in the morning to collect our luggage, except we weren't leaving for another day. We called the front desk to complain and received a most unsatisfactory response and barely apology. As for Mix the restaurant, do yourself and favor and don't go. Or alternatively, have your spouse/companion punch you in the stomach and then hand them $200. Totally agree that Alain Ducasse should remove his association or think about intervening immediately. Bottom line: Staff are mostly pleasant and nice just not very helpful. Small issues are far more tolerable when you aren't charged a small fortune for every last thing whether or not you use it($65 per day for tennis/parking??)

If we had been paying the rack rate of $1,700 per night (!), my review may have been different. Our room was huge, with a lovely large deck. We were further back on the property, but had a great view of the beautifully landscaped grounds. The room was a little funny though; the living room had a lot of unusable space, seemed to have redesigned an earlier kitchenette. There was a large unusable entry way with no lights. They also were short on roll-aways, though they had tons of advance warning, it seems that they could have brought in some more, because they told us months in advance that there may be a problem with one for our 9yo. But we had a large lounger and they were very nice about bringing in bedding for it. We borrowed movies from the front desk twice and it was a nice bonus. Hooks - hello? There was one hook (inconveniently behind the bed-sized tub), and not a single hook or soap dish in our guest bathroom. We had to drape towels on the bathtub, or clump them on the back of the toilet. Maybe rich people have towel-boys to hold their towels for them? The pool area and Living Room were gorgeous, with huge sliding walls that opened onto the grounds, more seating, and the firepit; it was just wonderful. Although there was a shortage of pool chairs (the staff nicely raided even their own to try to supplement), and CRAZY people were getting into fights over them, and saving them starting early in the morning to use for one hour in the afternoon. There probably could have been more shade umbrellas. There was a beautiful smaller pool near our villa that was stunning at night. For all the fuss about the food and the chef, it wasn't that good. I had some scrambled eggs one morning that I really think used shelf-stabilized eggs, they had that taste of college cafeteria. We did love the Cubano sandwiches in the Living Room though. We went to two local restaurants that were great, and a fraction of the price, and there were a few other highly-rated ones we didn't make it to. You should ABSOLUTELY call as soon as you book in order to rent a car. There are some gorgeous beaches on the island, but the cabs won't go there because they're down dirt roads. So the beaches they will take you to are nice, but no where near the caliber of Blue beach, or Red beach. (we didn't have a car, and were very sad to miss some of the others). The hotel beaches are fine, but nothing special, and on the Atlantic (rather than Caribbean) side, so rougher and without the white sand). You MUST do the bio bay tour, and swim in it. There was a torrential downpour on our second day, and this was the real opening of the peak season for the hotel. The staff reacted fantastically, they devised games, found additional seating for the Living Room, and worked very long hours amusing everyone who were trapped inside. One annoying thing though was that when we arrived, they were advertising two video game rooms for the kids, and a movie room. This never materialized, and they didn't really have any explanation. Overall the rooms were lovely, the grounds beautiful, the staff incredible, the value marginal, the island very nice. As noted, there are lots of add-on fees - this isn't a cheap hotel. There were also a lot of privileged teenagers (this was xmas break) with a lot of attitude tormenting the staff. Off-topic slightly, make sure to give yourself extra layover time if you have to catch a flight home. Cape Air was laid back and running over an hour late, and we missed our weekly charter.

I believe they need to decide to be either an adult/gay friendly resort or a family resort. 2) Hotel is on windward side of island. We were there 5 days Dec 29-Jan 3. Beaches were closed each and every day. No water activities which we were charged for in hotel fee were available at any time. This is a $65.00 per day charge after they add tax on top of your room 3) Hotel has major problem with pool areas. Every day all chairs around both pools were taken by guests that were not even using them by 8am. Some were never used during the day, but you could not if you had not marked them early each morning. The hotel solution was for me to rent a cabana at an additinal 250.00 per day. This was in addition to the $65.00 we were already paying for something not available 4) New Years Eve party was a joke. Advertised as a dinner, music with a guest dj, dancing, it was actually burgers, fries, and someone playing music (techno) off their laptop. This was at an addittonal charge of $307.00 per couple. Advertised at $125.00 per person, but of course they added on 57.00 in tax, tip;, etc 5) Bedding in rooms is advertised as W Signature Bed, but I have stayed at enough W and Weston properties to know that is not what they have here. Since this was a Wyndom Property last year, it is my belief they put the W feather top and pillows on the old Wyndom beds. These are the worst beds I have ever experienced at ANY Sheraton property. I stayed at the Sheraton in Puerto Rico coming and going on this trip to the W in Vieques and it is very easy to tell the difference. 6) Part of the $65.00 per day charge is high speed internet. Do not expect high speed. It is slower than dial up and will drop your connection several times each time you use it. 7) I do want to compliment the employees at this resort. They have a great attitude and do not complain. They all realized the problems the management is having but are doing a great job taking care of the guests. 8) At the published rate of 609.31 per night for just a garden room before taxes and the 65.00 added room charge, this resort is highly overpriced for what they offer. Only one restuarant, two bars, and being on the windward side of the island, I would never chose to stay here again.

I have worked in the industry and give allowances for things that can go wrong and am always very patient. We love everything from luxury to funky to rustic and don't travel with a lot of expectations. I also adore the Starwood brand and 99% of the time stay in Starwood hotels, but this W was \"interesting\" to say the least....the phrase we used to best describe our experience is \"don't write a check your \"rear\" can't cash\". Yes it's beautiful kind of Camp W, meets Bohemian Chic, the rooms are spacious (unusual for a W) and has a laid back atmosphere. The guests were an eclectic (though mainly pretentious) mix from 80 year olds to 5 year olds, families and alternative couples. The problem was the expectations that the W set with the Whatever Whenever slogan and the \"Wish\" telephone button. You throw that kind of bravado out there and you damn well expect it to be met. Our stay was the week of New Year's, the hotel was fully booked and woefully understaffed. It felt like a hotel that had only opened a week ago and just didn't seem to fit on an island where the horses roam wild in the streets. These are just \"some\" of the things we had to deal with during our stay. We would not stay here again nor would we recommend it to friends. There are other boutique lodgings in Esperanza or even a home rental we would consider next time. 1. Our room was not ready when we checked in at 5pm (check in is at 4pm), we were 2 drink tickets as a consolation but our room was not ready until 6:30pm. 2. The concierge was severely severely severely understaffed. Though we booked most of our own excursions, whenever we visited the concierge desk it was 3 people deep and everyone in front of us was complaining about some thing or another (dinner reservations screwed up, late car pick up, etcetera). 3. A reservation we made for an excursion with the concierge one evening was not made the following morning by the morning staff. It was only because we thought to check that we learned the reservation was not made and then concierge made the reservation while we waited. LUCKILY there was still space available considering it was a holiday week. 4. We had a room near the pool and could not sleep in with the door open to hear the ocean because the infernal awful \"vibe\" music started every single morning at 9:00am. That music should NOT start until at least 11:00am. Huge annoyance. 5. Some days the room was made up mid day. One day we came back at 5pm and the room had not been made yet. One day it was never made up at all. Some days there was evening turn down, other days there were not. On the days there was turn down sometimes chocolate was left, sometimes it was not, and one time they even removed chocolate from the room. Sometimes when the room was cleaned dirty glasses were not removed from the room. 6. We don't mind paying resort prices for cocktails but if you're going to charge $14 for a cocktail then fill the damn thing to the brim. Every single cocktail was short poured by 1/2\" and was extremely weak. 7. Big lack of communication from hotel staff to guests - Front desk or \"wish desk\" didn't know what the menu was for the New Year's Eve Pool Party. There was never any communications about daily events, like the live evening music. Had we known about the entertainment, we may have stayed and spent our dollars at the resort rather than leaving the hotel and then coming back to walk into the middle of a full music show. There was no communication about the lunch BBQ at the pool, tiki grill at the cafe, nothing. 8. The W does not have a shuttle to take guests to various places on the island. Because of the lack of car rental availability on the island, the W should really employ their own shuttle vans to transport guests around the island (not just back and forth to the airport or to Red Beach). One that goes back and forth to the beaches until they close (2pm is too early for the last pick up from the beach). And one that goes back and forth to Esperanza, Isabele, etcetera similar to what the Starwood Vacation Ownership properties provide. 9. If you're a \"coffee-er\" you'll hate that there's no coffee maker in the room. There is complimentary coffee in the bar in the morning but when you wake up in the morning, you want coffee now, to enjoy on the balcony, not after you dress and stand in line with the masses. 10. Room service presentation was hit or miss. One night it was 3 stacked dishes on a tray with no extras (no rolls/butter with the salad) with no explanation/presentation by the waiter and 2 pepper shakers were brought instead of 1 salt. While the other in-room dining experience was full blown wonderful presentation with it all explained and beautiful presentation. 11. AC/electricity went out and all we got was a note, nothing for our troubles and the fact that our beverages in the mini frig got warm. 12. I recall seeing a note that said the resort fee of $60 would be waived yet we were charged for the resort fee. The whole concept of Whatever Whenever \"your wish is our command\" fails because the expectation they set was horribly not met. The only other item to note is this hotel is on the Atlantic side of the island, very windy and rough ocean.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cI would not stay there for free.\u201d", "Author": "budgaboo", "ReviewID": "UR91760077", "Content": "I realize sites like this suffer from negative bias.

Our stay was truly memorable made so by the staff and facilities at the resort. The negative reviews posted seemed to come from guest that are not aware of what W Hotels and Vieques are like. The W has taken a fresh modern approach to a hotel that is funky, fun and caters to a younger generation. It is NOT the Ritz Carlton but you will get every penny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of your stay. Tips to maximize your stay. -Take advantage of free drinks from the full bar and snacks at the airport W lounge. It is truly a great way to start your vacation. -If you do not like loud music that plays almost all day, specifically request a room that is away from the main pool prior to arrival. If you are looking for a quite pool and beach make sure to go to the whisper beach or the circle pool. -There is excellent free coffee and tea in the living room every morning. Unless you want an espresso drink don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for it at the caf\u00c3\u00a9. -The caf\u00c3\u00a9 offers pastries, yogurt, and sandwiches for a more affordable breakfast. There are a few grocery stores in town where we bought yogurt and cereal. You wont find much fresh fruit on the island. We walked to the farmers market that is on Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from 8-3 and it is about a mile and a half from the W. Most of the produce is shipped in from the mainland. -Bring your own alcohol or buy it in town. The grocery stores have wonderful tropical juices that make great mixers. -Vieques Events magazine was a wealth of information and was in the hotel room. It listed daily events on the island, restaurant menus and general information. -The floating chairs at the pool were fabulous but go very quickly. Make sure to get to the pool early if you want one. -Snorkel gear and kayaks are free for use on the hotel beaches. -Alain Ducasse has done a wonderful job with the restaurant MIX on the beach. His French creations are delicious. We loved every bite of our two dinners at MIX. Greg was especially attentive and had an excellent knowledge of the food being served. -The Platinum amenity was either points, in room movie, or a W signature gift. Take the points. -Use the Whatever, Whenever option on the room phone if you need anything. They are very accommodating and respond quickly. -The hotel shuttle is really the only taxi on the island but was very convenient and we never waited long. - The spa was wonderful. I have visited spas all over the world and the W spa is one of my top five favorites. Each treatment room has a locker and an open air shower allowing you to fully enjoy the serenity of the spa without sharing a locker room with other guest. The relax package with 30 min body scrub, 30 minutes massage, and 30 minute facial was the perfect blissful ending to a great vacation. Minor flaws: -We had scheduled a bio bay tour for our last night with the concierge and were told to be in the lobby at 5:30 for the shuttle departure. We arrived at the lobby at 5:10 and checked in with the front desk that we would be waiting in the living room when the shuttle was ready. We did not hear from the front desk for a while so we checked back only to find out the shuttle had left and there was no way to make it to the bio bay in time. We were extremely disappointed to say the least and the front desk could only half way apologize. We then spoke to the concierge to see if there were any other tours we could try to make that night with no luck. Melissa was very sympathetic to our situation and compensated us very well for the inconvenience. -The largest down fall was the annoying and sometimes obnoxious other guests that demand things beyond reason and stake claim to all of the floating pool chairs and then never use them all at once. Vieques: Vieques is an extremely unique Caribbean island. Up until only a few years ago almost half of the island was owned by the United States Navy and was used as a proving ground for marines and sailors. Tourism was almost nonexistent because the Navy was frequently firing at the uninhabited half of the island. It is still getting used to visitors and is a little rougher around the edges. There are lots of horses that roam free on the island and they do leave droppings along the roads. The people of Vieques are vibrant and very passionate about their island. For us this made the vacation even more authentic and made us feel like we were in a foreign country with an oasis at the W.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York, USA", "Title": "\u201cThe Only Wow is the Price\u201d", "Author": "HegemierDiaz", "ReviewID": "UR90541721", "Content": "I am a fan of the W hotels and tend to stay there when on business. I thought what better than to stay at a W while taking in the rustic appeal of Vieques. Unfortunately I get the sense that someone had to go home early in the middle of setting up the hotel and the staff have been left behind to figure out how to finish the job. The experience began to go downhill from the beginning when we arrived to find only four of our five day stay was on their system. Luckily I had proof via Amex of the full booking and they were able to accomodate. But had I not had the documentation with me it would have been a big problem. If you do plan on coming to the W - I highly recommend some type of night vision eyewear. Please plan on wearing it around both outdoors at night and also pretty much any time you are in your hotel room. The sexy dim lighting the hotel employs is a great visual but very impractical and even dangerous when walking back to your room. One downstream effect is that our refrigerator was plugged into a low voltage outlet intended for the dim lights and so was warm. This was a big problem as we had baby milk to keep from spoiling. After two days and multiple requests an \"engineer\" came and plugged the fridge from one outlet into another. If they had indicated a voltage difference in the outlets I could have done that in the first ten seconds. Similar experience with the wi-fi for which we were paying basically $60 a day (more on this). It took three full days and multiple requests to the front desk to have the service restored which I am certain was no more than turning on and off the router. We were in Villa 13 which is at the very beginning of the property. I don't know if it was added as an afterthought because the sidewalk ends before the Villas. Meaning my family and I all had to step out on to the road to finish the walk to our hotel room. The road is inside the property so this didn't seem bad at first until experience showed us that this little road was continuously trafficked with guest jeeps, staff golf carts, or construction vehicles. And since at night the light of the moon was the only light available, it was a bit intimidating to step out into oncoming headlights and just hope they are not drunk. The restaurant is at best so-so. I think Alain Ducasse would be wise to pull his name from it because at this point, I would rate Alain's food about on par with the fine chef's of Stouffers. Coming from New York City, I understand the high premium of world class food. But the $30 entree's would be overpriced for what they were at a fifth of the cost. Only the prosciutto appetizer really delivered. Finally and importantly the price - of everything! All of the above and these other reviews would be nit picky if the hotel wasn't charging thousands of dollars for the experience. If you wish to charge diamond star status pricing - you have to deliver. I have stayed at Holiday Inn's with more consistent amenities and services. In addition to the healthy room fees is a mandatory $60 per day charge which includes things like access to wi-fi, tennis courts, the gym (how many hotels have you stayed at with a separate gym charge?), pool towels, etc. Basically nothing very impressive. Anything that would normally be extra (like taking towels to the external beaches) was an extra charge - so the $60 didn't cover much. You do need to a rent a car in Vieques if for nothing more than to escape $60 granola and yogurt breakfasts, $100 lunches, and $200 dinners. Mixed drinks were $15 minimum (made more criminal by the absence of any noticeable alcohol), we ordered a pitcher of Sangria by the pool and found out it was $50. So the little enjoyable things tend to be ruined when you realize just how overpriced it all was. In a nutshell, I will say that the location is beautiful, and I love the W style. However the W would be well served to get a seasoned manager from another well functioning property down to this Vieques one and whip the place into shape before they get a reputation they cannot shake.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExceeded my high expectations\u201d", "Author": "Ann-70", "ReviewID": "UR90423986", "Content": "Just returned from a romantic getaway to Vieques.

Pros: Beautiful location, rooms were well appointed, staff was very friendly, pool lounge chairs in the water were amazing, as were the little pods and hammocks throughout the property. Liked the amenities. Bliss products always enjoyed at W Stays. Areas for improvement: Pool temperature was COLD. they had a full house on Saturday and not many people in the pool. And there was never any option for night swimming (which is a favorite of mine as I don't have to worry about burning or sunscreen) as the water was fridgid. Warm the pool up by 5-10 degrees and the pool would have received a \"10\" from me. Concierge staff was AWFUL! Barely ever there and for this type of resort property you should have someone on at all times and someone to cover them on break. Then when they were there they were essentially useless. Told us to go to one venue for dinner and food/service was bad. Another person told us we could walk from the Bio-Bay tour into town easily AT NIGHT! ARE YOU SERIOUS?! Thankfully we took note of the length of the drive as we were being taken from the place to the bay and realized that not only was it a long walk it was entirely unsafe as well! All around the staff needs better training, but they were extremely nice (which you can't train for). Bell staff was the most knowledgable/friendly/accessible as well as the front desk staff. Room service needs some work too. Called Whatever, Whenever, Whereever and asked to have the pasta from the restaurant delivered to our room (vs. the one on the RS menu). They said the pasta was the same (which it wasn't) so we went to the restaurant, they told us we couldn't order from them for \"take out\" but could do so from the bar. Bar told us they couldn't order the restaurant menu from the bar. Finally got it all worked out, but it was certainly not \"WWW\" service that I've experienced at other W's. Also was extremely disappointed with \"mix on the beach\" dining. As were other guests we spoke with. Bar & pool menu was good, but actual menu in dining room was diappointing. CONS: There was this god-awful banging all EVERY NIGHT we were there coming from the pipes or something. We never could figure it out. Should have told someone on site, but we were having too much fun to complain while on vacation. Another con at times for us was the open bathroom...and the fact that the WC door doesn't close fully or have a vent in the WC. People have business to do there and unless you are staying in a resort on your own (yeah right) I don't think anyone wants to share their business. Also the tub wasn't that inviting. I love taking a tub and had no desire to do so in a big metel bin. someone took \"funky\" a little too far there. Also, there's not really any place to eat but on site w/out taking \"publico\" or renting a car, so bring your wallet. W Lounge at the airport was really nice (especially when you see the airport hee hee). Small plane ride over was interesting. My friend had to (or got to if you ask her) sit in the co-pilot seat both ways. I was sweating from the heat and the nerves...but 20 mins to get there on that little dinky plane was better than a 3 hour unpredictible ferry ride! We had bad dinner at Trade Winds in Esperanza...but a really really good lunch at Duffy's (get the bloody mary!) as well as a pretty decent inexpensive dinner at Island Adventures (after the bio bay tour which you MUST MUST DO) Also had great snorkling at Blue Beach (ask the guy at the sport shop on site to tell you how to go into the right point of the beach there for best viewing...we saw sea turtles and tons of fish!) All in all I would recommend this place. I will say as a girls get away we were the \"few\" as it was mainly couples there. But we didn't care. We weren't there to pick up boys or make new friends...just to relax, unwind, and enjoy each other's company...which we did easily.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cIf you could rate them only on effort these guys are an A+.

Beautiful pool with an attentive staff. Drinks and food were easy to order, staff delivered ice water numerous times during the day, the music was terrific (I was worried as some of the other reviews were fairly negative on this) and the pool area is relaxing and clean. 2. Mix restaurant on the Beach was terrific. The food was terrific, the service was attentive and competent and deserts were delicious. Try the ice cream sandwiches! 3. The bar area was fun and the menu was terrific. We relaxed on a chair built for two with a cheese plate and a glass of champagne to watch the sunset. A fun way to end the day. 4. The staff in the workout room and adventure travel area were helpful. We rented chairs to go to a beach off property and when we returned and shared that we had not used them because it rained we were not charged for them. 5. The rooms are clean, nice and the beds are comfortable. Cons 1. Check in was atrocious. We arrived at 2pm and were told that check in time was three and that our room would not be ready until then. The front desk clerk clearly did not have a great grasp of English. When we returned at 3 she sort of told us that the room would not be ready \"for awhile\". Finally without speaking she handed me two free drink tickets and I walked away. We went to the pool (after changing in a community bathroom) and relaxed for the afternoon. When I asked a server at the pool to check on our room she came back after about 15 minutes and told me that she did not know how to do this. 2. Part two of the check in concept is something called the \"Ambassador\". The ambassador walks you to your room, shows you the property amenities during the walk and then familiarizes you with the room. If you want to go to your room and there is no ambassador available you can sit in the lobby for 30 minutes or more. At one point there were at least 3 couples waiting to be walked to their room. We chose to walk ourselves to the room and got there and the key did not work. Upon returning to the front desk we were told by the woman who did not speak great English that it should have worked and no apology. 3. I asked if an ambassador could come and meet us at the pool to familiarize us with the property and was told no. If I wanted a tour I could come back later. 4. The W Cafe was ridiculous. It was if a senior management group got together and each one raised the price on everything by another dollar until it was time to go home. A small coffee is $4 (plus tax) a small muffin is $3, an individual serving bag of chips is $3. The staff is apologetic but unable to do anything but key in the amounts and tell you that your breakfast of a bagel and cup of coffee is $11. 5. We were scheduled for 8 days and were never contacted by a concierge to see if we wanted to plan any activities or needed any help. We had used trip advisor for our preplanning so did not need them but were surprised that the service was not offered. 6. There is no where to walk or hike on the property or near the property. We walked down the road one morning and turned around after less than a mile after having too many mack trucks come flying by. 7. There was a tremendous amount of construction happening at the hotel while we were there. One morning a maintenance person tried to enter our room (even though we had the do not disturb sign out) because he was supposed to work in the next room but accidentally opened our door. There were a couple of major renovations happening at the pool and there were anywhere from 6 to 10 construction guys hanging around mostly watching girls while one or two did some work. And Finally, The biggest issue with the W is not their fault. There is nothing to do on Vieques. No golf, no hiking, no galleries (please don't believe any of the advertisements), two average restaurants off property to eat at, two filthy little towns to visit, a number of beaches that are advertised as wonderful but most are loaded with horse manure (as is the entire island) and tons and tons of mosquitos and something called No See Ums that get under your skin and bite you for days. Upon visiting the local farmacia the response from the Pharmacist was \"Oh My God!\". My most memorable moment was stopping at the Glass Beach and taking a photo of my wife with her t-shirt over her mouth because it stunk like garbage and horse manure. The issue with the manure is that the horses run free on the island. They are on the roads all the time and crap literally everywhere.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Harbor, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel and wonderful staff!!!\u201d", "Author": "gapeachfl", "ReviewID": "UR89678174", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 3 days in November and were treated like royalty!

The W Retreat gets all the details right.. The Concierge, especially Lauren, made sure that every morning my plans were mapped out in detail from what beach to visit, to what the top restaurants in town were, and to what the best sightseeing venues were. My favorite part of the hotel was the pool. The staff that supported the pool were exceptional, from Carlos, Robert and Monica serving the most creative frozen drinks to Lala making sure that I had fresh towels and that I did not burn. They treated me like I was part of their family. Mark, from the Sports Club, made sure that my hike in the rainforest was vigorous but memorable. My only negative experience was with ISLAND ADVENTURES. The Concierge had arranged for a bio sightseeing tour. The taxi dropped me off at Island Adventures a few minutes late and I missed the boat. The manager at Island Adventures decided to scream and talk down to me, and finally asked me to wait outside of his store like I was a dog until my hotel picked me up. Their lack of professionalism and customer service shocked me because everyone on the Island of Vieques went our of their way to make me one of the best trips of my life.

We arrived at the Vieques airport and had a quick 10 minute wait in the W lounge. The lounge was very impressive - it takes up half the space of the tiny rustic airport and has a very helpful staff, snacks and drinks in a very comfortable setting - if only they could run the entire resort the way they run the lounge! Upon arrival we checked in and were told to wait in the lobby for an \"ambassador\" to show us to our room. I'm not the most patient person and waiting almost half an hour to be shown to our room was unacceptable in my book, but our ambassador did turn out to be helpful and gave us a tour of the entire resort on the way to our room. The grounds of the resort are beautiful and there are seating areas all around the property where you can relax and enjoy the view. The pool area is quite large but always very crowded with loud music playing. I actually liked the music, but can see how some guests would complain that it was too loud. I personally preferred to sit on the beach rather than the pool, which was virtually empty and much more relaxing. They seemed to have a problem keeping the pool towels stocked and there were quite a few times that I had to go to the hotel lobby to get a towel. They also need more people to work at the pool area and clean up towels, etc. once guests have left. If you arrive at the pool in the afternoon, every single chair has a used towel on it and half are unoccupied, so you have no idea whether or not you can lay down or if you'll be stealing someone's seat. As far as food at the hotel, we had breakfast at the restaurant the first morning, but then opted for the W Cafe for the rest of the week. They have breakfast sandwiches, cereal, smoothies, etc. This seemed slightly more cost effective (although a smoothie is $8) and just all around easier. We only ate lunch by the pool one day - it took around 40 minutes to get two drinks and two sandwiches (which are also quite pricey). The rest of the trip we tried all of the other restaurants throughout the island. We rented the beach package from the hotel for a day which included 2 beach chairs, an umbrella, a cooler, snorkel gear and straw mats. This costs $45 but we felt worth it to do once since the beach is much more enjoyable with chairs and an umbrella. It would be nice if this was included in the daily resort fee. As everyone else has mentioned, the $65 a day resort fee is absurd. Yes, you get free wifi and parking, but the snorkel and kayak gear is not even usable at the resort and the beach chairs that are included are for their beach only - not to take off property. The concierge helped us book Abe's mangrove, snorkeling, biobay tour (amazing, you should definitely do this). The cost is $100 per person, which the concierge failed to mention is cash only. Luckily when we went to pay Abe at the end of the tour, we had just over the $200 that we owed him in cash. This is a very important point that I can't believe the hotel fails to mention. Another issue was restaurant recommendations. It was Thanksgiving and I had called the front desk for a recommendation. The girl at the desk called Next Course to get us a reservation and called me back to say that they didn't have an opening until 9:30, which was too late for us. She then recommended Coconuts and said she would call them for a reservation. She called me back 10 minutes later saying that they weren't answering their phone but they were open so we should just go without a reservation. We drove over there to find that they were not open. We then decided to drive towards Esperanza and drove past Next Course. I ran in just to see if they could squeeze us in - half of the restaurant was empty and they seated us right away! A resort of this caliber should be able to tell their guests which restaurants are open and get them a reservation without a problem. All in all, the W is a beautiful resort, but has to train their staff better and step up their service to be in line with the five star resort they claim to be. They are getting away with this lack of service because there are no other luxury resorts on the island but I don't think that will last long. I would recommend this hotel because I would recommend traveling to Vieques and thought it was a nice place to stay, but it definitely needs some work.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cLuxury in Vieques\u201d", "Author": "anujin", "ReviewID": "UR88443710", "Content": "Four days before our wedding, Hurricane Tomas hit our resort in St Lucia where we were supposed to honeymoon. Based on recommendations from friends we decided to change our honeymoon to stay at the W in Vieques. I was a little confused about the transportation from the airport to the hotel - the website mentions it but at no point did I get any communication that it was part of the package - I assumed we would have to pay extra for it and take a cab to the resort. Just to be sure, I called the W from San Juan and found out that it was in fact included. It would be nice if the W could make this more clear. I had booked a spectacular room online - it was really important to us to have an ocean front view. However, when we went to check in, we were told we were in a mega room. Luckily I had the internet confirmation print out with me and showed that we were supposed to have a spectacular room and she moved us to the correct room. The W website implies that it has a rental car desk at the hotel - but in fact there is not a rental car desk. As we had to re-plan our honeymoon on such short notice we were worried about getting a jeep - but the W was able to help us get a rental jeep for two days. We didn't spend much time at the W beach or pool - we explored the island and we went to blue beach for our beach time. The music that's commented on in other reviews was definitely noticeable - but we could only hear it from our room on Friday night - that night it was loud enough to be heard over the waves - but the rest of the trip the music did not bother us. However, we did request a room that was further away from the pool so it might be nosier if you stay closer to the pool. The room was beautiful and clean and we didn't notice any issues with service. The food and drink are extremely pricey. We expected that to some point - we are from Chicago and the drinks were comparable to the W here. It does seem a little extreme though to pay $60 for breakfast consisting of toast, granola with fruit, juice and coffee. Just eat at other restaurants as much as you can - there are plenty on the island. We also stocked up on lunch food from the local supermarket to take the beach. And the resort tax is very unfair. Overall, we really enjoyed our room at the W the most out of the experience. The W living room and fire pit are also a nice touch to hang out in. We were disappointed that there's not a hot tub at the resort - but the bathtub in the room is a nice second place.

One passenger was assigned to the co-pilot seat. It's a short ride at 140mph & 2000 feet max altitude. Upon arrival at the Vieques airport we were directed to the W Resort lounge where we waited for about 20 minutes for the short ride to the resort. It took about 30 minutes for someone to deliver us and our luggage to our room and by that time it was getting dark. Upon arrival at the room there were dirty drink glasses outside our door - and they stayed there for 2 more days. When we entered the stairway to go down we discovered it was completely dark - the overhead light had burned out and my wife almost fell down the stairs. I reported it but they made no attempt to fix it that night. The next thing we noticed is the pathways are also dark because they are illuminated by very weak solar lights. We had to use our feet to feel for steps in some places. If you go, take a small flashlight because you'll need it. Dinner was OK but nothing great and the quality did not match the $107 price. The next morning the light in our stairway was replaced - about the time we lost hot water. It seems the resort has a problem with hot water pipes and after that first morning we had no hot water for the rest of the stay. The even worse part was when they cut off the hot water the shower stopped working. We had to use a hand sprayer in the tub to take a cold \"shower\". I complained several times about the lack of hot water and all I got was \"I'm so sorry\" but we were never offered anything to make up for the inconvenience, not even so much as a free drink. I had called several days before arriving and asked guest services to line up a jeep rental for us and I was told it would be taken care of. After our arrival I called guest services and told them I was ready for the jeep I discovered they hadn't made any arrangements at all. It turned out to be difficult to get a jeep because the gas stations on the island were out of gas. I finally got a jeep but we lost a half a day in the process. We went to buy a sandwich in the cafe before it closed at 5pm and discovered they had a single sandwich in the cooler. They did have ice cream but the next afternoon there was no ice cream. Seems the machine broke. If the days we spent at the W Resort had a common theme, I think it would be just that - something was broken every day we were there. The resort is beautiful and in a great setting. Food and drinks are over priced but that is probably typical for a remote resort. However, in my opinion there is a huge gap in promised customer service vs what is actually delivered. We probably will never return again because there are too many great tropical resorts that will take steps to make up for shortcomings such as no hot water. Had they tried to make up for the lack of showers / hot water by providing a free dinner, we might have considered returning. An irritant to many guests is the whopping $60 resort fee per day. The rational they supply is the fee covers the wi-fi, beach chairs, parking, towels, water sport items, etc. Therefore you are required to pay for those items whether you use them or not. Upon check-out we were taken back to the little airport where we were able to check our luggage back to our home airport - but not really. Vieques has no TSA or agriculture inspection so you and your luggage MUST be delivered outside the secure area of the San Juan airport. You must then present the luggage for an agriculture scan and get the luggage to the airline. Then, after a very long wait in the security line, you'll be at your departure gate. If we had arrived in San Juan to change planes with less than 45 minutes before boarding our USAIRWAYS flight home we would not have made it. The only reason we could have made it in 45 minutes is we discovered that there are 2 security lines at the San Juan airport. There must have been over 200 people in the line leading to the USAIRWAYS gate but we accidently found the second line when we were on our way to Vieques. We avoided the really long line and found the second line which had no wait at all. Then we used the connector hall to get back to our terminal. I was amazed that no airport personel were directing any of the passengers to the second security line.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frisco, TX", "Title": "\u201cLoved Everything about Vieques -- W Hotel, SeaGate Horseback Riding, BioBay and Duffy's\u201d", "Author": "WendyGFrisco_TX", "ReviewID": "UR87782930", "Content": "We just got back from a wonderful time in Vieques.

Just sitting by the pool and looking out over the ocean and beyond to Puerto Rico was enough to keep me relaxed. The terraced infinity pools make you want to skip the beach. Staff was friendly and very knowledgeable. The nights are even better with the constant croaking from the \"coque\" frogs, and the clear sky. Everything is extremely dark to protect sea turtles, so you get around with a glowing orb. Fun, a little dangerous. The bad... The service and prices are not great. Be prepared for an additional $100/day in resort fees and taxes. I averaged about $300/day, which was pretty conservative There is a grocery story less than a mile from the hotel and the W Cafe which sells a few items at a discount. Most of the locals seem to be on \"island time\", so service is generally slow. This goes for the hotel, and especially for local establishments. Our room had a damp, unpleasant smell that the hotel offered to fix with a spray. Did not take the offer, and we left the doors open most of the time anyway. Summary, I think its worth dealing with the few service issues and high pricing if you seek a uniquely relaxing vacation experience. I hope to return next year, as I feel they will be able to resolve the staff issues, and never got to visit bio bay due to excess rain.

We thoroughly enjoyed the \"do-nothing\" atmosphere of the island and would love to return to the comfort and retreat of the W. First, the property is stunning. It is impeccably maintained and pristine, with hotel staff constantly tending to the landscaping, pools, and porches. The styling and decor is flawless, but please note that it is modern and certainly not \"traditional beachy.\" There are no watercolors of sailboats or shell art in sight! The two pools were beautiful and, again, impeccably clean. We loved the loungers that were placed on a large step in the pool, with about three inches of water surrounding them. As for the techno music in the background, I can understand some reviewers' frustration. It was, at times, noticeably loud. We grew used to it, but also noted when it wasn't playing because we were then able to enjoy the sound of the surf in the background and the general quietude of the wildlife. If you would be offended by loud techno/new age music while lounging by a pool or lunching/ drinking outside, I strongly recommend that you really think about staying here and using the pool area because it is a noticeable distraction. At the very least, request a room away from the pool if you want to avoid the tunes and enjoy the sound of the surf. The two beaches, although small, were lovely, with the water being crystalline and the sand clean and soft. We enjoyed swimming in the water on the beach at the W almost as much as on the other famed beaches of Vieques. There was an ample amount of beach furniture, umbrellas, inner tubes, towels, and loungers available for the guests. Our room in Villa 4 was on the third story and had a beautiful view of Whisper beach. We were pleased that the hotel honored our wishes to be away from the pool area, per the recommendations of the wonderful Trip Advisor reviewers! Our room was large, incredibly clean, and well-appointed with two telephones, a flat screen mounted television, and all of the other W amenities. We both commented that it may be awkward to travel with a friend or family member that is not your spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend as the tub is out in the \"open,\" almost studio style. Housekeeping was meticulous throughout our stay. Our only small \"complaint\" would be the service during our entire stay, and it is not as much of a complaint, but, moreso, an observation that should be considered if you are deciding whether you want to book the W Vieques. Everyone at the W was friendly, but there was a notable lack of consistency among the staff and its training. Some staff would go above and beyond, truly embracing the mantra of \"Whatever, Whenever.\" However, a majority of the staff, although well-intentioned, did not seem trained in luxury hotel customer service. We had to do a lot of \"asking,\" which is unusual for a hotel of this retreat's caliber. For example, we had to be very proactive in booking our excursion to the Bio Bay, almost interrogating the staff member on things like, what to bring, where to go, what time to be picked up, price, etc. Without our prodding, the only information we would have learned was \"We booked a tour for you at 6:30.\" Throughout our stay, we had to make an extreme effort to find out about small things such as our jeep rentals and our airport transfers, laboriously having to check in with the front desk, inquiring about everything from cost, time, location, etc. We were fine with being proactive, but it was not exactly a helpful environment. I could easily see a guest getting sort of lost in the shuffle, with no one guiding him or her and explaining the ways of the resort and the island. Essentially, the staff were all green and did not provide us with the confidence that a more polished, professional staff would have. (I tend to think that this may be a common theme within the W brand as I have reviewed the W in New Orleans and one of the W's in NYC, stating similar issues....) We did not find timing issues to exist the way others have mentioned. The in room dining was always efficient. We had to wait around for about 30-40 minutes at check in, which did not bother us at all, but I could understand someone being very frustrated upon arrival if he/she had to sit around without bags, hoping that the welcome \"ambassador\" would show up soon. Last, I feel like the prices of the resort should be addressed. There is a $60.00 per day resort fee. The food and drinks were pricey, but nothing out of the ordinary from another W in a mid-large sized city. We enjoyed the food and drinks at the pool, once we just accepted that we were going to be paying top dollar. However, I continue to note that the food and beverage prices really did not differ greatly from those of the New Orleans W Hotel. The food at Mix was decent, but nothing monumental and the meal was about $125.00, which is an expensive meal for what I found to be \"hotel food.\" I would recommend skipping Mix for the price, but taking advantage of the pool food, the Living Room bar menu and the in room dining as it was tasty and easy. That being said, the drinks range between $6.00 for a beer to $12.00 for certain mixed drinks. After a day at the pool, with an average of about 3-6 mojitos/beers, 2-4 clubs sodas (I am pregnant so only half of our couple was drinking!) and snacks/lunch, we would spend sometimes up to $85.00. I hope this calculation helps you when deciding on the W. This review was very focused on the actual W Retreat, but I am happy to answer any questions about our experiences on the island, too. We ate at Duffy's, Belly Buttons, Roy's and the Inn at the Blue Horizon. We were disappointed to discover that El Quenepo was closed for hurricane season. We rented a Jeep for two days from Martineau Rentals and enjoyed Media Luna and Red Beach. We, of course, did the Bio Bay tour with Abe's.

I have seen both incarnations, in 2007 and 2010, respectively. W Hotels has completely renovated the old Martineau, and has created a unique W experience that ranks with their best properties (which I consider to include Mexico City and Montreal). They redesigned most structures inside and out, built new units and amenities, and established a consistent reclaimed wood aesthetic throughout that reminds you that you are on a luxurious W property. Or perhaps I should say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a W Retreat,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what it is. This is the W\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second retreat-style resort following its extremely expensive and exclusive Maldives retreat in the Indian Ocean. What makes it a retreat? In addition to all the familiar W qualities (a pool bar, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Living Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lounge, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sweat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gym, coffee shop, conference space, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever Whenever\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd service), the W Retreats have a large spa and a private beach. There are actually two private beaches at the W Retreat, kept exactly as they were when the resort was the Starwood Martineau. They are little coves, bordered on both sides by boulders and coral, so that neither beach is visible from the other. The smaller cove allows topless (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153European style\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) sunbathing. The larger cove is family friendly. Both coves are perfectly fine for sunbathing. But being on the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s northern coast, they do not have ideal water color and temperature. They are totally swimmable. But you will want to drive to the warmer, brilliant turquoise waters of the south coast beaches (Navio, Red, Blue, Garcia, etc.) to enjoy the ideal, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153postcard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Caribbean beach experience. I was a given a full tour of the resort, plus I had lunch at the pool bar, and I have to say, the prices simply do not justify the few advantages that the W offers. The cocktails at the bar are simply not special. They aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t memorable nor strong. The gazpacho is wonderful, but the sandwiches are uninspired. Lunch for two (soup, sandwich, and two cocktails) was over $60. So it was memorable for the wrong reason. The W offers one thing that most hotels on the island do not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c room darkening curtains. Most rooms in Vieques are white, bright, tiled spaces that offer no escape from the morning sun. At least guests at the W can sleep late without being disturbed by sunlight. Another tidbit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the front security gate is completely unnecessary. Yes, this is an exclusive resort for mostly mainland US residents. But Vieques is not some banana republic. It is a lazy island owned by the USA. Considering that the W charges roughly double what most other Vieques hotels charge, and it charges a $60 per night \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcresort fee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on top of that, the W is not a practical place to rest your head at night. Rather, the W is a fine place to stay if you ever earn enough Starwood Preferred Guest points. There are several other fine hotels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even colorful new houses with swimming pools you can rent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for less cash.

After spending the day in San Juan, my friend and I took a 20 minute flight to the island. The W airport lounge was a really nice touch when we arrived, however it was closed on our return. While we went to the airport expecting to sit in an air conditioned lounge with food and drink, we waited 45 minutes in a sweltering hot makeshift terminal. I wish the W had informed us the lounge would we be closed prior to us leaving the hotel. The hotel staff is very friendly and attentive. Everyone tried really hard to make sure all our needs were met and I feel they did a phenomenal job. The hotel is quite nice but I was not to thrilled with the layout.

It was very unappealing especially considering they had private events going on. The beach is very nice and was not crowded at all. The beach staff (Orlando) was awesome as well. All the food on property is handled by Ducasse and is decent but pricey (the breakfast was excellent). Do not go to his hotel if you are on a budget of any kind. The hotel charges a $60 resort fee which includes services that should be standard. At most properties I find a comp bottle of water from SPG, here it was a $9 bottle of Fiji and no other SPG gifts. \"Who's thirsty?\" Not me for 9 bucks a bottle. Lauren at the concierge was very helpful in planning our activities, however, there is not much to do. Outside the hotel there is really nothing much to do at all. The town is almost not even worth checking out. While it may be a nice spot for couples to spend a romantic weekend. If you are looking to party with a buddy or two I suggest you go elsewhere.

Also, the lobster special. Appetizers i recommend the tuna tartare and the cheese plate. AT 6pm they have free drinks in the lobby bar. Service was exceptional.

The W has a special air conditioned room (as part of the airport) just for resort guest where you can get something to drink or eat. Moments later the hotel Jeep picks you up and takes you to the resort. Robert Hunt greeted us at check in and since I had called ahead he was aware of my special occasion. Of all the people I have ever met that were associated with hotels, Robert is far and away the best at making sure your stay goes exceptionally well. Our room was spectacular, the amenities were fantastic. This was a perfect location to relax and take our minds off of business and family obligations. Check out the pictures I have included that range from the room to the awesome pool/cabana and even our special 30th anniversary dinner which was way beyond my expectation. Let me also say the spa/massage was fantastic as well. If I had to change anything with the hotel I would say that the beaches were a bit too rocky for a former Florida boy (but not too bad). And the ice machine didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work in our building during our stay however it simply meant a 30 step walk to another building\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..hardly a complaint. I have read several comments about how pricey the resort is, and those who know the Caribbean are aware that Islands pay extra to bring in supplies and someone has to pay for it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6My experience was that I got more than I expected for what I paid!!! There is a car rental company across the street from the hotel (walking distance) and Robert Hunt was very helpful in assisting us with that reservation so we could explore the island. Our highlights of our day long exploration was clearly the Bioluminescent tour in mosquito lagoon (A DON'T MISS EXPERIECE) and the ability to try out restaurants in the two cities\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..Coconuts and El Quenepo are the best, in that order. Robert also arraigned for our 30th anniversary dinner for two on the cliffs of paradise point overlooking the ocean, followed by the most romantic setting in our room possible upon our return, complete with rose petals, heart shaped towels and candles. Needless to say my wife was surprised and VERY pleased with the evening; I guess she signed up for another 30 years:)!!!!! Thank you Robert and thanks to The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd staff for making my 30th anniversary a week to remember.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGotta get here...\u201d", "Author": "pmeadct", "ReviewID": "UR77569497", "Content": "It was my yearly birthday trip and I chose the W in Vieques. Couple reasons: 1. from NYC area there are tons of nonstop flights with low prices. 2. The flight time is short 3. PR is a US territory - so no long distance roaming charges or text charges or internet usage problems. 4. The W just opened in March, so it was out of the awkward stage and ready for guests. And my verdict - I loved it! The hotel is beautiful, very modern, clean and sparse but not boring. Interesting Art work and unique furnishings are everywhere, making it truly one of a kind. What makes the W special and not just another hotel are a couple of things. First, Vieques is a small quiet island, not a lot of night life, shopping malls, etc. We saw horses roaming free along the roads. So, the island is not heavily commercialized yet. Secondly, with the lack of commercialization, the prices are low - outside of the W that is - for excursions, tours, etc. And Finally, the best part of the W is their staff. I met a few wonderful people there that I would like to thank for making my trip so wonderful. The first is Arelis, the Living Room Bar Manager, she is amazing...the best sangrias that I have ever had. My husband and I followed her from bar to bar to eat lunch with her. The second is Lina, the amazing waitress with Chef's training. My husband loves food and Lina exquisitely described every dish on the menu, down to the sauces and different cooking methods, it was such an education. The last two individuals are Angie and Casey, both waitresses who knew their stuff and were so welcoming and hospitable. I also want to thank Nick from the Phoenician who was incredibly helpful. Thank you again for saving those Taste of the Islands tickets for us we had a great time! Also, thank you goes out to the GM, Jonathan, for personally getting our togo lunches on departure.

We weren't looking to do much of anything, so this fit the bill perfectly. As for the positives/negatives : Positives - Top notch service, especially by Caribbean standards. It's obvious that Starwood is paying a lot of attention to this place judging by the number of staff around (even appears to be people shuttled in from other places). This seemed to be everywhere in the hotel. - Quality of food - our package included in the breakfast buffet - thought they did a really nice job by making it a little better than the typical hotel buffet (no premade eggs, some local things thrown on to the buffet, etc.). We had dinner 2 of the nights and thought the food was really good even if the pricing is all over the place (in some cases, certain entrees seemed really reasonable for the quality while others like the $18 shrimp cocktail with 4 shrimp, made no sense). - The beaches were really nice. Not huge, but they are pretty much private on account of the geographic layout, snorkel and kayak equipment is free (and good quality!). The pool areas are nice and well maintained, plenty of towels (and no silly sign out system), no issue with lack of chairs, etc. - The concierges were helpful with car rental, restaurant suggestions, etc. - The setup with airport picks was awesome (lounge with snacks/drinks while you wait for pickup, get picked up by bellman in private car, etc.) - Rooms were nicely decorated and comfortable. We had a poolside room and had no issue with the music that other people mentioned (though when you're outside, it does get annoying after a while that the music never shuts off :) ) Negatives - Be prepared to spend $$ on everything here. There is nothing within walking distance of the hotel and they know it -so everything is pricey. $13-$15 cocktails by the pool, $5-$7 beers, $9 bottle of Pelligrino, $17 burger, etc. As long you know this going in and accept it as part of the cost of vacation, you'll be fine :). There is a grocery store is that a 3 minute drive away that has cheaper goods to stock up on. The W cafe is also more reasonably priced than the rest of the hotel. - We rented a car for 2 days to explore the rest of the island. We saw some beautiful deserted beaches and we had great dinners at Tradewinds and Cantina La Reina. However, a couple of notes - take the advice everywhere about not leaving valuables in your car/leaving your car unlocked to avoid damage - our car was searched by thieves 2 different times. Also, given the narrow roads, wild horses/dogs, etc., it wasn't exactly a soothing drive in the dark back to the hotels from dinner. I thought it was a bit easier to drive around St. Martin than here. Also, it's not cheap to get off site - a jeep is about $80-$90/day and the W charges $45 to rent a package that includes beach chairs/snorkel/coolers - which is kinda needed if you want to enjoy the beaches. All in all, we enjoyed ourselves.

Sip a couple drinks and wait for the shuttle to take you to the W. Your bags are placed in your room before you even arrive. W arrival is like coming to Jarassic Park. After check-in we were given a tour from the concierge Robert, who by the way kept tabs on us all week and made our stay the most pleasent by providing answers and recommendations to everyone of our wild requests We also arrived just in time for \"Sunset Sip\" which is at 6:15p to 6:30p everyday, a free preset drink and hor d'oeuvres Alcohol prices vary around $15 a drink/ shot on property (we brought some of our own from San Juan and from in town in Vieques. The food at Wet as well as the Living Room was good, nothing exceptional. Though our dinner at Mix was phenominal! In an effort to see some things outside of the hotel and get some cheaper food we took cabs to Esperanza (There are only 4 on Vieques, and avg. $5 to 10 ea. way person). After so many cab rides, I'd recommend renting a car ($70-$90 a day), or a scooter ($50 a day). You will also need some sort of private transportation because these cabs won't go off road to the private beaches (Red and Blue were my favorite). We took the snorkal gear off property and went to the pier and saw some cool fish. My friend was daring enough to kayak from the W beach to the island 2mi. out. In Esperanza is were we rented jet skis and the scooters (Fun Brothers Co.) The staff is really knowledgable of what's in town, and where is the best place is to find anything. Cash is king in town. Don't bother taking your SPG Amex out, because the W is the only place that will take it. Merchants will take Visa or MC, but the cabbies won't. Beware, as many of the horror stories I've heard before, we did get stranded one evening in town. No cabs were answering their phones and the W had to personally get us. It was all fun though The demographic at the W was \"older\", 30-40ish and very \"couple'y\" There's not a whole lot of mingling going on and it's super quite. Beware, the Living Room lounge (bar & kitchen) shuts down around 10p. The late night menu is bleak (Turkey Club, Tom., Basil, Motz plate, 2oz Ham, and Cheese Plate).

We got to the resort on the complimentary transportation and checked in. When our ambassador took us to our room, there was a leak in the AC unit. We went back to the lobby where we were upgraded to a higher room class for our trouble. (we were booked into a Fabulous room and were upgraded to a Spectacular room.

It was just a short walk to the Living Room, restaurant and pool from our room, and we were right across from the gym and cafe. Speaking of the cafe, the gelato/sorbetto there was excellent. We thought the food and service at Mix, the hotel restaurant was great. We had the breakfast buffet each day, which included cooked-to-order eggs, smoothies, pretty much whatever you wanted. Dinner was ok the first night, great the last night. I think it was being tired from traveling somewhat the first night, plus the effects flying has on your taste. We also had lunch at the pool one day, the salads we had were great. Jason had a pedicure at the spa, he was very pleased with the pedicure and the woman who performed it. Couple words of warning. There is only one (maybe 2) ATM's on the island, so bring some cash. You will need some if you decide to go out to dinner or something. We had emailed about a rental car.

We stay at W hotels across the US for work and we love the chain. However, this hotel was no representative of a typical W. If you are expecting a trendy, plush hotel.....don't go here. This W has more of a rustic type of a feel. And the \"whatever, whenever\" phrase ONLY applies to the employees. You'll get your food, drinks, room on the W's schedule, not yours. I know every new hotel has some kinks to iron out but this is by far the worst opening I've ever seen. Case in point, our first day we had lunch by the pool and a waitress brought over hummus & pita. We thought it was complimentary so we started eating it. The waitress rushes back and says it was delivered by mistake, takes it from us, and serves a half eaten appetizer to another table! That's just gross. There is NO excuse for that. And that's just one of the many horror stories we have. Some of the other highlights of our trip: extremely uncomfortable beds, broken ice maker, no elevators (pack light), 1 hr+ for room service, limited menu at their restaurant, and poor service.

But when it comes to the W group, this one surpasses all that I've stayed at thus far. Being an SPG Platinum member I was in touch with the property (thanks Jonathan & Joe!) prior to my stay and was quickly up-graded to a Marvelous Suite while still utilizing points for the 2 two nights. All I can say is that the gorgeousness, sprawling space and comfortability of the room matched the entire resort as a whole. My experience started upon landing with a private W lounge at the Vieques airport where the staff there immediately set the tone for what was in store. Believe me when I say that this property excels with the \"Whatever, Whenever\" mentality. And they do it with an air of ease and honesty that doesn't come across as forced or robotic as I've felt in other W locations. This place is exactly the place to go (be it with family, friends or lovers) when you want to get away from it all and not have to do anything. I suggest you indulge in the amazing pools, the two beaches, the couches off the living room or one of the many hammocks across the property. There ain't much in ways of entertainment in the evenings, but again, at a place like this, who really cares? Save that for San Juan. My only 'warning' for any potential visitor is to take note of the costs that you'll incur that starts w/ a hefty nightly deposit up to $250, the daily resort fees of $65ish dollars and the heavily priced items on all menus and in-room bar (i.e. $9 water & $125 small bottle of Patron). But if you are expecting to get away from it all while still having access to the smaller 'fun' things in life, then stop complaining or go somewhere else. This place ain't cheap, but in my opinion its worth it. Oh, and if you are staying longer than 2 days, definitely look into renting a car so you can really explore the island and see all the beaches. There really is a lot to see outside of the resort and with limited island transportation, a car will get it done quick.

Food: We only ate at Mix one night - it was great - pricey and nice - we found stellar restaurants throughout the island - see reviews for SOL Food, Next Course and Belly Buttons. Personnel: Get ready to adjust to \"island time\" but ALL of the staff at the W was amazing. Standouts include: Jonathan (GM) - A Kiwi with a warm greeting and is always visible and helpful on the property. Robert- Manager of Mix/Living Room - what a personality and so helpful with all things island. Best of All: Lindsay (Whatever/Whenever) - she went above and beyond and was key to making our trip a complete success - we want to adopt her. She gave us an insider view to the island and none of our time was wasted or ill-spent - seek out Lindsay - she is awesome. To Do on the Property: The spa is nice - limited staff and offerings but beautiful. Great massage from Marco. The W Cafe has the best sorbet on the planet - try the CocoLime. The gym is state of the art - killer workouts. SNORKEL RIGHT AT THE HOTEL - some of the best snorkeling I have done in my life - right off the hotel beaches - small reefs house thousands of colorful - and friendly - fish.

Let's start with the island. We flew from San Juan in a 9 passenger plane, first for my wife and she was very nervous. The plane was fine and only 15 minutes. The only other option is a ferry which we almost did, only $2 each way but 1.5 hour trip. We heard horror stories from other travelers who chose this route, spend the extra money and fly. The W hotel has a very comfortable lounge at the airport where you can have a drink and a few snacks while you are waiting for a van to take you to the hotel. The hotel is a 5 minute drive from the airport. Rent a for a day or two and explore the island. The island is 5 mile wide and 20 miles long and very easy to navigate. The first day we drove to Red beach, the hotel will rent you beach chairs, towels, snorkeling gear, umbrella, cooler and beach mats for 2 or 4 people, we had 4 and the $45 charge was worth it. There is a jeep rental agency very close to the W, they will pick you up and drop you off or you could walk. We rented a 4 passenger jeep for $90 a day. Spend the morning at the red beach and then go to a beautiful little town called Esperanza. Great views, food and night life. The is very little in the way or transportation options so I would recommend renting a jeep. In the afternoon we went to blue beach and back to Esperanza for a few drinks. Now for the hotel. What a great experience. The hotel lobby, or you living room as they call it, is exceptional. Seating is abundant with great views of the ocean from everywhere. You could only hope you living room was like this. The food is expensive, as you would expect at a island resort, but was exceptional. From fish to steak every dish was great, we ate there 3 times and by far the best food on the island. Try The Next Course restaurant, 5 minute drive, it was very good. Bar food at Duffy's in Esperanza was also very good. The room was beautiful and well equipped, ask for a first floor unit, you can walk out you door to the pool or beach. The pool was very nice, and the bar was great. Service was exceptional, ice water, frozen grapes were served all day and your towel was replaced when you left your chair with a new one. The beach is steps away from the pool and was beautiful. Very calm water and nice sand. We never saw more than 2 or 3 couples on the beach at a time. Not much to do for kids, we did not bring ours and did not see any all week. The concierge, Jorge was awesome. Helped us throughout the trip. All of the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, whatever/whenever is their motto and they live up to it. This is one of the best managed properties I have ever been to. A quick shout out to Oscar, hotel employee that seemed to be everywhere, knew us by name and was a wealth of knowledge. You will not be disappointed with Vieques as a vacation destination, especially the W Hotel. We arrived on Sunday 6/27 and were supposed to depart Thursday 7/1.

We were treated very well as soon as we entered the hotel - except for one situation. We decided to do a Bio Bay tour (Abe's Tours $30/pp) and they were scheduled to pick us up at 6pm. We were told to bring cash, but when we got to the lobby at 5:30, the ATM was out of money. They did not know when it would be refilled. The concierge and front desk manager (?) let us know that they talked to the person with Abe's Tours and we could pay them tomorrow.

Maybe they were speaking down to us because we are young (23-24), but regardless, this was not our fault. Moving on - food was expensive. Everything we did order was very good, but I definitely suggest stocking up on some food (and maybe some beverages!) and eating in Isabel Segunda (try Conoco's) or Esperanza. It was difficult for us to do this because we did not rent a car. I suggest doing this at least 1 day. Cabs were pretty reliable for us.. but nonetheless, it is a hassle and can be costly when used every day. Now for the good things! This is such a beautiful property! We received an amenity upon arrival (maybe because we're Platinum?) - this really made us feel special! We had a beautiful ocean view. They said we were upgraded? I guess they meant with the ocean view. The room was spacious with a very cool tub. Pool was awesome! Renting snorkeling equipment and keeping it on the premises is free! It was only $15/day to take them off the property. The beach had steep shelves, waves and large rocks - I stuck to the pool. We had a great stay. Pricey but we knew that going into it.

Yes, there is music playing everywhere. Yes, the food is wildly expensive and not too varied (restaurant, bar, pool bar, & room service all pretty much operate off the same menu). You're either going to love this place or just not be thrilled with it. I would find it difficult to believe anyone could hate a resort as beautiful as this.

Thank you! Thank you! Opinions will naturally range based upon one's own expectations and experiences so for those that didn't write a glowing review, I think that their expectations were just incorrect before arriving. This is a boutique hotel and although part of the larger Starwood group, the resort feels intimate and relaxed. You don't feel as though you are at a large overcrowded resort. It is a W. If you know the W chain, then you will expect a certain \"feeling\" upon arriving. The lights are dim, yes, music fills the air most days, the seating is low and comfortable with plenty of places to curl up with a book, play one of the many games provided in the living room or just chill. It is all part of the ambiance. If you care for that, then you will love it, if you don't...well .... your choice. There is a resort fee and the food is on the expensive side. It is a luxury resort. Expect it upon arriving and you won't be surprised. The W staff will pick you up from the airport (if that's how you arrive) and take you to the hotel for no charge. If you want to get out and explore the island, I'd highly recommend a car. You can walk to one of the car rental locations or the W will drive you to others nearby. There are plenty of casual restaurants to visit around the island that have less expensive and more casual food if that's what you are in the mood for. There are 2 private beaches that are on the resort property, both very private and beautiful. The water is amazingly warm and there is some decent snorkeling off of both. The W provides plenty of huge towels, chairs, water, etc. at both locations. Depending upon your preference, you can choose a villa on the ocean side facing the water in villas 1-4 or choose a villa that surrounds the pool with the ocean beyond that in villas 5-17. We loved our oceanside view and rarely went to the pool as the beach was just one of the best little spots to hang out and soak up the sun. The rooms are spacious providing for just about anything you'd want and decorated in fun colorful colors that remind you that you're not at home anymore. The linens and bed are top quality and incredibly comfortable. At the entrance to your room is a small spot to throw down wet towels and kick off your shoes before entering the room. The fitness center is quite large for a hotel and has plenty of new equipment and is next to a small W cafe where you can grab coffee in the morning or have them pack a picnic lunch for you if you go out for a beach day on the island. (beware of the roaming free wild horses while driving around) We will be back and in the meantime....we're going to try and find a way to bring a little slice of this heaven to my home if it's just the aromatherapy candles that get me there.

I seek out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experiences and I encourage you to view hotels I have stayed at and their respective reviews (by clicking on my name). LOCATION: Great. A car ride away from other restaurants but in a nice spot with 2 beaches and ocean views throughout property. BEST WAY TO GET THERE: W lounge at airport will provide complimentary shuttle to hotel. TYPE OF ROOM: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8Spectacular pool/ocean & later Ocean View BED/SHEETS/PILLOW: Excellent. Same as other W Hotels which to me set the standard for the best beds, sheets, and pillows at any hotel. LIGHTING: Good in bedroom and great in bathroom. Would prefer a little more light in bedroom. BATHROOM/SHOWER: Bathroom is part of bedroom so there would be very little privacy for people not in a relationship. Shower is rain shower only. Bathtub is very cool looking but not very comfortable. TOILETRIES: Bliss products\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 very good. CLEANLINESS: Hotel is 2 months old and everything is spotless. A/C: Worked very well. CLOSET SPACE: Decent amoun but a bit small for 2 people to unpack all items. STYLE OF ROOM: Very nice. Great style\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just like the website photos. Oceanview/pool room was more of a partial ocean view and was disappointing. COMMON AREA: Outstanding atmosphere. One of the more beautiful resorts I have stayed at. Restaurant, pool, and beaches are all excellent. Downside is music is played non-stop\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 perhaps ok at a city hotel but not a resort when you are there 24/7. Music becomes very annoying. QUIET/MORNING LIGHT: Pool/Ocean view room was too loud. The music by the pool would turn into constant bass when the doors were closed. It starts at 930a (6:30am CA time) and woke us up. It ends at 10pm at night. Sunlight could be blocked with curtains. FOOD: Mixed. Breakfast was good and dinner went from mediocre to excellent. The really only very good entr\u00c3\u00a9e we had was the halibut\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and we ate here 3 nights in a row. Dinner entrees range from $25-$40 which would be ok if the restaurant quality matches the pricing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We had shrimp one night that smelled so bad. Breakfast ending at 11:00a (8:00 am CA time) is just too early. What happened to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhatever whenever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as this request is basic. TV/INTERNET: Internet is wifi with ok-good speed and no charge (part of $60/day resort fee). TV is flat screen and should be larger given the distance from the bed. SERVICE: Very friendly, but inexperienced and terrible service. Too many issues to mention them, but mistakes seemed to happen non-stop. Phone calls to reception would go 20 rings without an answer, staff doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow through on requests even when told it was a second request. Complain nicely to the right people and they will deliver. Staff is just too new and incompetent. SUMMARY: Know what you are getting into and this resort could be awesome. Be sure to stay on the quiet side at whatever the cost or perhaps just go to a different resort. Expect bad service, average food, and then enjoy the beautiful resort, pool, and beaches. We rented a car at the place directly across from the W hotel (Marquinez??) and were very happy with the service although the car was not in great shape.

There are wonderful small guest houses, Casa de Armistad in particular, but we often work while traveling and we needed some services that only a more complete hotel could offer. We found it at the W Retreat. The property is beautiful, taking into consideration the beachfront location set a short ride from both the main towns on the island. The rooms were designed to feel cool and contemporary as well as comfortable. The staff was more than friendly. As we visited within a couple of weeks of its opening, the staff was still learning but we felt they were all happy to be part of this new upscale property. The food was terrific. Alain Ducasse has been involved and while we were there, the one representative of his staff left after a few days and another was brought in to oversee. We enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner and brought some local friends over for the experience. Vieques is not Ibiza - if you are looking for extremely lively nightlife, you will not find it here. You will find a relaxing atmosphere, great drinks, beautiful swimming and snorkeling, and this property is very romantic yet lighthearted. Is it perfect? No, but it is human. And those who love Vieques feel that this addition to its development will be enough to be comfortable wtihout changing the things that bring people year after year.

A few things you should know if you get a room by the pool there is music on from about 9am-11pm, so if you want quiet ask for rooms on the other side. They have 8am yoga and 6pm sunset appetizer/ cocktails daily. Food & bevs are very expensive - I recommend hitting the supermarket to stock up for the room. Really close to the airport - W provides free transportation service. Staff was super helpful. Awesome gym. I would suggest renting a car (free parking at hotel) b/c taxi service is expensive to/ from restaurants and beaches. To go roundtrip to dinner was $25 and we rented a car for $35 per day for 2 of the days. And at least you can zoom around and explore unless all you want to do is chill out at the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel and be sure to check different sites b/c there were varying prices - I got the best deal on hotels.com and W price matched with their Best Price Guarantee program.

There were no waits for dining tables or pool/beach chairs. The rooms are very \"W\" and every little touch was what we expected from the nice robes to the well-stocked minibar. The lounge at the airport was nice and we were greeted with snacks and cold drinks before being shuttled in new jeeps with a/c to the resort just a short drive away for no charge and bags delivered to our room. The website photos are accurate. The food was great, although we never, in 5 meals, got a correct order. Our room wasn't ready til 8pm, so they comped our first meal and drinks as would be expected. The sliders are great with slaw. The lobster curry was great as well. Other guests mentioned they thought the on-site menus were expensive, I thought they were reasonable and I was happy to pay for the nice meals as I would in any American restaurant. Overall the property itself was perfect! The staff were gracious and bent over backwards to help, but given the remote location the anything/anytime philosophy was hard to live up to even with a simple request for a cigar, it took 24 hours but Bree came through and got some for us. We took a taxi to Fun Brothers (booked through the concierge) for a night kayak tour of the bio bay and even with a lot of little mishaps with the tour company I would highly recommend doing the kayak tour so you can explore and swim on your own.

Upon arrival at the airport, we were invited into the W Hotel room and offered cocktails and water -- a welcome relief given the heat. Check-in was a bit of a challenge. I had expected it to go more smoothly and easy; however, it seemed staff are still not fully proficient with accepting guests. And it took us several attempts to get the benefit of our packaged rate (not offered the cocktails and beach bag). The hotel's motto of \"Whatever, Whenever\" seemed to fit the staff. Good things: The atmosphere, pool, beach, rooms, and staff (very friendly and helpful) were all great. The lobby was also very well done. Things to Improve: Food prices are too high, and getting a check seemed to take some effort and patience. I would recommend that management provide more instruction to staff on service expectations. The breakfast buffet is $30/person and dinner will run you over $60/person; about a mile away, you can find great local fare for less than half the price. On the other side of the island in Esperanza, you'll find great seafood at reasonable prices and half the price of W Hotel. This is a $300/night hotel. We felt it was overpriced given the cost of other locations on the island. The hotel does not yet have a gift shop. The W cafe is supposed to be open 9 - 5 but we found it closed one day during lunch. Wireless internet is free and available but, those staying in the villas #100swere unable to connect.

We travelled with a 1 year old and his two and a half year old sister. Many of the staff are locals with young children and we found them to be so patient and caring toward our little ones it made our stay so much more relaxing. Twin beaches absolutely pristine and safe for kids. The resort fee includes unlimited on-property snorkeling and kayaking gear. Top quality mountain bikes with kid seats $10/hr. 2 minutes from the tiny, recently polished and shined vieques airport complete with a cozy lounge for W guests and free transport to/from.

One has to appreciate the confidence of a hotel that opens Easter weekend to a full house. A full house was quite a challenge for the staff, but they managed to pull it off with just a few hiccups. We were upgraded to an oceanfront room that was spacious and sleek. The bed was comfy...as a gadget fan, it was nice to have a flat screen television (that allowed easy hook up for a video camera so you could review any footage that you shot earlier in the day), dvd player and an iPod docking system that provided excellent sound quality. I had no trouble with my iPhone, surprisingly the area was even AT&T 3G. The pool area was beautiful, but small, with only six cabanas. During our stay, the cabanas were free, but staff were confused about how they could be claimed...one told us that they were first come, first served, but another said you needed to reserve them at the pool bar. The other contentious issue was that guests who were not in the cabana would use the lounge chairs immediately in front of the cabana. This caused more than one dispute, all of which could have been alleviated if both the reserved cabana and accompanying lounge chairs were marked with signage from the hotel showing that they were reserved. We were disappointed that the gift shop was not opened yet. There was a small ice cream/deli that was open that carried several products, some of them very peculiar. It was a mystery to us why they would stock their shelves with bags of pasta or a tin of olive oil, but yet not carry aspirin, deodorant or toothpaste. Granted, I am sure that these necessities will eventually be sold, it is a mystery as to why they weren't there from the start in lieu of the pasta and olive oil. As many have reported, the island is just starting to become popular with tourists. While some may welcome the undiscovered nature of this, for us, it was a bit frustrating. The W is a bit isolated (and with restaurant choices on site being limited), it is necessary to go to the nearby towns. Cab fare was $5 per person, no matter if there is one person traveling (or in on of our excursions packed with 13 people) ...but the drivers are highly unreliable and apparently in short supply. One night we were stranded at 9 pm at Belly Buttons, fortunately, the bar's owner was kind enough to make the 15 minute drive to take us to the hotel. While we found limited activities on the island (the concierge needs to do a better job having information regarding what activities are available,) but made the trip to Bio Bay with Island Adventures and enjoyed that. (To be fair, because of the crowds that flocked to a festival on the Island over Easter weekend, we opted to avoid the masses and enjoy the tranquility of the hotel.)

We arrived at the property via ferry on the morning after it opened after spending 3 nights at the Waldorf on the main island. I must say that I was a little worried about having kids at the W and also knowing that it had just opened, would they be able to function with minimal hiccups? After arriving on the ferry with my family, we were immediately greeted by the director of operations (Oscar) in one of the new W jeeps and he would not let me lift a finger to help him with my baggage. He had bottles of H2O waiting for us and insisted that he would take us on a tour of the island and its hidden gems including quaint towns, hard to find beaches with wild horses running free and must do restaurants. We were certainly receiving the Platinum treatment but I do feel he would go out of his way for anyone. Some people are just molded that way and he is all about bringing happiness. Next, we pull into this dramatic entrance with the traditional W greeting you at the gate. We then drove about a 1/2 mile lined with 2 story beautiful villas to the great house. WOW!!! when you walk in, it takes your breath away. Once inside, you can see right through the back to a fire pit and the cliff and ocean beyond that. To your right, you have a massive living room and to your left and great bar and lounge. beyond the living room on your right, is the famous Alan Ducasse Restaurant that has such a romantic feel to it. We were greeted by the lobby staff including Bree and Sandra who immediately felt like family and when you meet Jorge you will know what I am talking about. He not only exceed my expectations, he was on another planet. Bree, informed me that I have been upgraded and we were very thankful. We were upgraded to a WOW suite and let me tell you, You say Wow when you walk in to this beautiful 2 room suite. We also had the best location with a dramatic view of a small cliff and ocean. you can walk out of the suite through 2 sets of sliders from either room on to a patio and the grass to the edge of the cliff. The last night, while our children slept, Mr. Al Lopez, Alan Ducasse's GM set an intimate table for 2 on the edge of the cliff with a 3 course tasting menu and wine pairing over candle and moonlight so we can have a romantic evening. Again, going beyond expectations. The Pool area called WET again very well done and the staff equally incredible. Pablo and Blane were tremendous. My worries about the kids being with us quickly disappeared when we saw how many other children were there and the staff seemed to love having the kids around. It is such a peaceful place and well worth the wait. The spa will certainly be a treat for those spa lovers and the fitness center is state of the art for the great workout. There are Yoga classes outside and just like everything else here the sense of Zen is with you. We travel plenty and I must say this resort was breath taking. We were so sad to leave. In the traditional Oscar way. He insisted on taking us to the airport and not letting me lift a finger. The airport was close by and the W even has its own waiting area where you can continue to feel on vacation till your Cessna arrives. This Place Rocks and the staff is what makes this place rock.
