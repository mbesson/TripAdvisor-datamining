I suppose they dont see the need to be polite as they get thousands of tourists that will keep on visiting. It would not be a city I would recommend visiting. Our hosts at Hotel Maikol were excellent, English was pretty good and they were more than helpful & friendly, rooms and bathrooms were spotless everyday. Location was pretty central, metro was practically outside the door, so it was a great base for getting around.

We were greeted by the owner of the hotel who apologised our room wasn't ready even though we were very early and hadn't expected it to be. She was extremely helpful in explaining how to get where we needed to be and this continued throughout the trip. The room we were given had a great view of the piazza, was very large and spotlessly clean with comfy beds... Something inhave found to be hit and miss during other european trips.We were served breakfast each morning at a time of our choice which was lovely and plentiful. A great way to start the day. They even delivered a packed breakfast of croissants to our room on our morning of departure as we had to leave at 7am. The hotel is well placed for the colosseum - a brisk 10minute walk and also for accessing the rest of Rome including the Vatican city which can be accessed via the metro from right outside the hotel. About 15minutes journey. Other reviews have commented on the area. Although it is a less salubrious area if Rome we never felt threatened and food nd drink was generally cheaper than in other areas. Overall a great choice if you want a clean, comfortable and great value stay in Rome with fantastic service.

The en-suite bathroom was good, we had no problems with the shower heat or pressure consistency, although the soap holder had probably seen better days. The only downsides we had was that the person that lived above us (we were in room 9) would get up about an hour before we did and it sounded like they dragged their chair along the floor which was really loud in our room so often woke us up before we were ready to get up, although this wouldn't be a problem if you normally wake up before 7am and we don't think that is within the hotel's control. Also the hairdryer did not have a permanent on switch (presumably to save electricity as there were only 3 plug sockets in our room as well) so my hand often got cramp whilst drying my hair, but again not a problem if you don't intend to use the hairdryer!

The room is a nice size, is clean, and has a small refrigerator. The shower was small, but then all of the shower stalls we saw in Italy were small! The breakfast provided was excellent (2 of us got 2 hot ham and cheese sandwiches, 2 danish rolls, 2 yogurts, and a 4 to 6 cup pot of great coffee - at least a 20 Euro value!). Previous reviews have done a great job of describing the location - the MAS description is right on. To go a little further, it's an easy 5 to 8 minute walk from the exit at the #28 platform at the termi station, the platform used for the FCO airport express train (if you come in on a different train, follow the signs to #28 and exit there). When you exit, walk down the street that's straight ahead (Radison Hotel will be 1st building on your left) for 3 blocks where it ends at the west side of Piazza V. Emanuele II. Look to your right and you'll see 2 buildings on the north side of the Piazza - Hotel Maikol is located toward the end of the 2nd building, just past the large MAS sign. Betty is great, and will let you leave your suitcases there if you arrive before their 2 p.m. check-in (we did, and our suitcases were in our room when we returned. The Metro station is really convenient to the hotel - just between those 2 buildings on the north side of the Piazza.

Overall we had a great experience staying there and would definitely stay there again without hesitation. Getting there: We took a train into Rome that arrived at Termini station. Getting to the hotel from there is very easy. It's only a short 10 minute walk. Just make sure you get out on the right side of Termini station. If you look on google maps you can see where you should go. As others have pointed out, finding the actual hotel is a bit of a mystery but following the excellent advice posted here it is easy. Just look for the MAS sign and there are two large wooden doors next to it. You'll see Hotel Maikol on the intercom list. Just press that and you're good to go. Once you go through the wooden doors there is another metal door immediately to your right where you will need to use the intercom again. Then use the elevator to the second floor and you'll see the hotel. Location: The hotel is right outside a station on the metro A line and a few minutes from the main transportation hub (Termini). Getting to any of the tourist destinations is very easy as most are situated within walking distance of a stop on the metro lines. You will likely have to take the metro though - we did not feel that most attractions were within walking distance. The Colosseum is probably the closest and would be about 15 min but it was easier to just take the train rather than try and navigate through the streets. We had to take a flight back out of Ciampino airport and there is a bus that leaves just outside Termini station every couple hours or so. We took the cotral bus which isn't heavily advertised but it is on time, far less crowded than the other bus services to the airport and easy to get to. There is a stand outside the station where you wait and you buy the tickets from the driver. It costs 3.90 euros each. Some people have mentioned the area is a bit sketchy / feeling unsafe. We felt none of that at all. We got in fairly late on a couple days (after dark) and didn't feel unsafe at all. There are a lot of immigrants in the area, but we had no problems. The room: We had a room overlooking the piazza and it was very nice as your get lots of sunlight streaming through. There are shutters for the evening if you don't want the light. The room itself is also very spacious. There is a wardrobe to hang your items and a shelf within that as well. A large desk with the mini-fridge under it is also present as well as two nightstand tables. There isn't an alarm clock (or any clock) in the room so you'll have to have your own. The room is tiled and was very clean. We had two double beds pushed together. The bed and pillows were fairly firm (we prefer that). There is a wall safe in the room that is key operated. So you'll have to take the key with you when you go out if you want to use it. The hotel itself was also very quiet - I think there are only about 10 rooms so we didn't hear any sort of noise in the morning or evening. The bathroom: The bathroom was fairly large and has a shower stall, toilet, sink and bedet. The stall is a little small but big enough for one person to manage. The shower pressure and temperature control are excellent. In terms of toiletries, you get a bar hand soap and liquid shower gels. There is no shampoo/conditioner so bring your own. The towels are mostly cloth-like as others have mentioned but that didn't bother us. Breakfast: The breakfast consists of a glass of orange juice, a beverage of your choice (tea, coffee, milk or cappuccino), a pastry (usually a croissant), a cup of yogurt (usually strawberry flavor), as well as any necessary condiments (jam, butter, etc.). For two of us, we each got the items above (so 2 of each item). Note: usually the front desk asks what time you want breakfast (within 8am - 10am) and what beverage you want when you check-in. You should specify if they don't ask. Also, the milk by default comes hot so if you want it cold you should specify that. Service: The room was cleaned nicely each day and since the facility is owner operated you feel very welcomed and get personal service. The owner lady is very nice and will show you where everything is on the map when you get in and explain how to get there. You do have to carry around the 4 keys for each of the doors to get into the hotel but that didn't bother us. We also got in a day late due to a transit strike in Rome on the day we were supposed to get in and we called the hotel ahead of time to alert them. They acknowledged and said they would work it out when we got in. Upon check-in they agreed not to charge us for the night we weren't there even though they left the room empty.

Location is great for the sights of Rome, although as mentioned by a previous reviewer it is within a largely migrant area. This wasnt really a problem and there were plenty of nice Italian restaurants in the vicinity. You should take care at night as some of the \"nightwalkers\" do look a little dodgy, although you are probably in no more danger than you would be in walking around any other capital city at night. Word on Rome itself - great place to see with a rich history to immerse yourself in - we had a fantastic 3 days. One piece of advice I would give is dont be convinced by tour guides that the queues for main attractions are long (trying to sway you with queue jumping tickets) without checking first. We were told that the queue for the Colloseum was 45mins when in fact it was 5 and the Vatican museum was 1hour 50 when in fact there was absolutely no queue at all and we walked straight in. The giveaway is that if there are no tour guides at the entrance then they obviously know they cant convince you there is a queue!! Hotel Maikol is well recommened as a clean base for exploring Rome at a price you will find hard to beat!!!!", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location in a dodgy neighbourhood\u201d", "Author": "soul_man19", "ReviewID": "UR107736028", "Content": "When we got to Rome, our driver told us that the neighbourhood we were staying in wasn't where a lot of Italians stayed at but rather home to the many migrants you see around the city.

The cost is 4.50 euros using cash as opposed to 19.50 euros if purchased online beforehand.

We were looking for something that was under 100 Euros a night and was in a good location (no car). I had visited Rome before and stayed in the Termini area (near the train station) and found it was a great area to walk from and to get transit from. I started to look there and was lucky enough to find the Maikol. It had an elevator and air conditioning (2 of our requirements) as well as good reviews on trip advisor. We booked it for both the beginning and end of our trip. We arrived from the airport by taxi and it was a little tricky to find. There is no big sign out front but it is right beside a large discount department store named Mas that has a huge red/white sign so just look for that and you will easily locate the big wooden door. They buzz you up but there are a few wide marble steps (approx 6) you have to walk up from the elevator to the actual door of the hotel. Keep this in mind if you have a lot of luggage or mobility issues. It was not an issue for us and they are very helpful, so I am sure they would assist if you needed it. We arrived very early but were told we could leave our luggage and come back in half an hour and the room would be ready. When we returned our luggage was in our room. Betty (the owner) gave us a map and showed us how to get to everything by bus and also gave us site seeing and restaurant recommendations. Some quite close to the hotel. Those we tried were good. There is also a subway startion (metro) right outside the hotel. Termini is only 10 minutes walking which was also good for catching the hop on hop off tours, train to our cruise port and busses around the city. Walk around the square that the hotel is in there is a nice perfume shop (Limone), a few leather shops and some other cute shops and cafes. There is also a convenience store around the corner if you need drinks, snacks, toiletries etc. Breakfast is included in the room price. It is a continental breakfast with fresh pastries, yogurt, OJ and coffee or cappuccino. Trust me get the cappuccino - it was great and I looked forward to it every morning. They do not have a business center, but they do have free wifi. They also offered to let us use their hotel computer if we did not have our own wifi device. There was also an assortment of books on Rome that you could borrow. The room was large and very clean. It was not fancy but the bed was really comfortable and there was a small fridge. They provided drinks that were actually cheap (not like most mini-bars). There were complimentary candies in the room. The air conditioner worked great. I had read on several other hotel reviews that some hotels charge extra if you use the air conditioner - there was none of that nonsense there. The bathroom was a good size and included a bidet. The shower was small but typical for Europe. The only draw back was that the towels were not very absorbent. The material was more like tea towel fabric or cloth napkins. Still they gave you several and they were clean. I can not say enough about the service - everyone was super friendly and I very much enjoyed our stay. When we were leaving our prearranged taxi did not show up. I went back into the hotel to ask Betty to call our driver to see when he would be there. His phone was off. She offered to call a friend that has a car service and was able to get someone within 10 minutes to pick us up. His charge was 5 Euros more then the other company but well worth it for the quick service and it was still much less than we had paid to get to the hotel from the airport. She even had the young lady who was working there go down and wait with us because she knew the car. She made sure we got off okay and Betty gave us a wave from upstairs. It was a great trip and this hotel would definately be where I would spend my next trip to Rome as well.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hidden Spot\u201d", "Author": "bbbradk", "ReviewID": "UR83033430", "Content": "We just got back from a fantastic trip to Rome. We booked at the Maikol based on the great reviews here, and the great price. The hotel as several had mentioned is a little hard to find, unlike most hotels there is no sign, simply a buzzer for them beside a large doorway. Getting the luggage up was a bit of a pain (we were in Europe for 3 weeks so had lots, had to take it through the large door, then get buzzed in to a second doorway inside, up 2 steps to the elevator, then down around 8 stairs on a wide set of spiral stairs leading to the door). Check in was easy, Betty told us that our room would be ready in about half an hour (we were checking in early) and gave us a map with suggestions on where to have lunch nearby. We dropped off our bags and headed out. Upon our return, our bags were waiting for us in our room. As well, Betty got us a new map and drew directions to pretty much anything anyone would want to see. The room was quite large with a big mural sticker behind the bed with some mountain range. There was a small flat screen tv mounted on the wall (reception was great, but here were no english channels at all lol) There was a remote for the tv, as well as one to control the rooms air conditioner (it worked really well, on a warm day you could make the room cool in only a few minutes) The bathroom was large with a toilet, bidet (never used one, so didn't start) and a shower (rather small, but par for the course in Europe). The only bad thing I would say about the bathroom is the towels, they were like napkins you would get from a restaurant, and the bath towel seemed like a large paper towel. My favorite part about staying here was the fantastic breakfast delivered every morning, it would have a few fresh pastries, some yogurt, orange juice, and a fantastic cappuccino. We still miss the cappuccino. The staff was always super friendly, and the neighborhood had a great location, easy to walk to many sights, and a subway right beside the hotel if something was not walking distance. On our final day we had prearranged a pick up from the cab that brought us to the hotel from the airport (all of the airport cabs offer a return trip for much less than the trip to the city, you just need to call ahead to book). We waited more than 20 minutes for our cab before asking the hotel to call and ask when he was coming. When they called, the driver had his phone turned off (even though we had prebooked the day before). The hotel called a driver friend of theirs who was there in a few minutes, and only charged 5 euros more than the discounted rate our cab had promised.

As per previous reviews, we found Elizabeth to be very hospitable and helpful. She pointed out places for us to eat and nearby attractions. She also packed us a breakfast the night before when we had an early day trip the next day and helped us decipher some train tickets that were written in Italian. A small (and reasonably priced) mini bar was available. The bathroom was very clean and our room cleaned daily. We were also able to leave our luggage on the morning of our check out which enabled us to continue sightseeing, rather than being bogged down with all our bags. The only thing we would mention was that if you are tall and get room 8, don\u2019t expect much leg room whilst sitting on the toilet as it is a little cramped because the bathroom is the corner bathroom; we doubt however that it would be this situation in every room. We would definitely return to Maikol if ever in Rome again and thank Elizabeth for going above and beyond during our stay. Directions for future stays at Maikol: We agree with previous reviews stating that it was hard to locate Maikol. We turned right off Napoleone III and then asked for directions at another nearby hotel. We\u2019ve uploaded some photos which hopefully may help give some familiarity to the area. Look for the big red \u2018MAS\u2019 sign, walk up to it and the hotel plaque is virtually on the wall to the right of where you are standing.

Her images and stories of Italy always fueled my curiosity, and I found it quite a shame never to have visited Italy before, even I have visited other Mediterranean countries frequently and with lots of pleasure. So Rome, the ancient city full of Architecture and culture was a random choice, more based on the wonderfully cheap deal from Easyjet than a commited choice. It turned out to be an excellent choice for a first time Italy visitor, and the hotel Maikol had so much to do with the safe and wonderful experience, as it is fantastic to recapture your strengths after a full day walking around a city with so much impressions. First, the rooms have that bit of Mediterranean 70s/80s cosiness which can be a bit frilly for some, but I liked it for its home-like feel. The beds are wonderful, a bit on the harder side, but that is something I do not mind spending the time in a hotel (a softer feel makes me aware that several other people have slept on that same spot). I really loved that the aircondition would stay on even when I was away, so I could arrive in a fresh room. Not that Rome was explicibly hot during that time (a 28-30 c), but it is still a fresh feeling. As for the two women I saw running the hotel, they were so friendly. Often you feel that the friendliness of a person running a business (hotel) is fake, because it is their business (and money) to make you feel at home. Somewhat, especially with the blonde woman who was working there most of the time when I was around, I felt that they kind of cared about me in a more genuine manner. Breakfast was so super and lavishiously good...so much really good and sweet eateries and that cappucino alone is worth another visit to Rome. It was fantastic to receive a breakfast in bed. The hotel is really close to the railway station, only it took me a while circling the whole square, which is something peculiar I do as I always seem to take the side that has the destination I have to visit as last part, especially on squares (I have been in Barcelona for a total of 7 weeks and I still get lost at Placa de Catalunia). The park on the square had film screenings in the first week of July, which was lovely to see how the locals went to visit that. By the way, that did not affect the silence in the room from outside, because from outside in the noise was quite blocked. Sometimes I did hear some talking in the hallways, but not too much.

The reception staff and the owner were very helpful, and gave a free map of Rome explaining what to do and how - an excellent way to begin your tour.

The point is that the room was dark and the hotel was extremely quiet. The front desk hostess could not have been more accomodating. The bed was fine but not great.

Hotel is in close proximity (about 6 blocks) from Termini train station. Very convenient for us since we were taking a train to the port to catch a cruise ship. Also very close to the metro. This section of town is a bit too quiet at night (althought I think it is safe) but not an area that was appealing for a walk or getting a drink or dinner. It's not a big deal to get to Piazza Navonna or Trevi Fountain area which is much more lively. If you are interested in convenience to the train station and lots of value for a fair rate this is an excellent choice. One word of advice - the entrance to the hotel is in a courtyard behind two masssive wooden doors.

We took a Mediterranean cruise and decided to stay in Rome before and after our trip. We made the Hotel Maikol our bookend home during those days. We were very pleased. Simple, clean and excellent service. We stayed in two different rooms and we preferred the smaller room facing the courtyard over the larger room facing the street. If you are a very light sleeper, please request the courtyard. Regardless, the noise was not overbearing or obnoxious. There was a difference between the two rooms, though. If you don't have any issues with a little traffic noise, the street rooms are substantially larger. It should be noted that even the smaller room was quite large in terms of European hotel rooms. We slept with the windows open and the room was a perfect temperature. The rooms were decorated in a simple and clean way. Both of our rooms had a huge photo over the bed (kind of like a photographic headboard is the best way I can describe it) that was sort of weird for US standards, but they were pretty pictures... so \"when in Rome, do as the Romans\" was how we looked at them. Odd, but pleasant. The bathrooms were well equipped and well lit. There was a bidet that neither of us chose to use (let's be honest... we don't ever use them in Europe, nor do we probably even want to know how to use them), a toilet, sink and a small corner shower. The bed was pretty nice. We've slept on better, but we've slept on TONS that were a lot worse. I will comment on something another reviewer commented on. The towels. FIRST, they smelled great. We have had some really bad smelling towels over the years. These smelled awesome. Whoever washed them, did a great job. The scent wasn't overwhelming, it was pleasant and spa-like. SECOND, the other reviewer is correct... what in the world kind of towels were these? There were two giant handkerchiefs and two large bar towels. We used one of the giant handkerchiefs as a bathmat and one as a hand towel. Neither towel did much to absorb any water whatsoever. We used the large bar towels as bath towels. Pretty much the same result, we were still quite wet after attempting to dry off. The Maikol staff let us drop off our bags early, as both visits we arrived prior to check-in. No problems AT ALL. They were pleasant and helpful in this regard. Our bags were moved to our room (they were nice enough to ask our permission to do so) when they were ready. They also arranged a very nice taxi to take us to the airport on our final day. They made sure the taxi could accommodate our luggage and the driver was prompt and efficient. The location is very convenient. Just a walk of mere feet to the Metro and a 10-15 minute walk to Termini. You don't want to put your luggage on the Metro. You want to walk from Termini to the hotel. You might consider a taxi if you have too many bags. The location isn't the classiest neighborhood, but it seemed safe and quiet. Fairly typical for Rome, lots of graffiti and street vendors. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU LOOK AT THE PHOTOS OR GOOGLE STREET VIEW TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN FIND THE HOTEL. It is just a plain brown door next to a MaS sign and across the street from the flower stall at the park. The \"138\" is quite small in relation to the door. We looked at the photos and had zero problems. You will need to ring the bell and be buzzed in two separate times. They will give you keys to these doors, for you to come/go as you please, after you check-in. The breakfast was served in our room and consisted of orange juice, cappuccino, pastries, the standard packaged dipping toast and yogurt. It was simple, but nice. The breakfast shows the identity crisis that Maikol has. It's called the \"Hotel\" Maikol, but is listed as a \"B&B\". It looks like a hotel, but the staff behaves like a B&B. There is no dining room or sitting room. Either way, we enjoyed it a lot. The owner Barbie was quick to respond to an email question I sent her prior to our arrival. She was having knee surgery during our first stay, so we didn't get to meet her until our second stay. It was easy to see that she was very polite and obviously cares a lot about her location. Her adult son does not speak English, but he was very nice and very helpful. We spoke to him in our limited Italian and gestures. He carried my wife's bags for her. We saved the best for last. Most of our service was handled by Fiorella (she told us a nice story about how she \"adopted\" the Italian word for flower when she moved to Italy as her real name Tzvetelina also means flower) and she treated us VERY well. She was warm and friendly. She made dinner recommendations that were EXCELLENT.

It was a 15 minute walk from Termini (once we'd figured out the direction from where the airport bus dropped us) but just round the corner from the Vittorio Emanuele Metro station if you don't fancy the walk. It's an easy 20 minute walk to the Colosseum (or you can get the Metro) and 15 minutes by Metro to the Vatican. I can see what others say about the area but it seemed pretty safe and there were a number of good places to eat. We had a fabulous meal 5 minutes away at La Forchetta in Via S. Martino ai Monti 40. Easily our best meal, and best value, of the weekend. The hotel itself is accessed through a big brown door off the western corner of the Piazza, next to a big MaS sign. It's easy to find if you've looked it up on Google Streetview beforehand. The door takes you into a courtyard and a second door, then up a lift / stairs to the 2nd floor. There's a friendly reception and the rooms are off from there. Ours was light, airy, modern and comfortable. There was a an A/C unit but it wasn't hot enough for us to need. It had a TV a phone and a mini bar. The guy on the helpdesk gave me the wifi access code so we had (slow) wifi access for our stay. Breakfast is served to your room at a time of your choosing.

The location is very convenient, as it is only a ten-minute schlep from Termini, and it is half a block away from the Vittorio Emmanuele metro stop. The Maikol faces a lovely park, and the square is fairly quiet. The rooms themselves are much more spacious than I expected, and they were comfortable and very clean. They are not particularly stylish, but if you are on a budget, this is a great place to stay. The staff were the best feature of this place. It has a homey, family-run feel and all the staff were extremely accommodating. When we arrived, one of the proprietors wrote our location on a street map and told us how to get to all the major sites, as well as recommending a couple of local restaurants. It was really helpful, as we found it very easy to get lost while walking around Rome. Our bags were brought to the room for us, despite the fact that we were right around the corner from the reception. The staff will ask what time you want your breakfast and bring it to your room very promptly. Breakfast consists of jam, nutella, pastries, grissini, and yogurt, plus tea or coffee and orange juice. It was definitely nice to have breakfast brought to us, and the pastries were fresh and delicious. Free wifi is available, but the signal isn't too good if you're not close to the reception area. The place itself is rather basic, but the staff really go out of their way to make you feel welcome. We liked the Maikol so much that when we were stranded due to the volcano in Iceland, we immediately called them up and asked if we could stay there. They were fully booked, but offered to help us find another hotel (sadly, we did not take their recommendations). But we did stay there a couple of nights later, after staying at a much worse but similarly priced hotel about 10 minutes away. At 90 E a night, the Maikol is a great bargain, without any of the negative aspects of European budget hotels.

Once we received it, all the cash and credit cards were 100% undisturbed. These are some very trustworthy people who care about their guests! The hotel is more of a B&B just so you know what you're in for. It is located immediately next to the subway station for Piazza Vittorio Emanuelle II, and if you get out on the right corner of the Piazza, is just a 20 yard walk to the front door. (Door is an unmarked big wooden door right next to a shop called Mas). If arriving at Termini train station, it's just one stop away on the Red line. Some people on here complained that the neighborhood was shady, but we didn't really feel that at all. There are several street vendors who are of various minorities (pakistani, asian), and this may have turned some less open minded travelers off, but it seemed totally safe to us. You can walk to the Coliseum and Roman forum in 15 minutes, or easily hop on the subway to any other destination. It isn't a hotel proper, but rather several rooms (set up just like your average hotel room with windows, bathrooms, etc) in a building that are owned by a family who happens to live amongst them. Don't be expected to be blown away by beauty and charm, it's pretty strictly a functional hotel rather than a resort. We arrived too early to check in, but they took our bags in and kept them safe while we explored the sights. They don't seem to have a phone number available on their website or anywhere else online, so if you had to call them for some reason before arriving, I'm not sure how you'd do it. We dealt with 3 people the whole time and they all spoke varying degrees of english. None was fluent, but we got by, and their friendliness and willingness to try to understand made up for any language barrier. Breakfast was delivered right to our room every morning at the time of our choosing. It consisted of croissants filled with jelly, orange juice, cappucino, and toast and nutella. It was quite delicious and saved us money on breakfast each day. The room was quite big and the bed was actually comfortable (most euro hotels have stiff beds it seems).

As you walk towards the Colesseum in the most direct route you will come across a small restaurant which i think is called Tempio Di Mecenate, it is opposite the cinema.

We picked this B&B b/c of its close proximity to Termini train station and the price was right. Come to find out it was not as easy to get to as we thought after having to cross busy intersections and drag our suitcases on cobblestone sidewalks in the rain. If you plan to walk, it's best to go towards the southeast end of Termini before exiting onto Giovanni Giolitti and head south on Via Mamiani. We usually walk everywhere we go but in this case, having luggage and a toddler to worry about, a cab ride is the way to go - just 5mins and costs 5EUR plus about 3EUR luggage fee...well worth it! Pay attention to the pictures posted on here that included a picture of the entrance and the shops below. This helped us tremendously to locate the B&B. After ging through a gauntlet of two solid, high security doors, you take the elevator up just to come down a few spiral steps to get to the hotel.

Great small Trattoria Monti just next to the hotel (make a reservation!)", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "georgia", "Title": "\u201cGood value, next to subway, shady but kinda safe looking area\u201d", "Author": "pathkid", "ReviewID": "UR34331085", "Content": "Pros: great value, 99 euros/night as of 6/09 through venere.com, clean, speak english, they bring breakfast to your room!, really nice owners/keepers, they accept credit card. Cons: kinda seedy location, gotta buzz in everytime, they dont give u your key so u gotta ring the bell ALL the time wihen u exit and enter. They hold onto your room key...made me a bit paranoid. Ok, we booked through venere.com cuz it offered the cheapest price. They take mastercard, great! The room was super clean and spacious. The keepers are really nice and speak english. The breakfast was great!, warm bread, good yogurt and coffee, and they give it to you in your room. The overall value is superb I think for Rome. 99Euros a night is a very reasonable, I would certaqin ly recommend this place again to anyone. BUT BUT the location is kinda seedy...kinda. It's located 100 ft from the subway station and right below is some flea market thing and discount store, with all those weird gypsy ppl. The area I think is an ethnic neighborhood too, whcih may bother some. I'm not say that's bad, but imagine staying in a nice B&B with great clean rooms and owners...but it's located in china town NYC...safe but kinda dirty and seedy. During the day, the location is really busy with shops, but man after 8pm...it dies. NO one is around, kinda spooky and a sense of being unsafe, but hey, i'm a little paranoid. So, a great place to stay with some friends and yonger type couples. But not really the best for that young family with toddlers and that 90 year old grandmother. Overall i do recommend this place, it's real. The good remarks are real. It's thumbs up.

We had spent 3 days in Rome then 4 days in Florence, and took the train back in to Rome from Florence for our one final day in Rome before our return trip home. We then took the Leonardo Express train from Termini to the airport in the morning. The hotel is on the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, which has a metro station. It is not far from the Termini train station but we ended up taking the metro from the hotel to the Termini when we left because it is probably about a 6 or 7 block walk from the entrace to Termini, which is kind of a pain even with small rolling suitcases. The area surrounding Termini and the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele is a bit seedy. Next time I would just stay near a metro but would not try to be near Termini. The hotel (which is really a bed and breakfast) is very difficult to find. We walked around the entire square before we finally located it. You have to press a buzzer to get into the courtyard, then another buzzer to get to the elevator, then someone has to let you in to the front door of the B&B. This is fine but if you want to do a lot of coming and going, it's a bit awkward, especially if you are out late at night. Our room was adequate for our needs. It had an air conditioner, but if you use the air conditioner you have to close the windows, which are like shutters and which therefore block out all natural light when closed. The overhead lights were fluorescent, which I find a little depressing. There are no common areas, so a breakfast of cappuccinos and sugary croissants is brought to your room at the hour you request. For one night, the price was right, but next time I would stay somewhere in a nicer location and would prefer a traditional hotel where you don't have to pass through locked three doors before reaching the door to your room.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austria", "Title": "\u201cIf you look for a B&B for one night close to Termini railway station, Maikol is perfect.\u201d", "Author": "mi1972", "ReviewID": "UR31686097", "Content": "Maikol really is a mixed bag: Once, it is hard to find.

Next, the great hosts -- the team is really friendly. My room was nice and freshly renovated, and crisply clean and looked into an inner courtyard (good air, no noise at all). Breakfast was great. There is one drawback though: They have no breakfast room. Eating in your bed is ok for me for one day, but had I stayed there longer, the \"dorm feel\" of _having to_ eat in my bed would have annoyed me. To sum it up: A perfect place for one night, not sure if I want to stay there for a week.

Our only little complaint was that it is kind of hard to find since there are zero signs outside saying there's a hotel there. Basically it's behind a large wooden door that's sandwiched between two shops. You have to get buzzed in (there are also apartments that share the space), then go up the elevator to the hotel. Once you get it once it's easy. If you want to walk from the train station to the hotel it's about 10-15 minutes away.
