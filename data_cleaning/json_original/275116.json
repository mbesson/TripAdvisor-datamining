The hotel is very central being round the corner from Puerta del Sol. On first seeing the hotel it appeared rather shabby from the outside.On arrival at the reception we were told that they didn't have a double room for us but only a twin room, but this was not a problem.However, despite the fact that I spoke to the receptionist in Spanish, he continued to reply in English ( perhaps my Spanish is that bad!),I regard this to be bad manners.Our room overlooked the courtyard but was nice enough with a small minibar. The breakfast was very good with lots of choice and the staff were friendly enough.On a few occasions, our keycard did not work.The hotel was fine but the receptionist staff were not the most friendly.

We then realized, the next morning, the hotel had CCTV security in the reception area. But no, the tape only has 3 hours recording and the tape could not show who the thief was. The hotel did not give us any compensation to the money that got stolen as they claim we didn't put it in their safe (which we had to pay for)! Which 4-star hotel makes you pay for using their safe?

Rooms are roomy and clean (even by U.S. standards) with a good bathroom featuring full tub/shower and a bidet. A room facing the street isn't particularly noisy, with double-pane glass on two sets of doors leading to a balcony that's literally more for window-dressing than actual use.Service is OK, although the check-in featured one of those our system is not working and we can't find your reservation situations. The staff took a copy of my itineary from the Website where I booked the room (and prepaid it), let me have the room, and finally sorted it out two days later. (This happened to several travelers at the Catalonia Moratin.)The breakfast self-serve was certainly fine and worth the extra fee (if you need to pay it) if you're used to a decent breakfast. The alternative is coffee or chocolate and churros at a local bar. The hotel breakfast features hot and cold food, including pastries, fruit, several types of meat and nicely fried eggs.The neighborhood can be off-putting; Calle de Atocha is a rough-hewn street that's not dangerous, but it's not the Gran Via or a leafy boulevard, either. (It's also not as light and bright as the promotional shot of the hotel would lead you to believe.) It's an area in transition with plenty of construction and renovation going on; it's also only a five-minute walk to a large area of tapas bars and restaurants, with menus (if not service) in English.
