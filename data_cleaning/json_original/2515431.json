We had a very hard time finding a desirable hotel that would allow us to book only one night (a Saturday). Most other hotels that we tried insisted on a 2 or 3 night minimum (on a weekend). So we ended up at the Marriott Gaslamp Quarter. A nice hotel, right next to Petco Park. We were assigned to a high floor and the view was decent, facing east. The room itself was nothing fantastic, but suitable for our last night in San Diego. The location gave us an opportunity to check out the Gaslamp Quarter and the waterfront between the convention center and the USS Midway museum. So as far as location is concerned, not bad at all. We arranged a breakfast special which included a buffet breakfast as part of the room charge, which was perfect for us. The hotel has a well known roof-top outdoor bar, but we didn't have time to check it out. The business center was available for airline web check-in, so we were able to book our seats and print our boarding passes. Wireless internet was not included in the room price, which for me is a huge disappointment. You'll know from any other of my hotel reviews that as far as I'm concerned, with hotel prices being what they are, I don't see why they can't just include Wi-Fi for free. The beds were comfortable. I noticed that because of the location, it is possible you will hear the sounds of druken revellers in the streets below in the wee hours of the morning. But although I did hear some commotion (we opened our window), it wasn't so bad that we were unable to sleep. Your mileage may vary. Overall, not a bad hotel, in a great location.

We stayed at the Marriott in the Gaslamp and have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. You really can't beat the location. It is 2 miles to the San Diego Zoo, 5 miles to Sea World, and Petco park is adjacent to the hotel. There are tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The Altitude bar on the top of the hotel is great! We could only go up during the day because we had the kids with us, but it overlooks Petco Park so you can watch the game from there. You can also look into the park from the concierge lounge. We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the concierge floor. I am not sure why we were upgraded other than that my husband is a silver (or maybe gold, not sure) Marriott rewards member, but it was a very nice perk. We got free continental breakfasts and h'ordeuvres, free Wifi, and there was a computer and printer in the lounge that came in handy for printing our tickets for our activities. If you are lucky enough to be upgraded, be sure to get a to go container for your breakfast and you can take it up to the Altitude Sky Lounge and eat your breakfast outside. The room was very nice and clean. The kids loved that the turn down service included rock candy and Oreo cookies each day. I am not sure if this is a perk of being upgraded or if they do this for everyone, but the kids loved it! They also had bowls of candy in the lobby. The only drawback to the room was that there was no refrigerator. The hallway carpets were a little on the dingy side, but other than that I was completely happy with the hotel (and I am a high maintenance kind of girl). The staff was super friendly! Everyone we met from the maid to the valet guys were super friendly and helpful. Outstanding service. If you get a chance to go to a Padres game, I highly recommend it. We're not Padre fans, but it was still fun and the tickets are so cheap that we were able to sit in the 8th row. The kids got to meet some of the players and they will sign autographs. The best part was that it's right next to the hotel so there was not fighting traffic. We also went to Heavenly Cupcake for my son's birthday which is just a few blocks from the hotel. They were really good, but a bit pricey. We ate a Bud's one evening and recommend it. If you are on Foursquare you can check in and get free tater tots. There isn't a kids menu, but they did have chicken tenders and sliders and what kid doesn't love tater tots? My husband also recommends the Strip Club which which is a restaurant where you pick out your own steaks and cook the steaks on a grill. We did not do this on this trip, but he was there a few months ago and said it was neat experience and the food was good. We also found a great breakfast/brunch place called Mary Janes. We loved it.

The hotel is right across the street from Petco and just on the other side of the train tracks of the convention center and bay; so very convenient location. I left at 5:30 the next day which unfortunately was just about the time people were arriving for the Padres game. I had valet parked my car ($34/day) and it took over 20 minutes for them to retrieve my car. They were very understaffed for the number of cars that were arriving & departing. Even though the service was slow they were all very polite. I fully recommend this hotel with the caveat that service might not be as snappy as you would like. Otherwise it is a very good hotel.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and a Very Helpful Staff\u201d", "Author": "Emersom", "ReviewID": "UR116139610", "Content": "Attended a family affair here and couldn't have been more pleased.

It was a change as we usually stay at the Marquis & Marina for Comic COn, but thought we'd try something different. The Gaslamp Marriott was an awesome location. Being right in the Gaslamp is so handy to get to all of the action and I loved being close to the restaurants in the area. The service was very good. We used the concierge lounge, and the concierge staff were very friendly. I only wish there would have been a bit more variety at breakfast, but having that free breakfast is a wonderful way to start the mornings! There were some keying issues when we first arrived, as they had apparently had a power outage that day, but other than that, all of our delaings with the front desk were handled professionally. We had requested a refrigerator on our reservation and when we arrived we were told we were on a waiting list, so we were a bit worried that we wouldn't have a refrigerator, but we went out for the night and by the time we got back, they had put one in the room. WHEW! Speaking of the rooms, they were very modern, nice furnishings, and the bathrooms had really nice complimentary products. I RARELY use hotel products as I always bring my own, but I used these up! The shower actually had a decent shower head, which was really nice. The only thing we missed was that the rooms we've had at the marian Marriott usually had a couch bed in them, and this room was a bit smaller. It did however have a nice large desk and a view of the gaslamp. The only bummer was not having a jacuzzi to sit in at night when your feet are killing you, but I made do with the bathtub! We also took a trip to the roof to visit the Altitude bar. It looked fun. They have a bar and a fire pit, but wow, on Saturday night it sure gets crowded as it is not very big! Luckily, hotel guests get to go straight up without waiting in line, so it was very nice since we just wanted to get some photos. I can see it being a lot of fun if you have a group of friends wanting some drinks at night! Overall, this is a really beautiful hotel, with good service. i would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlsbad, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Week at Marriott\u201d", "Author": "CarlsbadTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR115818912", "Content": "My husband and I just spent an amazing week at the San Diego Marriott Gaslamp Quarter.

We loved the location, but there are several reasons we'll stay elsewhere next time. First the good: * Location - Only 1 block From the southern end of the 5th street Gaslamp district. Loads of restaurants & bars nearby and within walking distance of Balboa park (a bit of a walk, so likely not good for small children or older folk). * Cleanliness - Very clean & reliable maid svc. * Toffee - Big ol' bowl at reception that my gf couldn't get enough of. * French Toast - Mighty tasty French toast that comes w/ an otherwise average bfast buffet. However, skip the buffet unless it is included w/ your room rate. You can find much better for the $18 they otherwise charge. * View - We had a 17th floor room that had a decent view of the water and the unexpected fireworks on Fri, Sat & Sun nights. However, if on a lower floor, your view is likely to be of the neighboring building's windows (i.e. keep your drapes closed). Now for the bad: * Mattress - It was one of the oldest, most uncomfortable ones I've slept on. The mattress & springs were ancient & they simply tried to improve it w/ a 1\" think mattress pad. Needless to say, it didn't work & made the bed not only too soft, but also lumpy. * Toilet - Mot only was the bathroom quite small, but the toilet flush was extrely loud - both from within the room and from neighboring rooms (both on the same floor & above). Both my gf & I were awoken several times by it. There is absolutely no way to sleep through it, especially if your partner needs to use it in the middle of the night. * Age - While marriott does a good job of keeping it updated, it is getting older. From the tiny bathrooms to the thin walls, the infrastructure can't be changed. * Valet - Luckily parking was included, otherwise it would've been something like $34/night. Plus, they left my car door ajar for 2+ nights such that my battery was completely dead, required a jump to leave (which took 45+ minutes), and had to be replaced when I returned to LA. Not reasonable for a battery/car that is less than 2.5 yes old. * Management - My gf and I were a little bored & wanted to leave a day early to spend a night in Temecula. I'm a Mariott Elite who spends 30-40 nights a year in Mariott hotels. When I asked if it would be a problem tocheck out a night early, the day manager went into contract mode and stated the hotel's non-negotiable $150 early departure fee. When I simply asked if there was any way this could be waived for a good customer, she pulled out my signature on the reservation form, pointed to the fine print and said \"see you signed in agreement of this fee when you checked in\". I was taken aback as I was not being the least bit argumentative and ws simply asking if there was leeway. She couldn't care less and was quite rude. Amyway, the hotel is decent, but there are MANY, MANY, MANY (did I say many?) more options in the area. I'll most definitely try another (non-Mariott property) next time.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!\u201d", "Author": "Noush01", "ReviewID": "UR114944197", "Content": "I was really impressed with this hotel!

I travelled to San Diego (SD) for business in February for a two month stay. Two months away from friends and family is awful enough without mentioning staying at a hotel for the entire time. When I first found out that I was travelling to SD, I queried coworkers for the best in town and called around to a few. Someone suggested Marriott in the Gaslamp. From the beginning, the staff was extremely helpful with the booking, identifying nearby attractions and even suggesting placing a refrigerator and microwave in my room so I wouldn't get too fat during my stay. But, the refrigator didn't totally stop me from strolling around and grabbing bites to eat at one or two out of maybe a thousand resturants within walking distance of the hotel (okay, maybe a little over one hundred resturants). If it wasn't for the fact that I was there for work and my office wasn't downtown, I would not have ever left the Gaslamp! Everything was right there: movies, shopping, Amercian food, Thai food, Chinese food, Sushi, a Westin's Mall, the baseball stadium). 24 hour gym helps get the pounds away too. Did I mention the amazing view of the city from the Altitude Lounge ( Can you say rooftop to the 100th power? ) Awesome View! Additionally, the hotel's free internet and printing made my wedding planning away from home smooth. Running out of time here...but I want to stress that the hotel was super CLEAN, staff was extremely helpful with whatever I needed and I would definitely stay there again and suggest it to all my family and friends.

We were on the 16th floor in a room very close to the elevators but didn't notice any noise. The bathroom was beautifully designed. They really made perfect use of a rather small area, with lovely tile walls and floor, and the bathroom amenities included fluffy sponges and bath gel in addition to the usual shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap set. Very impressive. We didn't eat at the hotel (except for snagging Tootsie Rolls and taffy from the big bowls at the reception desk every time we went in or out) but had a big room service breakfast which was well worth the $18 each that it cost. Again, very impressive, and a good value considering this was not at all something that just got scraped out of a can or a cereal box. I like their late checkout time (noon) and we were also impressed that when we checked out, our car was already waiting for us at the valet stand without having to ask for it. The location is excellent, right in the Gaslamp Quarter so there are about a hundred restaurants of every imaginable type within a few minutes' walk. It was wasted on us because we didn't have time for much, but I would love to go back and stay for a proper visit to the area.

There's so much to enjoy and experience. As many times before when travelling the US, we were fortunate to meet and share with so many great people, from being attended in the local shops to the restaurant service. Ok, it's not the cheapest place in the country...but in most cases there is value for money in the service and the quality. The hotel was very comfortable, very clean and the service from the staff was excellent. Be warned though, the roof is a great place to drink and meet but if you're anywhere on the upper floors, the sound carries!! I do consider it a little on the expensive side for what you get...but nevertheless if you want a good base to work from, with quality and comfort - it delivers. Would I go back? Yes. One or two places that stood out eats wise: Croce's Restaurant and Jazz Bar....beautiful food and great service combined with a superb atmosphere. Be prepared to pay a little bit more than the average but it's so worth it. Dicks Last Resort.....what can I say.....I've never been so comfortable with being verbally abused!! It was fantastic fun. If you don't mind playing and BEING the fool, GO!!! The entire Gaslamp Quarter for me is just full of options. Go and explore!!!

The Altitude Lounge is not open until 5pm Monday -Friday but is a great place to sit on a warm chair on a sunny day and enjoy the view.

Do NOT take the sky bridge to \u201cground transportation\u201d, instead walk under these escalators and proceed outside. There is a clearly marked rectangular sign post with \u201cMTS\u201d written on it. There is a schedule on the pole and information regarding the bus fare. The fare is $2.25 exact change (bills or coins). The bus took approximately 8 minutes to get to downtown. Get off the bus at the stop located at 4th and Broadway. (It is the LAST stop on the route and thus not hard to locate, it is located beside Horton Plaza). Walk down 4th street for approximately 10 minutes to \u201cK street\u201d. Turn left. The hotel is on the left side at number 660. Check-in was quick, less than 5 minutes. The room key is required to access the elevators. No more than a 15-30 second wait for the elevators both in the evening and the following morning. My room, 1726, was located at the far end of the hallway. The room was attractive, comfortable and impressive. The bathroom had a sliding, wood door that does not lock. Standard bath tub and shower with lots of water pressure. The bath products were quite nice and well supplied with a few extras. There is a coffee maker with stainless steel pot and Starbucks coffee products. The unit made a nice, hot, cup of coffee in the morning. Both paper cups and black, ceramic mugs were provided. No issues with cleanliness. The room had one king bed, a wardrobe that contained drawers and the T.V., a cupboard, wing chair, and large corner unit work desk with rolling chair. The windows both opened onto the street, that was relatively quiet. The view was of downtown, the convention center and the ocean in the far distance. The 17th floor allowed views over most of the surrounding buildings so that quite a grand vista was afforded. The bed was comfortable with several types of pillows and a duvet that was very warm without being too hot. The alarm clock was a bit difficult to figure out, but there are helpful instructions on a sticker on the front of the clock. The button on the telephone that was supposed to connect to \u201cwake up calls\u2019 actually always connected to the hotel\u2019s messaging service and needs to be reprogrammed.

A couple of comments. The hotel has been remodeled so it has all the right touches--gym, computer room and well decorated rooms. The staff are also well trained and very eager to please. The restaurant was nice and the adjecent bar full of sports fans getting ready for a Padres game. The rooftop bar was very nice and had an excellent view of the stadium. Overall this is an excellent urban property with all the amenities. However the check-in clerk was not familiar with using state-issued credit cards for business travel. My work issued credit card has a $1,000 per day limit but the cost of my hotel for my entire stay was $1,200.00. The clerk ran my card through the machine several times and it was declined because she charged the entire stay which was over the daily limit. I had to use my personal card to check-in and someone from our accounting office called me thinking I was trying to charge personal items over the daily limit on a state card. When I went to the front desk to ask her to clarify the issue another customer was trying to check-in and had the same problem! A couple of points worth mentioning. I arrived late a night after flying in from Miami. Having spent the entire day on the plane meant I wanted to use the gym to work the kinks out of my back. The rooftop bar turns into a late-night hot spot. To access the gym at night means you have to walk through the night-time party crowd so you are walking through groups of clubbers smoking and drinking. That was interesting. Early in the morning when most people used the gym it was not an issue. In fact the gym was a great place to workout and the staff left beverages and fruit in the morning. But just be prepared for the night crowd. Also, I was on EST time the entire trip which meant the Padres game started at the same time as my normal bed time. The ballpark is next door to the hotel and it is very loud. The hotel provides noise machines which drowns out the roar of the crowd. I ordered room service that night and have to admit that the hand made guacamole was very good and better than some I had in Old Towne or the Gaslamp QUarter.

Obviously, the location cannot be beat. It's adjacent to the Gaslamp District and Petco Park (home of the San Diego Padres), putting you in the center of downtown San Diego's attractions. There is no need to have a car as downtown attractions are all within in walking distance and many others are a short ride on the San Diego Trolley. I was staying in town for a wedding and photographs were at 2pm, the hotel without hesitation granted me an 11am check-in so I'd have time to shower and change after the drive from Los Angeles. My Marriott elite status was recognized at check-in and I was given a room on the 20th floor and access to the Concierge lounge without having to ask. My room directly overlooked the entire playing field at Petco. The room as good-sized for a downtown hotel and furnished with a nice modern flair. Now what really set this property apart were the small touches. For some these things may not matter, but for someone who travels as often as I do, they are invaluable. Mouthwash was provided in the bathroom along with a sealed loofa for use in the shower with liquid shower gel (I am not a fan of soap bars). There were also two complimentary bottles of water sitting next to the ice bucket for me. Each staff member I encuontered was friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working at this Marriott. As an added bonus, one of the hottest bars in San Diego, Altitude, is located rooftop on the 22rd floor. Lines to gain access extended throughout the entire lobby nightly, but as a guest, you bybass the line and can go straight up to the rooftop.

It's a great way to unwind after working all day. Staying at the Gaslamp Marriot made my stay more of an adventure. It was so easy to get around. I never felt unsafe which made exploring the area even more enjoyable. There is also a free computer to use on the 6th floor. Everyone at the Gaslamp was friendy and very helpful. Later in the week, I moved to another hotel (not the Marriot) to another location downtown. Downtown has a completely different feel to it. Sadly there are many homeless people downtown. That part of the city feels very different than the Gaslamp District, even though it's only about 10 blocks away. I really missed staying at the Marriot. I would say this was my favorite Marriot hotel.

They weren't UNfriendly, but they weren't friendly either. Other than that, the service at the restaurant Soleil was very good both times we were there for breakfast. I was VERY impressed with the room. I expected the usual Marriott room, but this hotel is updated, modern and clean. The decor is more on the masculine side and very well done. I appreciated the plug-ins in the desk and the trunk/towel rack in the room. There were no towel racks in the bathroom, however, so there was no where to put wet towels or my clothes except on the toilet seat cover or the floor. I used the shampoo and conditioner and they were both fine. The beds were super comfortable. My friend even commented that she'd like to purchase the pillows online. The room was a little on the cold side, but it should be no big deal as long as you are under the covers. The view from our room was nice. It looked out over the city. We chose this hotel for its location since we took the train into the city. It was pretty much walking distance to a lot of places and totally accessible to the bus, train, trolley and taxis. You had to use your room key in the elevator to get up to your room, but almost every single time there was someone in the elevator with us. They would just ask, \"What floor?\" and punch our number in without us having to use our room keys. So much for security. On our second night in San Diego, we got back to the hotel at 10:15. I wanted to order room service, but the menu said dinner ended at 10:00 pm. I thought that was a little early, but I guess it saved me from gorging right before going to bed. Overall, we didn't spend much time in the room, but it was a nice hotel.

The hotel is adjacent to Petco Park (behind left field). After a delayed flight, I was arriving at the same time as a Padres game was starting. To my surprise, traffic was not terrible and the valet parking was a breeze (although for $30 a day, it should be). Check in was simple and easy. I had a standard \"city view\" room with a great view of the ballpark. I wasn't high enough to see any game action, but I could see an exterior scoreboard to know the score. The rooftop bar offers a pretty good view of the outfield. My room was very nice and easily surpassed my expectations. On my first morning, I ate at the Soleli@K restaurant.

There are cheaper places to get a drink in the Gaslamp area. I did not use the workout facility (also on the rooftop).

The gym was a typical hotel gym with several treadmills, free weights (low weights though), and a couple other machines. The hotel, as many others have written, is at the base of the Gaslamp Quarter District. It is literally on the corner of the district and you only have to walk a couple blocks to get to the end of it so within these few blocks, you have wonderful restaurants and bars. The close proximity would please any age group whether you want to just have an early dinner or stay out and drink all night. You are also directly across the street from Petco Stadium which is awesome. I recommend buying the $5.00 standing room only tickets as we did if you are going to a game. You can see the game from anywhere around the stadium and it lets you get a different aspect from the different spots. If you don't want to go to the game, you can watch it from the rooftop bar which was pretty cool. Rather expensive but a must see.

This was kind of annoying since we had a few of our own bottles of water and it was like 95 degrees out that weekend. And two, hallway noise seemed a little louder than usual for a Marriott. We could hear quite a bit of activity whenever people would walk back and forth. The front desk staff were very nice (Kirby was pretty cool). The only issue was that when we arrived at 5pm, there was only one front desk clerk and like 4 or 5 people backed up in line. We waited for about five minutes but then 2 additional front desk staff showed up and we got checked in quickly. But where were those 2 staffers for the first five minutes? The location, also, is excellent. You can actually SEE the infield at Petco from the rooftop bar. But be aware that the streets will get a little crowded if you visit during a home game. And the Gaslamp Quarter is right around the corner with a TON of bars and restaurants.

I would have preferred the bad view. Secondly, and more important to me, is that they do not put clean glasses and cups in the rooms. After seeing a news story that some hotels do not put clean glasses and cups in the rooms to replace the dirty, used ones - and being a little grossed out by this- I marked the bottom of my cup and glass to see if they would be replaced. Much to my dismay, when I returned to the room after housekeeping had cleaned it, the same cup and glass, with the marks still on the bottom, were there - rinsed but not replaced. I went to the next room where housekeeping was cleaning the room, to ask if I could get clean ones, and I saw on the housekeeping cart that there were NO clean cups or glasses!! And I could see the housekeeper in that bathroom, rinsing the glasses out and drying them with the bathroom towel, and putting them right back on the counter! Bad enough when a cup that I used is not washed properly and replaced, but being there were no clean ones on the cart, I can only assume that they are not replaced even when the room changes guests!

It sits downtown, across the highway from the San Diego Convention Center. I am usually not a fan of Marriott Hotels, but this particular location was well appointed. The hotel definitely had a boutique feel from the lobby to the modern rooms. The negatives to this hotel would be the lack of a pool and the restaurant which is overpriced. We received a pass to swim at the Marriott Towers nearby on the water, but it was a good 6+ block walk in a swimsuit and that pool was so packed with people you couldn't move. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant (only once), which was more than $10 for a danish and orange juice about the same quality as the 7-11 sells for $1.49. We never made it to the rooftop bar, but I understand that is quite popular during the evening. Fortunately the hotel sits at the beginning of the Gaslamp Quarter, so you can walk to many nearby restaurants that cost less and taste better than the hotel food. Probably the best reason to stay at this hotel is to see a San Diego Padres baseball game. Their beautiful new stadium sits right next to this hotel, so you can definitely walk over and enjoy all the beer you want before safely returning to your room. This hotel had valet parking, but we were also allowed to self-park at the garage directly across the street and had no problem with that. Easy to access, except maybe on a game day. Besides walking to the Gaslamp Quarter, you can also walk 4 or so blocks from this hotel to the convention center and a bit farther down the water to Seaport Village for more shopping. You wouldn't really need a car at this hotel to see several major downtown attractions, but it's good to have one for going out to Balboa Park, the zoo, Seaworld, Old Town, the beaches, etc. If you can get a good rate at this hotel, book it.

About a mile in to the town is also a large shopping mall. The only downfall of the hotel is its restaurant and bars. The bars are overpriced, even for such an area ($7 for a beer) and I couldn't get a decent vodka martini at either one. There are two; one at the lobby level and one on the roof. The one on the roof has a great view, especially at dusk and allows smoking, but still, couldn't get a good drink. The restaurant is also dud. It claims to be serving some sort of authentic Californian cuisine. No offense to California, but if that's authentic California cuisne, I don't want any. It's almost entirely vegetarian, which is fine, but it's all very odd concoctions, none of which really seem to work (I tried several during my stay, trying to be open minded and such) and they put a lot of emphasis on the display \"food as art\" kind of presentation. Aside from those two faults, the Marriott Gaslamp Quarter is a very good hotel. There is another Marriott about three blocks from it, the one with the convention center on the water.

The staff is friendly but I was a little frustrated on this visit to see the concierge desk empty frequently. One late afternoon I called to check on a restaurant and I had to leave a message. No one called me back until the next day.

The only meal we had at the hotel was breakfast which wasn\u2019t bad for room service. I\u2019m not sure of the price since it was given to us for free due to a 6am wake up call we received and didn\u2019t request. Other than that the room was nice and was perfect in size for the two of us. We were on the 20th floor which overlooked the stadium and a portion of the bay. The bar on the rooftop was good and you could actually watch the game from the hotel and on the big screen TV\u2019s they had. The hotel location is ideal if you plan on visiting the gaslamp area. I recommend doing so, there are so many restaurants and bars you would be hard pressed not finding something you will like. If anything there are too many to choose from. You are walking distance to the beach and marina area and the trolley is just a block away if you care to travel to the Old town area. The staff and concierge were all very helpful and friendly. Actually everyone at the hotel was very friendly. The concierge lounge could have been better but it wasn\u2019t bad. Overall we really enjoyed the hotel and our 3 days there. We came back to our room one evening to find that our bed was turned down and had a snack and CD with soft music waiting for us.

The room was about the size of a NY hotel room. But well appointed. Granet countertops, mosaic tiles, wingback chair with an ottoman. The area around is awesome. Clean, tons of restaurants...enjoyed Trophies upcale bar food, and Freds Mexican food. I'm sure it gets pretty crazy when the Padres are in town. I was in town when they were on the road. 2 Thumbs up. I'd come back just for a good nights rest. :-) WONDERFUL!!! My only criticism is the Valet. They are really slow. Day 1 took 15 mintues to call my car up. So Day 2 I called 30 minutes ahead for it to be ready. But when I arrived, 3 valets were standing there and my car was no where to be found.

I ordered breakfast and a late dinner (room service) and they were both bad. There are plenty of restaurants around the hotel that serve great food and I recommend that you take a quick walk.

Check-in was quick and efficient and the front desk associate skipped the \"hotel talk-through tour\" as I had already explained the wreck situation and it was quite obvious that I was just ready to go to my room. So for that I give kudos to this hotel, however, having worked in the hotel industry before, for a situation as serious as a totalled car, I half expected a complimentary amenity or upgrade, neither of which was offered (can't really fault the hotel for this, however, many other hotels would have offered one or the other). Room was a large corner room, however was a handicap accessible room (no mention of this at check-in) and did not have a tub, but instead had a roll in shower. Had I been notified of this at check-in (it is standard procedure to notify a guest if they are being placed in a handicap accessible room and have not requested such) I would have been asked to be moved to another room. Had requested extra towels, a microwave, and a refrigerator prior in my reservation. Was told at check-in these items were already placed in the room. They were not there when I arrived so had to call back down (after being told that they WERE there) to have them delivered. Hotel loses points for this. Overall my two night stay was good however, on the first night (the night of my accident) a group of drunk women exited the elevator on my floor and proceeded to converse quite loudly in hallway at 2:30 in the morning. I called down and requested that Loss Prevention (Security) be sent up to take care of the noise. Not quite sure if anyone was sent, but my assumption is no as the conversations continued until around 4:00 AM. Housekeeping began their rounds around 7 AM, once again awakening me due to the rather large gap between the bottom of the door and the floor. Second night went uneventful. At this point, my opinion of the hotel was still rather high, with a few key points that needed to be worked on. However, check-out was a disaster. I asked to speak with a manager regarding my inconveniences and the manager which responded just kind of looked at me with the attitude of why was I even bringing this to her attention (no writing down the problems [Marriott encourages a log of all guest complaints] and a general sense of apathy). I was then told that since I was staying on a discounted corporate rate, that my complaints don't really matter and that I would just have to deal with it. I was also told that had I called back with the noise complaint, I could have been moved to another room (moving at 4AM, when I'm sore and can barely move anyways due to whiplash among other accident related pains, which would include moving of the refrigerator, microwave, and other towels). Unsatisfied with the response received from the manager, I proceeded to call the president of Marriott Intl (I am acquainted with him as he is a graduate of my university) and left him a voicemail stating my concern. At this point, the manager's attitude still remained one of apathy and arrogance, as if noone above her (not even the president of the company) can overrule her decisions. I must say, I am quite dissatisfied and this is the worst service I have ever received from ANY level of hotel, select, limited, or full service.

I have read negative reviews about the front desk and they probably got fired or something, becuase the lady at the front was great, had a smile the whole time, and told us about the sky bar (which we already knew about). I had NO problem checking in, i reserved this place ONLINE the night before. (yea last minute) The online menu said there were NO king size beds, so i called in after i reserved online, the man who picked up the phone said at first that its all dependent on how many requests are made the day of. The guy was very kind and promised I would get one and I did. The room is very luxurious. They had quality bed sheets and furniture. The bathroom is awesome, I like how the bathroom door is a large sliding door. They provide the amnenities that you would expect for what you paid for the room. The view is great, you can see over Coronado ( the small island next to the gaslamp) Unfortunatley the OMNI hotel was slightly blocking the direct water. I can definitely understand why people would be upset because there is ALOT of construction being done around the area and it would be in direct view of their room if it faced south. But COME ON, its not like the marriott has ANY control over that. It's like telling your neighbor to never remodel their house. The sky bar (Altitude) is beautiful. It is SMALL compared to the Standard in Downtown LA (for those of you who have gone there.) It looked like it fit a little more than 100 people or so and the servers are extremely great at getting you drinks too. They asked us several times if we wanted drinks even though there were many other people around. Thats great service. There is also a great view of Petco Park. All in all, I thought it was worth the price to stay at this location and will definitely recommend it. We didn't party in the gaslamp area because we stayed at the skybar.

So close to Gaslamp Quarters - which my 14-year old daughter loved for the nearby upscale stores as well as the mall selections at Horton Plaza (all within easy walking distance). Being so cose to Petco Park, you have to hate baseball if you do not attend. You can easily buy tickets at the walk-up window, including the \"park within the park\" - a grassy hill behind center field for only $5, $8 for bleachers (being a Giants fans these bleachers do not compare as you cannot see game well) or $12 for view deck (top). We wanted to go 2 nights, but got back too late for the 2nd one. First night we got free hats, second night they were giving away t-shirts. Traffic around the hotel, even with a game going on, is not bad. We left area along with afternoon ballpark traffic and were only delayed about 10-15 minutes. Liked looking out the window at the park preparation activity, to check scoreboard at night. Could even see peaks of Coronado Hotel across the bay. Enjoyed close proximity to ice-cream store and Subway's (across the street). Liked going for walks in the morning along the marina (near convention center). Short hop over to Coronado - great beach. Easy access to Old Town and Mission Valley for shopping. Fun to be in a central location - with lots of action!!

We stayed for 4 days, and experienced nothing but incredible service and quality. Being such a busy weekend, we didnt really know what to expect, but our expectaions were far succeeded. We have stayed at the Marriott by the convention center before, and while we did enjoy it, the staff and service simply dont compare. We were greeted by fabulous doorman and valet, and while the parking was $24, it does include in and out service and all parking in SD is expensive, so it didnt bother us. We were then greeted by the wonderful fron desk staff, who were so well presented and smiley! They explained to us all the details of the hotel, and covered everything, so professionsl! The room they gave us was superb and had the most amazing views of San Diego. The decor in the rooms was fresh, modern and sparking! and the bed was incredible! After check in we decided to go and eat lunch, so we thought we would test the knowledge of the Concierge staff. Being such a busy time, they were swamped with people, but we were surprised by how attentive they were to us! They offered us maps, tickets (we went to Sea World, get your tickets from the concierge it saves you time) and so many wonderful restaurant recommendations. We really used them over the entire stay, and not once did they lead us astray. There restaurant recommendations were so accurate (check out Panevino Italian for dinner and the Mission for breakfast). To top it off they got us in VIP at a great club, and cant say enough, this concierge staff new exactly what they were doing and they always had a smile! Next we checked out the Altitude club at the top of the hotel, all I can say is wow! The view looks right into the Padres stadium, and you can see Coronado, Point Loma and the beautiful bay! It was a bit pricey, but the views made up for it. One of the nights it was very busy, and the service was a little slow, but overall it was great. Overall this hotel isnt really that great for kids, as there isnt a pool, and being amongst the bars, its more of an adult area, but we loved it.

I never visited San Diego before, so input was most appreciated. My first night was at the Laguna Cliffs Marriott in Dana Point and then the following 2 nights at the San Diego Marriott Marina (both of which I will write about on their sites). After staying at the Marriott Marina, I reluctantly moved over to the Gaslamp because the Marina was sold out my last night there. I wasn't reluctant to go there because of anything negative of the GasLamp Marriott, but we SO LOVED...the Marina Marriott that I was worried. First the Positives: The lobby was beautiful, simple but clean and elegant. My room was 1900 which was a corner room which had two huge sliding glass door sized windows (but they weren't sliding glass doors), and they opened on the bottom for fresh air. Around the corner of the room was a whole other area with a HUGE workstation for those of you there for business. Also a nice sitting chair in the corner and the desk chair was cushy too. If someone were working there, the other person sleeping around the corner wouldn't be too disturbed. THE ROOM WAS SPOTLESS. Not one fingerprint, dust ball or window streak. The beds had the new bedding which was really nice, flat screen t.v., nice carpeting, beautiful woodwork, even the bathroom door (which was a really cool sliding door with chrome on the bottom), great toiletries, great coffee pot (chrome with FLAVORED CREAMERS!). Now just a few negatives: Parking was expensive (like all downtown hotels). I believe the parking garage was around $20 dollars a day (valet only), and that's because there is NO PULL IN FOR INCOMING CARS. Just a plain old sidewalk. They did let me park my rental car there for a few minutes to check in and go quickly to my room, but I needed to come down right away and move it or they needed to valet it. The walk to the GasLamp was a few blocks, down Fifth street, but it was raining and those few blocks seemed far in the rain (we had sore feet too), so we took a cab to the waterfront area. Right across the street was CONSTRUCTION that probably would have been really annoying if we had been there a few days and trying to sleep in the morning. A HUGE CRANE was right across the street peering through the window. We had to leave at 4:30 a.m. the next moring for the airport, so that wasn't an issue for us. I would highly recommend this hotel though. The people working there were ALL VERY NICE and the concierge was great. BUT, I was traveling with my 14 yr. old daughter and we much more enjoyed the Marriott Marina on N. Harbor because the VIEWS VIEWS VIEWS from our bayside 19th floor room. Plus, we walked every evening right along the marina to the Seaport Village shops and restaurants. It was a short, safe and beautiful walk. The GasLamp had no pool, so the pool at the other property made it a much more desirable property. The GasLamp is a short hike, for you business travelers, to the Convention Center (not a great walk in heels). The Marina Marriott was RIGHT THERE. So even though the location, parking, non-pool could be an issue, it still is a beautiful hotel. Also, the rooftop bar was closed for renovation, but do to reopen March 31st. Hope that helps!

We also checked out Croce's for live jazz and that was terrific, too. Parking at the Marriott is expensive, so we opted to park in the garage across the street for about half the price the one day we did have a rental car. That leads me to the one problem I had with the Marriott...I noticed on the day of checkout that they had charged me $96 for parking and we had never used their garage.

The lobby is beautifully decorated, clean and contemporary with art from local artists all around. The rooms are beautiful -- not your usual polyester bedspread...this hotel features Marriott's new bedding (ala the Heavenly Bed at Westin), a beautiful marble walled bathroom and nice view of the bay and Petco Park. The rooftop bar (Skybar) is very popular on the weekends, with a line for non-guests stretching through the lobby to get upstairs. Hotel guests go right up. Especially attractive for the 20 and 30 somethings. Services were all around better than normal -- front desk and restaurant staff were very cheerful and helpful. The only spot on that record was that we'd called for fresh towels Sunday morning and they hadn't arrived 45 minutes later. We finally picked up old ones and used those and called to tell them not to bother. Seemed to be a fluke, however, as the next morning we called and got new towels in less than 5 minutes. The breakfast buffet was your standard fare for a hotel of this caliber...but it was $18 too. Unfortunately, the gaslamp is more geared to dinner and drinking than breakfast...so your breakfast options are limited. There is, however, a nice breakfast spot down K street about 3 or 4 blocks west. As another reviewer noted, there is no pool...kinda strange...but you do have reciprocol privileges at the Marriott at the Convention Center -- friends in our group went there and said it was crowded and not pleasant. I've also stayed there...and had the same feeling about the rooms. The other Marriott is about 5 or 6 blocks? away...but there is no shuttle, so if you want to swim, you have to walk or drive. I agree with the other reviews on the parking situation -- we didn't have a car, but folks in our group did. If there isn't a game at the stadium, parking should be ample in the garage right across the street (contrary to another reviewer, I know that there is parking in the hotel itself -- but I suppose they do use the garage across the street for overflow). Park it yourself across the street and you should save plenty off of the $24 tab. Sounds pricey, but things aren't free in DT San Diego. Workout facilities were also pretty decent. I wasn't especially looking for a pool, and I didn't rent a car, so those issues weren't a big deal to me. Like I said, an all around very good hotel.
