Unfortunately, the sheets weren't clean enough, as shades of old stains were visible in different places and I didn't feel confortable. The location is probably convenient for those who are just passing and stopping by, pretty close to the airport but far from anything else. Located on a kind of highway there are no shops and restaurant on walking distance, so you'd need a car. There are two or three vending machines in the lobby, but water was sold out and hasn't been supplied during my two days stay. However the staff was kind and helpful. The breakfast very basic. I think most of the customers are passing travelers and lorry drivers. It was very cheap, but, as I didn't have a car, I spent what i saved in taxis. If just as me you don't have a car and you are interested in visiting Graceland and/or the city centre I would recommend to stay downtown (Beale street). Consider that if you intend to visit the SUN Studios (walking distance from Beale St.) you can get a free ride from there to Graceland and return (check the website http://www.sunstudio.com/).", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWork Not Holiday\u201d", "Author": "THORP-10", "ReviewID": "UR65147563", "Content": "First of all could I say that the hotel itself was fine for a budget stop, the managers and staff were very helpfull and the breakfast was good for a free continetal afair. The problem is this is not a hoiliday location so as 4 adults who were in Memphis to see the sights it was a $35 taxi ride to everywhere. As was pointed out to us from day one it was not advisable to walk anywhere after dark so you do need a car or taxi. After saying that we saw no trouble or problems and the other guests and visitors were very freindly and helpfull. The bottom line is if you are staying as a stopover and have a car you get exactly what it says on the tin a cost effective freindly motel, if you are there on holiday get one of the posh downtown hotels and pay that bit extra. Finaly could I thank the manager and his family for there help during our stay as he was as suprised as us to have a group of tourists staying for a week with no idea about anything.

The old barbed wire fence I had read about was replaced by a nice fence, my room was decent with the only problem I had was the TV in my room was going bad and reception was kind of poor (not a clear picture on any channel). The location appears to be in an industrial area with trains running but if you get an inside room you shouldn't have a problem with trains and street noise. Internet service was ok running about 1.3 mbps. I had no problem with my room other than the previously mentioned TV problem. I didn't feel that there was a personal safety issue but I didn't really roam around in the evening.

I had booked 2 week nights at Harrah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Tunica and did not want to pay their Saturday rate. So, I figured that since it was our first night in and we would be getting in rather late I decided to pick a nice and cheap hotel. Well, cheap is right! The location to the attractions in Memphis is close, but on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wrong side of the tracks\". There is not much around but some run down buildings, but the hotel does come with fence and barbed-wire. Upon check in we were a little nervous about the location, but went through with it. We were shown to our room and upon closer inspection I noticed not only were there hair on the bathroom floor (eek!) and the drain stopper was on the counter, there was not a smoke detector. Well I found that pesky smoke detector; it was hiding in the drawer (and with NO battery). On our way out to dinner the man at the front desk asked how everything was, I politely smiled and said \"well the smoke detector needs a new battery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he replied with \"why? Is it making noise?\" I said \"No, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the drawer and has NO battery at all\". He smiled back and kindly said \"Well, what are you to do?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He was right... what are you to do? You would think it would be to get a battery, but who am I to judge? It was quite during the day, but we did get to listen to wonderfully loud rap music coming from the apartments behind the hotel. The toilet did not stop running after being flushed, which made for a fun evening of playing in a hotel's toilet tank!! And I also have to mention the billboards in the area... they consist of sayings like \"Don't buy guns for people who can't, or you will spend 10 years in jail\", \" The security door store\" and my personal favorite, \"Beat a woman and your a punk forever, Just chill...don't kill\" On the positive side... The beds were fairly comfy and the room was nice. The location was not very far from the main attractions. The breakfast was very nice and filling.
