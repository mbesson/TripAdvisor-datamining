The hotel is right in the heart of Dam, on a main street but our room which was on the first floor and overlooking the main street was surprisingly quiet. yes of course there will be some street noise, but nothing you can't live with. The rooms are small, but have everything you need. The bed was comfy (we had 2 single duvets on our double bed which was a bit odd), a TV with lots of English stations and a small but very clean shower room with toilet. The hotel generally is very clean, it has a bit of a boutique hotel feel about it, very contemporary and fresh. They have done really well to keep what must be a very challenging building in good condition and comfortable. Staff are all very friendly and helpful. Wifi was 5 euros for 24 hours (It is free I believe if you book your room with the hotel directly). If your flight home is later on in the day, there is a locked luggage room you can use for 2 euros. In future, this will be our first port of call when we visit Amsterdam. A real gem of a find and perfect for a few days in one of the most amazing funky Cities on the planet! There are dozens of cheap hotels in Amsterdam, more or less on every corner, most are cheap for a reason.

It's about time we spread the love and write a review. We were first attracted to the Gerstekorrel because of its convenient location : After a 40 minute flight from Luton to Schipol Airport , a 15 minute train ride to Centraal Station a short walk straight down Damrak you have arrived at the Gerstekorrel. Just turn left at Madame Tussauds ,walk across Dam square and you will see the tiny 5EURO Gift shop. That's Damstraat - a short commercial street crammed with various eateries, a tobacconist , perfumery,Bureau de Change,trendy trainer vendor,extreme sports accessory supplier and more. Even the mighty Albert Hein supermarket (just like Tesco) is nearby as is Kalverstraat ( a busy shopping precinct that hosts most types of shop ( everything from music,mobile phones and more munchies!) Sandwiched between the \"Wok to Go\" and Pizza parlour is the Gerstekorrel - quiety understated amongst the hustle and bustle of the area. The notorious Red Light District is a stone's throw away as are many cultural,historic and architectural tourist attractions.Waterlooplein market is a short walk away and you can catch a tram nearby to the Albert Cyup market. Upon entering the hotel reception you will be greeted by a smart,friendly member of staff.Of all the assets of the Gerstekorrel, the staff are the jewel in the crown - nothing is too much trouble, for them - their excellent local knowledge and helpful advice is worth its weight in gold.Our group of friends are of a wide age range (18 to 40+) and the staff always made us feel welcome. If you arrive before check- in, or your flight is after check-out , there is a lugguage store and toilet on the landing available free of charge - facilities that are most appreciated by us. The option of a safety deposit box,Wi-Fi,hot & cold drinks,confectionery & various other tourist essentails, 2 choices of breakfast and so much more are all available from reception. The Gerstekorrel offers a wide range of rooms from single,twin,double,triple and quad all with en-suite toilet & shower at value for money room rates.During our many stays we have been in all the types of rooms which have always been of a high standard. The rooms are clean,comfortable and serviced daily. Each one has TV,telephone,wardrobe,bedside cabinet,dressing table,extra bedding,chair etc. Now the beds....comfortable is putting it too mildly! I have always enjoyed a superb night's sleep at the hotel- the rooms are a tranquil,quiet sanctuary from the busy city centre outside. A friend of mine stayed in bed from 4:40 am until 8pm while we were at the Gerstekorrel as the beds are superb (and he had not indulged in alcohol,drugs or anything else that tires you out so much) Purely and simply the beds are that great you could just foresake the delights of Amsterdam for such blissful rest.We even joked that my mate might even try to steal the mattress! Well what more can I say? We are full of praise for the Hotel De Gerstekorrel and its staff whom we regard as friends after all these years. The proof is in the pudding as we are going to Dam at the end of the month (again) and we don't even have to state where we will be having another enjoyable stay.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location\u201d", "Author": "Lib H", "ReviewID": "UR122357370", "Content": "If you just need somewhere to drop your bags, sleep and shower, this is a great hotel.

If you're driving (we were on a bit of a roadtrip) you're best parking at one of the P+R sites out of the city centre and getting the tram back in - we parked at the World Fashion centre: 8euros for 24hours and transport tickets to get into and back out of the city centre.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coventry", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - clean but only a 2 Star\u201d", "Author": "Vigorous", "ReviewID": "UR121325775", "Content": "I was taken away to Amsterdam as a surprise for my 35th Birthday, my girlfriend organised the whole trip but she was disappointed with what we got through Expedia when she knew that for only an extra 20EUR she could have got us a room at Die Port Van Cleve, which is next to the Magna Plaza behind the Royal Palace and is a 4 star. However, the quality of the hotel really wasn't important to us as we spend most of our time out and about enjoying all that Amsterdam has to offer. We stayed for 2 nights and 3 full days, and only used the hotel to sleep in. So if like us you intend on spending very little time at your chosen hotel then you can do little wrong than stay here. If you intend on using the hotel for more than this stay somewhere else. Good for: Location - just off Dam Square Clean - the room was very clean/hygienic Cheap Bagage storage when you leave - no extra cost and do have a small toilet when you head back to collect your luggage Not Good for: Facilities - no bar, no restaurant - do not book if these are the things you are looking for Sleeping - Although I slept like a log, I can imagine this hotel being very noisy in summer/peak months. The bed was comfy but was 2 single beds pushed together, again that doesn;t bother me, but then had 2 sigle duvets that overlapped which wasn't good. Bathroom - whiclst clean the bathroom was one big wet room, no bath, just a shower with a hole in the floor. Size - Lke most places in Amsterdam the room was small Overall the hotel served its purpose for us, but would maybe look again if we go back. TIP: When you're out and wanting a drink, don't specify the size of drink you want, it somehow works out cheaper. And of course try the wheat beer!! : - ) Some must-see places are: Anne Franks Huis Van Gogh Museum Boat Trip Eating & Drinking Pastini - Italian Restaurant, spent around 70 EUR on 2 courses and a bottle of Red Wine, beautiful food, and lovely candle lit restaurant off the beaten track on the Southern Canal District Hoppe - Cool bar, busy but not overpriced in the southern Canal District Cafe Van Zuylen - Candle lit Cafe/Bar, this place was our favourite, again off the beaten track behind the Royal Palace 5 EUR for two beverages, candle lit and the food looked amazing although we didn't try Cafe Heuvel - Lovely Cafe/Bar in the Old South, if you go to the Van Gogh Museum, pop in here for a beer or Coffee, the lady that runs this place obvioulsy loves what she does and it shows in the way in which she runs it. Cafe Scheltema - My friend who lives in Amsterdam recommended this place for breakfast and I can thoroughyl pass on this recommendation, great breakfast - We both had the Eggs with Ham & Cheese and needed nothing else until dinner time - cost 18 EUR for 2 coffees and a proper breakfast. Also, if you hungry at the airport, go to the pizza & pasta place in main departures, was awesome - 7 EUR for pasta which comes in a carbaord box (like the movies) and the portions are huge and tasty.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cLocation was fantastic, room was as expected\u201d", "Author": "illgothere", "ReviewID": "UR121164841", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights November 2011 - The location is great, just a few steps from Dam square, about a 10-minute walk from Amsterdal Centraal train station, and walking distance to tourist attractions.

The staff are happy to help you with any queries you have and also snacks and drinks can be purchased from the reception 24 hours.

As I am a student we don't have masses of spare money, but we spent quite a while working out what hotel to stay in when in Amsterdam. Do not be put off that it is classed as \"red light district\" as it really isn't, it is right next to Madam Tussauds and by loads of shops, there are no coffee shops/ women in windows directly nearby, just a few restaurants which leads down to the red light district. When we arrived in Schipol (Amsterdams airport) we had already worked out that we could take the train into Amsterdam as a cheaper option than a taxi. We got the train which I believe was 4 euro each. When we arrived in Amsterdam it is literally just a straight line down past loads of shops and restaurants towards the hotel. We also walked to the train station when it was time to go home, the walk takes no longer than 20 minutes. Just follow the tram lines. The hotel itself could not be in a better location - close enough to stagger back from if you've had one too many (!) but far away enough to not be in the middle of the red light district. Even though there is a lot of hustle and bustle on the street it is on, our room was completely silent and could catch an excellent nights sleep! The receptionists were lovely and you have no curfew as to when you can come in, there is someone on reception 24 hours also. The beds are extremely comfy memory foam very hard to get out of! Bathroom a little small but what do you want from a budget hotel. The only thing I would say is there is no lift - bit hard being on the 4th floor, but you soon get used to it. All in all we LOVED this hotel and couldn't of asked for anywhere better! Definitely would recommend, and would definitely go back!

Although the hotel is officially smoke-free, also in the rooms there is a permanent smell of tobacco and marihuana-smoke. The hotel management does not seem to be interested in insisting on these rules... Our room was made very poorly, no vacum cleaning during the whole five days, just the bed has been made and the rubish been emptied. The carpet made a very disgusting impression. One day, despite we left the room before 9:30am, when returning at night we noticed the room had not been made up at all. Last but not least, the walls are not sound-proof at all. Sleeping without earplugs is nearly impossible, but we expected that due to the location of the hotel, so this point was no bad surprise.

Having booked an early flight we arrived well before check-in time but one of our 2 rooms were ready and we were able to put our luggage into it before going out for the day. (They also have a luggage room where cases can be left). We had one room on the first floor and one on the second - both 'standard doubles'. The 1st floor room was slightly larger but both were, like most city-centre hotels in Amsterdam, very small but clean - and no bed- bugs thank goodness. The beds were very comfortable and the shower rooms clean. Beware - there is no soap provided and as seems to be the norm in a lot of European countries there was no plug in the sink! Clothes storage space was abysmal - a tiny little 'hole' for hanging about 6 garments if you are lucky and an equally small cupboard with 2 shelves plus two bedside drawers - and you can't leave clothes in your suitcase as there is no room to have a case opened on the floor. We hadn't booked the breakfast option but were told by other guests that it was very poor - a bread roll and a cup of coffee from the vending machine. The reception staff were friendly and helpful but, as we found out, had very limited scope for dealing with anything out of the ordinary. We arrived back late one afternoon to find that the 1st floor room had been burgled and a camera stolen. On reporting this to reception we found that 2 other rooms had also been burgled with no signs of forced entry - suggesting that a key had been used. The thieves were obviously only after anything light and portable that could be stolen quickly and whilst we were 'lucky' in only having a camera on display, others weren't and had cameras, phones, money, credit cards etc taken. We discovered that the receptionist hadn't phoned the police and reported the burglaries and that we had to go and find the police station and report the thefts ourselves. The police couldn't have been nicer or more helpful but were none too happy that the hotel hadn't reported it themselves. On speaking to the receptionist later on - he said he had no authority to do any more than he did ( we assume there must be a manager/owner somewhere?) but was very sorry about it and did his limited best to do anything he could - he gave us a free security box for the rest of our stay and free coffee from the vending machine! This burglary was obviously an 'inside job' of some kind and if the hotel had reported it to the police I expect they would have been told to change all their locks - maybe they didn't want the expense! The big plus for this hotel is it's central location - it really can't be beaten and when you read the reviews for many other budget hotels in Amsterdam they are pretty awful.

We werent expecting much as a continental breakfast is miles away from what we regard as a breakfast here (sausage, eggs, bacon) however we were really pleasantly suprised with the warm rolls, prepacked cheese and tropicana orange juice. The tray also had a card on it that wished us a good morning and had the next 2 days weather on it which i thought was a nice touch.

With over 40 museums in Amsterdam alone, and with The Netherlands having the highest concentration of museums in the world, we enjoy every moment and you need to be in a prime location. And that is one of the best features of the Hotel de Gerstekorrel. We travelled in October 2008 with DFDS Seaways aboard the MS King of Scandinavia. After a wonderful crossing, we stayed in the hotel for one night. This year, we are staying in the hotel for two nights, but I must say that after our first stay at the Hotel de Gerstekorrel last year, I would be more than happy and will be staying here again in 2009. On arrival, the weather was thoroughly miserable, and due to a DFDS Seaways map being wrong, it took us almost an hour to find the hotel in the rain. Every Dutch person we asked, all they told us was it was on the Dam Strad. After finding it, we were told we couldn't check in for another couple of hours, which annoyed us slightly, as we weren't told of this, but we probably wouldn't of minded if the weather wasn't so bad. It didn't ruin the trip. Because the hotel was so cheap, we expected it to be very basic and prepared for it to be very low standard in its cleanliness and quality. However, when we arrived in our room, we were delighted to find a television with lots of English and Dutch channels, a telephone, a nice clean toilet and shower (although small) and a huge room. It was the same room but on two different heights with a few steep stairs Although our room window faced out onto a wall, we came to Amsterdam to go out and explore and didn't plan to stare out the window all day. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were clear and I can't express how friendly and co-operative the staff were - and moreso how great their Engish was. We received our automated wake up call right on time, and we enjoyed the continental breakfast delivered to us at our room at the exact time, sharp and prompt. It also had free WiFi, and I will taking advantage of it this year when I take my laptop. The rooms were very well heated/air conditioned, depending on the weather and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. It is located just next to Dam Square, so you're near lots of major attractions - although we had quite some time walking to Science Centre NEMO - which I must say is incredibly interesting! There is a great family feel to the hotel. It is only a bed and breakfast, continental breakfast at that, but that is all you really need and it's edible. Nearby is a coffeeshop, but there is no problem with that, nobody ever bothers you. With a one minute walk to Dam Square/Madame Tussauds/Nuewie Kerk/Royal Palace, 5 minute walk to Central Station and 3 minute walk to the Red Light District, this hotel is in a prime location and its fantastic quality with great prices. If travelling with DFDS Seaways, you must purchase the Day Trip Passes (that's the A, B, C, D and E) tickets which allow you access to different attractions for a great price. I think it cost us \u00c2\u00a360 each, but it cost us all \u00c2\u00a345 to get into Madame Tussauds anyway, so it's a great deal. Lots of different attractions to enjoy.

LOCATION: This hotel has probably the best location in Amsterdam, it is literally on the Dam and is a few minutes walk to shows, red light district, restuarants, madame tussaads, shopping etc. The Location is PERFECT, in my eyes I would much rather pay less, have a less star hotel and be close to everythingas opposed to paying more, having a posh hotel but be a while away from the attractions.

Both were extremely friendly and helpful and assisted us n finding certain attractions etc. Overall I would say this hotel is perfect for non fussy people, who are on a tight budget and want to see amsterdam as opposed to relax in a hotel.

Nice bathroom with shower. I did not find it noisy, even being on the street side. It is very clean, good beds (3 in my triple room). Price I paid was 99 Euro through a Dutch website [--], cheaper than via Booking.com. No credit card needed via this website I used.Not cheap but normal for Amsterdam. Location is very near Dam square, opposite rooms of the 5-star Krasnapolsky, ideal location I think, walking distance from central station and most sights in Amsterdam. For eating dinner in your room the next-door take-aways are ideal and cheap. No minibar in hotel room, no airco but a table fan, which I found to be VERY necessary in summer. Without it it would be too hot for me in summer in this hotel, but the fan means of course the room will not be quiet at night. In the reception you can get drinks and even toiletries. in bathroom there's only a dispenser on the wall, bring own toiletries. All in all a good place to stay, especially outside summer months. I am Dutch but stayed here because of a very early flight and evening activity in Amsterdam. Had to leave to early to say anything about breakfast but it is served in the room.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Location\u201d", "Author": "ScottishTraveller77", "ReviewID": "UR8231555", "Content": "The location of this hotel is superb for bars, shops, restaurants, trams. We paid for and expected a budget hotel and were pleasantly surprised that it was far nicer than we had anticipated. Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Our allocated room was on a different floor from our teenage children and the receptionist immediately said it wasn't a problem to change and gave us rooms on the same floor. Rooms were ready early and we were able to check in immediately. Rooms are pleasant (though not particularly large) with neutral decoration, beds comfortable, linen fresh and clean, showers worked well. Rooms facing the front can be noisy when the windows are open (the children had no problem with this) but the rooms at the back are very quiet. We had our breakfast delivered to our rooms every day at a time to suit us (warm rolls, jam, coffee, juice). We were able to leave our luggage in the hotel's locked storage room on our day of departure. We have been to Amsterdam on a number of occasions but this was our first stay at this hotel. We would not hesitate to book this one for our next trip. The only downside would be that the stairs are very steep and it is a little awkward to carry cases up and down.

The stairs are very steep and would not suit an old person or someone with say back/weight problems. The cost we paid was 50 euros per night without breakfast included which was hefty enough. However if you are like me and want to do Amsterdam properly and are not too bothered with elegant and quiet surroundings then its not an issue . We were able to walk from central station about 10 minutes to the Hotel and everything was so close! I would recommend also that you visit Susies Saloon which is a bar just around the corner. It has a pool tabel and between 4pm-6pm its 2 euros a pint of ice cold Heinekein (beautiful) Do Not buy drink from the Bulldog bar!!!!!! It cost us 70 euros for 1 round of beers and one wiskey was 8 euro! Getting back to the Hotel , the staff were friendly and to sum it up its clean, comfortable and really, really, central.

I picked it due to the location, of which turned out to be excellent. It was in walking distance of all main attractions. I think it was a good 3/4 hour walk to museum area, but there are lots of things to see and do on way. The hotel itself was presentable. We arrived mid afternoon to find that we were in room 40 - on the fourth floor with no lift! The stairs are quite steep, but managable, by the end of our stay we could get to the top without being out of breath!! The staff were very friendly and helpful, the reception was 24 hour. The information at reception for sightseeing was good (I recommend looking through 'Boom' Magazine for handy tips on where to go). The room was cleaned daily, with no extra cost incurred. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as there were so many cafes / bars that served breakfast and we like wandering around! We caught a train from airport to Central Station and walked it down to the hotel (which is about a 20 min walk down Damrak. You will pass a S-- Museum - this is rubbish. Also theres Teasers, which was 13 euro for two large beers - the dearest we paid, but my husband wasn't complaining!! Also on the left (opposite teasers on other side of road) is the Grasshopper Bar, well worth going into. We got round a few sights. We thought the museum entrance fee were a little steep. We went to Anne Franks House, which was alright (a bit depressing though!). It was a shame that the front had been altered to a modern looking buidling but I suppose this was required. We went in Hollands Casino, which is quite a grand building (don't forget picture id or you won't get in!), we had a quick walk around the Vondelpark, but due to the terrential rain we didn't see much of this. We did plan to hire bikes (there is a shop very close to hotel for this), but the weather put us off. The flower Market is good for soveniers, and I thought were the cheapest. I liked the Leidesplein and the Rembrantplein for drinking and meals. We went round the Red Light District Area a couple of times. The bars, are alright round here. I did not like the Old Sailor as it was always jammed packed with lads and a bit off putting. We went in the Casa Rossa S-- Show (recommended to be the best one). I thought it may have been a bit more racy, but the comment from the couple at the side of me kind of summed it up when the lady commented that her husband could dance better than the lady on stage.......Also the bar staff were very somber, and you were hard pushed to get them to serve you. We went for a smoke (something we have no real knowledge of), we were recommended to try thr Stones Cafe (about a 5 min walk from hotel) and the Bulldog (walk right from hotel and first left before canal or go over canal and then next left!! you'll see the signs). This is very commercialised so for people like us who didn't know what they were doing - ideal! I think though for the more expert smoker they would be a bit rubbish and overpriced. The bulldog cocktail bar on Leidesplein (I think) is well worth visiting in the evening. The bar opposite the hotel (Zwart) on the corner of Dam Square was my favourite. It played 70s and 80s music and has a good atmosphere. Overall I recommend you look through the Boom Magazine to give you some ideas, it also has vouchers in which came in handy (this magazine was in reception).
