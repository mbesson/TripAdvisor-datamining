Meanwhile the manager who received us, Mili, was very nice and kind with us.

Its at least a half hour trek to anywhere near town, the BB itself is in someones flat, which is on the main carriage way in the bad end of town. It advertises parking but there isn't any, unless you cross the main road, go over the dual carriage way (dangerous), over several crossings and down a really rough street to find a public parking spot. They speak no English, the family seem to be living there in amongst everything and the en suites constist of a shower head over the toilet. We did a runner after just one night instead of the three we booked but we had to pay to escape. Awful, awful, don't go there even if you're a budget traveller, you can get good last minute deals for the same price, if not cheaper at much better hotels, like La Gioconda.", "Date": "Apr 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR853263619", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "jennyshutts"}, {"Content": "Nuova gestione   showReview(20524493, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR392822274", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "utopic2002"}, {"Content": "Chiamarlo \"Art\" e' stata un'esagerazione!   showReview(8377772, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR527154681", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "niedzielko"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d606208-r14038553-Art_Bed_and_Breakfast-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "606208", "Price": "$81"}}
