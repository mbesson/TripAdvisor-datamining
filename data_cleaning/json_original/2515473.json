The bathtub did not drain. It was GROSS. We happened to notice it in the evening when we were rinsing off from swimming in the pool. We called the front desk, told them we would be going out for dinner, and would it be possible to have somebody come and fix the drain? They said no problem. We got back, and it was clear that somebody had been in there, but that nothing was fixed! All they did was pull out the plug and lay it on the floor and leave muddy footprints and a mess in the tub. Ewww... The next morning, my husband showered first. He specifically turned on and off the water while showering (to use less) because of the drainage issue. I waited over AN HOUR for it to drain, and finally I just gave up and started using a cup to take water from the tub and dump it in the sink. Finally, we had to get going so I just gave up and stood in water while I showered. Questions that went through my mind: 1. This didn't happen over night. Clearly, other customers must have complained about it, so why hasn't it been fixed? 2. Did the maid not notice when she was washing the tub that water wasn't draining? Why didn't she notify the manager? 3. Did the maid even CLEAN the tub? 4. If they knew that this room had a problem, why didn't they offer to move us? Why would they put ANYBODY in that room? Also, there was mold around the patio door to the pool, the TV channels listed in the pamphlet hadn't been updated since they switched providers TWO MONTHS earlier (and there are far less channels available now), and the room needed updating. The final kicker: When I checked out, I asked for a discount and explained the reasons/complaints why. The clerk went to the back to talk to the manager. The clerk came back and said that she could give me a $25 discount. I accepted, and then asked if it's normal for the manager to NOT speak to customers directly if they are unsatisfied. She stammered a little, and then said something about the manager being busy. I said oh? And the clerk said, \"Well, we get complaints ALL THE TIME so it'd be too many interruptions for the manager to have deal with them each individually.\" Nice.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on Earth\u201d", "Author": "Tanya B", "ReviewID": "UR127785850", "Content": "Beautiful w/partial ocean view, bed and pillows soooo comfortable; rooms clean and smell fresh; quiet and serene, can see/hear ocean from room; just walk out and you're on the beach!

I decided to on a staycation at the beach. I've seen the Best Western Blue Sea Lodge and thought I would give it a try. I went at the end of February on a Saturday when I knew the beaches are far less traveled. I was told on the phone that check-in is at 4 p.m. but I could come as early as 2 p.m. if a room was available. I was at the hotel at 2 p.m. and was promptly told a room wasn't available but I could use the facilities. I decided to walk around the beach and get some lunch. I surprised I couldn't check in until 4 p.m. especially when I saw about 15-20 people at the hotel. The front desk personnel were very nice. I was told my partial view room was in the newer part of the hotel. I was surprised to find my partial ocean view was actually a full view of the Public Rest Room. I could see the ocean so the advertisement wasn't false. lol. My problem with this room came later in the evening when I was out on the patio ~ the homeless started arguing whether you can spend the night in a public rest room or not. I suggest you get you partial room in the old part of the hotel because that is closer to the beach. This is where the pool, spa and most of my fellow hotel guests were located during the day and evening. The common area was very nice and the other guests were very friendly. The beach view is fantastic and there are restaurants / bars / gift shops nearby. You can't beat the location. Later on during the evening I kept looking around the old / beach front section of the hotel trying to figure out why I had to endure the Public Restroom room. I noticed the majority of the older section wasn't rented out especially the third floor and beach front rooms. Best Western I kindly suggest you offer upgrades (free or paid) in the older building if they are available before you put people near the North side of the newer building. Would I stay here again? I'm not sure. If I do stay here again I would make sure the exact room I got.

I don't know about other rooms, but room 509 with a partial ocean view on the third floor was perfect in my opinion. The down side to this place is paying $16 for parking and the garage has barely any clearance so just to be safe park next to registration if you can. Also, I thought the breakfast was continental, but apparently they charge for everything. I paid 10 dollars for 2 bagels with cream cheese and one tiny orange juice. Usually I would not pay that unless I am starving. Also, the employees are not all that. They were not rude to me, but they don't know how to explain where rooms are and when I walked up to the counter I had to say \"Excuse me\" so I could ask a question, kindly interrupting the 2 staff members' important conversation.

It\u2019s gone through other changes since then, including ownership and numerous managers, but two things have remained constant draws\u2013its immediate proximity to the ocean, and the friendliness and helpfulness of its management and staff. The hotel is modest in size, three floors, 128 rooms, and shaped like a lower-case \u2018h\u2019, with the feet being the full ocean view rooms directly on the boardwalk (which is between the building and the beach), and the sides and \u2018stem\u2019 being partial view rooms (looking at the ocean on an angle). Registration is in the \u2018stem\u2019 of the \u2018h\u2019, along with a modest caf\u00e9 and lounge area, and a computer terminal free for guests\u2019 use. The original building, way back even before my time, was all-suite, and most (not all) of those suites were eventually divided into individual rooms, so you have a sense of sizing \u2013 some rooms are quite tight! Rooms include a mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, free high-speed internet access, small safe (big enough for a small camera bag), plush terry robes (which can be purchased), and at least in the full ocean views (the only rooms I reserve), flat-screen TVs on the wall. Each wing of the \u2018h\u2019 has a laundry room, and an elevator - but it\u2019s quicker to climb a flight or two of stairs. The hotel has its own parking lots, both above and below ground, and charges a daily fee for parking. One caveat \u2013 the spaces seemed designed for mid-sized or smaller vehicles, and half the guests arrive in SUVs and pickup trucks, which can make squeezing into a slot a challenge, especially on sold-out summer weekends! The hotel caf\u00e9 has limited hours and serves light fare, but there are a score or more restaurants within a short walk along the boardwalk or Mission Blvd (the main drag paralleling the shore), including two - World Famous (excellent seafood) and Tony Roma\u2019s - right across the street (and the front desk often has discount coupons for some other of the local restaurants). Just about every other shopping necessity can be found within a short walk, including a major supermarket and drug store, and Garnet Avenue, the main shopping and entertainment district of Pacific Beach, is only a few blocks away. The main feature of the hotel, of course, is its immediate proximity to the beach and its attendant activities. Enjoy jogging, skating and cycling on the miles long paved boardwalk between the hotel and sand, and swim, surf, and boogie-board in the (generally gentle) ocean swells; rental accessories for all those activities can be found within a short walk of the hotel. And at day\u2019s end, there\u2019s nothing much more relaxing than sitting on one\u2019s balcony, in the cool ocean breeze, watching the sunset.

One night guests came into the courtyard at about 2:30 a.m., loud and playing in the pool. I called the front desk to let them know. In about 5 seconds the manager was there and in no uncertain terms told them to get out of the pool and go to bed. Fabulous. One thing I would skip is the breakfast area....it's stuff you'd find in a free continental buffet, but not free. Take advantage of the big grocery store down the street and the fridge in your room.

To me, on this trip being within visual distance of the ocean was more important than the room and amenities. My only request I made through the Wyndam Rewards website was not to put me on the first floor. I arrived an hour before check in time, and the front desk hostess promptly checked me in anyway. I was put on the first floor, Room 106. I was surprised that this room was even available given that the room across from me was partially demolished, the lower half of the walls in the hallway had drywall removed, with exposed studs, and the carpet in the hall and up to my door was covered with cardboard duct-taped to the walls and threshold. My balcony/patio opened up to a lovely ground level view of the parking lot. I was pretty much in disbelief at the whole situation. I approached the hostess (Melissa I think), and asked for a different room. She was very accommodating and immediately found an upper level room (352) which was an upgrade for me at no additional cost. She saved the day. The rest of the staff were uniformly friendly and personable, including housekeeping. The \"partial view\" rooms are exactly that. I was able to watch the sunset and see the ocean waves by sitting catty-corner on my balcony and looking between the buildings. The tropical decor wasn't something I'd choose (the inside chairs were stiff and uncomfortable, there were 2 paintings of the same thing), but there were little things that I could really appreciate (Oxygenics shower head with outstanding pressure, bottle opener in the bathroom, extra pillows, bottled water, ironing board, plenty of hand towels, decent coffee). There were a few minor annoyances (roof construction next door, the door lock wasn't responsive, the TV remote buttons were sticky) but it was a quiet, spacious, and comfortable room. The pool was a little crowded and felt a bit enclosed due to the glass windbreaks but appeared well maintained. Parking was $15/day. There is an excellent and popular beachfront restaurant (World Famous) across the parking lot with very reasonable prices that I ate breakfast at twice. The boardwalk spans several miles back and forth and gave me about an hour of brisk exercise daily, the sunsets were stunning, Mission Beach was clean, and there are plenty of convenience stores and restaurants nearby. I would stay at this hotel again but probably not for a special event like an anniversary. I felt like all the provisions I needed were there, it was weathered but clean, and the staff warmed the place up.

After trying twice to fix it they ended up just moving us to a different room, which turned out to be a beach front view w/ a flatscreen TV!

Another Plus was free internet in lobby where we were able to print out our boarding passes. Also, the lobby had a suprisingly good coffee shop w/ tasty pastries. Location is everything and all of the area attractions were about a 15 min drive away. We had rented a car for the days we were there and a car is def a must have when visiting SD. Plus Pacific Beach is great in general w/ plenty of bars, restaurants, and of course the board walk & ocean within walking distance of the hotel.

I found out after I arrived at the lobby that there was supposed to be a fee associated with the car ride but it was waived when I'm sure I looked surprised and mentioned that the free shuttle service was one of the reasons I choose the hotel. I was ready to pay, but the person in charge that day said it would be taken care of and wanted to know which website I had booked with. Today, I had a computer crisis, one that started last night. Melissa, is the nite clerk, and she is so helpful and happy to be helpful. she really deserves a raise, as she helped me last night with computer stuff--not even in her job description I'm sure, but was so kind, made some phone calls to get more advce, etc. She made me feel as if nothing was too much trouble. And the computer got up and running. We decided to just leave it on... No luck with that, so this morning down to the front desk I go and I'm told the Radio Shack isn't too far and they are willing to look at it. Well, it was quite a walk, but I got there only to find I would be purchasing a new laptop at Staples across the street. I stop at Ralph's (local grocery store that is very close 4-5 blocks, 10 minute walk/stroll and this is great as your room has a fridge, sink and microwave) on the way back and consider buying my own bottle of tequila... As I stroll in to the lobby I menton that that was quite a jaunt you sent me on, all three woman behind the counter had dropped jaws and truly surprised looks. They thought I had a car! I was offered a taxi when I needed to go back and pick up my new down-loaded computer. I asked the ball-park cost of that and the manager, Catherine B. spoke right up and said she would be happy to drive me over when the store called back. How nice is that I ask you? She piped right up and said her job was to help me enjoy my stay, all aspects of my stay. I have to say that between Melissa and Catherine, I could have had a bad association with my stay here, but I only have great things to say about the location, the friendly (over used I know, but really, happy friendliness, not the kind that you know 'it's just their job to act like they care) assistance with a problem that was really none of their responsibility makes me want this hotel to continue to be a success and popular. The boardwalk is right off the pool area and there are plenty of local places to eat within a five minute walk, bike rentals, surf board rentals, lots to do and a few touristy shops as well; T-shirts, beach chairs, etc. The pirce for this great stay was so very reasonable--I thought I could never afford to stay 'on the beach', but this hotel did exactly that.

I asked to be moved at this point, honestly i shouldn't have had to ask with some many things going wrong.

We stayed 4 nights at the Blue Sea Lodge and I give this hotel a solid 3 out of 5 stars. More like a 3.5. We loved the proximity to the beach. You cross the boardwalk and you're on the beach. The pool area was easily the best aspect of the hotel. You can sit behind a clear glass barrier and enjoy the sun and watch the waves w/o being bothered much. On the other hand, the hotel wasn't as quiet as I would have liked. I'm a light sleeper and needed a sleep aid to get to sleep 3 of the nights. We has a room with a king size bed and we did not have an ocean view. It would've been nice, but it would have been too loud for me coming from the Midwest. Also, the TV we had in our room was terrible. It was noisy and old. They need to upgrade from the 20\" tube to flat screens in all the rooms. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel as we decided to not rent a car. It cost around $40 each way. An airport shuttle would've been nice as would a continental breakfast. They did have a little shop that offered a few breakfast options. We ate there one morning but would not recommend it. There are way better options a few blocks away on the beach. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. They got us on the right bus and trolley to and from downtown and helped us with other recommendations. Our room was cleaned each day and there were no shortage of towels for the 2 of us. Lastly, I booked this hotel through expedia and found a 10% off promotional code online at some random website.

I agree with ALL of the positive remarks and NONE of the negative remarks. Apparently the hotel went thru a change over the past 12-18 months and all for the better. We stayed in room 312. Corner room with ocean front view. The room was not the biggest but not the smallest we have ever stayed in. However, what do you do in a hotel room besides sleep and watch T.V. and get it on. Your suitcases know more about the room then you do. For us as long as the room is clean, bed is bed-bug free with clean linens, and the hotel is located in a safe location (day and night), that is about one really needs. The balcony was sufficient to walk out on to. Once again, not the largest balcony we have ever had in a hotel room but it was large enough to have 2 chairs with a table. From our room we were able to view a beautiful sunset each and every night. Keep in mind this hotel is on the public walkway for the beach - SO anticipate noise. We could occasionally hear skateboarders attempting tricks and hear music from our room with the doors closed. However, like any beach venue, things slowed down around 10:30 pm. We were able to open our balcony door every night and go to sleep listening to the waves and ocean sounds with out being disturbed by any man made noises. There is plenty to do with in walking and driving distance of this hotel. We liked it that Ralph's grocery store with a Starbucks was only 2 blocks away. Prices were reasonable, not outrageous.. This is a good place to stay both as an older couple OR for a family. We never heard our \"hotel mates\". We only saw other persons staying at the hotel when we came and went from our room Otherwise, we would have thought we were the only ones in the hotel and this was during Spring Break. Balboa park was beautiful and only a short 15 min drive, in busy traffic, away. We didn't take in any amusement parks etc, but passed them frequently as they are all close to this hotel. Side note: We ventured to Torrey Pines to see what the fuss was about the golf course and views. It is beautiful, so take in the sunsets from there if possible BUT skip the Hilton Torrey Pines. The food was outrageously priced and we didn't get what we paid for. There is just so much to do around San Diego that is so inexpensive. Take it all in. Parking at the hotel is NOT free. However, negotiate with the hotel manager for a discount. It is available...particularly if you mention a company that you work for. A lot of times they will knock off 1/2 or more for parking each day. The swimming pool is private - meaning no one other then hotel guests have access to it. You must have a room key to go in and out of the pool area. The view from the pool area isn't that great - in other words, you can't lay out and watch the beach BUT it is nice to lounge by.

They gave us advice on pizza delivery, and was not disappointed with that either. We enjoyed the large TV with cable. I'm glad I read a review of the hotel on-line before we checked-in, because I knew to expect a smaller size than usual hotel room.

Check in was quick-got room keys to room #344. Parking provided was covered garage but it was quite a trek to the elevator to get to the room. Opened the room and immeidately saw an open purse on the floor as well as a suitcase with clothes. Ooops-our room key worked just fine but someone else was already staying there. Very disconcerting. Thinking things happen sometimes and rolled our luggage all the way back to the lobby which was two buildings and three floors away. Asked for Matt the person who checked us in and he at first said it couldn't have happened (like we were lying!). Then he did something on the computer and said \"oh my bad, I looked at the number wrong\"-ran our cards back through the machine and told us it should be room 244. Never apologized or offered any other explanation. At this point I felt very uncomfortable and told my husband we'd be taking all valuables with us if we went out. Got to room 244 and immediately noticed the disinfectant smell obviously covering up what smelled like stale beer. The room was very small but adequate, however what we thought would be an oceanview room had a view into the bedroom of the old apartment complex immediately next door. Walking out onto the small balcony, you could see a view of the beach looking down an alley filled with garbage cans and cars. My husband went back once again to the desk to inquire about any other room that might be available and was told for a $60 additional/night fee we could get a partial ocean view in room 245. He brought the key back for us to view that room and once again it was just one room closer but the view wasn't any better-just didn't have the bedroom across from our window. When my husband went back to discuss with the desk clerk he was saying if we didn't like it and we checked out that we'd still have to pay the one night. No effort to help us get a better room whatsoever.

After reading the other reviews here, I decided to take a chance on the Best Western Blue Sea Lodge and I am so glad that I did. I made my reservation online through the location's own website (not the general Best Western one) and the process was very easy. On extremely short notice, I was able to get a room with a full ocean view (keeping in mind this was in February during a bad economy -- I wouldn't expect the same in the summer). We did make the small mistake of driving into the Pacific Beach area down Garnet Avenue on a Saturday which was somewhat clogged with traffic and typical \"beach bum\" pedestrians, but I say \"small\" mistake because it gave us at least an idea of what all was along the area's main drag. For those in a hurry or who don't like traffic, I might recommend approaching the hotel on Grand Avenue or one of the many other smaller streets. However, do be warned that the entire area is a typical California beach town and that all of the streets are relatively narrow and that it's a place where parking spaces are very hard to find (except at one's hotel). Upon turning onto Pacific Beach Drive from Mission Boulevard, take the little turn area to the left just past the public restrooms that divide traffic and that is just before the street ends at the beach. Right in front of you will be the driving entrance to the hotel where you can park and enter the lobby. Because parking is at a premium in this area, they do charge $12 onto your stay if you do need a space (this is clearly mentioned on their site before making a reservation) -- do be aware that this is not uncommon all through San Diego and not just in Pacific Beach. We arrived quite early for the listed 4:00 check-in time, but we went in anyway just to check and see if our room was available. There was one couple already being helped at the counter, but a second gentleman working there saw us from the back and almost leaped out to immediately assist us. Both of the counter workers were extremely helpful and courteous. The one helping us said that there were already rooms available and that we could indeed check in early. Rooms with the full ocean view were available on any of the hotel's three floors, and I asked for the third so there would be no foot-stomping above us and we wouldn't be right in the face of the crowds walking by or the people enjoying the beach. After getting checked in and provided with our parking tag (there is even underground parking if desired), the guy helping us at the counter gave us a few tips and we were off to our room. We were given Room 361 on the far south corner facing the ocean. The room is small but they have made great use of one off-angle corner area where they placed a full-length mirror in order to make it seem larger. I want to stress that my use of the word \"small\" by no means should imply that the room is uncomfortable. It was extremely clean and well-kept. The only blemish I noticed during the entire trip on the inside was a small tear in the shade on the floor lamp. On the outside patio -- complete with two comfortable chairs and a table on which to sit one's favorite beverage -- any blemishes are due simply to the room's close proximity to the beach (as one can literally feel the very slight edge of the spray from the waves when the ocean reaches high tide). More on the inside -- the bed was extremely comfortable. There were two extra pillows provided in the closet to add to the three on the bed itself. Especially for those who recognize my avatar, there were plenty of places for our stuff even though the room size is small. The chairs and table were comfortable and sturdy, and the room contained a binder provided by the hotel that contained lots of information on the area. Robes are provided for your use that might look uncomfortable upon first glance, but are actually very cozy and handy. The bathroom was immaculate and well-stocked with towels. The shower/bathtub is sort of sunken down into the floor which I think made it more accessible to the handicapped. It was a little odd to get into but I think only because I wasn't used to it. I will caution those reading this that it is a little louder than other hotels when somebody next door uses their own shower and might be startling the first time it is heard. The pool area is very cool because it faces the ocean -- it is well-kept and very clean. The ice machine and soda pop are down on the first floor, but there is an elevator so that's no big deal if you don't want to take the stairs. The soda pop is, as usual, a bit on the expensive side and goes up to $2 if you want a bottle of Minute Maid Lemonade. On that front, you are better off taking the short walk across Pacific Beach Drive into the small strip mall that faces Mission Boulevard where there is a liquor/convenience store or taking a longer but reasonable walk north on Mission to Ralph's grocery store or a 7-Eleven that's further up. There is also a small caf\u00e9/deli in the lobby of the hotel that was fairly full of people on Sunday morning, but we did not eat there. Most people should find that anything they want is within easy walking distance. I felt very safe even at night and even going down the narrow alleys that split up certain buildings and streets. The beach cannot be any closer. World Famous, The Eggery, and Ocean's Pizza are all basically just across the street, and much more in food, drink, and surf/gift shops are a few short blocks to the north. As mentioned above, parking is hard to get in Pacific Beach, so walking is the best way to go. However, due to the proximity to the ocean, the friendly people, and the relatively slow pace (as opposed to much of the rest of southern California), I don't look at that one bit as being a bad thing. For what one normally pays anywhere in the southern part of this state for anything with a view, this hotel cannot be beat. Unless you want to make reservations at least six months in advance for the Crystal Pier and pay even more, it is pretty much impossible to get an ocean view any closer to the sea. The patio view and the sound of the waves was worth every hard-earned penny an no other place in San Diego that I have ever stayed in -- all at much higher rates -- was better. Even if I could not get an ocean front view, I would still recommend this hotel for those looking to stay in Pacific Beach.", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "azgalcb", "ReviewID": "UR24671367", "Content": "Picture welcoming smiles, comfortable rooms, sandy beach with great ocean views and rolling waves at your fingertips.

As in previous posts, you probably don't want to be on the first floor if your room is on the end nearest the ocean due to noise. Activity goes well into the night. My biggest gripe is that the carpet was filthy in our unit. Put on white socks, walk around 1 minute, and the socks are dark brown on the bottom. That's the one maintenance area we found seriously lacking. Other than that, houskeeping was great. Lots of restaurants are within walking distance.

Yes, they do charge for parking - it is at a premium around the beach. However, for this fee, you get to park underneath the building in covered, secured parking. I felt it worth the price.

I found this and a couple of other hotels in San Diego that were ON THE BEACH and picked this one at the request of my husband, who felt more comfortable going with an established \"brand name.\" (Best Western) The area, Pacific Beach, is very crowded both with residents and travelers. However, upon our request we were placed in a room that was VERY quiet and faced an apartment house next door rather than the beach or the pool. This was important to us as we have a toddler who goes to bed early and is a light sleeper. I know we had people staying in the rooms on either side of us and above us, but I never heard them. The only time we had a problem with noise was when the noisy frat boys staying under us decided to have a drink on their patio at 2:30 in the morning (more on that later). They didn't stay outside long (I think someone had complained about the noise, and they went inside) and we didn't have another problem with it on other nights. We did have a small balcony, which was nice, as well as a table with two chairs and a bar with two barstools where our toddler could eat his meals. The room we got was nice, very clean, the bathroom looked like it had been recently refurbished. The bedspread, couch and some other furnishings were a bit worn but nothing we couldn't live with. The room had a queen bed and a pullout queen sofa. With the sofa folded up, the room was spacious; with the bed out, not so much, so we only left the bed out at nighttime. Overall it was a pretty average room but we don't have champagne tastes :) There was good closet space but the bathroom does not have a bathtub, perhaps for water-conservation reasons. We had to have our 2-year-old take showers with us instead of the baths he is used to, which was a new experience for him, but not a problem; actually after the first time he enjoyed the shower a lot. The hotel's common areas are a little worse for the wear and it's apparent the hotel has been there for some time, but otherwise are OK. We saw hotel workers painting, cleaning, etc. the whole time we were there, so I think they are trying to keep up with it, but with a large volume of people through the building, plus the sea air to contend with, it's probably an uphill battle. Everything was clean and the hotel does have some nice amenities, including a microwave and refrigerator in the room we got along with a washer and dryer on the floor beneath us to wash seawater-soaked towels and clothes. There is on-site parking you pay extra for, which I was glad to have after I saw how congested the general area is and watched people circle to find parking places. Despite high foot traffic in the area the parking lot for the hotel is secure and we didn't have any problems with our car when we were there. There is a Ralph's grocery store about 2 blocks from the hotel, so we were able to buy groceries and keep them in the in-room refrigerator, which was great for us and would be a real advantage to this hotel over others, as it's always helpful (I think) to be able to keep some food in the room. The pool was nice but be aware I think they use purified saltwater for it; the water was very salty for pool water, but the pool was clean and the area was well-policed for garbage, etc. The best part of all was the beach access: walk past the pool to a door in the glass wall facing the ocean, and you are on the boardwalk with the beach just steps away. We could hear the ocean from our side-facing room (although we couldn't see it unless we looked around the corner of the building, but that was fine with us :) and that, to me, was the best part of the hotel. The one advisory I have for families is that this area is apparently Party Central for high school and college kids looking to hang out on the beach. The boardwalk in front of the hotel has constant activity and is quite loud (shouting, laughing, boomboxes and stereos going, etc.). I would not have wanted to stay in the front of the building facing the beach, or facing the pool; it would have just been way too noisy. The boardwalk was a very interesting place to take walks but I don't know if I would have wanted to put up with it for longer than the three days we were there. If you are looking for peace and quiet, this is probably NOT the hotel to stay in in San Diego. For us, having a small child, it could have been a disadvantage. If you have teenagers, however, I would think this would be a great place to stay as they would have plenty of opportunities to meet other teenagers. The area is well-patrolled by police, lifeguards, and private security from the hotels, so there wouldn't be much fear of anything bad happening. All in all, though, I found the hotel to be very pleasant and was satisfied with what we got for the amount of money we paid. We have stayed at places with far fewer amenities that cost more money in other cities we have visited. I am not sure we would stay here again if we were going to be in town longer next time, but I would recommend this to other travelers who don't mind (or are actively seeking) a lot of activity where they stay.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, California", "Title": "\u201cFun Location, Grungy Motel\u201d", "Author": "attymom", "ReviewID": "UR17010608", "Content": "If you are looking for a serene beach getaway, this is NOT the place.

I've been a regular guest at this hotel for over 20 years, through numerous management and ownership changes, because of its location and staff. It's a fairly small hotel with 128 rooms total, only a portion of which are true 'oceanfront', the rest being so-called 'partial view' (the rooms are 'perpendicular' to the beach, so the ocean & sun view are at an angle) - if you want the entire horizon as seen from your balcony to be ocean (and that is breathtaking - see my photo), be sure to specify, though of course those rooms are more expensive. Except for suites, rooms are fairly small; when first opened, it was all-suite, but eventually the suites got split into two rooms, making for some very tight quarters. Rooms all include mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, iron & ironing board, CD clock radio, a small safe (big enough to stash a small camera bag, not the wallet&jewelry 'glove compartment' size I've seen elsewhere), and recent upgrades added flat-screen TVs in the ocean-front rooms; there is also a guest laundry. The original main building is U-shaped, with a modest pool and small jacuzzi located between the wings, facing the ocean; lazing in lounge chairs provides a great view of the ocean and the passers-by on the boardwalk. The hotel is adjacent to the paved boardwalk which runs from south Mission Beach up through Pacific Beach. The good news is that the boardwalk provides a perfect (albeit mobbed in summer) oceanfront walk (or skate, blade, bikeride, et al - all rentable options in the immediate area); the bad news is that skateboarders make a lot of noise on concrete, and they and other locals often hang out on & along the boardwalk into the late evening (again, more often in summer). The latest expansion of the hotel added a coffee shop, which (as of my last visit) stays open until about noon, but for a serious meal, you have to venture out ; there are numerous restaurants, many oceanfront, within a very short walk, including 'World Famous' and Tony Roma's, both just across the street. The former is oceanfront, the latter in a mini-mall; also within a short walk north are a host of other restaurants, as well as a drug store and a supermarket. The hotel has its own outdoor and underground parking lots (be warned - the spaces are ludicrously undersized, seemingly designed for compacts, and in the summer space is at a premium!), and charges a daily parking fee. Jump in your car and the downtown Pacific Beach shopping area is about a mile away, spectacular downtown La Jolla 10 minutes' drive north, and Sea World 10 minutes' drive south. There are several other oceanfront hotels in the immediate area, with roughly the same amenities for comparable rates, though most sit further back (mixed blessing) from the boardwalk and ocean, some are just too chic ('No bare feet or bathing suits in lobby' in one totally turned me off), and this is the only one (I believe) which is part of a chain - those high summer rates rack up a lot of points on my Best Western account!", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location, Okay hotel\u201d", "Author": "rizzay", "ReviewID": "UR8852764", "Content": "Great place to stay if you just want a place to crash in a beautiful area of SD.

The hotel location was just right for me it's across from the beach, just the boardwalk separating it. In the early evening you could catch the sunset which is gorgeous. Make sure you book an oceanfront . My mistake, I didn't believed the reviews that it's worth getting the oceanfront. I booked just the ordinary room w/ king size bed. I got there early and the room wasn't ready until 3p.m. which is their check-in time so I had to wait. Have the chance to walk and survey area for restaurants. Came back and check-in to my booked room.... The size was okay but what I didn't like about it was the view of the wall from the next door building. Na-ah, not working for me. So went back to front desk, and requested for another room available with a view. Offered me an oceanfront with upgraded fee-checked it out first before I said ok. Love it, accepted it and the rest was history. My BIG advise GET an OCEANFRONT VIEW, it's worth it. Cleanliness rank ok. And forgot to tell you, It includes a flat screen t.v. in the rooom-COOL.

We reserved an ocean front room and got exactly that. Our balcony overlooked the boardwalk, beach and ocean. While I did find the room to be a bit small (I think my last hotel room in NYC was larger) it was more than adequate for the two of us and the little time we spent in it. The bed was comfy, the flatscreen TV awesome and the bathroom clean and updated. Our maid did a fantastic job of cleaning the room as soon as we asked (we never even ran into her/him) and was even able to get all the sand out of the tub every time. The staff was helpful and pleasant to deal with. We had no trouble with noisy neighbors but, we were on the third floor. We did find the beach to be a bit noisy so, we soon learned it best to close the balcony door at night and for afternoon naps. Otherwise, it was great to sit outside and people watch. My theory is, after reading other reviews, that the type of room you reserve/ask for determines whether or not your stay in pleasurable. You definitely get what you pay for. Spend a little extra and book a renovated ocean front room and you shouldn't be disappointed. Book a \"city/garden view\" or a non-renovated room and you get parking lots, public restrooms and frustration.

Of course that trip will take place once your 'final touches' of the remodeling efforts are complete. We are confident that your staff is feverishly in the middle of the upgrades as of this writing - probably just down to picking out new paint colors? Who knows? Maybe you only had to finish up with the room we occupied? Whatever the case may be, we can only hope the outcome will include removal of all the rusted out metal on the balcony, broken bath tiles, dingy carpet, old air conditioning unit, beds made of marshmallows, and you might want to have the smoke alarms installed on the ceiling instead of laying on the floor. By the way (just something to think about), in order to effectively \"FIX\" an electrical outlet (your parking garage and spa areas come to mind), you need to consider doing more than covering the switches with duct tape (although the colored tape was a nice touch over the same-old gray). Yes, electricians are quite expensive...hmmmm, come to think of it, SO ARE YOUR RATES. Figuring you must net a nice profit per day per room, you might dig deep for a couple of bucks so that a professional can correct these things to keep your place up to code. Even with the \"less than award winning\" room, we could not let the \"lesser than award winning spa and pool\" go by without a comment. Nice to see that there were plenty of used pool towels available for our use. It was uncanny how day and night, there were no towels available. No bother, we did bring our own, of course why would we need them? The pool AND spa were covered end-to-end with screaming children who's parents found it to be the perfect playground for water polo and splashing events. What can one say about the relaxing spa? The beautiful yellowish hue at night, the smell? We'd rather block that from our memory. Oh well, even though the pool, spa and room were probably a smidgeon below \"award winning\", we decided to get a little ice from one of the two antique ice machines to chill our beverages so that we could imbibe on the beach while watching the incredible sunset. Did I say, ice? What ice? By the end of our stay, we determined that between 3:00-4:00am, the machine would casually dispense ice, otherwise, yep, empty. At least you can't duct tape over the sunset! Last, but not least, we REALLY enjoyed winning the coffee lottery on day 1 and day 5 of our visit. We're glad your \"award-winning\" staff was looking out for us and our caffeine intake. One more thing, you could probably do without the alarm clocks, they're unnecessary unless you're in a third floor room. Just hire the family who was in the room above us to stay above guests on the morning of departure. They seem to be up and jumping around 6ish EVERY DAY. Again, it was memorable, so was appendicitis and the Steelers losing Super Bowl XXX. Best regards.
