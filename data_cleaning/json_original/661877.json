I must emphasis the cleanliness. Good clean linen and fresh towels.There is a hairdryer available and plenty of storage if you need it. the room has a t.v if you need one..:) Also you get free wifi. The breakfast buffet is served on a rooftop terrace with amazing views. The food is excellent and there is a good choice. You will not go hungry. After a day of sight seeing you can relax in the bar which is traditional style and full of comfotable cushions and couches to chill out on. Again another mention to the staff. All the team are friendly and helpful. Elvis will help and advise you as will any of the team. I personally think this is a lovely charming hotel which charges a fair price for good quality.I also felt safe here. When you visit big cities there is always the problem of been charged high prices for sub standard rooms. This is certainly not the case here.I would definately use this hotel again and i would recommend it to others.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Markham, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLOVED IT!\u201d", "Author": "sharon p", "ReviewID": "UR123646737", "Content": "beautiful hotel! very clean, great service........very friendly staff.......stayed for 1 week.....highly recommend this hotel......ask for Bayram..... he was very friendly and willing to help make your holiday memorable....thanx Bayram!", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent place to stay\u201d", "Author": "lynn g", "ReviewID": "UR123630031", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for only one day en route to Rome.

In the morning the manager(Coskhun) demanded to know exactly how long i wanted to stay; I explained that my itinerary was open, and they said that they would put me down for a week and that iI would have to pay in advance, and they would require three days notice to cancell. I offered to pay night by night, and give them one day notice; we could not resolve this issue so I checked out. I paid my bill with cash. The Owner refused to give me a receipt, was intimidating and rude and physically threatening, and even tried to physically block me as i left the premises!! After he was paid for my one nights stay, he yelled at me that he would now charge My credit card, and he has done so. I have been charged twice for my one nights stay. I feel that other people should be aware that this hotel owner is a thief. C omp breakfast on the terrace was below expectations. Olives, bread, juices and coffee and tea. Also tomatoes. It was served on a lovely terrace with amazing views of the Sultanhamet area. I will not return to Star Hostel again I would advise any future traveller to this hotel to be carefull.

However , thanks to the location of the hotel and a lot of help from the staff members, we very much enjoyed hanging around the area, especially Sultanahmed area. Also they helped us out finding really good deals for some activities, including an evening belly dance show, a half-day Bosphorus cruise, and even a hot air balloon tour in G\u00c3\u00b6reme, Cappadocia. Very professional and generous! The hotel room is very clean and comfortable. The double bed was big and soft. The night view from the terrace is just amazing. You can see the other shore lit up by orange lights. And most of all, we had lots of fun times at the cafe in front of the hotel, which is located on the street. Very welcoming, offering Turkish tea and alcohol. Just sitting, chilling out, and chatting with different guests and staff members there gave us many interesting and international experiences.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Star Hotel Istanbul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d661877-Reviews-Star_Hotel_Istanbul-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$85 - $218*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Akbiyik cad.
