We rang the buzzer for the Hotel Papi repeatedly but no one buzzed us through the street gate! So we continued to press the button for the Hotel Papi and sat out on the street. Once a resident from the complex came out we entered past the street gate. Next was the locked building door. We pressed the button for the Hotel Papi again and FINALLY someone buzzed us through. When I explained all of this to the gentleman at the front desk I was treated rudely. He said he was at the desk and insisted I did not press the right buttons. I am 110% certain my wife and I pressed the correct buttons. No apology from the gentleman at the desk. Had noone come out of the complex, we would have had to check in at another hotel for the night!! Scary thought... right now we are worried that if we head out for some gelato, we'll face the same neglect and not get through the street gate.

The room was very hot, although this was in March and the temperature outside wasn't that high. The AC didn't work correctly, so we could choose between either a very cold or a very hot room. The view from the window was of a back alley with little light coming through it. I recieved information on how to connect to the wireless internet, but I couldn't see the access point at all in the room. I finally got a weak signal to another access point that I could use, but only at one very specific location in the room - everywhere else, the was no signal at all. The room was very clean, so no complaint whatsoever in that department. The service wasn't excellent - and it frankly seemed like some of the employees viewed guests as somewhat of a nuisance - but it was acceptable and one of the employees actually went beyond the bare minimum, providing assistance and advice.

The breakfast area was compact, though it didn't matter as we couldn't wait to get out and explore what Rome had to offer. The area surrounding the hotel is great, beside the Castle Saint Angelo and Bridge, which are fantastic landmarks, and only up the road is St. Peters Square and the vatican. Across the river is piazza navona/ pantheon and surrounds with great restaurants everywhere. We recommend getting the hop on hop off bus and it stops just across from the castle on your way back to the hotel.
