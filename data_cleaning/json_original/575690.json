Pros: 1) Great location... especially if you want to go for a gondola ride as some of them are parked right outside the hotel doorstep. 2) Buffet breakfast is typical Italian... cold cuts, breads and cheese. Set in the cozy sitting area overlooking the charming patio and canals. 3) Staff are very friendly. Rooms and bathroom were freshened up daily. Cons: 1) Although this could be a pro, IMHO the room decor was too heavy and dark. Perhaps this was the hotel's way of showing the typical Venetian decor of old.

We checked in at the main Palazzo Priuli, and breakfasted there, but otherwise we really enjoyed the experience of having our own \"front door\". We were on the top floor with what seemed to be apartments below, but we never experienced any noise, and the reception staff at the Palazzo were perfectly charming and helpful.

Most places we stayed were fantastic, as per our reviews. However, this was a disaster. Firstly, when I booked three rooms through booking.com I left the message for the hotel \"Hi bongiorno ! We are a family traveling from Australia regards\". We then arrived at the address on the booking of Castello 4984/5, Castello, Venice. It's a small reception, but manned, and as we went to check in we were told that we would be in two different buildings. This, of course, was unnacceptable because we had four children in our group, so we could not split the group in that way. It got worse; the two buildings we were going to were BOTH different to the building we were at with the reception, and neither had overnight reception. Given the price we were paying, this was extraordinary ! When we were booked, the photos were of a premise were we checked in; but other than that we did not step foot in the hotel ! It was like checking into a 4 star Novotell to stay at the 2 star Mercure next door, and after you had booked the hotel rooms because you had searched for 3 star and better properties ! So, there are a few big issues here. One, the advertising should have made it clear that the rooms were detached from the premise that we searched and booked. Secondly, the premises are rated differently; they should not be marketed jointly without CLEARLY letting customers know this fact. There is NOTHING on my booking.com confirmation to this effect. Thirdly, especially for children and the elderly, it should be made clear that the premise they will stay in is not attended at reception for 24 hours; even today, when I searched the hotel through skyscanner hotels the first feature listed in amenities is 24 hour hotel ! Fourthly, we searched for 3 star and better establishments when clearly the rooms we were given were not of that standard. We arrived at 6pm on a Friday night, with 4 children and a 70+ year old, so it was impossible for us to relocate for the night we were in Venice. Frankly, visiting for one night it is disappointing we need to spend any time at all at reception being shocked by such unprofessional surprises. Make no mistake; this was commercial deceit the likes of which would be illegal in our home country. The attitude of the staff when we raised these issues was a shrug of the shoulders and ... tough luck ! Sorry, just not up to scratch, Casa Nicolo Priuli. Having said all of that, the rooms were ok, albeit the steps steep and corridors narrow for our elderly companion. The experience was soured by all of the above though; we could never book here again in good faith, and suggest travellers stay elsewhere in Venice. I have purposefully waited some months before posting this review to try and be more objective, but the end result can't be changed - this was disgraceful, unethical behaviour by Casa Nicolo Priuli.

It had enough room for a small table and two chairs in addition to the bed. The bed was rather hard and despite being a so-called matrimonial bed, it was just two singles pushed together leaving a crack in the middle. To be fair both bed issues seem common in Italy rather than just limited to this hotel, but still there must be comfortable queen size bed somewhere in Italy, especially in this price range. The elevator was claustrophobic; aside from moving the luggage we always took the stairs but this could be an issue for some guests. Breakfast was quite tasty both mornings and served in a very nice setting. Physically, the location is great, just a short distance from St. Mark's square. But it is also a fairly noisy. Boats run along the canal all night. And worse there is a touristy cross between an Italian bar and gelato store that no Italian would ever visit that is quite loud. Maybe jet lag made it worse. The internet is free but as in most Italian hotels it is a hassle. I don't understand why Italian hotels can't just hand out a WEP/WPA key and perhaps change it once a month or week. Instead many of them have subscribed to a tedious system where you receive a ticket with a username and password good for say 24 hours. Both the username and password are eight characters and contain a tedious mix of lowercase and numbers, more suitable to a bank or trading account than mere internet access. Moreover, the system automatically logs you out after some period of inactivity, perhaps an hour, and it often seems necessary to reenter the tedious username and password (I was using an iPod touch). One comment from another hotelier seemed to imply this hassle was a result of 9/11 and presumably a legal requirement. Maybe the hotels can start pushing back against the surveillance society in the name of business; terrorists who who want to go undetected will find a way whether it is encryption, digital stenography, or any number of other means.

Rooms: the rooms are quiet large, the decoration is all right although it all looks better on the pictures than in person: maybe if the finishing had been done with little more care it would have looked much better - but this is going overboard, for a \"normal\" person it is just fine. We had a mini bar, tv set, small safe, wardrobe, a table and 2-3 chairs. Bathroom: the bathroom is nice and clean. There is a shower curtain, you get the small welcome set (soap, shampoo, shower cap, toothbrush and toothpaste); large and small towel and a floor rug. Breakfast: excellent! You get a little bit of everything: ham, cheese, eggs, salad, fruit salad, yogurts, fruit, croissants, cornflakes, muesli, juices, coffee ... really a lot to choose from, and the waiter keeps bringing fresh stuff if it gets low. There's even a toaster! Breakfast was really a positive surprise. Overall I would recommend this hotel for stay in Venice. We payed 150 euros/night for a double room w/breakfast ... not cheap but then again nothing is in Venice. With a few cosmetic touches they could really leave a much better impression, but I would say it is one of the better 3* solutions in Venice.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay\u201d", "Author": "JohnHols", "ReviewID": "UR18630406", "Content": "This place is OK to find, a few mins walk from St. Marcs, however some travel agents position it in completely the wrong location! Look at the hotel's own website to get the correct map location. Check-in is at the Palazza Nicolo Hotel next door, which is now merged into the same hotel. This is in a beautiful canal just off the main tourist routes. You can pick up a gondola from right outside the hotel (about 3 very laid back gondoliers run from here) who's standard route does not get caught up with the \"gondola jams\" near St. Marcs, a far more romantic experience (100 Euros at night). The hotel is 14th century, very clean and comfortable. Our delux canal view double room had a good view of two canals and a Basilica with its own leaning tower. The room was decorated in \"period style\" but with a luxury modern bathroom. However the air con was inadequate for August. The room was slightly removed from the main hotel in some converted apartments next door, on the top floor- this corner position is necessary for the canal views. If you get one of these rooms there is a small lift but remember to keep your finger pressed on the button all the time to make it move! Breakfast was a very nice buffet with good choice. A small bar across the canal serves great food at a reasonable price, but plays music till midnight, which then stops prompt, so don't go to bed too early.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Casa Nicolo Priuli", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d575690-Reviews-Casa_Nicolo_Priuli-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$183 - $558*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Castello 4985/4</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30122</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "575690", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8e/62/8e6208c095f99e326246bd96616fe56d7large.jpg"}}
