I travel alone almost everywhere I go so it was wonderful to have such friendly staff that were always welcoming and helpful but never intrusive. They went above and beyond for even the smallest request. I worked in luxury travel sales and used to represent a Four Seasons hotel so always offer small tips wherever I stay. My shower head wasn't mounted properly so I mentioned that I'd found a solution (anchoring it with my hairbrush) but that they might want to have it fixed before the next guest arrived. It was fixed when I returned to my room that afternoon. Another day, I returned with a black radish which I was fascinated by because I'd never seen one before and Erdi not only cut it up for me but sat with me to eat it and prepared the other one with honey to sit overnight, something they do in Turkey for colds, and presented it to me in the morning. It's little touches like those that make a trip even more memorable. Plus you really can't beat the location.

We arrived late and were greeted by Erdi which did nothing but smile and was very patient when explaining to us some of the sights to see - at 1 am. They realised we had travelled for some time and whipped up some refreshing drinks and gave us some Turkish delights for energy. We were also upgraded from a double to a triple room for some extra space. During the entire stay at the Hotel Adora, if there was anything, Erdi would help us. He also helped us when we needed arranging the Florence Nightingale museum, which apparently not everyone have heard about. The breakfast buffet is simple, but for us it was an excellent choice since we also wanted to try the Turkish (breakfast) cuisine at other places. We had the breakfast 2-3 days, then went out in the city for breakfast the other days (and could sleep a bit longer :). The rooms are nice and tidy and you get a good night sleep - even though the hotel is located close to Gulhane tramstation which makes it even more ideal to have as a starting point. Walking distance to some of major sightseeings (less than 5 minutes), and with access to the tram you can also easily visit the Biggest Shopping Mall in Europe. So, something for everyone!

The internet response to my booking came quickly and efficiently. The room on the 5th floor was clean and adequate for our needs. Breakfast was included in the rate and that was really a great selection. Breakfast was not only bread and cheese, but a varieyt of breads and cheeses, fruits, juices, olives, boiled and scrambled eggs and sausages. The small hotel is centrally located a min from a tram station and right across the street from the side entrance of the Topkapi palace and very easily within a no sweat leisurely walk to the Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, Grand Bazaar, Egyptian Spice Market, Bosphorus Tours, New Mosque. The room had everything we needed, a safe, refrigerator and even a little corner to have our luggage and a vanity table & in room and dining room internet. My only comment for improvement is that they need better lighting in the bathroom. Best of all the staff was over and beyond helpful and friendly. They went out of their way to contact us at the airport where we were waiting for our daughter who had missed her flight.

If you pick a hotel right on the main line, there tends to be clanging sounds. Hotel was also within walking distance to all the important sites, Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, etc., also within 10-15 min. to Eminonu. Scenery along the street of the metro is very charming and picturesque so that the walk is not boring. Most importantly, it is located in a very nice area so that walking at night feels very safe. There were several young women staying alone at the hotel. Restaurants along the metro are more expensive, but not necessarily better. Hotel is also within 5-10 min. walk of some really cheap and good eateries; we were able to buy fresh squeezed orange juice for 1TYL at some cafes. Staff -- really the gem of the place. The manager Erdi and the staff were friendly, funny, and helpful. Even just walking by us while we were waiting for the elevator, they would take the time to press the elevator button for us. They made the entire experience very warm and friendly. Our flight was at 2pm, but they allowed us to have a late checkout. In general, the people in Istanbul have a great sense of humor and are always trying to joke with you. If you have been in hotels in which it felt like you owed the staff something, then this hotel will really be a great experience. Hotel Services -- Can't complain too much about this place because they gave us room upgrade, and our room ended up being quite sizable for us. Also, the airport shuttle used by the hotel is only 50TYL, which was the cheapest that I would've found by myself, so they definitely didn't add any additional fees. It is charming and quaint in its decorations; there is heater, a/c, and hot water; and it is very clean. However, do note that this is an older hotel so it does feel more like an authentic experience than staying at a Hilton. Local Sites -- Topkapi Palace was not as great as everyone says that it is; extremely crowded and even though you are not supposed to smoke on the grounds, tourists stink up the place and some of the guards also do as well. The Harem is also not as great as claimed -- not that many rooms are open and there is no furniture as in the Dolmabahce Palace -- only good thing about the place is that fewer people are in there.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sterling, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but don't plan on a good night's sleep\u201d", "Author": "AndreaT-VA", "ReviewID": "UR119607213", "Content": "I really wish I could write a good review because the staff at the Adora was wonderful.

The hotel owner needs to do some major upgrades: new mattresses, new heating units, and plumbing repairs.

The staff was very welcoming and helpful with where to get money changed and so on. Apparently, the owner treats his staff well and it shows. The hotel manager, Umit, was very gracious about everything too. The breakfast is generous, unlimited and has decent variety - but gets repetitive - but I am not complaining. The rooms are tiny - just enough room for a decent, comfortable bed and a small but clean bathroom - but well worth the price and location. The hotel itself is on a very cute cobblestone street that is quiet and makes you feel at home immediately. Overall, this was excellent and I'd stay here again if I wanted to keep to the same budget. Locationwise, I would prefer this to the Sultanahmet area because this is closer to the Asian side too. The hotel's location is absolutely superb. It's a very very short walk away from the tram line, a very short walk to the Sultanahmet area (Cemberlitas Hamam, Basilica Cistern, Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Topkapi, Haggia Sofia, Grand Bazaar, Archaeological Museum - highly recommended, Islamic Museum, and so on) and a very short walk in the opposite direction to the Spice Market, the Bosphorous River (the Eminonu dock from where you can take a 2 hour river cruise - highly recommended - for 12 lira), Galata Bridge, and lovely eateries in a corner by-lane just 10 meters away from the hotel. For those who love to walk, the hotel is close enough to walk across Galata bridge, up a curving hill to Galata Tower, and on to Tunel, Istiklal Street (with its rocking night life and character-full alleys with pubs and live bands), all the way to Taksim Square, and then a downhill walk back.

They called us taxis, told us how much we should generally pay for things in istanbul, called restaurants and made reservations for us, made us an early breakfast a day we had to leave early, and were just very pleasant and knowledgeable.

Our luggage was taken to our room which was a good sized double with bed, nightstands, wardrobe space, a (reasonably priced) mini bar, safe for valuables, dressing table and chair, tv and air conditioning unit. The decor is simple, if a little chintzy. The ensuite shower room was basic and clean. The bed was comfortable - mattress very firm. Housekeeping standards were excellent throughout our week long stay. Breakfast got a little tiresome on our 7 day stay, an array of meats, cheeses, breads, olives and fruit. I got the impression that smaller platters would have helped keep the produce looking and tasting fresher. The hotel is ideally located for all the major sites of Istanbul. Spitting distance to the Topkapi Palace and a ten minute walk to the Blue Mosque, Archaeological Museum and Hagia Sophia. Fifteen minutes to the Grand Bazaar - an amazing shopping experience where you can't help but barter and buy. A short walk in the other direction leads you to the banks of the Bosphorous where ferrys can cheaply and easily transport you further afield...to the Asian side or to Taskim Square and the awe inspiring Galata Tower. The tram line is also right outside with very regular service. The Adora Hotel is within the main restaurant/ pub area of Sultanahmet and their proprietors will constantly attempt to usher you in to their establishment. This could be annoying for some people but we found it all in good jest and some of the waiters banter provided fantastic entertainment. Besides, it's good to have a wealth of eateries to choose from near where you stay. Choose carefully though, we found price and quality varies massively from place to place. Despite being in this bustling area we found our room remarkably quiet and enjoyed sound sleeps every night. The hotel was undergoing some upgrades while we were staying but the builders were only in at times convenient to guests so this didn't disturb us.

The beds were comfortable. The room was quite small (almost filled up with the beds), but the bathroom was of normal size and the room had a small extension with no beds and more free space, so overall it did not feel too small. - We did not experience almost any \"technical\" problem that people sometimes mention: we always had hot and cold water, the heating worked well, the door locked properly, we could open windows if we wanted. We just had one small table that was shaky and not really horizontal, but that's all. - The breakfast was quite diverse (fresh apples, very good dried fruits, 2-3 kinds of cheese, bread, milk, yoghurt, corn flakes, muesli, savoury things like bacon, omelette, olives etc), and most of it was fresh and of good quality. However, not everything was excellent: for example, if one of the main things you care about in your trip is the quality of meat products or omelette in your breakfast, I would probably not advise you to go there. But I guess for most travellers this is not the most important point. - The wireless was free of charge and the connection in our room was very good.

However, it was very comfortable and what mattered the most to me, was that it was very clean. So too, was the bathroom. The room had air conditioning, TV, a bar fridge, a safety deposit box, telephone and one even in the bathroom. Breakfast was great, with a variety of breads, fruit, cold meats, olives and cheeses as well as cereals and hot foods. You could go and get whatever you wanted and however much you wanted. It was very yummy. However, the best thing about this hotel is the staff. If you want warm, friendly, helpful and professional staff, then you are in the right place. I cannot express how fantastic they were. I was picked up from the airport for free, they greeted me with a cocktail and some turkish delight and took care of my luggage. They booked a tour, and organised an airport transfer for me, recommended places to see, explained how to get to places, what tram to catch and where to get off and they even spent an hour ringing different electronic stores to help me find a certain battery for my camera. Hows that for service! They were always there with a smile on their face no matter what time of day or night it was or even if they had just done a double shift. Erdi, one of the reception staff was truly amazing. He spoke english very well and even sat with me regularly to chat, and keep me company. I truly felt welcomed and safe. Thank you Erdi very much for making me feel welcomed. I would also like to say thank you to Burhan, Fikret, Ahmet and Mustafa (he's the waiter who is always extremely happy and makes you laugh) and the women who clean and serve (sorry, I didn't get your names).

There are no windows in the room but only in that appendix. Uneven floor, floor moldings misplaced. Furniture and room/bathroom finishing have seen their better days. - Ants everywhere in the room. Don't leave any food or drinks open on your table - or otherwise in the morning you will find an ant-hill there. - Squeaky A/C hardly producing any cold - it was just about 30C outside and it was hardly doing its job. At night we had to switch it off because of tremendous noise. Wonder what's going to be if the temerature goes further up? - Safe and fridge are in the room but seems neither of these items were working. So were the remote controls for TV and A/C. The latter two were replaced upon request (apparently they just brought the remotes from some other room) - Very poor insulation in the room - you can hear all the sounds on the corridor and even neighbours talking on the phone in their rooms. You can also feel the shivering from the tramway, but that must be a common issue in the area. We were lucky since our room was facing an old cemetery (!) so at least no noise was coming through from the street. - Although very friendly, staff seem to do their job only when asked to.
