Tiny double room only way to move around it if one person stayed on a bed.The bedroom was dirty, dust every where and food debris,used cups etc on floor.Bathroom was relatively clean but we could see into our neibhbours ensuite as there was no covering for outlet! All bedrooms seemed to open onto an inner tiny yard with smelly drains which explained the lack of light.On our overnight trip from Bulgaria were tourists from Ireland, Norway, Netherlands, Russia, UK, and Bulgaria and everyone complained bitterly about this \"hotel\". We felt it might be Backpacker standard only.DO'NT GO THERE.......", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morocco", "Title": "\u201cNever ever again!!!\u201d", "Author": "Moroccantourist", "ReviewID": "UR53861561", "Content": "So terrible..it's not even 1 star, so why stating 3 or 4 stars?!!!rooms were not clean..service and staff terrible..the roof was covered by humidity...the heating was not working correctly and when I asked for extra cover I didn't get it..the phone in the room was not working so if you have a request you should take the elevator which is not that safe and ask directly in the reception..a real nightmare in a very beautiful city! what a pity..what a shame!", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Egypt", "Title": "\u201ca terrible hotel, never again\u201d", "Author": "EgyptHoneymooner", "ReviewID": "UR45559072", "Content": "this hotel was the worst hotel ever, services are horrible ,staff was stupid and not friendly , rooms not clean, food not enough or variable, no one there can understand any thing, staff talks only turkish, you dont know how you can communicate, i have been to many hotels but this one is the worst ever, i liked Turkey alot, but didnt like the hotel at all", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Kecik", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1207956-Reviews-Kecik-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$58 - $76*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Fethibey Cad.
