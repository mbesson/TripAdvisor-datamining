This place has fantastic service and is a gem in Phoenix! Although it\u2019s located on busy Camelback Road, it\u2019s very quiet and serene on the property. You\u2019ll feel a world away from the bustle as you relax and unwind here. The grounds can be a little confusing, and I\u2019ll be the first to admit that it was a full day into our stay before I figured out how to navigate the twisting paths without getting lost. The property is comprised of a series of colonnaded paths leading to various green spaces and pools and the rooms and scattered among all of this. It makes for a sense that you are in a hotel of individual rooms \u2013 not cookie cutter corridors. That having been said, I\u2019ll admit that our room was in the section on the east side of the resort that does have an interior corridor. You still have to meander through the resort to get to this section, but this part does feel more like a regular hotel as opposed to what I described above. Nevertheless, our room was gorgeous! Essentially, it was a suite with three rooms. We had a living area with couches, a coffee table, a television and a wet bar and a spacious bedroom with a super comfortable bed and another TV in an armoire. In between the two rooms was a bathroom area with a cool tub and a shower. The room was equipped with a safe in the closet and contained a refrigerator. We were slightly annoyed that the fridge was stuffed with minibar items, but we just removed those and placed what we wanted in there for the duration of our stay and then replaced them before checking out.

Plenty of secluded areas in the garden to relax & enjoy a fireplace or fire-pit while gazing at the stars. The air is perfumed with a unique scent, perhaps it was flowering jasmine?

When you arrive at this resort you leave the city behind and discover a sanctuary of charm, beauty and culture. As you enter the property through giant mahogany and iron double doors the atmosphere is that of a lavish private residence. Each hotel room is resplendent in old world charm, many filled with a breathtaking collection of European antiques, tiles and artifacts. The sky overhead was constantly blue, and the grounds were alive with the splashes of colour from many flowers and trees. The very famous T Cook\u2019s restaurant buzzes each evening, its reputation drawing visitors from afar. In truth the service here is a little stilted as if the staff don\u2019t need to go the extra mile for hotel guests because they have so many attending just for the food. Everywhere else in the resort the staff are exceptional however. Being able to learn and remember the name of every guest must be a condition of employment here. Have a cocktail before dinner in the lovely Italian courtyard, served with a smile by Kala, who also seems happy to share interesting stories of Phoenix life. The wine list is extensive and you can have a three glass tasting flight before you settle on a bottle you like. For lighter fare eat at the poolside bar. They serve amazing slow roasted pulled beef with crispy fries and flat breads. The Jacuzzi by the pool is hot and strong jets massage away any tension you might have in your muscles. Upstairs above the gym is an open air yoga studio. It was lovely to practice here with a cool breeze wafting down from the Camelback mountain. Afterwards spend an afternoon in the Alvadora Spa, worth a visit simply for the steam rooms and plunge pool, or linger for a hot stone deep tissue massage with the smell of orange blossom relaxing your senses. Then just lie by the pool, relax with a beer or cocktail and comfort yourself that the city buzzing away literally yards beyond the wall cannot be heard or seen. You may as well be in the middle of nowhere.

So while Sanctuary offers a wide open feeling and dramatic vistas over the valley, Royal Palms feels rather cramped and closed in. The real problem though was the accomodations. I reserved a Valencia Casita based on the website's promise that these rooms offered \"stunning views of Camelback Mountain and/or the orange groves\" and a \"semi-private patio.\" In fact, the three different rooms I was shown offered no privacy whatsoever. All three opened immediately on busy walking paths. It was like staying in a fishbowl, on display for all who walked by to see. The only way to get any privacy was to close the shutters and drapes on all the windows. This made the room - which was rather small to begin with - feel truly cave-like. The lighting was terrible. The shower was very poor, the towels thin and scratchy. The TV was about 17 inches. No complimentary bottled water was offered. The only positive was the friendly valet/bell staff.

Weeks before we arrived, concierge Mona helped not just with suggestions but made arrangements for every detail from hot air ballooning to horseback riding to spa appointment. She kept in touch through email and phone calls to clarify details of our trip and to remind us of all sorts of things (like don't plan any outdoor activities between 9a and sunset during the Arizona summer! - thank goodness she warned us!).

Everytime we needed the car they had it waiting for us outside in what seemed to be under 60seconds and every time we returned we were always greeted with two valets to help escort us and our baggages out of the car.

It was scary how he always seemed to anticipate our every need well before we even realized it. Before we realized we were parched he was right there with large cups of lemon ice water - and refilled it well before it ever reached halfway empty. If we looked a little uncomfortable from a towel that was too wet, before we could decide what to do Jose was there with a dry towel...and he provided this degree of excellent service to every guest at the pool!

It's also because the grounds have been carefully designed with many plants, flowers, and courtyards, so that the overall sense is of \"old money\" and privacy. It made us feel rich, and we didn't break the bank staying there! The rooms are not as luxurious as the grounds, though they are definitely well-appointed and spacious. You won't mind, though, because you'll want to spend your time exploring the courtyards and hanging out at the pool. The spa was gorgeous, and also broken in smaller rooms for privacy and comfort. Other pluses: the on-site restaurant is excellent for both breakfast and dinner; the valets are quick and friendly; the resort fee explicitly covers tips (except for meals and spa services). The cocktails at the lounge are very good, and half-price during happy hour. A few weaker points: the pool is on the small side, creating a little tension between families whose kids want to play and the adults who want to drift aimlessly about or sit near the edge with their Blackberrys or books.

The hotel was fairly quiet as this is low season due to the summer heat hence it was excellent value for money. The place based around an old villa built in the 1920's and extended and converted into a hotel in the late 90's.The place is understated and attention to detail is excellent. It has a really nice feel to it. All of the rooms are set around gardens and pools and you would not believe there are 120 rooms. The reception is tiny, so don't expect to be wowed by marble and chandeliers. It is like you are staying at somebodies home (all be it rather large!). I can't praise the staff and service at this hotel enough. Evan from the valet, Jose-Caro, Dustin and the others from the pool were fantastic and really treated you like royalty. Nothing was ever too much trouble and they constantly topped up iced water at the poolside meaning you were not forced to keep buying drinks. Overall, definitely the best place I have ever stayed and will definitely be returning and we have stayed in some high end hotels around the world. Old town Scottsdale is about 5 minutes in the car and downtown parking is free. That brings me on to resorts fee's. As we had two Valencia suites it was a total of $56 a day plus tax but this covered tips, paper, parking and wifi. If you factor it into the room price at booking it is not an issue. Try the T Cooks lounge. The bar food is excellent and the happy hour is 5-7pm and their was a reverse one later. We did not use the main T Cook restaurant but the locals in the lounge highly recommended it. Prices seemed ok compared to UK prices for similar standard fare. Finally the standard of the room was excellent with top end furnishings and spotlessly clean. The layout of the valencia was slightly unusual with the bath between the lounge and bedroom but it is a good layout if four are using the room as it can be segregated with two sliding doors.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cRomantic, clean, great service, great food!

We had booked at the last minute and got a really good rate so we were a little dubious what the property would be like. It turned out to be fabulous. Immediately upon entering the hotel driveway, we felt transported into elegant Spanish environs. The valets welcomed us and efficiently took care of the rental car, the luggage and escorting us to the check-in desk which was really a quaint parlor-like room. From the efficient check-in to the initial tour of the resort, we we were thoroughly enchanted with the hotel and the service staff who were helpful and available at all times. The food and drinks were excellent and the restaurant ambiance was entirely consistent with the Spanish theme of the hotel. The outdoor seating area, including for the bar was absolutely enjoyable and peaceful. At night the bar had a couple of singers who provided live music to which those so inclined (like us!) could dance on the small bar room floor. The singing duo even took our requests and did their best to please. As did all the other staff at the resort, especially so at the pool. Already in March the temperatures were nudging the upper nineties and the staff kept running up an down making sure that the pool guests were supplied with endless glasses of lemon iced water. Our room was small and a bit oddly arranged. The bathroom was in between the bedroom and the sitting area (where the sofa sleeper was that my daughter slept on) so that all traffic needed to be through the bathroom. The room was also small and had a view on a small back alley. This was our only negative for the hotel. But then, it is an older property and we were not surprised by some quirkiness. The overall feeling of the property very much evokes a feeling of being in a rich, Mexican villa being attended to by smiling, friendly people.

It was a shame to end our time at this wonderful hotel with experiences one might find in an ordinary hotel. Don't miss the piano bar on Friday nights which seems to have become a local favorite since many people appeared to know each other. The pianist and his vocalist were wonderful - the painist is not only superb at his art but also personally welcomed us. The service in TCooks was always impeccable. Other than the last couple of days, the service and attitude throughout the hotel was extremely professional at the same time warm and welcoming - all staff showed similar concern for our \"relaxation.\" It is a rare jewel to find such a place in today's world. As a last note, the designer casitas are beautiful but they are too tight with all the furniture squeezed in. It was difficult to navigate around the room at night and we are very fit people. It's not a shiny new hotel with all the fancy amenities; it is like being in a private hacienda in the back in the 40s and 50s.

The entire complex begs to be explored. We did this many evenings with our two young boys. The pool is wonderful and the man who tends the pool bar and is the waiter is wonderful. I have never seen someone work as hard at their job. We did not actually order food or drinks, as we were with our kids and were attending them in the pool, but he was literally running from one order to the next and the heat was oppressive. He was always smiling. We stayed in one of the Valencia Suites. It was very nice but no view. Had it been earlier in the day and not after a 6 + hour flight I would have requested a different room. They were accommodating by bringing in a cot so our boys did not have to share the pull out bed. (although, I did request this a week before when I made the reservations and it was not ready when we got to the room after a long flight from Hawaii, at 11:30pm at night, we had to ask for it and it was brought in promptly) I did have a sneaking feeling that some people who worked there were a bit put off by us having our 3 and 7 yr. olds with us. They all eventually warmed up when they saw how well behaved they were (the kids were too jet lagged to get out of hand, lol) But I did feel as though kids were not welcome. The food was incredible and incredibly priced, but worth the splurge. They do have a great kid's menu also. We ate at the lounge which is more casual and at the main restaurant. When we called to ask about the dress code for the the main restaurant (T. Cooks) they said that it was \"resort casual\" and they preferred no shorts and did not allow jeans. We pulled out the only pair of pants that my husband brought and ironed them only to see that there were many patrons with shorts on. A little frustrating, but nothing terrible. The only thing that put me off, although it was handled professionally, was when we checked in and went to our room. There was a woman, who was badly bruised, obviously drunk, talking on her cell, smoking on the outside steps of our hallway. This was almost midnight, and we had our very tired children with us. Then when our cot was brought in, she was right outside our room, sitting at a hall desk, leg draped over the table, practically falling off the chair, she was so out of it. When we asked about her and if she was alright, they were very kind saying that she had fell on some bad luck and had been in an accident and was recovering. It was a little off putting mostly because our kids were with us. We also encountered her the next morning at the pool, ordering drink after drink, and she did not look well. After that we were told she was being moved to a different room. I feel like I am nit-picking but when you spend that kind of money and the reputation of the customer service is very high, you tend to look for things wrong. So all in all it was a very pleasant experience.

Yes, we have been to nicer, more \"perfect\" resorts- but the bottom line is the service, the grounds and the ambiance at the Palms keeps bringing us back. I said it before- if you can't relax and unwind here- you can't do it anywhere. Around every corner is a bench or garden or trickling fountain or hammock. Poolside staff re-fills your water (and drink order) constantly and the valet staff will remember your name- 1 year later. The rooms are lovely with attention to detail and romance. Yes the pool is too small. Yes there is a resort fee (plainly advertised). But that fee covers valet, gratuities, wireless, newspaper and twice daily room servicing. The pool is open 24 hours- go later and enjoy complete privacy. Its still 80 degrees out after dinner. Most telling to me- the number of Phoenix/Scottdale residents who \"staycation\" here. They don't go to the Biltmore or the Phoenician- when they want to feel like they are apart and away from the everyday world they go to the Palms. One note if you are deciding what room to book: the spa suites have a full bath, full living room and master bedroom. They are all divisible by large pocket doors. (Great for quiet time). They are modern and clean. The downside: they are in a standard hotel-type wing- which means you can have someone above you or below. If you want to be esconsed in total privacy- book a casita. The rooms aren't quite as nice, but they are very secluded. Its a personal preference. Get to the pool (early), grab a cocktail, have Matt prop up the umbrella to give you shade, and forget the world. (or grab a hammock under the palms and read a book, or watch the bunnies.)

The Royal Palms exceeded our expectations each time. We celebrated our anniversary there this year. If you like being steps away from the pool, the spa, the restaurant, your car... yet at the same time in a private, elegant resort..this is the place for you. It is designed as a destination, so you could stay on grounds the whole time if your goal is to relax by the pool and get spa treatments. But we also took day trips, and the concierge was excellent in helping us plan then. The pool service, valet, and bell staff were like none other. Your water glass was always filled with ice water, no order from pool side was too much, and they were always willing to please. At poolside, Jose especially was exceedingly pleasant, helpful, and professional. He was always there to ask if we wanted something. When we went out at for our day trips, the valets had our car available virtually instantly..within a minute or two of us asking. Everyone we met was pleasant and helpful, and was patient in answering our questions and responding to our requests. Our room, and many others, opened up onto a large patio area with a fountain, reflecting pool, and gas fire pits with many places to relax. There are many cozy 'nooks' to sit and relax. The spa treatments were great (I'd need to write a separate review to tell you about them). The Royal Palms is right off busy Camelback Road, but you'd never know it. There is a long palm tree lined driveway which sets it back from the road, and gives the Royal Palms an immediate, elegant feel. It was very quiet, and you immediately feel calm and comfortable. I think the proximity to Camelback Road is a real plus; it means you can easily go on day trips. Also, the Royal Palms was less than a 30 min drive from the Phoenix airport. I'd recommend eating breakfast at T Cooks, lunch at the pool, a day trip, and then dinner at T Cooks. After dinner, sit by the fountains and the outdoor fireplace, and enjoy a nice drink. The Royal Palms is not a large hotel (I'm not sure of the number of rooms. I'm sure their website would have that information). The feel is very personal and feels customized to your needs. The T. Cooks restaurant is on grounds, and serves excellent food. I believe it is a top ranked restaurant in the Phoenix area in its own right. You can eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. The Royal Palms is not your 'big box' type destination. Although children are welcome there, it would probably not be the place for large groups with lots of children to entertain. If you are celebrating something like an anniversary, its a wonderful place. Or if you need a relaxing getaway, you can't do better than the Royal Palms. It would also be a great place to go with other couples. I recommend the Royal Palms without reservation.

I had specifically reserved the Alvadora Spa Terrace Suite for our 2 night stay at the Royal Palms. While waiting at the airport for our flight to Phoenix I decided to ask the hotel if they had an available crib for the room. I was told that they did, yet they could not guarantee that one would be available. I thought to myself, \"no problem, we have a travel bed anyway\". Upon arrival at the hotel I was told that cribs were \"not allowed\" in the suite that I had reserved and was asked by Ashley at the front desk if I wanted to change rooms. Ashley offered the following: -- our original suite w/o a crib, a downgrade to a casita for two nights w/ a crib or a comparable suite for one night and then we would have to move to a casita for the 2nd night due to availability. I stated that I wanted our original room as I was not interested in a downgrade or having to move rooms when we were only going to be there for 2 nights. Ashley then told me that she had actually given our Terrace Suite away in the last 3 hours since I called regarding the crib. I explained that at a hotel of this calibre I would have expected a phone call prior to giving our room away. Shouldn't the paying customer have the right to decide if they want their reserved suite or not? What right did she have to give our suite away that I had specifically reserved months before AND they could not even guarantee a crib AND the hotel never stated that cribs were not allowed in that particular suite (which I still don't understand). The weekend only got worse: --Ashley was rude and implied that children were not welcome by statements such as \" these rooms really aren't designed for pack-n-plays and stuff like that\" (which I had none of by the way). -- Ashley lied about the availability of our suite and tried to convince us to take another room. -- The crib that she claimed she had already arranged for was not delivered until 9:45 pm (2.5 hours after our arrival). -- Our \"welcome amenity\" that was part of our package was not ready upon arrival either and was not delivered until 9:00 pm (although at 7:30 they told us they would be \"right back\" with something for us). -- They asked what newspaper we would like and then delivered a different newspaper -- The spa gave my facial appointment away to another guest \"by mistake\" and given that they only had one person doing facials that day I had to wait almost 1 hour before I could receive my treatment. On a positive note, the manager at the front desk was extremely apologetic and removed Ashley from the situation.

Another reviewer mentioned a sense of a \"tip mentality\" but we didn't experience that. The $25+ daily resort fee covers all tips & gratuities which was published in several areas throughout our stay. We began our 25th anniversary getaway with a couples massage at the resort spa. The massage therapists were fantastic, giving an excellent massage, and were both very professional. Desk staff: the mostly female employees were friendly and professional. But there was a gentleman working the front area who gave an unfriendly vibe and both hubby & I felt we were intruding. I saw him interacting with other guests and noticed his lack of friendliness; he never did crack a smile. Pool: We enjoyed the cozy pool and enjoyed socializing with other guests. Homero did an excellent job refilling ice water and raced around filling food & drink orders. He was very accomodating and a joy. We really missed him the following day as the other staff person was adequate in his role but not outstanding. Fitness room: Small, several treadmills, and a few weight machines. It's open 24/7 but the fruit wasn't fresh and the water containers weren't replenished. Someone should probably check on the freshness of the items from time to time.

Cook's: Was really looking forward to an excellent experience and it was good, but certainly not great. The best part of the meal were the desserts, and they were excellent. Be sure to try the chocolate fantasy. Romance quotient: The resort knew we were celebrating our 25th anniversary and spread lovely rose petals on our table at T. Cook's. They also decorated our dessert plates with \"Happy 25th Anniversary.\" Very nice touches. At the pool, newlyweds shared how the resort gave them a rose petal turndown, chocolate strawberries, champagne, and a lovely card. We thought that was fantastic. After dinner, we returned to our casita and found a rose petal turndown, the chocolates, and a card from our friends. I learned later that the resort does note big anniversaries but told me, \"your friend beat us to the punch.\" Oops....

The fantastic: the Landscaping. Every square inch has gorgeous lush landscaping, gardens, fountains etc.There were fountains, gardens and comfy benches around every nook and cranny.

We almost stayed at the Gainey Suites (also ranked #1 by TripAdvisor), but am glad we did not. It looks more like an ordinary hotel next to a shopping mall. We returned to the Royal Palms because our last visit (almost 10 years ago) was always a great memory. We've since been to the Phoenician, Hyatt, Camelback, etc. and like Royal Palms the best. The service at the pool is simply outstanding. The staff is tirelessly working to adjust your umbrella, order drinks, or, keep your waters fresh with ice. As soon as you drive down the palm-lined drive, staff immediately jumps out to meet you and open the doors to your car. The pool area, while small, is charming and never felt crowded. We always found two chairs with an umbrella. This is not always the case at much larger resorts. You can easily get a table next to the pool for a great lunch or breakfast too. All shaded, with misters when hot (like it was last weekend). We've traveled all over the world, and The Royal Palms is one of our top places to stay for a relaxing trip. We booked it on Hotwire, and were upgraded to a casita conveniently located next to the pool. I noticed that Gainey Suites was also a #1 ranked hotel, and we drove by to check it out. We're glad we didn't book there, because it looks like any other hotel next to a mall, and they had no food service at the pool.

I suppose that I should start off by saying I would not recommend the Royal Palms unless you are looking for an authentic Arizona experience or you want a boutique resort experience. The pool area is so incredibly small and the rooms are so old that I just can\u2019t see staying here. With that being said, service and dinning really make the entire resort worth considering. If you want clean lines, a modern feel and a general \u201cnew\u201d feel, try the Fairmount Princess or the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch which are both 1st class choices I can vouch for. I can also vouch for the Royal Palms, but only in the context of being authentic. It is also worth noting that the Royal Palms location is absolutely perfect. We live here in the Phoenix area and try to have a stay-cation at a local resort at least once a year, so we have stayed at many of the local resorts. I like the other resorts more than the Royal Palms. This was our first time at staying at the Royal Palms. The rooms are divided into two categories, suites and casitas. Within the Casita category there are \u201cDesigner Casitas\u201d and \u201cValencia Casitas\u201d. We stayed in a Valencia Casita which is the older type although the Designer Casitas are in the same type of structure just remodeled and I\u2019m not entirely sure that staying in a Designer Casita would be much different. The Casitas are dark inside. It is by design. These are old adobe buildings that were obviously built to minimize the impact of AZ summers. The ceilings are about 7\u2019 high and each casita is attached to another. They have been tastefully remodeled to maintain a southwest look. Very Santa Fe-ish. The beds are quality and the linens are top notch, high thread count. There is wifi throughout that worked just fine and didn\u2019t cost anything. The TV\u2019s are flat panel, but not high quality. Our room had a really cool \u201cbeehive\u201d fireplace and lots of windows with shutters for privacy with a nice little courtyard patio. The bathroom was small and while it may have been modernized at some point, it has fallen behind. The in room safe was the kind that uses a key, and of a pain to have to haul a key around with you\u2026Cars don\u2019t even have keys anymore. The grounds of the hotel are impeccable, Gorgeous, Unrivaled! The pool and pool area are WAY TOO SMALL. If you think you are going to come here to lounge by the pool with ANY privacy then you are looking at the wrong hotel. The fitness center is average. The Spa is very nice (with the exception being that it doesn\u2019t have its own pool). My wife and I each had 90 minute massages. The price for a massage is higher than most other resorts in Scottsdale and at those resorts you get the benefit of enjoying the spa\u2019s private facilities\u2026Not so here.

We chose Arizona for our vacation since we really just wanted sunshine, and it was hurricane season elsewhere. We chose this hotel based on TA. The staff were excellent across the board, in all departments. The front desk, valets, pool bartender and restaurant staff were all great. Breakfast was good. We didn't love the food at the T. Cook's restaurant at dinnertime, though, and would suggest eating elsewhere at night. (Also, FYI, we did go one night for happy hour to eat at the bar in T. Cook's, and apparently the price is based on when you finish your meal, not when you order it--we paid full price even though we arrived well within the designated period. We didn't feel like saying anything, though.) The concierge was especially helpful and set up a great day for us in Sedona. The gym is clean, and the equipment is great. As others have mentioned, this place is designed such that you often feel like you have it all to yourself. The grounds are lush and beautiful and really unlike what you would expect in the desert. We first stayed in a Montevista Terrace room. It was new and sparklingly clean, with a very comfy bed and a gorgeous soaking tub. The terrace was not at all private, though, and the room was pretty noisy from people in the hallway. This section is more like a regular hotel. We discussed the possibility of moving at some point during the week to a more quiet and private location, and the staff were very accomodating. They gave us the choice of moving to one of the deisgner casitas, and showed us two of them. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with our room. I was really impressed by that, since obviously that didn't have to do that for us. The desinger casitas are not as new or as squeaky-clean, but are more private and tucked away on he property. They have patios in front and in back, with the back ones entirely closed off by a wall for privacy. If you want privacy, this is it. The tubs are shallow and nowhere near as nice as those in the Montevista rooms, and in fact the staff mentioned that as their big drawback. But, the walk-in shower with a skylight is just a nice. Our designer casita did have a couple of other weird drawbacks, though. As another person mentioned, the wooden blinds don't close all the way so this detracts from the sense of privacy a little, and means the room was never dark at night. Also, the AC/heating system turned on and off all night, and each time it started up there was a sound of five taps followed by the sound of rushing air. Ear plugs and a blindfold are a good idea, but light sleepers should just not stay in these rooms. Actually, the hallway noise with the Montevista room was probably no worse, and at least that room was dark. All in all, both rooms were lovely, but each has its own drawbacks. Hopefully this info can help someone decide. If you are dying for sunshine and want a hotel with great service, why not go to Arizona? We had a great time. There isn't a ton to do in the area, but it is really close to Camelback mountain which is a fun and challenging hike (though not for those who are afraid of heights). I would suggest renting a car from the start, which will give you the freedom to hit the grocery down the street for basics, great restaurants in Scottsdale (try Deseo at the Westin Kierland; skip entrees and instead try all the ceviches and apps), shopping, side trips to Sedona, In N Out Burger (!), etc.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "montana", "Title": "\u201cnickel and dime makes it feel cheap\u201d", "Author": "fernfil", "ReviewID": "UR50367746", "Content": "the hotel was great except that they nickel and dimed us with fees.

I have stayed at the Royal Palms countless times since they reopened in '97. I can unequivocally state that this is the most unique, exceptional resort in the US or Europe. You are treated as if you are a guest at a treasured friend's private estate. The property and grounds reflect a unique combination of lavish decor that refuses to be overwhelming or common. Refined Spanish-Tuscan hacienda estate. The casitas and designer casitas provide a lovely respite for privacy, relaxation and romance. Beautiful accomodations (including decor, bedding, furnishings) coupled with well-planned appointments. Hidden niches, fountains, hammocks and seating areas provide ample opportunities for an intimate chat, glass of wine, shared dessert, etc. The staff at this property is the most exceptional I have encountered anywhere. From the General Manager to the housekeeping staff, they reflect care and consistently superb competence unparalleled at any other resort property. Working with colleagues of this quality makes it difficult to exceed expectaions, yet that is exactly what Rick and Jose, who man the poolside Cabana, have accomplished. They are gentlemen who view their service as a rewarding career rather than a way to pay the bills as you may find at other resorts. Even if you are particular, they are likely to anticipate your need before you do. They will mix a superb smoothie or cocktail inspired by your personal preferences and ensure your comfort while lounging poolside. On one occasion, Rick went to a store early in the morning before coming to work and purchased several decks of cards (his time, his $) to compile a pinochle deck for my husband and I because we had forgotten ours. They also perfectly concocted a special beverage for us based solely upon a distant memory. Jose tracked down my favorite pop within moments of my unique request. These are merely a few examples from our more recent stays. We never stay elsewhere because we know it would disappoint compared to our experiences here. Although the property and grounds are so exceptional that they themselves provide compelling reason to travel from any location to stay here, the staff transforms this exceptional resort into an incomprable destination. I admit I hesitate to share my unrestrained gushing (I have after all been coming here for more than a decade) because I do not want to ever see this propery change or expand, but I am compelled to honor the exceptional service we have received by sharing our experience.

Cook's, on many occasions when in Phoenix, but I had never spend the night in one of its many types of accomodations. The prices seemed steep and I preferred the more discreet location and ambiance of its \"sister\" resort, the under-renovation Hermosa. However, I have rarely stayed in an accomodation anywhere in the United States, or elsewhere, that had the high quality of service at every level than the Royal Palms. From tthe minute I arrived by taxi from the airport, windblown and sand blasted after several days in chilly Flagstaff, when I was prfomptly and cordially met by the valets and escorted to the front desk, I felt special. In the cool, classy, intimate front office, I was quickly checked in, my advance request for newspapers had already been taken care of, my request for an early check in was accomodated, and my bags were promptly delivered to my Designer casita, which was atucked behind a wonderfully soft but not too sweet smeloling orange tree and trellises of fuscias. A smal table and chairs, at which I ate the delicious breakfasts delivered to my room, daily; read my papers; and stared up at the black sky and clear stars, in the evening. It was not fronting Camelback drive and the neighbors on the other side of the wall were accoodating,k so it was extremely quiet. I also stayed in a Valencia room which was similarly quiet ad a bit larger. The bathrooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. The meals are delicious, and room service is prompt and done with a lot of class. The grounds are simply gorgeous. FLowers, trees, green grass. Lots of places to just sit and look at the stars, fountains, read, or close your eyes. It is quiet, romantic, adn utterly peaceful. The spa, which has been recently renovated, is unique. Many of the treatments are done outdoors, in total privacy. There are outdoor jacuzzis set in stone and steam baths. My spa treatments were wonderful and the technicians were very professional. There is a large unheated swimming pool and an adjacent heated spa, and that was my only real source of unhappiness. SMoking is allowed at the pool, and it was annoying and fairly constant. While a couple of cigar smokers were required to do their puffing across the pool in cabanas, the smoke did waft its way across. THe bar/dining area at the pool can get very noisy as the sound carries, and much of the talking is by the pool attendants/ waiters. They were generally very good about constantly providing free iced water to guests and fairlyl regularly making rounds to see if anyone wanted food or drinks but sometimes they would just disappear for long stretches, or carry on long, and loud, conversations with certain guests. Another problem was allowing very young children in the jacuzzi. They were loud, and also used it as a swimming pool. The most annoying occurrence at the pool, which was constant, was the use of cell pjhones. They should be banned. For a place that is otherwise offering total rest and relaxation, it is simply not possible at the pool, with phones constantly going off and people of all nationalities shouting to whomever was on the other end. The restaurant is also loud when it is full. The acoustics are bad, and woe to you if you are seated next to a table of four or more, especially if they are heavy drinkers, and, particularly if they are a group of businessmen, and that was a frequent occurrence. Therewere three of us, and we practically had to shout to hear each other. I recommend you eat outdoors on one of the patios, which are heated on chilly desert evenings. Back to the valets, they were very quick to call cabs or limos, suggest alternate modes of transportation, including even, when possible, driving me to a destination themselves. They quickly and professionally greet dinner or other guests, including mine, and park and retrieve cars better than I've ever experienced. They are polite, humerous, well dressed, and knowledgeable about the area. In short, they make a great foirst and last impression. The business center is open twenty four hours a day, which is very convenient for those wh are working (or at least communicating) in different time zones. There is a small fitness center as well. The Royal Palms is now be my \"go to\" place in Arizona, if not anywhere in the US, for a relaxing vacation destination that also has many activites nearby if rest and relaxation isn't enough, such as hiking, golf, art museums, botanical gardens, spring training baseball games , and, downtown, professional sporting and cultural venues. High quality shopping and gourmet restaurants are also within a few minutes' drive.

Having attended weddings and eaten in the restaurant before, I hoped to add a guest room visit to my future. Let me just say, this hotel did not disappoint. When we drove in Evan, the valet/bellperson, was fantastic. While he unloaded the bags, another valet cleaned out the back seat of our car, throwing away cups and the flotsam and jetsum of a long car trip. Impressive, I thought. Evan escorted us to the Front Desk where we were checked in swiftly and it was off to our rooms with our escort leading the way. We wound through fountain-seranaded courtyards and colonades covered with bright bouganvilla. At every terminus of a walkway, we seemed to encounter enchanted private gardens or outdoor art. Later, we would wander through the hotel grounds, or rather explore the intimate gardens and fireplaces one finds in the most out of the way places. It gives the hotel a personal charm, a sense of privacy and enchantment that seemed to make (almost) irrelevant the 111 degree temperatures. The room was dark and cool in feel, a nice respite from the blaring heat outside. The bathroom included a 6 foot, fairly deep soaking tub and a tile enclosed shower. One note of improvement might be the bath towels that should probably include a bath sheet, but everything else, from the robes to the beautifully scented amenities, from the flat screen TV to the extensive magazine selection, the free wireless Internet and the luxurious linens, made for a comfortable, serene several nights of meetings. TCooks was great, too, although we only had breakfast there! Still, the superstars to me were the grounds and the staff. People like James, the minibar attendant that escorted us to the dining room when we were wandering, a bit lost, in our exploration of the hotel or Adam, the bell person who checked us out and noticed the computer bag, thoughtfully storing it in the bell closet to keep the equipment cool. It's the anticipation of needs and the attention to detail of the team that makes the Royal Palms experience live up to it's beautiful ambiance. Stay here, you will be so very glad you did.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Service, Beautiful Property--Still A Little Room for Improvement\u201d", "Author": "BigBrion", "ReviewID": "UR33062164", "Content": "This is one of the most beautiful hotels at which we have ever stayed. The grounds are gorgeous. Our room was very nicely decorated and furnished--just lovely. The service ranks up there with the greatest hotels of the world--especially the poolside service which is beyond compare. There was always a fresh of cold ice water at my side without even having to ask. The small ( and I stress small) areas for improvement are that they really need an adults only pool since the current pool area had quite a few noisy children. I do not understand what causes parents to bring young children to a romantic resort like this but there were times when their screaching and splashing in the pool took away from what otherwise would have been a positively idyllic experience. There were a couple well-behaved children but there were also some over whom their parents exercised less control. I think that this hotel advertises itself more as an adult-style couples' property than a family resort but it seemed to be more of an family property. A simple solution would be to place an adults only pool area in the Montecito Terrace courtyard, where the fountain now is. The other area for improvement is in the food. We had dinner in the restaurant on the property. The dining room is beautiful but the cuisine did not quite measure up to the beauty of the dining room. The cuisine was not bad...it just was not stellar like the rest of this property and the service is.

When we arrived, the check in service was great. We were there very early so we got a few recommendations and directions for coffee and lunch. Then, as we were getting ready to leave, they came out to let us know our room was ready (extra early!). The resort itself is beautiful. The grounds are full of different types of flowers and you'll often see hummingbirds visiting! The resort (and our room) backed to Camelback mountain which was a very nice view. Our room, a Valencia Casita, was nicely decorated, and had a patio with a table and chairs off the back. We took advantage of the weekday special at T. Cooks restaurant (starter, entree and dessert for $50) and had a wonderful dinner on our first night there. Their lobster tortellini is amazing and the service here was great. The resort is in a great location. It's close to Camelback hiking trails and it's within driving distance to the Scottsdale Fashion Square, Old Town Scottsdale and Tempe. Our only complaint about the Royal Palms is their pool. They only have one, and it's not big enough for all of their guests. My husband and I aren't early risers so by the time we got to the pool each day, all the chairs were filled (tightly packed too) so we only got seats at a table on the outer patio. We were looking forward to a long weekend of relaxing by the pool so this was a big disappointment. I guess I wasn't feeling very relaxed sitting at the table because I also noticed that you could hear the cars on Camelback Road from the pool (not a big deal, but I noticed it and figured I'd mention it). Also, the service by the pool was lacking. Once, the pool staff member came by (he really just came by to grab one of our chairs) and said he'd be back with water and I asked for a drink menu. He never came back. All in all, a disappointing pool experience.

We just spent the past Easter weekend at the Royal Palms Resort and Spa in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. It was the perfect small resort for our last minute romantic get away. It was the first time we have been to the Royal Palms and there were quite a few room style choices. We went with a package featured on their website that included a third night free when you booked two nights. The package also included $50 toward food and beverage in T. Cooks (their fine dining restaurant) and $50 toward spa services. We upgraded for an additional $10/night to be in the \"Designer Casita.\" We were in \"Casita\" 116 which isn't really a casita as it is attached on both sides to another casita but the room was very private and it had its own front patio and was situated in a cul-de-sac of casitas. There was some street traffic noise from E. Camelback Road as these rooms are in the front of the hotel but once inside the room, we didn't hear the traffic once. The room was very tastefully decorated in a Mediterranean/colonial style. It was painted in a rich dark color which we found cozy but someone else might find oppressive. There was a gas fireplace (with remote.) The flat screen TV was in an armoire and was a bit small for the distance it was from the bed but there were two very comfortable chairs at the end of the bed which worked well for viewing. The room had a nice size desk, a large closet and ample drawer space. The four poster king bed was very comfortable with nice linens. There was turn down service each night. The bathroom had a large walk in shower with a skylight and a separate standard tub. The amenites were lovely. I couldn't get enough of the orange blossom scented moisturizer. (I bought a large bottle at the spa to take home.) The resort is very atmospheric and the grounds are lovely with flowering plants, meandering walkways. and pools and fountains. You really feel like you have gotten away. The swimming pool area is small and the lounge chairs would fill up each day but the staff was very accomodating setting up more seating as needed, refreshing used towels, providing ice water, adjusting umbrellas and serving light food. The pool water wasn't heated and it was too cold for me to enjoy at this time of year but my husband braved it and enjoyed floating on the \"rafts\" provided. The fish tacos at the Cabana Cafe were excellent. We ordered room service a number of times and were quite impressed. In room dining is one of the most difficult services for a hotel to get right but the Royal Palms didn't disappoint. They were extremely timely and efficient. They accomodated all of our little requests for things off the menu (peanut butter for my husband's toast, cottage cheese for me.) Kudos to server/manager Todd for a great job/department. (If I had one suggestion, it would be to warm the breakfast bakeries but that is a small fine point.) We enjoyed our two dinners at T. Cooks restaurant. (A little disappointed with the desserts but the ice cream and sorbet were worth the calories.) Sunday through Thursday they were offering three courses for $50 which was a good deal. We would highly recommend the roasted chicken, the salmon and the duck. One night we had dinner in the lounge. We shared a wonderful burger with a nice salad the night we arrived. There was live music and a great relaxed vibe. Kim, our waitress, was very thoughtful to have the kitchen split our meal onto two plates and load up on the greens. We used the small but adequate work out room. The equipment was new (three treadmills with built-in TVs - head phones provided, I-pod adaptable, three oscillators) and there was a set of free weights, a small area for mat work and some yoga and \"ball\" equipment. I got lucky and didn't have to wait for a machine but I could imagine a line up. There was a hot tub by the pool which I didn't use because I over-heard the temperature was rather low. We did have massages in the new spa which was very nice. I am sorry that I forget the therapist's name because I would recomment her. My husband was pleased enough with his treatment too. Again there was a worthwhile package that included dinner for two in the restaurant when you booked two massages. Another deal Sunday through Thursday was a ninety minute massage for the price of sixty minutes. Not bad! The spa facility is new. It is small but thoughtfully designed with separate lounging areas (indoors and out) hottubs and steam rooms. The resort is showing some wear around the edges (i.e. lounge chair cushions, awnings in the cabana cafe) but the staff''s eargerness to please and atttention to detail make up for anything that isn't sparkling. The \"resort fee\" of $25/day was a little confusing. As I understand it takes care of housekeeping and valet but not any food and beverage service or pool attendants. Obviously we were very pleased with our first stay and plan to return. With the special packages, we felt we got a fair value. I think we got lucky because of these deals and am not sure what next year will bring. (We wouldn't return this year because I couldn't stand the intense heat later this spring/summer.)

We had room service one morning on one of them and it was so relaxing and the food was good. One thing I noticed about the room service is that is was less expensive than the other two resorts I mentioned and better food and service. The first night we were there we sat outside of T Cooks on one of the tables surrounding the fountain.. Beautiful night and weather and big candles at each table. We just had cocktails and lots of appetizers..very romantic setting.. On our second night we ate at T Cooks indoors and had one of the best meals ever.. One of the days we went out to the pool before noon, and I do suggest if you are planning on enjoying the pool area get there around that time as it gets very crowded. I liked how the minute I sat down a pool attendant came rushing up with a glass of iced water with lemon, and continued to refill every time it got empty.. It wasn't a very hot day to Arizona's standards but toasty enough to have to take a swim in the non-heated pool to cool off. Yes, the pool is not heated and it's oh so cold when you first get in, but I bet when the weather is 100+ it's a relief.

My husband and I really like having a hot tub in our room...he's leaving for Naval training for several months and we just had a baby, so a little romance was definitely needed. I looked everywhere for a room with a tub for two and either the hotels had mixed reviews or they just weren't very romantic at all. I came across this hotel and I'm so glad I did. It is expensive, yes, but during the summer it isn't so bad for all the quality you get. Everything is so intricate and in my experience, the staff was attentive and incredibly polite. As soon as you get there, your car is whisked away by valet...which is nice, but if you're an introvert you may not like calling valet everytime you want to go out (but why would you leave this romantic haven anyway?). We got a room with a 2-person tub and it was the most mood setting room I've ever been in. I've stayed in hotels all around the world and this was probably the best for a romantic couple with a middle class income. Every detail in the room looked like a precious antique, right down to the box that holds the sugar for your coffee. Everything was just classy and interesting to the eye. The attached pictures really don't do it justice, as my flash is harsh. The room looks softer, larger, and more romantic in person than what the pictures provide. Our bathroom was gorgeous with candles already placed around the tub. We could dim any light we wanted to in the bathroom. The room itself had a huge bed (I'm used to the one we have at home, but my husband loved it), a decent sized TV and beautiful furniture. We had a patio where we sat and watched a large monsoon the first night. It felt like we were in some Columbian mansion or some exotic retreat with all the decor on the buildings. It's a treat for the eye. My husband and I took a break from our room and wandered around the grounds, which had hidden fountains and benches as well as a larger garden to walk through. Room service food was not only very tasty and professionally prepared but they took the time to make it look good too! It was obvious the whole staff in this place wanted to put their talents into their jobs. The pool was beautiful too, but I just had a baby so that was not an option I was interested in ;). The only complaint I can think of, is that we were on the bottom level, so at about 7am I was woken up several times the first morning by people trampling around upstairs. I'd recommend the upper floor...but the next morning wasn't loud at all.

The property is lush and well planted - a tropical oasis in the middle of the dessert. Beautiful. The rooms were clean, warm and inviting. The view of Camelback Mountain from our room was very romantic. The housekeeping staff were very thorough and the nightly turn-down service was a nice touch. I was suffering from a cold so we decided to stay in one evening. My wife ordered room service and when the wait staff arrived and noticed the cough syrup on the table, he showed genuine concern, explaining that the Royal Palms took illness very seriously and he would be happy to have the chef prepare some chicken soup and a hot toddy. Caring and attentive service was found throughout the property, with the pool attendants offering the best service. They were always ready to fill a drink, bring a glass of water, find a chair, refresh towels, etc. The pool bar closes a little early (6pm?) but the pool and hot-tub remain open all night. Great relief from the heat. The pool area was basically adults only. There was an occassional kid, but I got the impression children weren't encouraged. In fact, I overheard one of the valet's radio the pool attendant to let him know that \"Shamu\" had arrived (a family with an inflatable whale). They put a stop to that and we never did see Shamu or the kids. The restaurant was exceptionally good, although I did have one negative experience when I chose to sit outside to eat. We sat for about ten minutes and never did see any wait staff, even though the maitre'd assured us there was service on the patio. To be fair, it was very hot and nobody in their right mind would want to be outside and I was sick and didn't wait very long before leaving to head to our room. The lounge, adjacent to the restaurant had a great selection of drinks, a funky vibe, and great entertainment. It was hard to find a seat, but once seated the service was very attentive. My wife and I both had spa treatments while we were there. The spa was nothing spectacular, but very comfortable. Noticing I had a terrible cough, the masseuse even took the time to call me the next day to give me the name of a cough syrup his doctor had recommended to him. I noticed that some travellers complained about the $22 per day resort fee. This fee includes valet parking and all tips. It is a bargain - you would spend that much on valet in most hotels. Speaking of valet, if you call ahead before leaving your room, the valets will have your car ready and waiting with the air conditioner on.

After a lot of research of Phoenix and Scottsdale resorts, we choose Royal Palms mainly because it is more exclusive and smaller than the large resorts (the Phoenician is a couple of streets over). Especially after learning that it was spring break and many hotels were close to being 100% booked, I definitely didn't want to go to a place that was so booked that I would have to wait for everything, pool, gym, breakfast, valet. The Royal Palms makes you feel like you are among very few people and have alot of privacy. They have a very nice pool (just 1) and the staff throughout the hotels is very attentive and nice. The valet and bellmen are just wonderful, we never had to wait long to pick up or drop off our car. The front desk even printed out our boarding passes the day before we left, which we are so grateful of after seeing the enormous lines at the airport. We may have been late for the flight, in which case my husband would have yelled at me for since I am always running late! This is the kind of place for someone looking for privacy and doesn't care about having 3 pools and many loung bars through the hotel. It is a smaller hotel but that really is the beauty of it. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous with camelback mountain in the back drop. The hotel itself is mediteranean style with beautiful antique pieces throughout. The doorways each have so much character, they look as though they have been there for 100 years.

The blond guy (I'm bad with names) was like a walking hand-book in steps of service. Flawless in other words. I do love the accomodating approach, one that he def. mastered (which could not be said for his sidekick). In 104 degrees heat, one would be dependent on the pool no?! I guess the different flavoured Pina Coladas didn't hurt either. The second wow-factor was owed to the food. Top notch, roomservice as well as in the restaurant (same kitchen, but that doesn't nec. guarantee anything). In particular we were hooked on some of the breakfast items, so much that we squeezed one in before our checking out, a last one... Other than that the grounds were very pretty. Ordinarily we would stay at smaller capacity hotels, not used to sharing lol. The first room we were offered must have been on top of a flight hangar, or the back of the restaurant turbines, same thing. But that was corrected immediately. We had booked a Designer Casita, which turned out to be quite spacious, with a sturdy bed. My only complaint was the standard of the bathroom. We had been warned at the time of booking that it would be a \"standard\" bathroom, but for the room level I don't think I've had such a basic bathroom ever. Leaves room for improvement.

This hotel is simply spectactular. I was a guest at the hotel in June 2007. Traveling to Arizona to attend a wedding, I first took a quick side trip to Tucson, to visit friends, and stayed at the Arizona Inn there. How disappointing! Beautiful grounds, great pool, but the room was mediocre, a bit tattered and worn, and overall did not measure up to the positive reviews I saw on tripadvisor, and which prompted me to book my stay there. So, my expectations were relatively muted when I made my way to Phoenix and Royal Palms. On entering the property, I was blown away by the stunning architecture and gardening. In the reservation desk area, they had a pitcher of tasty and refreshing pink lemonade (Lord knows it was certainly HOT!) and I was greeted warmly by the reservation agent. Here's where things started to get real good. Traveling in the off-season, I thought I'd secured a pretty good deal - I believe it was $150/night for one of their basic rooms. Well, without even asking, I was upgraded to one of the new Spa Suite rooms. When the bellboy took me to my room, and opened the door, I almost fainted. It was stunning! On entering the room, the sounds of soothing, acoustic music enveloped you. The lighting was just right, dim, and romantic. The first part of the room is a sitting area with a luxurious, turkish-like seatte, full of comfy pilows - across from that you had an impressive entertainment unit and a small wet bar area. In the center of the room was the most luxurious bath I've ever had the privilege of looking at, let alone, using! Deep, soaking tub, those bowl sinks that sit on top of the the vanity. A walk-in steam shower, lotions, shower gels, shampoo and conditioners that were heavenly! You then enter the bedroom, and it was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. Just gorgeous. Dark stained wood floors. Two plasma tvs (one in the sitting area, another in the bedroom). And to top it off, a beautiful balcony that looked over a stunning courtyard area. One afternoon we were serenaded by a spanish guitartist. Pinch me - I must be dreaming!! Unfortunately, it was so daggone hot, I couldn't really take advantage of the balcony. Also, because I was running around a bit for wedding activities, a long day trip to the Grand Canyon and The Police concert the Monday before I left, I really didn't get to enjoy the room for my 4 night stay as much as I would have liked. But that just gives me an excuse to make a return trip - during a better -cooler - time of the year. Oh - and service. Talk about going the extra mile. I discovered that my credit card was missing from my purse. I couldn't find it anywhere. I wasn't sure if I'd dropped it while shopping or possibly in the car. Well, one of the valets did a painstaking search throughout my rental car and managed to find the card in a really obscure location. I guess it had fallen out of my purse while I was driving. I was so grateful for the time and effort this gentleman put into finding the lost item. Overall, service was exemplary throughout my stay. Royal Palms has spoiled me for life when it comes to hotel accomodations. I doubt there is a place that will ever measure up to my experience last summer. The surprise factor alone of getting such a beautiful room at a fraction of it's normal nightly rate is something I'll likely never experience again. In a nutshell, Royal Palms is simply amazing!!

As many satisfied guests have noted, the property is initimate, well-groomed, historic, romantic (part of its schtick is to promote romance), and an utterly refreshing change from the mega resorts like the Biltmore and Phoenician which are nearby on Camelback. These are high points, along with the good service and friendly staff. However, we thought it didn't quite live up to our expectations. And, frankly, I'm a bit surprised at the surfeit of \"5s\" in the tripadvisor ratings. The Royal Palms is good...but that good? We had a designer casita room which we thought was a bit dark and maybe a bit too in-your-face with a romantic furnishing (to be fair, this is the theme of the place). The bathtub in our room was mundane. Just a tub. But it had a huge walk in shower (with only one head). Far better, we thought, if the tub were a two-person jacuzzi tub and the shower more routine (to stick with the romance theme). The room had two patios, but the back patio was small, the walls were high, there was no planting or other vegetation. It was quite claustophobic. And the larger front patio -- where we did sit and eat breakfast one morning -- was not especially private. People could walk right by, within feet of our table (there were curtains we could pull across...but that just made it less scenic). Our room also was noisy. The AC was noisy, but most of all there was a constant running of water, like a toilet or shower was running next door. Maybe it was unique to this room -- Room 105 -- because we were at the end of a row of casitas and near the kitchen (could it have been kitchen plumbing?). Overall, the room seemed very nice and pretty but not luxurious by any means. Incidentally, these designer casitas are on the west side of the property and a bit isolated from the other rooms and casitas. You should ask to be on the east side -- you'll be closer to the pool and spa too. Finally, to our minds, one drawback was the lack of public rooms. Yes, I know, this is a boutique kind of establishment and I guess the expectation is that guests will walk the grounds or hole up in their rooms, but a couple of indoor public spaces would have been nice. The lobby here is not big -- just a check-in area. And when it's 110 outside, the outside sitting areas are not always comfortable. Call me a nitpicker, but it wasn't a perfect 5, at least if judged against other properties that try to reach the same customer base and at the same price range. But I have no problem recommending it as a sweet alternative to the big resorts -- especially if you are looking for a special romantic kind of getaway.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "HarukaKasuga", "ReviewID": "UR8603737", "Content": "I stayed room 147 for 3 nights last month.

I was already full with the meal so I didn't a room to taste all the deserts unfortunately. There were several kind of deserts, which looked refined. I ate only one desert, which was a rapsberry square cake. It was a small one in a big plate. It had a tangy strong rapsberry taste and I personally liked it much.

I haven't seen a casita or a suite--I've only stayed in a regular room here. I stayed in a room in the 200's on this trip. The room was fine, especially the bath, which is opulent and wonderful. The closet in the room is small, and there's no real dresser drawers. There's coffee in the room--French press style, which is great--and a fridge that doesn't charge you if you accidently pick up an item. The rooms are a little dark, but you can fully open the blinds for more light. The only thing that perplexed me on this stay was the refilling of the mini-fridge and the coffee. They give you enough in-room coffee for one use--but I was there for almost 3 days. I figured the maid service would replenish it, but no. So I called the front desk, and someone brings me a bunch of loose coffee in a drinking glass with plastic over it.???? Also, I drank all the bottled water in the mini-fridge the first day, but it was never replenished. Again, I called to request it be replenished, and they brought me some huge glass bottles of Evian from the restaurant.??? Also, my room did have a small ant problem, over by the chairs. I got bit on the toe by one, and now the itching is driving me crazy. But when you are in Phoenix, these things happen. Overall, I would stay here again, most definitely.

Well, neither of us wanted to pay $300 per night to sleep on a pull out couch (and that's a bargain compared to their normal prices!) so we made do with the king size bed. They had told us the first night that we could move to a different room with 2 beds the next day. When we went to the office the next morning we were told by some different people that there were no rooms available that day and we could move the next day.

The good news on my last visit (4/07) was that we were upgraded to a small suite, the bad news is that it must have been a handicap-only room as the bar in the only closet in the space was lowered for wheelchair access. (Room 313, if my memory serves me correctly.) So, no \"long hang\" ability for the ladies. I don't remember if that was the problem in 4/06, but I do remember our room also had no convenient place to put your clothing. My wife had to hang her \"fancy\" dress on a the drapery rod.

The Royal Palms is without question an incredibly beautiful hotel, with exceptional service. We spent two nights at the Royal Palms (after one of us spent two great nights in a very nice b&b in Sedona and the other sleeping on the ground of the base of the Grand Canyon), and we couldn't imagine a better place to complete our Arizona vacation! From the moment you enter the Mediterranean inspired grounds, you know you're in for a treat. While we are not luxury travelers by any means, we have stayed at several very highly (top) rated hotels, and none exceeded the service provided at the Royal Palms. From the welcoming front desk staff, to the extremely quick, polite and helpful valet attendants, to the amiable and informative bellman, to the pool cafe bartender eager to replenish cups with fruit laced water, to even the friendly pool maintenance man at 5:30 am, all made us like important visitors. Walking into our casita did not disappoint! Our room was nicely appointed, but certainly not pretentious. We thoroughly appreciated our four poster bed, the gas fireplace, the instrumental cd's, and the private porch with french doors, and were treated to turn-down service. The grounds are beautifully maintained, with gorgeous flowers, citrus trees, and cactus to be enjoyed. The Royal Palms' size and European-style intimacy stand out from the many enormous resort complexes circling Camelback Mountain. While the small pool and the absence of golf greens may leave some wanting, we greatly enjoyed the cozy ambiance. The soft, instrumental music playing throughout the resort enhanced the stay. I understand that the pool could disappoint with crowding in more popular seasons, as it was small, but there were plenty of covered lounge chairs and pool-floats for all who were there during our May visit. Additionally, the pool could be improved with cooler water temperature, particularly during our 113-degree visit (\"but it's a dry heat!\") While the hotel's restaurant is reputed to be one of the best in Phoenix, with among other things apparently one of the most highly rated pastry chefs in the country, we were quite disappointed with our service at our one lunch-time visit to the hotel. While our food (lobster bisque, salad, and desert) was excellent, we were seated in a corner of the restaurant and essentially forgotten -- we had to wait more than five minutes on several occasions just to get the waiter's attention after small problems (need for a knife, no pen provided with credit/room payment slip), our water and tea were not replenished, and the waiter placed our meals in front of the wrong person. Although these might not be big issues in a lesser restaurant, we were left very frustrated in light of the restaurant's reputation and the expensive cost of lunch. Unfortunately, the hostess had already left before we were done leaving us no one to whom to relay our concerns. Being on Camelback Road where Scottsdale meets Phoenix, you will find yourself in a great location for touring both areas. We enjoyed quick trips to several good restaurants in Scottsdale (Los Olivos and the Old Town Tortilla Factory, among others). Although the hotel does not have a golf course, you can enjoy their nicely appointed weight room or remain active by hiking at Camelback Mountain, which lies directly behind the hotel (but requires a short car trip several blocks away for convenient access). I would also highly recommend a visit to the Desert Botanical Gardens during your stay to learn a great deal about the desert environment. While the rooms and casitas at the Royal Palms can be very costly, good deals can be found, particularly in the off-season. Indeed, during our stay in late May, we paid only $179 a night for the casita, which often go for more than double that amount. Consider on top of your room rate, however, that you will incur a $22 per night \"resort fee,\" purportedly to provide a tip-free atmosphere (I am not sure how that is \"tip free\").

We also had a patio that overlooked a lovely courtyard area that had a fountain and several wood fireplace pits. They were lit on Friday night but not the others, which was a little disappointing. However, I'm sure that had we asked to have them lit, it would have been done right away!! We ate dinner outside of the resort 2 evenings but did enjoy T. Cook's on Saturday night. Overall, it was lovely but the service could have been better. We did feel as if the waitress could have been friendlier and more involved in our dining experience (as opposed to just serving us food). The fitness center and spa were excellent. I enjoyed two treatments at the spa and they were phenomenal - worth every penny. I would like to comment on one event that happened during our stay that explains why the Royal Palms is \"royal\" in my book....during her massage, my mother and her massage therapist were talking about where we had eaten the night prior and my mom commented that we had eaten at T. Cook's. She asked my mom what she had for dinner and my mom told her the duck. She asked her if she enjoyed it and my mom said yes, but that it had been a little dry. They went on to discuss other things and my mom didn't think anything of the conversation. When we all got back to the room, we received a call from the front desk advising us that the duck was going to be removed from bill!! What a surprise, especially when it's not expected. It's things like this that make you feel like you are a guest that is truly cared about. All in all, the Royal Palms is the nicest place I have ever stayed. It is not really for children and it's not for the die hard partier looking for night life entertainment. It's definitely better suited for the romantics or those looking to de-stress and be pampered. It's going to be hard staying anywhere else after my time at the Royal Palms!!", "Date": "February 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cBeyond expectations!\u201d", "Author": "gillysirl", "ReviewID": "UR6583205", "Content": "WOW!

Possibly the casitas in the old section are what gives it its rating. We did not see one. Our corner \"Plaze suite\" was BIG and an extremely long walk through two courtyards (my heart began sinking when I saw the first courtyard. I had an idea what we were in for as I saw open windows and the people in the rooms and closed windows along the dark halls I was walking in). The door to our room opened to a large, lovely living room with loud, admittedly pretty, stereo music greeting us. All blinds were closed, here and in the bedroom which adjoined. When I opened them, I realized why - The bedroom looked out on the air conditioning system - six huge compressors. I tried to open the window - not a chance! The living room looked out on a dark hall and blank wall with a table against it to stop the eye. Those windows didn't open either. We were in sunny Arizona with no way of breathing the air unless we propped our door open and craned our necks to see some sun and sky. When we turned the stereo down we could hear the roar. Even when we left it on, as we did all night, there was still a strange high-pitched noise we could not obliterate. I walked the 10 minute walk back to the front desk, with a wonderfully patient bellman working his second job while trying to get a real estate license, to ask for a different choice. My husband, who had just broken his elbow horseback riding, waited. I was told I had booked the \"new\" Plaza area. I had never been told the difference. The only other available room, I was told, was a deluxe room (no living room, which might have been OK with me in exchange for air) so we went to look. That had a balcony, and an opening door, overlooking...the parking lot. I didn't bother trying other choices. Actually, supposedly there were none. There were rooms that looked across a courtyard at other rooms. Not much of a choice. If your room faced the road and the hall, the other option, your windows did'nt open because it would be too noisy. We actually could still hear the cars through the fan vent in the bathroom ceiling. As mentioned in other letters, the pool is too crowded. The restaurant was fully booked for dinner when we got there, but no one had suggested when I reserved a room that I also reserve for dinner. In a way, we turned out to be lucky as it was mostly closed in like the rooms. I could go on as our daughter and her husband and two sons, for whom I had also booked a room, had sililarly difficult experiences. What did I learn? Always ask if the windows open.

So be our EIGHT YEAR run at the Royal Palms Resort in Phoenix. We thought about changing our annual hotel destination this year, 2006 but decided, why change something that has usually been good? Well, we found out why. The front desk staff needs some training and they need to learn how to treat a guest who has been a faithful to their hotel for this many return visits. First, our room choice had been requested for a month prior to our trip...then on the day of arrival a very specific room was asked for and was available, only to be given away 5 minutes before we were given our room, after we waited all day for the room to be cleaned etc. Then we were told no roll aways anymore...all of our previous visits we have had one. So this was an issue this year... new rule. That was a problem since the hotel was sold out for the night. We were unable to have beds for all guests in our room, then the staff was not accomodating in finding an alternative. They offered The Ritz, which is not a Resort/Spa. We had to find our own alternative accomodations at 10 p.m. Friday night and it basically ruined our evening and the next day as we had to check out and move the next day although moving to the PHOENICIAN was a Pleasant one.

The Royal Palms was magnificent - Mediteranean Style - sumptuous furniture, beautiful grounds, luxuriously intimate. We had a deluxe casita. I felt like royalty there. I didn't purchase any of the spa services however every day - usually in the morning - I went to the fitness room (towels, tv, music, juices, ice water, coffee, fresh fruit) to use the exercise machines, then went into the Eucalyptus Steam Room (which was heavenly - one glass wall so you can see outside) then the outdoor jacuzzi then the outdoor lounging area by the fireplace. (All, except for fitness room were separate men & women facilities). No additional charge for any of this - and they give you robe, slippers & a locker. Attendant in the spa showed me all the treatment rooms - they were unbelievable beautiful. So even if you don't use them ask to see them. Breakfast & Lunch at T.Cooks or Cabana Grille were superb. Only a little disappointed with Dinner at T.Cooks (service & decor were excellent but portions were very small and plain - also not much selection for vegetarians like us who eat fish, although not shellfish). But that is such a minor comment and will absolutely not deter us from visiting again.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by an amazingly friendly, warm and caring staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Our first contact was with Tony, one of the valet attendants, who opened our doors, introduced himself and thereafter, always knew us by name. (This was a trait of everyone we met on the property...it was as if we were staying with friends who always greeted us this way.) He took care of our luggage while we checked in and then gave us a tour of the property and then showed us to our room. We splurged on a deluxe casita and it was well worth it. The room was beautiful, but then again, what isn't beautiful at the Royal Palms? The only other place we have seen that was so completely visually appealing was a resort we stayed at in Tahiti. Obviously very different environments but beauty is beauty no matter where it's found. The entire property makes you feel like you are living in a lovely, watercolor painting. The colors of the buildings and flowers and artwork all make for a serene and soothing atmosphere which you find yourself melting into very quickly. The casita was beautifully decorated and very roomy. We had a private patio in the back with a view of Camelback Mountain. We had our own patio in the front as well (there are curtains you can let down to increase the feeling of privacy) where we sat and enjoyed the lovely evenings. The bathroom is a slice of heaven. The huge, walk-in shower with built-in, tiled seating is a spa treatment in itself. And the selection of soaps and lotions that are provided are wonderfully luxurious. We can't offer enough praise to everyone, and we mean literally EVERYONE, who works there. Everyone is so happy and I don't mean in a freakish Disney/Stepford way. It's as if everyone there is absolutely thrilled to be doing their jobs and in finding ways to make you feel content and welcome. We never heard a raised voice, saw a scowling face or felt as if we weren't the most important guests there. The food in the restaurants is wonderful if just a little pricey but then again, you're paying for unsurpassed quality and service. T. Cook's serves marvelous meals and the Cabana Grill has wonderfully casual lunches (and breakfast brunch on Sundays) and poolside drinks. The poolside service is unsurpassed and again, Rick and Jose (I can't say enough good things about the two of you either!!!) make you feel as if you're visiting their home. And by the joy they demonstrate when doing their jobs, it's no wonder you feel that way. We didn't use the spa but we visited the boutique area and it was beautiful as well and also well stocked with a wide assortment of spa products. On our last night there, we had the privilege of attending the General Manager's reception in the Presidential Villa (where President Bush had stayed just 2 weeks prior...regardless of your politics, it's pretty cool to know you're standing in the bedroom where a world leader has recently slept!). Our wonderful friend Jose was there and we also had the joy of meeting Greg Miller, the GM, Rick Behr, Delores (I hope I spelled your name correctly!) the Director of Experiences, and Gregory Casale, the head chef. They were all entertaining and charming and we had lovely drinks and hors d'oeuvres which made for a great send-off on our last night. We were truly sad to leave them, in fact when we left to go back to our casita, Jose made a point of stopping us and letting us know what a pleasure it had been to have us stay with them. It felt so much like saying good-bye to a friend that we hugged him before we left. My husband had seen the resort on Great Hotels on the Travel Channel but could not remember the exact name of the resort. Since we had never been to Phoenix before, that meant we had to search through every other high-end resort property before he recognized the Royal Palms from its pictures. Even after having looked at all those other properties, we just had a feeling about the Royal Palms and we couldn't have been happier to have made the choice we did. There will be no other place for us to stay on any future visits to Phoenix. Why would we? Coming back to the Royal Palms would be like coming home. And as a testament to the commitment to service and care the Royal Palms offers, look at the negative reviews of any of the other comparable resorts. Do you see any responses from those properties' management? No. And in the scant negative comments I've seen about the Royal Palms (both of which seemed to come from completely unreasonable people in my opinion), they took the time to respond and see if they could make things right. That says it all to me. This is the finest property in Phoenix, hands down. I don't need to stay anywhere else to know that. Thank you to everyone at the Royal Palms who made our stay with you an absolute joy.

This is a outstanding place for a romantic getaway or to go to relax, eat, enjoy the spa. T. Cooks restaurant was very good. Enjoy a margarita by the Kiva fireplace outside. Heaven. The casita is amazing with evening chocolates delivered to your door! I could go on. The entire staff from the valets to the maids to the pool bar staff is outstanding.
