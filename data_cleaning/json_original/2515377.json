Thursday morning at around 7:30 I went to the front desk to 1) Tell them that my sister would be arriving that day, to pick her up at the airport, and to have a keycard ready for her and 2) have myself taken to the airport at 8:00am. The shuttle didn't get me picked up until 9:00am, and only then after I had to make an issue out of it did I finally get taken to the airport. When my sister arrived that evening, she called to have the shuttle pick her up. She was told she didn't have a reservation and that there was no one with our last name staying at that hotel. She called the other Days Inn in the area from the same convenience phone (not the one we were staying at) and was told that she had the reservation and that a shuttle would pick her up. After being picked up and taken to the wrong hotel, the same lady who told my sister that she had a reservation over the phone 5 minutes earlier now said she didn't have a reservation and that she was at the wrong Days Inn. My sister had the lady call the Days Inn we were staying at and again was told no one with our last name was registered there. My sister asked to be taken back to the airport. The wrong Days Inn she was at refused to take her back even though they were the ones who took her to the wrong Days Inn in the first place. After my sister had to walk, in the rain, back to the airport, she found out that a taxi would not take her to the Days Inn we were staying at because it was not profitable for the taxi company. My sister then called me, told me what was happening and I called the front desk on the room phone. Only after yelling at the front desk did they finally realize WE HAD THE ROOM AND RESERVATION! They finally picked her up. On top of that, I was chewed up by bedbugs. I am still itching and feel miserable.

She picked this one out and I was skeptical because I have only stayed at Days Inn once before (it was in Hollywood; haven't reviewed it). Anyway, We made two separate reservations. She made hers for two nights via CheapTickets and I made mine for one night via the Days Inn website (we made the two night res. a month in advance and decided to make it a three night stay the night before we left for Seattle). Via CheapTickets, we paid about $55/night. I happen to find a promo code for the res. I made, so it was taken from a rate of $75 down to $50. Ok, so we arrived at the motel, and it is extremely close to the freeway, which didn't bother us (might bother some others though). The man at the front desk (forgot to get his name, sorry) seemed very apathetic to us and the people before us. However, the checkin was smooth and he paired both of the reservations together so we didn't have to change rooms. We got our keys and went to our room. Little did I realize, a mistake was made when I made the res. on the website and we ended up with a smoking room. Seeing how I am allergic to tobacco, this was definitely NOT acceptable. We immediately went back to the front desk and again, the man was very apathetic. To my surprise, he upgraded our room from what was a first floor single queen smoking room to a king non smoking second floor poolside room FOR FREE. MUCH MUCH better. The only bummer is that we had to switch rooms in the morning to a single queen non smoking, but that was ok for us. Our room was nice. There were 5 pillows on the bed, and the bed itself was very soft and comfortable. All the basic amenities were there (soap, shampoo, cups, towels, etc.). Everything was clean and worked well. We had a great nights sleep, even with the window open! The next morning we ate the continental breakfast. They offered waffles (used waffle mix and a waffle iron), 2 different muffin flavors, toast, English muffins, four flavors of cereal, milk, coffee, OJ, and apple juice. We found apples the first morning, but not the next two... so my guess is that they are limited every morning. Also, the breakfast room attendant seemed very annoyed (though,I can understand when one guy didn't read the directions and failed to spray the waffle iron before use). After we ate, we went to the front desk to check about having to switch rooms. This time, there was a girl named Nadia. She was much more pleasant than the man that checked us in. Anyway, she said to us, and these were her exact words, \"Why would you need to change rooms? Your reservation is already paid for. You can just stay in that room.\" Thus, we got to keep the king room for the next two nights. Accommodated? YES! We were very happy about the situation. Moving on. The motel does have an airport shuttle, but we didn't use it, so I cannot comment on that. We also didn't use the pool/hot tub. Free WiFi is available, but the signal was very week. We didn't complain about... we were able to check the important things just fine. As for location, the airport is about an 10 minute drive away. The nearest light rail station is an 8 minute drive (though it takes upwards of an hour to get downtown). The Seattle Flight Museum is an 8 minute drive away. And there is a large mall that takes about 10 minutes to get to. One thing I did notice is that the Housekeepers start working at 8AM. We put our privacy sign on the entire time, and on our final morning, the housekeeper knocked just after 8. I thought to myself, \"Maybe she thought we had checked out already.\" After getting up and dressed, we came to find out that our sign had gone missing. We think that some other guests had taken it, but we'll never know. Overall, it was a nice motel. I rate it a 4/5.

My flight landed early and I was able to check in early (4 hours). The room was basic (bed, chair, desk, flat screen tv, dresser), but comfortable. The bathroom area had granite countertops. It was clean and, for the amount of time I actually spent in the room, a good value for the money. My room opened up to the pool, but being April in Seattle wasn't open. The highway was noisy, however once I turned on the heating unit you could not hear the noise anymore. I do recommend turning on the heat/fan/AC unit if you are a lighter sleeper. The bed was fine (not too hard/not too soft) and the water pressue in the shower was average for a shower. One good thing about the shower was that it was a massaging head with many different pressure settings. Housekeeping arrived early each day I was there and I usually wasn't ready for her to clean the room (I wasn't even ready to leave yet), but every night when I arrived back at the hotel my bed was made up and there were clean towels in the room. I was only able to have breakfast 2 of the days I was there (didn't wake up early enough the other 2 days), which was a basic continental breakfast with the added benefit of waffles. My only complaint the whole time I was there was a staff member, named carol, on my final morning at breakfast. Someone couldn't read the directions on how to use the waffle maker (spray first, pour batter, close and turn until it beeps) and the waffle stuck in the iron. Carol was standing there cleaning it, but quite a few people were waiting to use it so we were standing around. She turns to us and goes \"It's going to take awhile, do you have to stand there?\" and someone else answers that we did need to stand there. So every so often while she was cleaning she would turn and smirk, sigh loudly, and shade her head. She kept doing this for a good 15 minutes while cleaning the entire area and not allowing anyone to use the waffle irons (15 minutes before breakfast was over).

I can't remember what the exact price was, but it was under $150, so in my opinion, with the stay for one night and 6 days parking, it was a good value. Yes, the hotel is very outdated. But, I wouldn't say it was dirty. The rooms could use new mattresses, but they were clean. We weren't expecting anything fancy, so we were fine. It was also in a very good location - right off the highway, and close to lots of shopping and places to eat. We even swam in the pool, and it was very clean as well, although small. I have two complaints. One, when we reserved, we were told that there was a 24 hour shuttle to the airport. When we checked out the next morning at 4:30am, we were told shuttle service didn't start till 6am (I think it was 6am), so we had to catch a cab. Not a big deal, but a bit of a hassle. My complaint is about the girl who checked us in. Upon check in, I was told to give a credit card number for security purposes. No problem, that's normal. She told me they'd swipe my card, but they don't actually charge anything to it. So I handed over my card, and said I wanted to pay for the room in cash. She accepted my card, swiped it through, and took my cash. A week after we got back from the trip, I looked at my credit card statement. She had charged me for the room on my credit card, AND taken the cash! I immediately called the hotel and spoke with the manager. He told me that records indicated I had paid with a credit card, and no cash was exchanged. I right away said that wasn't true, I paid with cash, and she just swiped my credit card to record the number. He said no, you paid with credit card, there are no cash records and if there was an excess charge, our till would have shown it. I suggested to him that perhaps she TOOK the money and he said that couldn't be true, we have cameras. I asked him to please go back to the day we checked in, on camera, and described what we were wearing. I told him he'd see us handing her cash. Luckily for the cameras, he saw we paid cash and refunded my money. I'm assuming the front desk clerk pocketed our money, and if so, I hope she lost her job. I still recommend this hotel to a friend because management worked with me to get my money back. But if you pay with cash, ask for a receipt!", "Date": "August 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cNoisy but comfortable.\u201d", "Author": "Aussie03", "ReviewID": "UR34289900", "Content": "Spacious breakfast area.

I believe the hotel you stay at kind of shapes your vacation more than anything else, and the Days Inn really did that. I was very skeptical of the hotel after paying less than a premier price and reading some shifty reviews. I mean, it's not a 5-star $300/night hotel, but it was a great little place to stay. The continental breakfast was very good... I craved the waffles for days after I got back home. The staff was also very accommodating. My wife is pregnant and got sick while we were there off some bad Chinese food. I asked the receptionist where the closest hospital was, just in case, and she pulled out a pre-printed mapquest map to the hospital and give it to us for free. Later on, on a whim I asked them if there was a Wal-Mart nearby, and she pulled out yet another mapquest map to the Wal-Mart and gave us that for free!!! The cleaning lady came in and cleaned our room every day while we were gone and did a fantastic job without disturbing the possessions we left in the room (we have bad experiences of our stuff being stolen by the cleaning crews of other hotels). Their parking is very accommodating, and they have a nice lounge in the breakfast area with a computer with internet access and a big TV. They also have a pool which doesn't look too inviting, but it was the fall when we stayed so maybe the 60-degree weather didn't put us in the pool mood.

This was the worst hotel we've ever stayed at. Upon arrival we did get to check in about an hour before 3 pm which was convenient, however we arrived to a 2nd floor room which stank of musty alcohol and cigarrete smoke. The door had been kicked in by someone previously and the room number was broken off and written on with a black marker. The carpet was so filthy that my family and I wore shoes the hole entire time we were there. The carpet had been replaced...over the old carpet and the door to the adjacent room was not accessible because the new carpet was tacked over the bottom of the door, rendering it useless to try to open it. We arrived to hair on the toilet seat and in the bathtub, not enough towels and beds that looked unkept, smelled like someone had slept in them before. There was a little sign about the environment and the fact that they do not wash the sheets unless you put that little sign on the bed. So maybe the sheets hadn't been washed in a while? We were without hot water for the first 3 days out of 4 that we stayed there. My husband called the front desk or went down there to talk to them personally several times. They told him that they would try to switch us rooms or would fix the hot water if we came back the next day by 11 am. Ok, our main purpose to come to Seattle was to sight see. We were not aiming to wait around the hotel room all morning or to mess with moving between rooms. We were up and out of there before 8 o'clock each day and the hotel should have been the last thing on our agenda. They would not switch us rooms, kept saying that they didn't have any openings. After begging for hot water, they sent a maintenance man to our room that did not speak English. He came to our room 2 mornings in a row and still didn't manage to fix the hot water. Finally the 2nd night my husband called the general manager. He finally let us use the room adjacent to ours so that we could bathe ourselves and 4 children. The room key to the room next to us did not work and of course the carpet was tacked against the door so we couldn't go between the rooms from the inside. Finally my husband had to take the door off the hinges so that we could access the room just to take a sodding shower. Towels. Only once did housekeeping come to clean the room and give us towels..they left 3 towels, didn't change the sheets and we ended up having to take out our own garbage the whole time we were there...3 towels...for 6 people??, the rest of the time we had to beg the front desk for towels and got nasty attitude every time. I have yet to see the \"fitness center\". I do not believe it exists. The pool was freezing cold and dirty. The hot tub had soggy food strewn around it and the paint on the fences was peeling off. The switch to turn the hot tub on was not labeled and was right smack dab next to a general sign that pointed to all the switches that read...\"Do not touch, Emergency shut off switch\". So which switch exactly turns the darn thing on? The business center exists of two outdated computers on a counter in the lobby, one of which has a scribbled \"out of order\" sign on it. The only nice things was the free do it yourself waffles for continental breakfast if you can stomach sitting in a small lobby with tons of other guests and eating on sticky table clothes. At least we had friendly neighbors in the room next door to ours, they partied, cussed, drank and smoke until around 4 am the first night we were there. It was a real pain in the arse actually to have to listen to that all night long through the thin walls. NOISE. If you stay here you are within 50 feet of nothing but truck stops and a convenience store. There are no grocery stores anywhere near this place and one Jack in the Box restaurant. The freeway is within spitting distance of the back side of the hotel. If a car went over the guard rail it would probably land in the pool you're so close to I-5. So yes the website is accurate you are within close distance to the freeway. This was the WORST hotel experience we have ever had and will NEVER stay at this place again.

Hotel seemed lax in security and was quite noisy. No microwave or indoor pool as touted by web site. Communication appeared to be a low priority as no one was able to answer such simple questions as \"Is there a nearby park?\" We had a reservation for 3 nights and checked out after the first night. Unfortunately the front desk staff failed to \"check us out\" and we were charged the full three days on our credit card despite paying cash upon surrendering the keys and notifying them of our departure. Subsequent attempts to handle this through the management have both failed and proved to be very frustrating. Had to contact the credit card company to dispute charges. Very unprofessional management/staff and a disappointing all-around experience. Check your credit card statement closely if you choose to stay at this hotel.
