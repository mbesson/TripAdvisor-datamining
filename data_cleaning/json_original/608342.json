The owner is very helpful and friendly. Our room (number 14) was basic and clean, with a balcony, minibar, tv and free wi-fi. It's the room beside the reception desk, so it was a bit noisy. Regarding the stairs... well, in Amsterdam many hotels will be like this. Unfortunately, we happened to be carrying two suitcases weighting 20 kg each, so climbing those 37 steps was quite an exercise. So it's not recommended to mature, obese or people with heavy luggage. For the young folks, it won't be a problem though.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pula, Croatia", "Title": "\u201cClean, Safe & Welcoming\u201d", "Author": "MsShitHappens", "ReviewID": "UR127574335", "Content": "Okay, the stair really are ROUGH, but that's not a big deal given the fact that - it's Amsterdam! - all the stairs are more or less the same and awful (good for your work out). The hotel owner is unbelievebly nice, professional and helpful. He made our stay a nice memory, thanks for that. Since this is a one star hotel you cannot really expect much (there aren't many amenities to begin), but this place has everything that you can ask from a budget hotel. It's very clean, safe, warm (excually, it's too warm, we had to keep our window open all the time), it has free wifi and a delightful owner. My only bigger problem was sleep quality. The beds are far from comfortable, they're, in fact, hospital or army bed - I'm not sure. And I'm sorry that we had to share a bathroom and the toilet - the next time I stay there I'll make sure I take the room with a bathroom and a toilet. The best thing about the hotel was it's location. It's located in the very heart of Amsterdam, behind The Dam Square. All bigger tourist sites were in walking distance. All in all it was a very pleasent experience and I would stay there again. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cIf you're a backpacker or trekking Europe, this is for you, but...\u201d", "Author": "Gloria W", "ReviewID": "UR126408518", "Content": "Bottom line: 1) The hotel owner is SUUUUUUUPER nice and helpful.

The Hotel and the room also where very small, but it was clean and we really enjoyed our stay there. Everyday we had fresh towels which quite suprised me. Also the owner was very friendly and answered all the questions we had about where to go. We spontaniously decided to stay a night longer - this was no problem and was handled very incomplicated. As the hotel is right in the city center you reach many sights, restaurants and bars in only a few minutes. Anne Frank Huis is just a stone's throw a way. There is also a tram station very close by the hotel. I would recommend to rent a bicyle - there is one just arround the corner.

The shared toilet and shower, steps away from the room, were always clean and I received fresh towels daily. There is a great little restaurant below the hotel towards Dam Square. Albert Heijn is a block away which is very convenient. The only problem I had was the temperature in the room during the day. Can't fault the hotel for the heat wave, but a fan would have been a nice touch. Check out was also a breeze and that's not easy at 5:45 in the morning!
