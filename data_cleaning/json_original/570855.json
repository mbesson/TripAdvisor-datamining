We thought it would be more convenient to stay here rather than in Sultanahmet because we thought it would be easier to get to the airport from here. That assumption was 100% wrong. But other than that, we had called the hotel before arriving in Istanbul confirming our reservation for a double room and confirming the rate but when we arrived at the hotel, the man told he was going to charge us $20 more for the room since it was just for one night. The room itself was horrible. It wasn't a double room, it was a room with two twin beds and it was tiny; no place on the floor for our suitcases (we only had one carry-on each) so we had to place them where we had to walk over them and it was difficult to step over the suitcases on the floor. The windows didn't close properly so the freezing cold air came into the room along with the loud street noise - ALL night long. There was some hole in the bathroom that was open to the outside so again, freezing cold and noise entered there. We didn't sleep all night long. I have to say, I would not recommend this place to anyone -- also, expect to pay higher prices than they originally tell you once you are there.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and fine for the price\u201d", "Author": "Foreignforays", "ReviewID": "UR117289399", "Content": "We had three night staying at this hotel and could not have been happier with the location as it was walking distance from sights like Sultan Ahmed (Blue) Mosque, Grand Bazaar and even Hagia Sofia is not too far away. It is a great area to walk as well as you see so many ancient evidence of Istanbul's amazing historical past. Glimpses of city walls, Roman viaducts and columns and capitals probably 1500 years old tucked between more modern structures are just par for the strolling course in this part of Istanbul. The tram line is only about 300 m away (Leilani stop) and this will take you all the way to Kabatas where you can pick up a Bosphorous cruise for 12 Turkish Lira or a trip to Princes Island or catch the underground funicular train to Taksim Square. All tram/metro/funicular rides will cost you 1.75 TL using a small plastic token you can buy from machines at each stop. Same fare no matter how far you go but if you change trains it is another token to reboard. Pretty easy to get around really. On the street outside the hotel are some great street food sellers exp in evening when you must seek out the sardine seller. A tray of freshly cooked crumbed sardines with salad for 4 lira and you will crave it for weeks later - guaranteed. The beds are firm, the pillows hard and the bathrooms are basic but okay. The management was responsive to any concerns (eg light bulb blown meant someone came immediately to fix). Internet connection was best in the dining area on the mezzanine level above reception but only some floors had it for inroom use. Breakfast was buffet Turkish/Greek style - salads, cold meat, bread and pastries. Power plugs are European two prongs. Within about 50 metres (up the hill) was a strip of some really good and inexpensive cafes, doner kebab shops and a bakery selling fantastic pides and boreks for 1-2 lira was only about 200 metres away further along from the cafe strip. A great mini break which did not end up costing very much but we had a hoot and had some great food, excellent photo opportunities and not bad shopping either. Look out for Egyptian Bazaar near the so-called 'New' Mosque. Get of the tram at Eminonu and walk across the road using the underpass (cheap buys in there!). Also make sure you buy a fish meal off one of the floating kitchen on dragon boats just beside the bridge there. Restaurants for those who don't want to be too local are under the bridge roadway itself and you can stroll along that level too. A bit touristical for me but probably very nice.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "dubai", "Title": "\u201cit was generally OK\u201d", "Author": "DIDI A", "ReviewID": "UR116944240", "Content": "we stayed at the hotel for 5 nights...the hotel is very basic....can't complain the A/C was working good... had water in the shower all the time ...but the fridge was not working tho... other than this they could of done with little bit of cleaning everyday in our room which have not been touched or cleaned since the time we arrived and for the 5 nights....the man in the reception was trying to help with booking the going out nights ...for 50 euro per person!! ....the location is good 10 -15 mins walk to the tram...it's budget hotel OK to stay in if u r not fussy or after luxury...", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "frankurt", "Title": "\u201cONLY LIERS\u201d", "Author": "matacupulainbrate", "ReviewID": "UR33691610", "Content": "don't believe what you read on Intenet about their Location \" neabry just 15 min walking by Grand Bazar \". there are two different hotels \" one located YES, nearby Grand Bazar and other one, so far by this location. \" i sad these all, because when i book a room, i did after read the all these things regarding their location, exactly i was interested by be close by Grand Bazar. they did this reservation for a room, for other Hotel \" why these all things? i answer you \" for win only money \" instead give me the right room for which i laready used my credit acrd and they afetr charged it, that counter man told me \" go to other our hotel, located so far by these all things wrote about them ( by Grand Bazar ) \" DON'T BELIEVE THEM. ask them if you need more information's until you got the right answers. now, i have contact the Web Service trough i used my credit card for not be charged. also, they don't have their own parking cars. they send you leave the car to a public parking location, where have pay $10 for 12h", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bergama Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d570855-Reviews-Bergama_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$66 - $100*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Fevziye Caddesi No 34</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Sehzadebasi</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34470</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "570855", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a9/f7/a9f730fa0d88aadfc2fc7b5f9b293ec41large.jpg"}}
