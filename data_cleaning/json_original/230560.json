We were given a small hot, stuffy room on the first floor. You had to climb into bed or you hit the wall. The air conditioning had been turned off and you couldn't open the door as the bed was up against it. The bathroom didn't have anywhere to hang a towel or put any of your toiletries in. The breakfast was served in a airless room that looked like a double garage. The coffee was made and kept in a thermos if you wanted a cup of tea they had tepid water in a thermos. When i asked for fresh boiled water I was told the water in the thermos is freshly boiled, it was dreadful tasted like plastic. They served the same dry pastries every morning.

This is not the only reason for the one star. The other desk clerk was rude from the start. He did not want to accommodate me into my friends room or upgrade us. He could not understand anything we were saying. He repeatedly said, \"IMPOSSIBLE!\" That is the moral of the story, everything about this hotel is impossible! It started with the bed. Sharing the bed is impossible. It is small than my dorm room bed. Sleeping on the floor is impossible because there is barely enough room to get through the room. Other things impossible: The wifi is impossible to get except in the lobby, the one computer in the lower level of hotel is impossibly slow, a decent breakfast is impossible, unless you like warm milk. Easy transportation and good food around here: impossible. Calling a cab to the airport: IMPOSSIBLE! This is what led to my postcards being fervidly torn up and thrown in the waste can. We asked for a taxi to bring my 2 friends and me to the airport. We had to make one stop before and so the lady said we will not make it to the airport (my one friend had an hour earlier flight). She cancelled the first cab. Then she suggested to order 2 cabs because the one cab she said was approximately 45 minutes away. Ok... Then the cab shows up 10 minutes later. We said cancel the other cab we have time now. She refused to cancel saying she will be in trouble. She had no problem canceling the other cab and she told us we wouldn't fit in there. We fit in the cab just fine. And it turned into me saying, \"I'm sorry we have to go! We don't have a lot of money for 2 cabs, since she was pressuring us into 2 cabs in the first place.\" Do you know how expensive cabs are to the airport??? Let alone anywhere in Italy. You have to pay for the cab to come to you and then to where you are going. It's ridiculous. So she is saying, \"You can't!! You can't\" Yelling and I kept apologizing but we had to go so we left. I felt bad, but I also felt like she was trying to scam us. Then I realized I handed her my 7 postcards to different family members to mail 10 minutes before that, with stamps. Can you guess what happened? They never made it to their destinations, my other ones from the day before I dropped in the Vatican did. I am not going to say she is a bad person. I can see somebody in the heat of the moment ripping up some paper postcards angrily. Maybe she regrets it, maybe she doesn't, but my family was looking forward to getting postcards from Italy from me.

Hotel is situated in a nice quiet residential area in Monte Mario. Safe enough to walk around in the evening and shop/browse around the few commercial streets around. Public transportation is a 10 minutes walk to FR3 regional train station Balduina. From there, a short trip takes you to a transfer possible on Line A train Valle Aurilia, but be sure to commute anywhere from 45 to 75 minutes to get to Rome. The hotel shuttle takes about 15 minutes to Piazza Cavour, on reservations at front desk only. The basic room on the second floor, was very regular. Clean sheets, clean towels, vacuumed daily but a bit disappointing compared to the overall look of the hotel. Even my travel agent was shocked when I told him about the look of the rooms, web site sold it as an classy stay... but not on the 2nd floor! There are no ironing board and no additional power outlets to charge a camera or mobile phones in the rooms. Even if there is a 120V converter in the bathroom, but it might no be the best place to put a mobile phone to charge while your in the shower. Hair blower wasn't working as well. The bathroom isn't the best part of the room, big enough for a single person and unfortunately the way the shower is built, all the water from the shower ends up on the floor and even outside the bathroom after a shower. The rug in the room was always wet after a shower and the smell of the humid rug and humid shower curtain was really awful. The restaurant has a great service. The food was great and the small selection on wines and local beers is more than enough. The barman/waiter offered an awesome service and was very helpful with information on transportation, safety in Rome, buses, tours and TV shows to watch! He was very friendly and is definitively a valuable resource for this hotel. The breakfast is just good enough to get your day started with it's diverse menu but after 3 days it really gets on your stomach! But it's quite fair compare to what's available to breakfast in Rome. There's a tiny pizza joint called City Pizza on the same street as the hotel, where the servings are really good and the pizza is quite good tasting and affordable.

It is a bit far from the city center and if your caught looking for food at night your out of luck as many business close early. However if you take advantage of the free shuttle service or catch the 990 downtown then location becomes less of a hassle. The room itself was very modern and mimicked the minimalist style illustrated in the lobby which in my opinion is very appealing. Tv had CNN eurosport and RT, with more chanels if you wish to purchase them, which came as a surprise since most euro hotels lack English channels. Breakfast was simple yet did a sufficient job supplying the guest with everything from cold cuts to eggs and everything in between. The restaurant surprisingly was very good considering my usual experiences with hotel food my only suggestion is that they put a beer on tap rather than only having bottles, but hey you can't get everything Probably the greatest quality of this hotel is its staff. Initially my flight out of JFK was canceled and I lost my bag during my stay and the reciiptionist was more then courteous in helping me retrieve it. Once while working out in the gym I thought I had gone in unnoticed yet within 2 mintues a employee came flying in the turn on the tv and make sure the room was at a suitable temperature.

When my partner and I arrived in Rome, the cab driver new the exact location, so no troubles there! The cost of the cab will, however, set you back around \u20ac45, so a tad expensive!! The hotel is located in a residential area - it was lovely walking around and discovering the little shops and restaurants. There is also a supermarket about 15-20 minutes walk from the hotel! The nearest overground station is Balduina, which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There is a little shop next to the station where you can buy your travelcard from (about \u20ac3). When you catch the train at Balduina, you are a few of stops away from an area that has a Metro station (check your maps). Although this sounds like it would take you ages to get to the city centre, it only takes about 30 minutes max! Alternatively, you can use the free shuttle bus (people carrier) that the hotel provides in the morning. You'll need to register your seat/s with reception. We always got a seat when we needed them. The shuttle bus will drop you near the Vatican. Staff at Hotel Zone were friendly, especially the bar man (who was sometimes on reception). He was always happy to help answer any questions we had. The food served at the hotel was lovely and the free breakfast was nice (which included bread, scrambled eggs, pastries, cereals, juice, tea, coffee, etc)! The hotel room we had was clean and the bed was comfy. The walls, however, are very thin and you can pretty much hear everything is the rooms next door. It was also a bit annoying when I wanted a lie in but I couldn't because the cleaners were hoovering! It would also be great if there were tea/coffee making facilities in the room.

That said, I don't understand when reviewers weigh location so heavily against a hotel--it's not as if the hotel changed locations before you arrived. You know in advance where they are, and you can look them up on Google Maps, multimap, etc. A little research goes a long way! This hotel is indeed not very close to the central tourist area, but the price reflects that. My wife and I were regularly able to walk 10 minutes to Balduina station and take the light rail to Trastevere, or transfer to the Metro at Valle Aurelia. For anyone who has used big city transit before, this is not a big deal. We were in the historic center within 30 minutes each day. A ticket costs 1 Euro, while lesser hotels in a \"better\" location are often an additional 50 Euros or more per night. You can do the math... PLUSES: 1. Excellent and friendly desk staff, especially Paolo. All spoke very good English and most were extremely helpful--you could transfer this staff to the Cavalieri Hilton (EUR400/night) and they would fit in perfectly. We were very impressed with their professionalism and work ethic. 2. Clean rooms with plenty of information available. 3. Good closets and lots of shelving space 4. Very good breakfast staff, plus a pretty good breakfast. The eggs were marginal, but the cold meats, cheeses, yogurts, coffees and pastries were all very good and filling. 5. Free parking and exercise room (we did not use either one, but worth noting) 6. Bellboys were VERY quick and helpful. 7. Common areas were fairly clean and well maintained. MINUSES: 1. The air conditioner in our first room stopped functioning after a few hours. The replacement portable A/C required the window be left open for the exhaust hose. It rained that night. Not very pleasant. However, they were able to move us to a new room the next morning. 2. The wallpaper in both rooms was peeling, though not excessively so. 3. Upon check out, the desk clerk insisted that my credit card would not work (this would have been the first failure in 9 years, including 5 trips abroad). I ended up having to walk nearly 30 sweaty minutes round-trip to the nearest ATM to find cash to pay the bill. I am almost certain that this was a ploy to get me to pay in cash; if not, it sure is an odd coincidence. I used the same card without problems for two additional weeks in Italy. This particular desk staffer had a bad attitude in general, nothing like the other two we dealt with during our stay. If the key statistic is \"Would you stay here again?\", then the answer is definitely YES. Even if I wanted to stay closer to the historic center, I would still consider staying at Zone and making the transfer into town each day--I doubt you'll find a better experience for the money anywhere in Rome.", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cPlenty of Surprises\u201d", "Author": "Prof49", "ReviewID": "UR16464427", "Content": "Hotel is clean but the service leaves a lot to be desired.

Ok...there are good things, and there are bad things with this hotel. The bad things. 1. I have spent a lot of nights in hotels in Europe. This is NOT a 4-star hotel. Whoever gave them the 4 stars must be currupt!! 2. The rooms are extremely noisy. Not from outside traffic; there is no traffic as the hotel is at the end of a dead-end road. The noise comes from inside the hotel. You can literally hear everything that is being said in the room next to you. Even if you fart, they will hear it!!! Also, the hallway has laminate. This means that you will wake up as soon as the first people go for breakfast. The cleaning process is also extremely noisy, and starts at 08.15. 3. I have never seen a 4-star hotel with a curtain in the shower. 4. The breakfast is ok for a 2-star, but not adequate for a 4-star hotel! 5. The gym is nice, but who uses it after walking the entire day in Rome? 6. I ordered a single room on bookings.com, only to discover that the hotel has cheaper single rooms on their own websites. 7. Getting there from the airport is a nightmare; take a train to the city centre (Termini station, 11 Euro), then take a taxi (25 Euro for suitcase and Termini surcharges). Forget about buses and undergrounds. That is not practical in the evening with suitcases. 8. My single room was very small. 9. Usage of the airco requires a science degree. The nice things: 1. At 10 minutes walking distance, there is a great Italian restaurant. Follow the road, keep right, and at the end go to the right. 2. The only place in Rome where you can sleep with an open room in the night.No traffic noise. 3. Transport to the city centre is easy. Take their free shuttle, and walk. Go back by taxi (15 Euro). Summarising: This is not a 4-star hotel compared to Spanish and Portuguese standards. And believe me, I am an experienced traveller. Now a meesage to the Zone Hotel staff who tends to respond to these postings: Instead of appologising, please take action. My criticisms are exactly the same as those made by others 1 year ago. The breakfast is still bad, ok..staff is now friendly.....but if you know that your rooms are noisy, try to put customers as far as away from each other. Adjust your pictures on your website; I did not have a fancy bathroom and glass panels. Start the cleaning process later. Put a carpet on the halways. Add a device that ensures that room doors are closed c losely and quietly, instead a big bang. And above all, be honest and remove a star. And please, don't tell me that this for Italian standards it is 4-stars. The room + breakfast is 3 stars. Having a fancy gym should not count for an extra star.

The train station at Balduina is at some walking distance from the hotel and has no ticket machine.

The road to the hotel is very poor over the last 100 yards with many potholes and there is no street lighting - the pathway is often blocked with cars - hence the need to use the road to get to the entrance - health and safety issue here!!. The hotel from the outside looks rather modern, but unfortunately, the rooms were poor with the wall paper peeling off the walls and the carpet looking and feeling threadbare. Beds were hard. During the night if another guest closes the door with any force the whole room will vibrate and if someone goes to the toilet in the rooms above, you will hear the flushed water!! Bathroom was clean, but the shower curtain is a bit dated and sink plug did not work. The room was clean too. TV selection was extremely poor - 2 english channels - CNN and EuroSport!! The air conditioning was an absolute nightmare - hit and miss and was noisy. I did ask for someone to have a look at it and it took him 20 minutes to get it to work. Once we turned it off, it was back to square 1 - at least it wasn't too hot. Breakfast was good with a decent selection and service. However, there was visible mold on the wall where water damage was evident. The fitness room is a good addition (be aware this is not a gym - there are no free weights so you can't do proper chest or any arm exercises) The real downer (and business people be aware) is the internet access. I paid 5 euros for a half hour and on the docket it said I had 24 hours to use it. I used 15 minutes and when I went back the next evening it didn't work. I went to reception and was told the account had 'died' after 11 hours since first logon by the system so I said create a new one for the 15 minutes I had still remaining and had paid for. I was absolutely astonished to be told that this was 1. impossible with out buying more time. 2. management were aware of an 11 hour termination for a long time but continued to allow the docket to be printed saying 24 hours. (this led me to be very annoyed as it's what written down is what can only be relied upon). 3. I was then informed that this causes continual frustration with other users but management policy is set with regard to this and I was told in no uncertain manner that it was to stay.

First the bad though. The only thing negative I have to say about this place is the location. It's FAR. It's way off the map, about a 10-15 minute drive from the Vatican (which is in itself a considerable ways from the city center). While there is a free shuttle service that goes to and from the hotel, I have three main problems with it: 1.) You can't take your luggage, which means you have to cab your luggage to and fro the place, and pay taxi costs (which are expensive -- 50 euro or so to the train station). 2.) It doesn't run all night - the last drop-off to the city is around 6:30, so if you're coming back any time after that, you're out of luck and have to take a cab -- again, expensive. 3.) It advertises as going to the 'city center', but it's nowhere near. It doesn't even cross the Tiber. It drops you off at Piazza Cavour, if I recall, which is near the Castel San'angelo. Look on a map - it's several miles distant from the Coliseum, Pantheon, etc. That having been said, the Hotel itself is very modern, and it was a charm to stay at. We booked a triple and got a spacious room with three beds. They have satellite TV with REAL CNN (Not CNN International, which is basically a continuous five minute loop of the world's activities) and a host of other channels, both in English, Italian and German. The continental breakfast was an actual continental breakfast. The server even made my friend and I an expresso, free of charge! The food was great. Internet access is available, but it's very expensive (something like 5 or 8 euro an hour). One thing I would recommend for food -- there's a Doner place just down the road, with the most amazing kebabs and pizza for ridiculously cheap prices. Ask the hotel. Some of the best food I had on my trip! Overall, would I stay again? The hotel itself was great, the service was exceptional, but the location is far too far. For the extra subsidy you're going to pay in cab fares when you need to haul luggage to the place or come home at night when the free shuttle service is no longer operating, you can probably get a just as nice hotel for the same price that's inside the city. And, if the hotel is reading this, what *would* make me come back to stay? One, make the hotel shuttle pick up and drop off in the *actual* city center -- like Piazza Venezia or San Marco. That's within walking distance of all the main sites in Rome and is close enough to the train station that a cab to and from there would not be that much. Two, extend the evening pickup times until at least midnight, if not later. If I'm going to a night out on the town - a nice meal with a girlfriend, a play, a bar with friends, etc. -- 6:30 as the last pickup time is unacceptably early. Midnight at the very least is a time I could have a nice meal, or enjoy an evening's entertainment, and be ready to return home by. Three, if you don't accept luggage in the free van, offer a paid service that does. I would not mind paying 15 or 20 euros for a service that would pick me up and be able to carry my luggage, because I know I would be paying 40 or 50 euros otherwise if I chose a taxi.

I phoned reception, and managed to persuade a disgruntled receptionist to give me another room. Room 206 was even worse! We decided to stay one night and then find somewhere else the following day.

Breakfast was fine but a reasonably limited continental breakfast which didn't change while we were there. Shuttle services into town was useful in the morning but hopeless at night as it finished far too early to be able to actually eat dinner. Finding the place from the train station was a bit of a nightmare but signs appeared as you got quite close to the hotel. Distance also posed a problem when trying to get to our hire car place ( a couple of suburbs north, on the way out of Rome), as public transport would have been near impossible and taxis are expensive.

We recommand using taxis to and from the airport. These are \u20ac45 & \u20ac60 from Fumicino and Champino respectively.

There are several every hour. Note that metro tickets are the same but have a 75-minute time limit. So buy when you need, not before. Like most capitol cities, Roma is not cheap. Beer is very expensive - between \u00a34 - \u00a310 a pint. If you can, drink mineral water ( cheap by UK standards ) and house wine. The food is generally very good. There are hundereds of snack bars all offering quality food at a fair price. A good measure is if the locals eat there......... The city is busy but be brave when crossing roads. Only cross at designated crossings and if there is no green/red man, walk with confidence. Give the driver eye contact. Do not stop in the middle or you will get knocked down!!!! The drivers will adjust their speed to let you cross without them having to stop. At this time of year Roma is desperately hot.

We asked the price and it was 50 euro, so we went ahead. It is a little daunting in the airport and trying to find the best way to the hotel is still a mystery. Shuttle took about 40 minutes as we had to drop off another couple. Room was pleasantly sized and had everything we needed. Area is definitely a residential area, but pretty nice overall. Hotel was getting remodelled when were their, so construction noise started at 9:00 am, but we off and site seeing by then anyway. We did take a peak at the rooms being remodelled and they are very, very nice. Staff was relatively helpful. They provided us with a tourist map that was very helpful, although the hotel was off the map. Maps of the bus routes were very weak at best. Breakfast was pretty good as other have said. Getting to/from the hotel via 990 bus is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Taking bus back to hotel is a little tricky, but had it figured out by the 3rd day. You can try to tell bus driver you want the zone hotel stop and that helps, but pay attention. We opted for a 3 day bus/metro pass for 11 euro. Not sure if this ended up being the most economical, but not having to find a tobacco shop to get tickets was worth the extra. Bus is a little confusing because ir really zig zags through the neighborhood and you feel like \"hey we were just here\". Shuttle bus works best for the mornings. I would contact the hotel a couple days before arriving to reserve for every morning you are there. We were not able to get on it the day after we got there, but booked it for the following days. Getting to FCO from hotel was a little tricky, we took 990 bus to Metro, luckily we tagged along with a german lady that was going to the airport, otherwise we would have had trouble. I would suggest trying to get a detailed map of the area before going, as every map we were given either did not have hotel on the map or was too fuzzy to read.

Firstly the hotel is located in suburbs and so you have to catch a bus (990) into the vatican city. This takes approximately 30 mins to get to piazza cavour during the quiet times and up to 45 mins during rush hour. This is quite a problem. Imagine you have an early start at 8.00 spend the whole day in town and fancy heading back to your hotel to get changed. This means anywhere from 60-90 minute round trip to get to your hotel and then back into town for the night. Not good. Also you need to eat and the hotel has no restaurant and there are only snack bars or takeaways nearby. SO you really need to eat in town. meaning the journey or you stay out. Another very important point if you want to see the sights is that the journey only takes you to the vatican city, not rome city. To give you an idea it takes about an hour to get to rome city and the sites, and an 80 minutes to get to the colloseum. SO this hotel is a real hassle for those wanting to see all the sites over by the colloseum. ANd believe me this is where most of teh good sites are such as colloseum, palatino, baths of caracha(might be spelt wrong), trevi fountain etc. The catacombs are also this side and require another bus journey ( or walk as we did for over an hour from the baths). So bear in mind the catacombs are about 2 hours from the hotel. If you dont mind this and just want the st pauls bassillica and to see the cistine chapel etc then the hotel is 30-45 mins from here. Also with regards to the hotel. Breakfast is limited, you get rice krispies or cornflakes. You also get croissants and bread, plus if you are lucky and get there in time you get a yoghurt. They also provide a slice of cheese or slice of ham for you. I think its ltd. To cap it off because there is no restaurant there should be a kettle in the room, but there is no kettle. So no tea making facilities. There is a bar that no one goes to in the lobby. ITs lifeless. Other errors at the hotel are our key card needed reprogramming every day to allow us in the room and if you dont stick the shower curtain to the wall correctly the bathroom floods and there is no drain so it stays wet. on the positive the room is clean, spacious and airy. it has a minibar and a free safe. So its up to you. If you only want the vatican side its ok. But if you want the rest of the sites its not good. On the very positive side rome really does have some exceptional sites worth seeing.

About 1/2 mile away is a metro stop for Balduina, this is on the FM3 (aka FR3 line), as near as we can tell, this stands for \"Free Metro\" as you DO NOT need a ticket to board this train. You can make your connection at Valle Aurelia to the Red Line (Aka A Line) you do need a ticket at this point and I don't remember if you can purchase them at this station or not (on our first day we had walked the full two miles to Cipro station (Aka Vatican Museum on the A Line) and purchased our tickets there. So, it is close to a Metro Stop but consider the following: The Metro stops running around 10:30 or 11:30 pm depending... and restaurants often don't open for the evening until 7:30pm. Restaurants do not rush you and whenever we ate in town we missed the last train and had to walk all the way back (often 3 - 4 miles) and many cabs are unwilling to drive that far (we tried to catch a cab one night at St. Peters and we no sooner told the driver Via Alfredo Fusco and he said no). Upshots: The rooms are sound proofed, there are safes and small refrigerators in the rooms (nice features) the staff is friendly, helpful and speak English very well. The continental breakfast included croissants, rolls, salami, ham, Swiss cheese, corn flakes, Rice Crispies, Yogurt, canned fruit cocktail, oj, milk, water, tea and cappuccino... we never left hungry. A nearby restaurant known as Cappieri (spelling may not be quite right here) serves excellent food, the wait staff is very friendly, speaks English well and the prices were very reasonable. We ate there semi frequently as it was close to the hotel and we would not have to worry about the metro/cab situation. A party of four with 2 appetizers, 4 main dishes, 2 desserts and a bottle of house wine ran about 65 Euro total. As I said the food was very good, we were never disappointed. We were very happy here, but there will be some walking, or have a number handy to call a cab if you need one. Other than that it's a great place to stay and we would definitely stay there again! Hint, you can take the FM3 train all the way to Pyramide station and switch to the Blue Line (aka B) and it's one stop to Circo Massimo or two stops to Colosseo (Coliseum) without having to pass through the crowded and much maligned Termini station...
