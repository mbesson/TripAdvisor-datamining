Carpet was not clean, but it was full of hair, dust and crumbs on it. When I complained I was not taken seriously, but was told that it was new so it was impossible that it could be dirty. The toilet was not fresh, the ring was not cleaned over, it was almost an end in the sink and soap in the shower was over. They made \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039up and folded the towels every day with never cleaned the toilet bowl really well but just poured in the detergent. We had no security locks on the door but we closed it with a simple key, which is not felt so safe. The whole room smelled of paint. Breakfast was not exactly an English breakfast. Dry bread, juice, yoghurt and cereals. Hotel corridors were mangy and the paint had started to come off the walls, mold on the ceiling and smelled old and stuffy.

However we were greeted by an unfriendly receptionist. We were handed a key and sent up four flights of stairs with our luggage traipsing behind us. The room had a double and a single bed, the decor was grimy and oldfashioned. We were happy to have ended a long trip and arrived in London, however it was not what we expected for the money we were paying. The beds had flat pillows and no duvet, a sheet and blanket, the matress had seen better days, the springs were uncomfortable. On looking in the wardrobe a solitary spare pillow, yellow and meldewed. In front of the wardrobe a mouse trap, the box and poison kind. Wanting to freshen up I ventured into the showerroom, I began to run the water in the bathroom sink and was greeted with a gurgling and a foul smell, (believing it to be the toilet) I consulted my partner. On further inspection we noticed that when i ran water into the sink the shower tray began to bubble and fill with pungent water. We informed reception and they sent up the maintenance man to remedy this. We sat on the bed whilst he began to plunge the shower tray, in the mirror opposite the bathroom we witnessed faeces emerging from the plug and showering the surrounding area. We promptly returned to reeception and requested a change of room. This is not the worst thing we encountered in the wrongly named Kings hotel. We were relocated and the room appeared to be better, it smelt fresher when we entereed, the beds were in the same condition as the previous room and the solitary spare pillow in the same mouldy state in the wardrobe. Smelling curry we decided to go and have some dinner, we werev directed to the curry house adjoining the hotel, this appeared okay until we were seated at grease stained tables. We chose to exxplore thee surrounding area and instead eat out. We returned and went to bed, we slept although it was an uncomfortable experience, the pillows were so flat that we obtained cricks in the neck and the springs were digging into our backs. Our second night, we both woke at around 4am to a clicking sound, at first we thought that it wwas the fan which had been on. However after turning on the light and turning off the fan, the noise persisted. After investigations it became clear that the noise was coming from the waste paper bin, I witnessed something moving in the bin, afteer stamping on the floor it became clear that it was a rat. The rat clambered out of the bin and ran along the room and under the bed. Again we went to reception and after waking up the staff member informed them of what we had encountered. They sounded surprised and insisted that they would inform the manager. We spent the remainder off the night awake and huddled on the bed wondering whether the rat was still under the bed. We spoke to the manager oursselves on our departure, he was unaware of our nightmare, but knocked a minimal amount from the bill.

First, I had booked a twin bedroom but when my mum and I arrived, there was only a double bedroom for us. The bed in that room was the worse bed we ever slept in. In fact, we hardly slept at all because it was so uncomfortable and you could feel all the springs of the matress through the material. I also realised that the shower in the ensuite bathroom was broken and when I told the owner, he obviously knew about it but had not told us as he said: \"yes, that's ok, the plumber is coming tomorrow\". So he showed me the shared bathroom on the first floor. I took a shower there the next morning at 8.30 and there was no hot water left! His reply was that I should have got up earlier! I was obvioulsy not very happy with the whole situation so I told him I wasn't ready to pay for an ensuite if all we had was a bedroom with a broken shower and only cold water in the shared bathroom. He accepted to charge me only the price of a basic double bedroom. However, the next day, he told me that the 10% deposit I had paid online were not going to his hotel but to the website people so I had to pay the deposit once more to him. I am pretty sure this is a lie but couldn't find anything on the website clearly stating who the deposit is going to. I had to leave that day so I left my mum to deal with this problem and she eventually paid those 10% as well as the price of the rooms. And this is not the end! He then gave her another bedroom because she was now on her own. That bedroom was in a terrible state and there were even electric wires sticking out of the wall! She woke up at 7am because she was freezing (it was snowing outside). She tried to put the heater up but it wasn't working and when she asked the landlord about it, he said he was only putting the heater on between 8pm and 4am!!! Finally, my mum had enough and after paying him for that extra night, she managed to find another place to stay in.

One day, the room service hadn't left us towels, but the receptionist gave them immediately after informing him about it. We got a triple room instead of double one. Obviously, it has more space than the double room. The room was next to the stairs, therefore the noises were a bit too easy to hear through the door.

Was looking for economy, location, and convenience. So, I jumped on Hotels.com and did a search of the Kensington area of London and Kings hotel showed up with several others -- but Kings appeared better based on pictures, amenities, and price, so I booked it for 2 nights. The first night I arrived, I was told by the desk staff that there was a water leak that couldn't be fixed, so they took the liberty of moving me across the street to the Park Lodge Hotel -- no big deal to me, as I was just tired. Until I got checked in at the Park Lodge -- crummy room and see other review..... The next day the Kings Hotel got the water problem fixed and I packed up again and moved over to the Kings. On the booking website, it said they took credit cards, but the desk staff demanded cash payment only for the room..... Hmmm...... So, without many other options and a full shcedule, I paid in cash and checked in. Next problem was there was not an elevator/lift in this hotel and I was on the third floor with 2 heavy bags. I am not lazy and usually take the stairs, but on this day I really needed a lift. So, I hefted my bags up over 4 flights of narrow stairs in an old victorian hotel - into a narrower hall, then up a little spiral staircase to a narrow door I could barely fit through -- and I am thin. This was my room -- literally about 7 feet by 8 feet in dimension with a bathroom about 3 feet by 3 feet includnig shower! Problem here was that the hotel was advertised as having an elevator -- it did not! Also smelled very smoky and there was an ashtray in the room. The room had been vacuumed and the linens were fresh, but that's about all. My advice -- stay away from this one!

Over all, I had a pleasant stay, but a few things bothered me. It mainly concerns the way the hotel advertises. On several websites and in the information they send to travel agents, the hotel is said to be a 3-star hotel (although, in fairness, there are sites, where 2-stars are claimed), extensively renovated, offering continental breakfast with an option for English breakfast, also, it would host a Tapas Bar, the first one in England. None this is true however. It's certainly not three stars. It's two stars at best. So why advertise otherwise? It may just be a mistake, but they should update the information with travel agents. Extensive renovation. Strangely, I found some pictures of a room with bathroom, that seemed to be renovated. But when I stayed there with a group of 34 people, none of the rooms in which my group were staying had been renovated. One can only conclude that if indeed there ever was a renovation, it must have been carried out during the eighties, which doesn't count anymore. Especially not, as it wasn't done very well to begin with. A continental breakfast was available, however I wouldn't want to live on the continent where they serve that particular breakfast. If Europe is meant, which is probably is the case, then even by French or Italian standards it's very basic. However, that can be forgiven. One cannot expect much of continental breakfast. Unfortunately, their claim to also be able to provide an English breakfast, wasn't true at all. When requested, the reply was, that no chef was available in the morning and that we best try somewhere on Queensway. Their advertising must therefore have been erroneous, it should have said they provide you with suggestions for an English breakfast. The Tapas Bar was another feature of this hotel that puzzled me. I actually had a feeling as soon as I walked into the reception area, that tapas wouldn't be on the menu (let alone typical Spanish dishes) as the staff certainly didn't come from Spain, they came from India. So I wasn't surprised to find that the restaurant didn't serve paella, but curry. Now for me, I didn't come to the hotel to eat tapas. But why advertise with such feature if it isn't really there? Coming to the state of the rooms. As said, the rooms weren't renovated, but that doesn't say that they were terrible. Certainly, the quality and maintenance were poor, and could certainly use a renovation, but everything did function. Also, and I find that special in a hotel of this class, there were fresh towels every day. The biggest plus-point of the hotel however was its staff. They were extremely friendly and helpful. In conclusion, I have to say that the problem with this hotel isn't really the sort of accomodation it offers. It's the fact that it advertises itself as something it's not. I hope that in the future they can do something about this and maybe get the quality of the hotel up to the same standard as the level of friendliness of their staff. Then they would certainly be able to claim three stars. As it is, it's a basic two star hotel, in need of renovation, which advertises facilities it does not offer.", "Date": "September 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cNOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL\u201d", "Author": "laneyfAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR3675628", "Content": "This was the worst place we have ever stayed in.
