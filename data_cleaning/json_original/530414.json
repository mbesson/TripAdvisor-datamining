Here's why; easy back entrance to Tanger, easy access to the Landing, easy access out to the Branson Hills pkwy where Target, TJ maxx, Best Buy, Bed Bath and Beyond and many more stores are located, plus the IMax is located just up the street and easy to get to Silver Dollar City as well.

The breakfast was a normal hotel continental plus breakfast. IT was a much bigger room than most, but decorated a bit out dated. The room was clean but the beds were a bit firm and I like a firm bed. The sheets were clean but almost see through. I could have used an extra blanket. The a/c was the kind that cycles on and off, which kept waking me up. Our room was near the street which was a bit noisy early in the morning. I truly have no complaints and feel that we got what we paid for. We spent very little time in the room as we didn't come to sit, but to see the sites, so except for sleeping we were hardly ever there. There was a little trouble with parking because we were out later than everyone else so we had to park quite a ways from our room, but we are healthy and can walk, so not truly a problem.
