The number of other guests we overheard (not difficult when the only wifi is in the reception area) complaining to reception staff was appalling & each time the reception staff failed to satisfy the legimate concerns of patrons. Probably the most significant of these encounters was the guest who ripped into the reception staff (who by the way are the only staff) for supplying incorrect rooms following her request and payment for several rooms of the same quality all next to each other. She was given varying rooms of varying quality on several different floors. The staff had no explanation or solution. Another patron had accidentally double booked online after a credit card malfunction (which the staff understood and knew before her arrival) however they refused to refund the second room, which the guest clearly would not be using! Our basement room was reasonable but not brilliant however the once weekly cleaning (including rubbish disposal and replacement of things such as toilet rolls) was concerning. Perhaps most concerning however was the curious business of the luggage storage room.

The wall was badly marked by people moving the TV also. I addressed my situation with a receptionist who was happy to show me a different room, BUT was in the basement? This room was much bigger in size, which i wanted but the views, not so. I took the room and the receptionist was very laid back about the situation.

NOT a hotel!\u201d", "Author": "siCTR", "ReviewID": "UR123616657", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights in January. We knew at around \u00c2\u00a365 this was cheaper than a hotel and was well located. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a lot, but this place was still smaller than I imagined! We booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmedium suite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as the website gave the impression that it was larger than the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdouble luxury studio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and had a small seating area that included an armchair and a table. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that the medium suite is in a slightly longer room, but the only real difference is that in the double you sleep with the kitchenette parallel with you, whereas in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of feet further away. The pictures are an accurate representation of the rooms, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re photographed very cleverly in order to make them seem more spacious. Our apartment was in the main building at 8-18 Inverness Terrace. We were initially given a basement \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which was incredibly warm and people walking around above generated a lot of noise. It did not appear to match the website pictures as it was lacking the armchair and table. To be fair to the staff, they were very accommodating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we dealt with Arthur who tried to help out as much as possible. I initially thought I had wrongly been given a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdouble studio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rather than the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmedium suite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Arthur therefore gave me the keys to another room and invited me to inspect it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this room was on floor 4 at the top of the building. I then realised that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmedium suites\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are indeed small. However, this room had an armchair and table and was much cooler than the basement flat (although the downside is that it is more sensitive to noise coming from outside on the street!). We opted to go for the top floor room since the basement was too warm (even for January!). However, upon our return to reception Arthur noted that we still felt disappointed with the room and allowed us to instead stay in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcExecutive Luxury Suite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the top floor. We were very happy with this room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the kitchen and the bedroom were in separate areas, but the room was still essentially open-plan. The room also contained a small dining table with four seats. The kitchen area contained a sofa bed, but this room would be pretty cramped for four people. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to pay the full price for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcExecutive Luxury Suite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. My advice is that if you only intend to sleep and shower in your room then this is a fantastic location in London \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you might as well book the cheapest room and accept that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be living in a small area. If you want more space then book a hotel instead. Just to point out that aside from the kitchen equipment (plates/glasses, cutlery), the only things provided are towels, bed sheets, toilet roll and soap. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPower Shower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is pretty feeble and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a cheek to call it that. The bathroom is very small with not much room to move in the shower. The beds are fixed next to the wall, so if there are two of you then one is going to have to climb in and out of the bed at the bottom end rather than from the side. The ironing board tiny, although there is plenty of space in the wardrobe. If you go into this with your eyes open then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be happy.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExecutive?\u201d", "Author": "Ben W", "ReviewID": "UR123465935", "Content": "Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this property.

Positives: GREAT location - you're 30 feet from the Tube and seconds away from actual Hyde Park, which is amazing. Area is REAL London in that it's not a tourist death trap with people snapping pictures in front of you ever 5 seconds. The room was fully equipped for a weeks stay with shower full kitchen, and rear \"balcony\". Negatives: No \"front desk\" to speak of so if you needed anything you had to get it yourself, i.e. shampoo, toilet paper, towels, etc. Don't know if it has been fixed since but the elevator was out of service and lugging 3 pieces of luggage 3 flights of stairs is not much fun. Additionally, since there was no front desk, no one was there to help. The floor and walls seemed to be made out of paper because you hear everything, I mean everything. We literally thought there was someone tap dancing above us for about 4 hours every night. We Americans are used to huge rooms with all the frills but the UK is different. The bathroom is unimaginably tiny - I'm talking you can barely turn around while in the shower. The bed was atrocious - small and like sleeping on gravel. I can't stress how small the rooms were even though they look spacious in the pictures - THEY ARE SMALL. There is no maid service like at a hotel chain so make sure you're a clean person. Good luck making a phone call as there is a phone but no instructions as to how to use it - sounds silly but trust me, we tried for 10 minutes to make a call to no avail.

I had a look on the apartments' website. They are studio apartments. They appear larger on the website than they are in actuality. When we arrived. check-in was smooth, front desk staff helpful. Their helpfulness extended for our 4 night stay. We paid 89 GBP per night. The room was clean but I only learned by asking that housekeeping services work differently here. There is no daily cleaning of the room as in a regular hotel. The room is cleaned weekly if your stay exceeds a week. You can have daily fresh towel changes if you request at the front desk and items such as soap, toilet paper, shampoo etc are stored at the front desk and will be given to you if you need replenishing. You take the latter up yourself. Housekeeping will put the clean towels in your room for you. The room/apartment has kitchen sink, small fridge, microwave, cook -top, a few dishes, toaster and kettle. I liked the proximity to the tube stations, Bayswater and Queensway, Bayswater is also just about 6 stops away on a direct line from Victoria Station where one arrives with the Gatwick Express from Gatwick Airport assuming that is your arrival airport. I also liked the proximity within walking distance of the variety of good restaurants. Our room was on the 4th floor. Thankfully this allowed us to sleep with the window open, since there were 2 nights when it was reasonably warm and with only a fan it got a little uncomfortable. You have to pay a 20GBP deposit for a hairdryer if you wish to have one in the room. There is an iron and ironing board in the room. The free wifi is only in the lobby not in the room. Overall, I believe the apartment suited the purpose of our stay well. I would advise booking early as this place seems to fill up quite quickly.

The appartment is a room in fact with sink, fridge bathroom TV, M/wave all fine but very small and smelled of smoke (non smoking room). The worse thing was that we were in the basement (my colleague was 'upgraded' which seemed to mean she had 2 beds and her room was off street) It was an absolute maze in the basement and no sign posts to help find the rooms. It wasn't straightforward and very rabbit warren like. My room window was just below street level with steps down from the street to a sash window. It was a little unnerving by day but the night was horrendus. Gangs of men were congregating in the street drunk shouting, bottles smashing and what sounded like someone kicking a door throughout the night. I was too afraid to move or put a light on in case they realised someone was in the room and they came down the stairs to the window.

If you are going to spend a lot of your time in your room and want lovely surroundings, then don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay there. The rooms are generally small but clean and tidy. Unless you get a room which overlooks the street, you will probably have a view of other windows (some quite close). We got up early every day and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back until the evening so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to spend good money on pretty surroundings. Having read various reviews on here (before making our reservation) about noise, we slept (very soundly) with ear plugs! We initially had a room on the third floor overlooking the street which got all day sun. The room got so hot we couldn't sleep at night (there's no air conditioning in the building). That room was very small. We declined the offer of a fan and were moved to a much larger room on the ground floor (not the basement) which even had one chair! It had two windows, both of which looked into a stairwell with other windows very close but the temperature was much better. We found the staff to be helpful and polite but not what I would call friendly - more business-like (quite different to the staff we met when we stayed at the Premier Inns). Towels and linen are changed on request (weekly from memory, otherwise).", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nigeria", "Title": "\u201cLocation location\u201d", "Author": "ecimadh", "ReviewID": "UR112164708", "Content": "In short i would say that the location of the place is great , IT was 3 minutes walk to nearest tube but yes in central London you are never too far from a tube station.

I expected it to be small being in London but this was much smaller than I anticipated. I have stayed in Rome, Paris, and Venice all with bigger rooms than this one. My wife and I could not be in the bathroom at the same time because it was so small. We noticed no noise problems though. The staff barely spoke English, which is odd being in London and all. They did have an iron and ironing board in the room which was handy. It was close to two different underground stops, less than 5 mins walk to each (Bayswater on the Circle and District Line and Queensway on the Central Line). Nearby there was a Starbucks, a McDonalds, and several other cafes/restaurants and other various shops. Also a pretty good bar nearby, the Black Lion where they have Hoegaarden (my favorite beer) on tap. The last thing to mention which sort of infuriated me is that the hotel charged a 3% fee on using a credit card to pay for the room. Charging a fee to use a credit card? Get with the 21st century.

Some of the reviews made me worry, however on arrival I knew we'd made the right choice to book.

In the room I was a little shocked of the size of the room, not that it was to small by any means however we'd paid for the Superier because people had mentioned the rooms being small, however it didn't seem superier to us. In the description it said we'd have an arm chair and coffee table, so I assumed they'd give us the wrong room. We asked reception who confirmed that we did have a superier room, and that they'd put a arm chair and coffee table in the room soon!! However, the man arrived and could not fit the arm chair through the door....even if he did then Im sure it would have taken up all of the space. So we didn't get the chair, I presume either they didn't have any superier rooms left and so tried to pretent ours was or it was, which means the standard rooms must be tiny. It was only an extra \u00c2\u00a310 from standard to superier so we didn't mind to much. Who knows if we got the right room or not?? Anyway. The room was very clean, with a kitchen area, breakfast bar and two stools which we sat at to have a drink and chat. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom an ample size. It did get very warm through the night, however we just slept with the blanket off and were fine. I love going to London and would highly recommend these apartments to stay ,very good location.

Having said that it was \"only\" \u00c2\u00a370 a night, arguably a bargain in central London. It's probably the worst bed I've ever stayed in, and that includes years of backpacking in Asia and South America, and stays at the infamous mansions in Hong Kong. I've had a stiff back & shoulders the whole week. The bed is tiny as well in width but also in length (I'm only 5'11'' - it's not like I'm 6'4\"). What's described as a flat screen LCD TV is suspended over the bed like a CCTV camera and without a remote control. Insulation is really poor and I could hear my neighbours going to the toilets at 2am. Quite gross. There was an unpleasant smell coming from the bathroom (apart from that the bathroom was the best feature of the room). Surely calling it Apartments is the best excuse for the absence of reception and room service. The guy at check in was chatting to his mates during 2 minutes before he took notice of my presence. I had to produce a piece of ID upon check-in (luckily I'm French - the UK has no official ID). And I was appalled that I had to agree to a \u00c2\u00a3500 guarantee on my credit card.

First off, this place was advertised specifically as an apartment, and it was encouraging to walk to the front thinking it looks absolute class. Once opening the room, I felt entitled to expect a bit more than just a room with virtually no space to relax, the double bed taking up the large percentage of the room and nowhere to sit other than two fairly uncomfortable bar stools. The ironing board was a complete joke and almost unusable. There was no hairdryer available for the room and we had to specifically request it., which is unacceptable by the standard of most modern hotel rooms, let alone a supposedly serviced apartment. The wardrobe had three coathangers. The crockery amounted to a milk pan and a frying pan and the icing on the cake was when attempting to cook breakfast in the morning, the toaster managed to set off the smoke detector which is cleverly positioned adjacent to the hobs. We could also hear the smoke detector going off in other adjacent rooms too. The doors hardly close quietly so you can hear just about everything going on. A plasma TV was advertised, it was pinned in above the bed with the reality being analogue service with four channels not even corresponding to the remote control. Thank god we brought an I-Pod station. The room was not even serviced once and the towels/bedding were not changed once throughout the stay. The shower was barely enough to swing a cat in and the basin for the bathroom tiny. I will also add the lifts seem to take for ever to get from one floor to the next, and the corridors are about 60 degrees celsius so always have your window open and fans switched on. On the positive side, its brilliantly located for the tube stations and various amenities, but that's hardly a credit to the place itself. In my view they are quite fortunate to have other facilities in close proximity, without which this is something I couldn't even come close to recommending it. We may have got a much smaller room than others that may exist, and I'd recommend it only if you are utterly desperate just for somewhere to sleep and sleep only, but for the \u00c2\u00a3190 we paid for two nights, I'd want a bit more and advise that if that's the summit of what you want, try and find a hostel or similar.

Arriving Saturday afternoon, it was hot and we suffered through one night heat was our first impression of London and Hyde Park Apartment. The staff were great, personable, courteous and helped when they could. Our room was supposed to have a remote for the TV. When we inquired, the front desk person said someone must have taken it and he would have to buy one. Being on the weekend, we didn't pursue the matter but the remote didn't show up over our week stay. However, with only 3 channels available (not satellite - just basic cable), there really wasn't a need. We picked the smaller double room: double bed, large closet, small kitchenette and bath. The window over looked the street. For us, it was comfortable. We were prepared for smaller rooms coming from Canada. We also didn't have much luggage and was on a budget so the size was exactly what we expected. During the heatwave, if not for the fan we got on Monday, we would have switched rooms. There was a room across from ours that overlooked the alley. Not a great view but likely a little more quiet and more spacious. It was a double room, furniture was the same size but floor space was twice as wide. Two windows so you could keep the open at night and not hear the noise from the street. The bed was comfortable, although we slept on the duvet and used the extra large towels for bedding due to the heat. If not for the fan we got on Monday, I would have paid a little more and switched rooms for one facing the alley. The bathroom was a good size but the shower was quite small even for me. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m about 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21228 and bending down was difficult. Others have posted pictures and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evident. The doors have two locks. Great for us as the top bolt did not work properly and never did get fixed. Positives: Good location - 2 minutes from Hyde Park (beautiful), a block away from Queensway and Bayswater metro station, a block from all restaurants, grocery store and mall. Well stocked kitchenette - enough dishes & pots to make your own meals. But with so many good restaurants, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mostly heating up leftovers. Clean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when we arrived. Room service on the weekends only but extra towels and toiletries available if needed. Free Wi-Fi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c best down at the reception desk but we found our connection on the third floor good enough for web email and basic surfing. Perhaps because our room was directly over the front desk on the third floor. Not sure but saved the trouble of having to go down to the lobby. Washer + Dryer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coin operated available Elevator \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if on the upper floors and have luggage Negatives: Noisy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Inverness (street) has many other apartments/hotels/hostels and close to busy streets. On the weekends and most nights, hostel crowd/friends were up fairly late and loud. Would have been better if the window was closed but due to the heat we left the window open. Not too much street traffic though. Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little far from central London. But if you get a tourist pass, the tube will take you everywhere. Apartment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is not a hotel. So you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re room won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be cleaned daily, not safety deposit box, usually one staff on site, Access \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only one key per room. Not great if you want to do your own thing even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the two of you. The front entrance is locked all the time but at least there is someone at the front desk to let you in for most of the day.

Went through checkin with hiccup of not having photo ID despite having printed e mail confirmation of booking and living in the UK but as we had card used to make booking we were allowed to pay up front for three nights. Then told that only rooms left were on ground and lower ground floor, but \"thats probably for the best as it is hot\" Went down in lift to the room. which was pretty much as expected. The bathroom though small was clean and modern bathsheets and handtowels provided. 5 of the ceiling lights were not working which in a basement is unfortunate. so I raised the roller blind to survey the view. A small grey yard about 12 foot square with three other windows looking over it and two doors leading through it. If you raised the window and stuck your head out you and looked up about 20 feet above you could see a railing edging the street behind the property.....stunning. It also had the advantage that the two doors were used as a route between the adjoining houses so if the blind was raised people wandering through could wave at you. My husband asked to see another room and returned to say this one on the ground floor was further disadvanted by having the bed in an alcove so that to get in or out you had to climb over the end of the bed. Our room had one side free of the wall at least. So we settled for what we had. We manhandled the bed away from the wall it was on so that I didnt have to climb over him to get out of bed, and I sent him searching for a hairdryer as none were provided in the room. He returned with one from reception that had seen better days which I held onto for the three days as dripping up there everytime I wanted to dry my hair seemed ridiculous. After an excellent shower I dried my hair using the microwave door as a mirror as no mirror except in the bathroom. Obviously executives have no hair! Once we had got used to living underground we realised we were lucky as we didn't suffer the street noise that other rooms did and we could open our windows fully when we were in the room and awake, though we were not so keen to risk this at night with the access route running past. I took the mattress off and relocated the two slats that had come out and after the this the bed was quite comfortable though the mattress was a real cheapy. It was so hot when we stayed that I don't think anything but aircon would have worked though a fan might have been useful.

With luck the desk clerk was able to find one, but that was a strange oversight in the first place. Even more disturbing (along with such local idiosyncracies like the need to lock the door with the key after closing it -- at least nothing became unaccounted for...) was the loosely clanging door between this and the room next door, which of course did nothing to improve the already non-existent soundproofing between the rooms. The bathroom and room itself were spotless and with a more modern, Scandinavian touch, but with the temperature inside both also more akin to Swedish Lapland in autumn (without mosquitoes).

I wished that I had read the reviews prior to booking. We agree with many of the reviewers that this property has great potential. It's in a great location, it's clean, has laundry facilities, is affordable and is suitable for many categories of travellers. All of the effort put into the refurbishment of this property was wasted for the sake of those cheap matresses. After a couple of sleepless and uncomfortable nights on that bed we decided that we would warn others and maybe inform the owners that travellers expect a basic level of comfort - a foam matress would have been better.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cOk but NOT Executive.

The room was much smaller than we expected but was clean, bright with everything you need EXCEPT a safe, a hair dryer, good duvet and only 2 pillows for a double bed. It had thee worst bed I have ever slept in - incredibly thin with springs sticking into us all night! Hotel smelled of cigarette smoke. Service was friendly. Good bathroom and shower. Noisy building late into the night. This place is ok if you just need a crash pad and can handle sleeping on a cheap thin mattress. Queensway tube station is a couple of minutes walk away.

The staff are rude and infelxible and couldn't even get a phone message to us. The matress was so thin I laid awake at night counting the springs that were cutting into my vital organs. The shower was so small I had to step out of it to wash and then get back in to rinse. The kitchen had nothing you could really cook with, doing 2 packs of pasta from Tesco was a challenge. We booked here because we were returning from a long trip and wanted to stay in and cook for ourselves; what a mistake! We ended up spending even more eating out. Finally I should mention our window looked out over the ugliest block of flats I have ever seen which bloked out all natural light and the room was so hot and airless we ended up thinking London in midwinter was hotter than India. We have booked with lastmiute before and can highly recommend either of their \u00c2\u00a370ish secret hotels in Kensington.

It was short ( wouldn't be able to accomodate someone over about 5 ft 10 tall) and lumpy with springs sticking out from it. It was like they had spent so much money on kitting out the appartment but then got the matresses out of a skip. So becuase of that we wouldn't come back. At the end of the day you're buying a bed and if you can't sleep properly then it's not good value for money. Also no bedside lighting at all - you had to have bright ceiling lights on if you wanted to read - not very relaxing.
