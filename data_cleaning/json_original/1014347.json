First of all, the location is great, a block from the Four Seasons, 5 minute walk to Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi and Sultanahmet Tram stop. The street where the hotel is located is lively, safe and full of nice cafe and restaurants, no need to wander around finding food elsewhere. The hotel is a small hotel with 2-4 rooms each floor in the 5 floors building. Half of the rooms face the street in front while another half face the back street with less view. The roof top offers view of the Bosphorus. The room is large, the bedding is very comfortable with 5 pillows, small sofa, writing desk. The bathroom is large with tub and heating towel rack. There is also a balcony in some room. Sometimes the hotel can be a bit noisy when there are lots of kids running on the corridor but I think that happens everywhere. The service is impeccable, hard to beat. The staff are always the same face so after a few days of staying there, you feel like home. They are friendly, honest and helpful. The breakfast was great with a lot of variety and you can order hot egg dishes on top. The hamam is also great with extra service for massage but the best I had on this trip (of 12 days and did several hamam with extra service.) I would stay here again and again.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cExcelent\u201d", "Author": "marciapisani", "ReviewID": "UR125997468", "Content": "I am just coming back from this friendly hotel.

I literally looked at every 4 and 5 star hotel in Istanbul to figure out where we should stay for our vacation. We started on the premise that we wanted to be in Sultanahmet but realized that the only 5 star hotel in this area was the Four Seasons which I had stayed in previously and prices had tripled since the last time I stayed...We then looked at other 5 star properties but they seemd out of the way and not in the historical center. So we started looking at good 4 star and 3 star properties that were central, sound proof and had a hammam/sauna. We decided on this hotel due to its location away from the trains that run in this area and the trams that run further up, in fact the street this hotel is on is the perfect place between the tram and train tracks and we heard nothing. We were given a room on the top floor under the roof terrace, being March and cold no one was eating on the roof terrace but I read that breakfast can be served on the terrace during the summer months and this could be a real problem if you want to sleep in in the mornings. The room was a good size although there were no drawers to store clothes, just hangars. It was awkward to store your under shirts and socks etc. The bathroom was ok, standard. If you look at the photos of other members you will see that the bathroom has a window looking onto the bed area, there are blinds for privacy but I can tell you that the blinds don't really work... Our room had a great balcony with two chairs to hang out and look onto the Bosphorous, the view was amazing. If you turned away and looked in the other direction you had a view of the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. We walked to the two mosques, Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar from our hotel. It was a treat to walk by the Blue Mosque every day. We also walked down to take the train from the train station in Sultanahmet. Our rate included breakfast and it was sufficient although it was mainly eggs, cheeses, juice and bread. It got a little bit boring towards the end. The front desk staff did not all speak good English and one lady told us that it was a 15 minute walk to a specific metro station which ended up taking us about 1hour to walk (and we walk extremely fast) so that was disconcerting. As guidebooks and tripadvisor members advise, stay in Sultanahmet and stay here if you want to avoid the noise of the trams and trains and get good value for money.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tongariro", "Title": "\u201cLovely, small hotel in the centre of Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Tongariro", "ReviewID": "UR117323432", "Content": "Great hotel, with very friendly & helpful staff.

The staff were very friendly and helpful with our requests. The rooms were clean and comfortable and quite quiet given that the location (in Sultanahmet) was quite bustling, busy and noisy; our stay coincided with ANZAC day and the area was full of Australian and New Zealand tourists who kept the bars open until quite late in the night. However, we seemed very insulated from the noise given our rooms were on the fourth floor. I would recommend asking the hotel to book floors on the upper floors. I would also mention that the hotel had free WiFi throughout the hotel which we found very useful. We booked two suite rooms in April 2011 - our first trip to Istanbul. Six of us were travelling together (a family of four with two young children aged 4 and 8 and two grandparents), so we booked two executive rooms on the fourth floor of the building. One of our rooms was a suite with a separated lounge area which was useful for sleeping the children at night. The rooms were of good quality - although one of them was quite small, and the bathrooms were clean and well decorated. Breakfast was included in our price and was good with a wide variety of foods available - especially Turkish breakfast with vegetables and cold meat cuts. Cooked eggs were available on request. However, it was really a hot cooked breakfast buffet and the breakfast eating area was quite small. We were lucky in that we arrived early for breakfast every morning (our children woke up early every morning) so we didn't have any problems getting a table. But there were one or two other families during busy days who had to split themselves up over two or three tables. The location was perfect. The Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sofia and many other of the main tourist attractions were walking distance from the hotel. There are hundreds of places to eat near the hotel or a short walk away, and many places to shop and pick up carpets, souvenirs, pots, plates, lights, decorative items. You can also get to the Grand Bazaar quite easily within two tram stops or a short taxi ride away. The hotel staff were very helpful in guiding us around the city and especially in organising taxis from the hotel to make sure we didn't get ripped off. I would recommend this hotel to people travelling with families since the hotel has rooms that can accomodate families and there were several other families with children staying at the same time as us who all seemed happy with the accomodation. The staff were also very friendly. The only downsides were: one room was quite small although it was a 'suite' with a partitioned sitting area - and the partition was quite thin which meant that it didn't really isolate our children from the noise of the TV or our talking after putting them to sleep. The hotel was described as a four star but I would really call it a 3/4 star by European standards. In conclusion: a perfect hotel for families, great staff and very friendly, excellent location, but probably not a real '4-star' hotel.

The location is fabulous - it's on Akbiyik Caddesi, which is a street full of cafes, lovely restaurants offering street-side tables in summer, and boutique hotels. It's a five minute walk to Aya Sofya and the Blue Mosque, seven minutes to the Topkapi Saray, and just round the corner from the Arasta Bazar, which is a smaller, less frenzied, and less confusing version of the Grand Bazar, and no pressure from any of the shopkeepers. The waterfront is five minutes away by cab, and Taksim about 20 minutes away. The hotel is small - 16 rooms - but has all the conveniences you would expect, like an elevator, ground floor restaurant serving meals all day long, and even its own hammam and spa! The rooms are great - we had three rooms (401, 403 and 404) on the fourth floor - and are huge, particularly by Istanbul standards. The fittings and furnishings are of very high quality - super comfortable beds, sofas and sitting area, two desks, LCD TV mounted on the wall, room safe, minibar, etc. Perfect to come home to after a long day's sightseeing! Free wi-fi was a bonus, also there is a laptop guests can use, plus a printer downstairs. There's a beautiful rooftop on the fifth floor with views of the Marmara Sea on one side and the Blue Mosque on the other. By the way, some other reviewers had commented on the noise from the call to prayer. Our rooms faced the street, and we had no noise issues at all - the windows are double glazed, and the most we heard was a light murmur one night. Considering it's such a lively street, it was amazingly quiet. The hotel staff was so kind and caring - any requests we had were attended to promptly. The girl at the front desk even told us not to exchange money at the hotel as we could get a better rate outside! Whenever we took a taxi, they would come outside and give the address to the driver in Turkish, and one time when we were taking a cab back to the hotel and the driver was trying to overcharge us when we reached, she actually came outside and yelled at him, and voila! that was the end of his overcharging attempts! Breakfast every day was very good - huge selection of fruits, yogurt, cheeses and eggs cooked to order.

I would definately recommend the hotel but it is quite pricey. We got a deal online with ~25% off which helped. Probably worth it for the location and quiet rooms as the calls to prayer first thing in the morning can be quite loud.

Very clean property, the best location possible for people that want to go sightseeing, close to public transportation (which we found very convenient). The staff was really friendly, although most people do not understand or speak good English. Still that was not a problem, as there was another staff member that did. Price was really good, if you compare against likes. Nice touch: free use of really fast internet from a laptop next to the reception. I think there was free wifi in the rooms, too, but did not need it and am not sure. On the less positive side: this street can sometimes be very noisy. On Saturday evening between 9:30 and 11:30 there was a lot of noise coming from the street. We had our windows open but even when we closed them we could easily hear the noise. On the same evening, there was a 30min disturbence from the lobby of the hotel from people that had gathered there and were just speaking loud (no yelling), which for us being on the first floor could be heard as if the noise were coming just outside of our room door. This never happened again and may be it is not so often as the hotel is really small with only a handful of rooms. Speaking about size, the breakfast area was really small without this being necessarily a problem, but it is not suitable for people that lfancy taking breakfast in 1-1/2 hrs in order to relax. Last 2 things that I really found annoying: 1. The satellite english speaking channels (and at least half of the others) never worked while we were there. Despite the fact the staff tried to correct the problem (they changed sat receiver) the problem persisted. The excuse (and the message on ther screen) was there was no signal. At the same time, though, every morning at the break fast area BBC was playing spotlessly! When I asked, they told me it was a different satellite receiver from the one for the rooms! This till does not explain why there was no signal (as they claimed). 2. We asked the staff a few times about tips for eating out. Their only recommendations were those for which they apprently receive retrocessions - they would routinely pull a brochure from the stand on the reception desk and insist that was a very good choice. When we asked for a recommendation in the surrounding area of Sultanahmet during the first day (as we were too tired to walk for long) their only tip was the restaurant Best Western Acropol just scross the street! Mind you, there are probably 25-30 restaurants we counted during our stay in a radius of just 200-300 m away and at least 5 up to 50 (yes, fifty) meters from our hotel.

THE VIEW: our room window was about 2metres from another building, so we didnt get a nice view, they were doing some work in that building, but i was never disturbed by noise or anything. the call to prayer was beautiful, i would have loved to be able to hear it in our room, but never heard it. the view of the sea from the terrace upstairs was beautiful, they let me sit out there everyday just reading my book and didnt feel forced to order food! they even provided blankets when it was cold. the only thing i found lacking was that the gym was rather small and we didnt get a massage as planned as it was quite alot more expensive than in our local here. apart from that ten out of ten. many thanks from Kobita, Amina and Taneiya", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spain", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location & Recommended\u201d", "Author": "angelaboltons", "ReviewID": "UR36197855", "Content": "The hotel was fine , well equipped and clean. also has a very kind stuff..

The breakfast buffet is limited and poor. There is a very small range of breakfast cereals and fruit and some poor cold meat products that are really only suitable for feeding to the many cats in the area. There is a top floor open-air balcony but, unlike other hotels, this has no awnings or canopies and so is quite unusable in the hot afternoons.

The room we took was on the top floor with ample privacy and a cool breeze coming in from the east, off the shores of the Bosphorous; we also had our own little balcony. Our stay was made even more comfortable when the hotel offered to cordon off the hammam downstairs for us. We were supplied with bathrobes and towels and all other essentials, so all we had to do was take ourselves down there straight from our room!The hotel took great care in catering for our privacy, bringing in a female masseuse for me and a male masseur for my husband. We opted for a full hammam service, which included use of the showers and sauna, followed by a steam, scrub and massage. Both masseurs were highly professional made us feel very relaxed (especially the female masseuse, as I was pregnant at the time and she took a lot of care in making sure I was okay!) As for the food, I have to say it was the best food in the area of Sultanahmet. We tried a few other places but nothing else compared to what we epxerienced at our very own hotel. Our package came with a full breakfast option, which was great - we had the option of choosing from a range of hot and continental breakfasts, or making up our own (something the waiters and chef are very good at). We also had lunch and dinner there on a couple of occasions and each time the food was perfect. The staff were very helpful and made it a highly enjoyable experience.
