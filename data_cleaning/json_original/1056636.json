While I recognise the hotel bonaparte's rating is lower, there is no comparison, facilities here are brand new but everything is so small - 'cosy' is not a good description. There is nowhere to store luggage, you have to either be tiny or a contortionist to use the shower and there is very little space to use the writing desk. In addition there are few choices of tv channel and no phone in room, likely because there was no room for it. To give credit to the staff they were very plesant, helpful when needed and the hotel did offer a mobile to use with free local calls. Won't be revisiting by choice", "Date": "May 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR967736410", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "src33"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1056636-r22632750-Hotel_Bonaparte_by_Rhombus-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "1056636", "Price": "$107"}}
