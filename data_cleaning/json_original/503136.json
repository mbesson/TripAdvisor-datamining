It's very near all the major sights and in a superb area. After a day walking around Barcelona full of people it's nice to go back to a place that is quite and that looks good. My only complaint is breakfast for which I paid the package for the 3 days of my stay. The standard was somehow poor, not great variety and the food wasn't all ready when it was supposed to be. If you were one of the first ones in the restaurant you had to ask the waiter to asked for the food to be taken out of the kitchen or actually cooked (it was a buffet) and that was if you knew there were more attractive options. Not all the food was fresh so the standard wasn't uniform during all my stay, on the first day I had stale bread and the tortilla didn't seem that fresh. The staff is helpful and try to address your concerns and help you finding local information. Hopefully they can work on the food issue as I would love to go back there in my next visit.

The hotel staff also spoke English. I would have given the hotel a perfect rating but the construction next door is ongoing and it will be going on for awhile. The noise started around 8am but it was not a problem for us because we are early risers. There are many restaurants and cafes nearby. We did not do the hotel breakfast.

The Hotel is not far from Las Ramblas and the Square at Placa De Catalunya. It is very central and within walking distance of the major sights. It was very well decorated and very clean. The staff were very friendly and it was generally a nice hotel. The only problem I had was the room. It was on the 1st floor looking at a wall and was very dark - all day. That, however, was not the biggest problem with the room. The noise was far worse as when people were walking around next door or upstairs it sounded as though they were in our room and if someone flushed a toilet in another room you could hear it really loudly. Its for this reason alone that I only gave 3 Stars. It was not a cheap Hotel and I dont think a bit of soundproof is too much to ask for.

The d\u00e9cor is modern with pale walls and dark brown wood effect furniture. Our room (308) wasn\u2019t particularly large but was sufficient for our needs. It had a flat screen TV, comfortable bed, room safe, mini bar, balcony with chairs and a table (even if the view was somewhat lacking) and the usual storage options you\u2019d expect. The bathroom was also modern in design with a large shower and thee room was well maintained and spotlessly clean throughout. All in all the accommodation itself was very good. The staff on reception were friendly and helpful and there\u2019s free internet access available in the comfortable lobby area if you haven\u2019t taken your own laptop/tablet with you and need to get online. There were only a few small niggles none of which were substantial. Our room safe didn\u2019t lock initially but this was quickly sorted out by a member of staff. The mini bar in our room didn\u2019t actually keep anything cold although we don\u2019t use hotel mini bars anyway so this wasn\u2019t an issue but we reported it to reception on departure who were going to check it out. The BBC channel didn't work on TV but the free internet access meant we could check online if we really wanted to. The roof terrace bar wasn\u2019t open which was a pity as it was warm while we were staying and we would have liked to have utilised this facility. The building work which other reviewers have mentioned is continuing on the property next door. We stayed from Friday to Monday and while there was no building work at the weekend it started at around 7am on Monday morning. It wasn\u2019t a big deal for us as we are early risers but it was loud enough to wake us and could be an issue for guests staying during the week. Ultimately this is beyond the control of the hotel though. As far as location goes it\u2019s only three blocks from the nearest metro station. If you arrive by train from the airport (cheaper than a bus and much cheaper than a taxi) you use the same station but a different exit which is a further three blocks away on Passeig de Grazia. Even so it takes less than ten minutes to walk to the hotel with your luggage and it\u2019s not difficult. It takes about twenty minutes to walk to Sagrada Familia, about the same to the marina and sea front, about fifteen minutes to Casa Mila and about ten minutes to La Rambla. It\u2019s best to take the metro if you want to visit Park Guell or the Magic Fountains. The metro is quick and inexpensive and if you plan on using it regularly it\u2019s cheaper to use one of the multi-trip tickets such as the T-10 which works out at under \u20ac1 per journey. If you plan on visiting the Magic Fountains one evening be aware that they only operate on certain evenings which vary depending on the time of year. The Gaudi sights do get extremely busy so if you can get to them early you\u2019ll save yourself having to fight through the crowds. There is a supermarket a couple of streets away from the hotel if you need to pick up any bits and pieces. There is a tapas restaurant attached to the hotel (closed on Sunday) but having eaten there on our first night we weren\u2019t that impressed. There are a couple of other bars and restaurants in the same street but Barcelona has no shortage of eateries so you don\u2019t need to go far to expand your options. On the whole though I\u2019d recommend the Hotel Constanza and would certainly stay there again.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel!\u201d", "Author": "disdonc", "ReviewID": "UR126291272", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay here!

The rooms were large and clean, if a little dark (the minimalist decor can best be described as \"brown\"). The sofa was uninspiringly placed near the bathroom with the only view, other than the bathroom door, being the wardrobe (you couldn't see the telly from the sofa). We didn't have a bath, only a shower. But the shower was great! The bed in the suite was actually two single beds. I knew this when I booked but I had expected them to be made into a large double - instead they were left, and made, as two seperate beds pushed together. Kind of killed the romance. On the second night that we stayed, we asked if we could change to a double room (with a double bed). They said this would be ok but that we'd still be charged the full cost of a suite. When we asked why the beds couldn't be made into a double they told us that it was because the suites were usually taken by groups of three, who used the sofa as a third bed. Huh? We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, as we found a good value cafe a couple of streets away. The hotel's bar/cafe, called 'Bruc 33', did reasonably good tapas at reasonable prices. Around the corner is the restaurant \"Casa Calvet\", set in a building designed by Gaudi, which I heartily recommend for a fantastic meal in a memorable setting. The hotel staff were, on the whole, polite and professional although they did ignore my request on the booking form to be given a suite at the back of the hotel (which I had read were supposed to be the best). In a nutshell, the hotel is fine and offers reasonable value.

I was a little concerned re the noise mentioned by other guests on Trip Adviser, but after emailing him about this, he put us in a room away from the construction work. I can honestly say though, we didn't hear any noise for the duration, wherever we were in the hotel.

I commented how quiet it was - until we opened the balcony doors and copped the morning traffic, but certainly not a problem, just funny! The only bed cover was the one in the website photos. It was made of a slippery satin type fabric, which stayed on the bed for about 5 mins once you were in it. I asked at reception for a blanket as it was late September and not sure how the a/c was going to be during the night. They gave me a blanket the size of a knee rug, made of very rough fabric, so small, I asked for 2. The next day, the housekeeping changed the 2 small ones for one large one (same rough synthetic fabric) which barely covered the bed. The satin one spent most of the night on the floor again, the small size blanket wanted to join it. Wifi was only in the reception area, which was a bit of a hassle.

While I do tend to be a princess about my hotels, I decided to do this trip on the cheap. We're used to spending on average $400.00 per night on a hotel room, we got the Junior Suite for $150.00 per night. Honestly, that worried me a bit, but the reviews on TA were solid, so we took the risk. Room was nicely appointed, and quite spacious for Europe. Nice shower and decor is simple and clean. Really, the only difference between this hotel experience and our experience at other, more expensive hotels comes down to the details... After check in, we were pointed toward the elevators, and made our way to our room (no bellman to take the baggage). This isn't a problem to us, but it is different. The room was made up every day, but there was no turndown service (again, something that I find to actually be a tad bit annoying in the more expensive hotels, I never seem to have any privacy, there's always housekeeping knocking on the door trying to feed me chocolate). There was no WiFi in the room, but there was a cable connection for my laptop, and there was no extra charge for this (actually, a welcome difference from the hotels we are used to). No room service, but we never use that anyway except to get a bucket of ice from time to time. They did, however provide us with ice buckets when we asked, as there is a kitchen on site for breakfast, etc. The two twin's made up into a king were incredibly firm mattresses. It didn't bother my husband, but I was popping Tylenol like candy the entire trip. If you like firm mattresses, you'll love it, it you're like me, you may very well be in hell. I don't fault the hotel for this, as I've had overly firm mattresses in more expensive accommodations as well, so I can't blame this on the cheaper rate. Ooh, here's one weird thing though. When you leave the room, and take out your key (which switches off the lights, tv, etc.) it actually turns off the thermostat! So, every time we came back to our room it was freezing cold. Good news is that the heat is really effective, so it was warm in about 10 minutes. Front desk staff were helpful in suggesting restaurants, Hakim, especially went out of his way to come up with ideas for non-Tapas restaurants for us after we were Tapased out in three nights. They also took care of faxing our passports to the car rental company when I screwed up and forgot to bring them along when we picked up the car. Overall, I've got to say, that for a savings of $250.00 per night over what I'm used to spending, this place was a steal. Really, all I care about is the quality and cleanliness of the room, and this room was quite comparable with the hotels that I'm used to.

After reading the reviews I was prepared for the noise problems mentioned by other reviewers and had brought earplugs to sleep with, and a cable to get internet access from my room. My friend borrowed a cable from the reception. We stayed in two single rooms. Both rooms were on the first floor facing a tiny interior yard/shaft. This is a common solution in Barcelona but may disappoint visitors who are used to daylight and a view to other than a grey wall. We appreciated being able to turn off the aircon at night and sleeping with the window ajar. The rooms were small but well laid out. Their decor is stylish-on-a-budget. The bathroom even had a small bath tub. We had requested quiet rooms and our rooms at least had no noise from outside the hotel. But as mentioned earlier there is a lot of noise around the clock from people passing through the tileclad hallways, inadverently slamming doors that haven't been soundproofed and chairs being moved about in the surrounding rooms. Upon arrival one of the rooms didn't have any toiletpaper and the instrucions for the safe were missing. After the instrucions were given it was discovered that the safe couldn't be locked with a personal code. This was fixed later, but meant that there was no place to store valuables the first day. The other room was ok but it's safe was difficult to lock requiring up to 20 attemps before locking. We stayed for 2 nights and during the stay I had to have my keycard reconfigured twice because it failed to unlock the door to the room. Staff was very accommodating when these problems occurred, but they are clearly let down by faulty and unstable technical solutions. I tried the breakfast buffet. It was ok and a good choice if you don\u2019t mwant to start the day roaming the streets searching for a place outside the hotel . The hotels breakfast is served in a rather uninspiring windowless room. To sum up: I recommend the hotel because it is very well located, the staff is helpful, and the rooms are ideal for visitors who spend most of their time away from the hotel and don\u2019t need much space. It is also smoke-free. WORD OF ADVICE TO HOTEL MANAGEMENT: it takes very little to improve the user experience of the hotel. The noise problem encountered by so many guests can easily, cheaply and swiftly be solved by mounting feltpads under the legs of all the chairs and other moveable pieces of furniture, and by mounting transperant adhestive pvc bumpers (gotas protectoras) on the doors of the rooms, wardrobes, the fronts of the minibar-fridges and on the drawers of the night tables. Alternatively you can fit the rooms with carpets, but that is a costly solution and personally I appreciate and prefer tiled hotelroom floors that are easy to keep clean, don't become smelly over time, and better for guests suffering from allergies and asthma. Also provide free wireless internet access in the rooms. And opt for stable technical solutions when purchasing systems for locking the doors to the rooms, safes etc.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, New South Wales", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "JoVee", "ReviewID": "UR94025631", "Content": "I booked my accommodation based on previous trip advisor comments and was not disappointed.

If you are staying during the Summer and want to enjoy the sea view/sunshine in your room then it may not be the best option; if your priority is more to explore the city, then it's a perfect place. Room: The Single Room was very small, but such is the case with any other hotels, not unique to Constanza. Though small and no view (window was facing the inside of the building), it was very clean, no dust, and comfortable with nice firm bed and good bedding. Bathroom also very clean and comfortable to use. I'm fussy with bathrooms, and the bathtub didn't look quite clean/new enough to take a bath in, but it was more than sufficient to take a nice hot shower with good water pressure. Rooms equipped with fridges. Free wi-fi in the lobby area only but I had signals in my room and was able to use them. Staff: There were some comments in the past reviews about unfriendly staff but my experience couldn't have been more different. I interacted with 3-4 different staff during my stay and everyone was very friendly, helpful, spoke good English, and offered great help with directions / making reservations, etc. Noise: Again this was mentioned as negative in the past, but I didn't have any problem during my stay despite near-full occupancy. The doors and walls were thin so I can imagine the noise becoming an annoying issue if there are rowdy stag-weekend type of group staying in the hotel. That's just bad luck, and at this price range the noise issue would be the same anywhere else unless you are staying in 4-5 star hotels. Area: Very central location and walking distance to most tourist attractions yet on a quiet street so no noise from outside. I am a female single traveler but felt perfectly safe walking back from Passeig de Grancia / Las Rambla area (taking the main street detour) in the 11PM hours. Easy to find the way from Plaza Catalunya (around the corner from Casa Calvet); I took the Airport Bus and it took me about 10-15mns with a big suitcase.

We have very mixed reviews on this hotel for a number of reasons. Being the type of people who research in depth before travelling anywhere new, I was surprised that some of the good & bad comments we read all seemed to miss several key issues. Alas, I hope you find this review as helpful as some of our other reviews which people have commented on. (Apologies for the length of this review, but like others we\u2019ve posted, we want to give everyone the full picture.) We booked with the hotel directly \u2013 having read some horrific tales about pre-booking various hotels via alternative websites. Having the knowledge of research behind us, we were not expecting to be awestruck as we arrived (it\u2019s not the usual type of hotel we\u2019d stay in) \u2013 and sadly, our expectations proved right. Check-in, to be fair was quite unprofessional. The staff were very nice but we had phoned and emailed the hotel 3 times in the week prior to travelling (and also at the time of booking) to specifically request a 5th floor room (furthest away from traffic noises) and we were assured that either a 4th or 5th floor room would be made available. Following check-in, we were handed a swipe-key for a room on the 2nd floor. Honest mistake, but when we discussed our previous correspondence regarding a 5th floor request, we were met with the usual shifting of shoulders, eyes to heaven and made to feel a little awkward. We were told a 5th floor room would not be ready until at least 3pm. Not a perfect start to our break. Not exactly living up to the big sign they have on their reception desk either claiming 4\u00bd stars on Trip Advisor. The Suite: The first thing you notice on entry is the overwhelming smell of a disinfectant aerosol. I\u2019m all for a nice smelling clean room \u2013 but not to the point of tasting the stuff on the back of my throat. If the room is cleaned properly, is there really a need for a spray? The room itself was a nice size, but in saying that \u2013 no great shakes and not overly comfortable. It may be a 4-star hotel, but in our opinion it\u2019s more likely on the wrong end of that spectrum and much closer to a 3-star rather than pushing the boundaries for a 5-star commendation. It also suffers quite badly from noise pollution coming from adjacent rooms, be it other guests or just the cleaning staff each morning dragging furniture around. (Aside from the Conrad Maldives - you think that one hotel somewhere in the world would have resolved this problem by now by soundproofing the walls/ceilings? Bedroom: There was some mould on the ceiling/walls in the bedroom and although this was minimal \u2013 it\u2019s still not something you should be subjected to in a 4-star hotel. In addition (and although we knew this before booking) not one single suite in the hotel comes with a double, queen or king size bed? All suites are twin (i.e. two single beds about a foot apart.) Not ideal when turning in the middle of the night and falling between the gap! Beds were a little hard and dead and resulted in quite a sore back each morning. Lounge area of the suite consisted of a plain 2-seater couch looking at a set of wardrobes \u2013 O, and a light. Lighting: If you need total darkness (to a reasonable extent) to go asleep, forget it. Yes, they provide black-out curtains, but that kind of defeats the purpose when there are (a) 2 x low light green LED lights flashing continuously in the ceiling at the end of your bed \u2013 with no way to turn them off and (b) 1 x emergency exit white light above the entry/exit door. This normally wouldn\u2019t be a problem in a suite, but they have no doors to separate the lounge area and the bedroom, so the light streamed in. Not exactly a very bright light, but when your eyes adjust to the darkness, it feels like a lighthouse. We asked reception to check out the flashing LED\u2019s only to be met with Manuel from Fawlty Towers \u2013 \u2018no-speak-a-de-English\u2019! Bathroom: The towels \u2013 I didn\u2019t know you could fray towels so badly and still use them in a 4-star hotel? Completely unacceptable! No toilet roll on the 2nd day either? Unforgivable. The shower takes a while to get hot and magically, it still drips for 5 minutes even after you\u2019ve turned it off? No usual notice in the bathroom either about changing towels by leaving them on the floor etc. so you can only assume it is the same policy as other hotels you may have frequented previously. Room service: What room service? The only hotel I have ever stayed in to date where there is no relevant information usually left on a table by the TV. No idea on the room service number to call, or the room service opening hours or available menus? I\u2019ve stayed in 3-star hotels with much better room service. When we eventually got through, we were told we could have a selection of bread or a salmon bagel. Hmmmm, does that make you salivate or what? When we queried if they were our only options, we were told \u2018yes\u2019. Obviously we skipped. Air Con: Other reviews are also accurate with their description of the in-room AC. Can anyone tell me the point in having AC in a room (occupied and paid for by adults) when we\u2019re treated like infants and not allowed to adjust it to our own individual needs? The room was like an oven (even in October) and with no AC we could only open the balcony doors and entertain the noise of street traffic for a few minutes. Internet: The free in-room internet is wired, but is fine. Forget about the Wi-Fi in the lobby area \u2013 it\u2019s slower than old fashioned dial-up and keeps losing signal strength every few minutes (even when no one else was using the Wi-Fi.) Hotel in General: The location of the hotel is perfect in our opinion. Other reviews are accurate \u2013 it is about 7-10 minutes casual walk away from Plaza Catalunya \u2013 close enough to everything without the incessant traffic, noise, people, etc. If you prefer a more centrally located hotel on the doorstep of everything, then you\u2019ll have to put up with a lot of noise and a lot of weird folk, beggars, homeless, pickpockets, etc. At night, the neighbourhood is fairly quiet and in a decent area \u2013 so no need to worry about weirdo\u2019s following you. Breakfast: The breakfast is ok for \u20ac10 PP (even if the cereal choice is pathetic and the fruit is unripe) but the most annoying thing is that it appears to be perfectly ok for the hotel cleaning staff to pick from the buffet laid on for the hotel guests! They may not sit down in the same area, but they pick from it and on two mornings it resembled something like \u2018feeding time at the Zoo\u2019. Consequently, we were left with very little choice for our breakfast one morning. The staff also seem perfectly happy to stand at the buffet counter and shout, not talk to each other (like Spanish do) for 10-20 minutes at a time. Not exactly what you need first thing in the morning when a little groggy. It\u2019s all just very unprofessional really. The catering staff also began to clear the buffet \u2013 even when hotel guests were still eating breakfast. I witnessed two hotel guests asking for items that were cleared away and my wife also had to ask where the croissants had suddenly gone? Sorry, that was the second most annoying thing. The most annoying thing without question is that the hotel shares the breakfast area with a caf\u00e9/restaurant next door \u2013 using a sliding door to divide the two. Aside from the huge noise pollution generated from next door, everyone smokes profusely, so 20 minutes after showering and getting dressed for breakfast, we now smelled like ash trays and had to shower and dress again \u2013 never mind breathing in passive smoke and the dangers associated with that! Completely and unbelievably unacceptable. My advice is to go somewhere else, or get to breakfast early so that you\u2019re finished long before 10am. By the 2nd day we choose not to go back. Reception: Sit in the reception area for a few minutes in the morning and you can see cleaning staff and other staff \u2018running\u2019 around the floor at top speed. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my life in any hotel I\u2019ve stayed in. As my wife perfectly summed it up: \u201cThe hotel is not quite the worst ever, but none of the staff are professionally trained to any degree.\u201d As you will know from other reviews, there is no swimming pool in the hotel, so definitely not a place to stay in the peak summer months or if you just like a swim in general. The roof-top bar appears to be a complete afterthought by management also. It was still open in October (surprise, surprise) but it is - without question the worst roof top bar I have ever witnessed in my life. There\u2019s more ambience in a mortuary. Ironically, we knew (most of) what was in store for us when staying in this hotel \u2013 it\u2019s just from writing this review that we suddenly realise what we were actually subjected to during our stay. Maybe it was the fact that we were literally using it for a hub to put our heads somewhere at night, or maybe it was the magic of Barcelona City that counteracted any negativity? The hotel is ideally located and very clean, but sadly that is really where the positivity ends. On this occasion, we were not interested in swimming or using a roof top bar, but room service would have been nice - especially when you\u2019ve spent all day running around a huge and brilliant city and all you want to do is kick back and relax.

It was on the 4th floor at the front of the building, but the soundproofing on the balcony door left a lot to be desired. In my unscientific estimation, I would say that it blocked out no more than 70 of outside noise, so you would continuously hear the drone of vehicles going up and down Gran Via Corts Catalanes... and the police sirens on that street sounded like they were just outside on the balcony! To compound matters further, the maids' store room was right next door, so I was awoken early on a couple of mornings by their comings and goings.

This hotel was a terrific find. We dilligently researched our hotel options and the Constanza offered the best balance of price, quality, and location. We couldn't be happier with our decision. Rooms: The Constanza is small, boutique hotel with modern, yet comfortable, furnishings. Be sure and ask for a room with a balcony facing the street. Since we were out enjoying Barcelona most of the time, we were only in our room to sleep and shower-up before heading out at night. The beds were comfy and shower was wonderful. We have no complaints whatsoever about our room. Location: The Constanza is located on a quite side street, so street noise (apparently a problem at some Barcelona hotels) was not an issue. The hotel is in a great location just north of Barri Gothic. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to Placa Catalyuna/Las Ramblas, and 10 minutes to El Born. The location was terrific and the short walk was never an issue. There are pleny to cafes close to the Constanza for breakfast/coffee. No matter which direction we headed in the morining, we always seemed to pass a nice spot for breakfast on the way -- a nice perk. Cabs are plentiful, but the only time we used a cab was late at night, when the 10 minute walk after a day of sight seeing (and night of drinks) wasnt' worth it. A quick cab home to the Constanz from Barri Gothic or El Born was never more than 8 euro. Price: The price was outstanding. Weeknights were 90 euro and weekends 120 euro.

The room's door did not lock (seriously, when trying to leave we closed the door behind us and it would just push open). The shower drain was clogged and drained slowly (nothing like taking a shower in standing water). The bathroom sink began draining directly on the floor. One morning there was no hot water (nothing like a cold shower in the morning). If you're staying more than one day, don't expect your room to be cleaned until late (3:00, 2:30, 3:15). So much for a siesta. No need to set an alarm clock (construction begins promptly at 8:00 a.m.).

We're a young couple in our twenties and value for money is everything to us! After doing extensive research it seemed that this hotel was our best option for around \u20ac100 a night. Infact, several hotels charging much more than this had a lot worse reviews - Hotel Constanza was something like 22nd out of 500+ hotels in Barcelona when I checked this site - and very reasonably priced. I used the hotel's online booking system - we planned 5 nights in Barcelona over the New Year so I expected some increase in the normal price. I was pleasantly suprised - each night was \u20ac100 for a double suite, and it went up to \u20ac130 for NYE and NYD - very reasonable in my opinion. Our room was a lovely double suite, done up in minimalistic colours and furniture. The beds were comfy and clean, we had a balcony looking to the back of the hotel, and a spotless bathroom. I can't really think of anything to fault the hotel room-wise. One small niggle for me personally was that the room was quite dark, they had spotlights in the ceiling which made it very romantic, but quite dark when you need to do your hair/make up!

I contacted the property directly in the summer (via email in Spanish) and they told me that the low rate was due to renovations of the hotel - renovations that would be done in September. My stay was for November so no concern there. The hotel is well-located. Just a few blocks from the Passeig de Gracia and Plaza Catalunya. It's not a block or two away, but rather 4 or five city blocks so if being a stone's throw away (walking-distance-wise) from the center of action is important to you then this might not be the place for you. The hotel met all expectations. The rooms were super modern and minimalist - in a sense almost too minimalist as there wasn't even an alarm clock in the room. For the base price of 90 euros (base price for a standard double), I had a large terrace with chairs and a table overlooking the back of the hotel. The back does not face a street rather other people's/other buildings \"backyards\". Breakfast ticked all the boxes and was in a sleek, if not small room adjacent to their cafe - the latter which is accessible to the public. (They have a clever sliding door which separates the cafe from the breakfast room for hotel guests.) I imagine that later in the day the divider retracts in to the wall and the entire space is usable for the cafe open to the public. My only quip was that upon returning to the room for a bit after the midafternoon meal, the door was propped open. While I use the in-room safe for valuables such as passports and extra cash, I nonetheless typically put out the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign as I prefer the cleaning people not to enter the room as (1) I typically don't make much mess and (2) for security reasons. However, the cleaning people not only disregarded the \"do not disturb\" sign, but while they were cleaning they apparently used the deadbolt to leave the door propped open and then neglected to come by when they finished to close it. It was a bit unsettling to return to the room to find the door propped open. Luckily nothing was stolen, but I did go down to the front desk to comment to the staff (in Spanish). Seems the cleaning people were in the process of finishing for the day so the desk manager went with me to talk to them before they left. They admitted they went in despite the \"do not disturb sign\" being on the door as well as leaving the door open. The cleaning staff apologized as well as the desk staff. They hotel didn't do anything above and beyond that, but frankly I was just grateful that all was well, so no harm no foul.

Well we knew that there is a renovation on going in the hotel and that is somehow taken in concideration in room rates, but still the noise coming from the construction during business hours was unbearable. It was literarely like living in a major construction site. So sleeping late was impossible even with earplugs and spending timed during the afternoon in the hotel room was not really pleasant.

I can really recommend this hotel as a great base to explore Barcelona. Overall the staff are friendly and very helpful and the rooms lovely. Note: When we stayed they were re-developing most of the hotel which meant there was no restaurant/bar or breakfast offered, but the hotel offered an excellant rate to compensate for this. We were advised that we would not experience any noise and as we stayed over a weekend we did not expect any, however around 10am on Saturday morning some building work could be heard, however Sunday was very peaceful. LOOK & FEEL The hotel is set in a building that was built in the late 1800's, and has a very modern and stylish interior. This can come across as cold if your taste's are not for the very modern!. ENTRANCE & RECEPTION The entrance is of a quite street in the Eixample district, with large windows to the front and a large lobby area heading to the back of the building. As mentioned above the hotel has a very modern interior but is very stylish, and we were greeted by friendly and efficient staff on the front desk before being shown to our room. BAR & RESTAURANT As mentioned before, the bar and restuarant were shut for re-development during our stay, so I can not comment on the facilities. For breakfast you can use the local cafe's or the local supermarket near-by (turn right out of the hotel and go down one block before turning left) BEDROOM The bedroom was modern, clean and quite spacious. The hotel offers a variety of bedrooms, ours was the front with a small balcony (not big enough to sit on though). At the back I think there are bedrooms with a terrace. The bedroom had a double bed made of two single's (which is the norm for this hotel, ask for a double and they will make the two singles into a double for you). The bed was large and comfortable. The room had Air-Con (although the minimum temperature was 17c), a TV with all the usual spanish and a couple of english speaking channels (BBC World etc..), a minibar, desk and chair. Minibar prices were quite average for this class of hotel. Internet access was available, but I did not use this, instead as I needed to book some tickets, reception allowed me to use there computer and printer free of charge. BATHROOM The bathroom contained a bath and shower in one, although the bath was rather small, the shower was good with excellant pressure and plenty of hot water. Usual supplies of a combined shampoo and shower gel were provided and were of a good quality. The hairdryer was in the bathroom and actually worked (my wife's normal complaint! considering she has long hair) Towels were ok (my usual complaint) if a bit on the small side again! LOCATION Ideal for visiting the Gaudi designed buildings of Casa Batllo and the Sagrada Familia. The hotel is located in the Eixample district near a whole street of Tapa's bar's. Also you can walk from here to the Old town and Las Ramblas PARKING Not used so not sure if the hotel offers parking.

First, the location: in a quiet street within 20 minutes' walk of half the tourist attractions, on bus routes taking you everywhere else, and only 10 minutes walk from the bus station for the airport at Gerona. Secondly, the comfort: we had an apartment on the top floor with a kitchen and a terrace - flooded with light, quiet at night, and lots of room to stretch in. Thirdly, the value for money: we paid 150 euros for the room - which may sound a lot, but by Barcelona standards is very reasonable for an apartment. Most important of all, the staff were unbelievably helpful to us when we were robbed on the first day of our stay. A sneak-thief stole my wife's bag in the Citadella park. We lost all our keys, our credit cards, our passports, our driving licences, and all our cash except for the euros 23 I had in my pocket. I've never felt so vulnerable in my life: in a foreign city, with no papers to cross the border or get on a plane, and not even the money to buy a meal, on a Saturday afternoon when every consulate and bank is shut. We had to report the loss to the Spanish police; we had to cancel our four credit cards; we had to get a friend (and subsequently our bank) to send us money through Western Union; we had to get emergency passports out of the French and British consulates when they opened on the Monday; we had to re-arrange the whole of our holiday, cancelling hotel reservations left right and centre; we had to make arrangements for a locksmith to meet us after we got back to Paris, to break into our flat; we had to do all this in something approaching a state of shock - and we had to keep on doing it, as it dragged on for day after day. To give you just two examples of the kind of problems we ran into. We nearly had to go straight home, abandoning our holiday, after the first Western Union branch we went to refused to give us the 5,000 euros my bank wired to them, because the bank omitted my middle name - a name I haven't used since birth, except to get a passport. Again, we had to re-arrange the whole of our holiday after Europcar refused to let me have me the car I'd reserved, because all I could produce was an emergency driving licence from the French consulate and not a full licence. Throughout the whole of this ordeal the staff at the reception at the Constanza could not have been kinder. Nothing was too much trouble. They phoned for us, they faxed for us, they looked things up on the web, they gave us excellent advice. Giselle contacted our other hotels for us, more than once; Alberto found us a train running from a station ten minutes' walk away (Passag dei Greicia) to a tiny station deep in the countryside about 5 or 6 kilometres from our next hotel near the monastery at Poblet; and Rheda - most marvellous of all - got a friend, the owner of a second Western Union branch, to let us have the money we needed to continue our holiday. And that was only the tip of an iceberg of help. I really can't express my gratitude to them. They rescued us from disaster. We realised - too late - that thefts from tourists have become a major industry in Barcelona. They have a special police station (in Plaza del Catalunya) entirely devoted to taking statements from tourists who have been robbed - the queues can be very long at peak periods; and when we got to the British and the French consulates we found half a dozen officials dealing with entire waiting-rooms full of victims with much more frightening stories to tell than ours. We never saw the thief who stole our bag; they were attacked. In one case the thieves ripped an elderly Irish lady's bag from her in the hall of the airport; in another the thieves punctured the tire of a car while the driver and his wife were in a restaurant; then they followed them on the motorway, and when they stopped in the emergency lane, they came up to them and offered to 'help' - the help consisting of stealing the wife's bag from the back seat. We also heard of false police-cars pulling cars over on the motorway, only to rob them. Highway robbery is alive and well on autoroutes in Catalunya - and the police seem quite unable to do anything about it. So: I'm not sure we'll go back to Barcelona, even if (in the end) we heard Rolando Villazon and Nathlie Dessayes sing Massenet's Manon at the Liceu, and we got to see the monastery at Poblet, something I've wanted to do for thirty years. But if we do go, you'll see why we will stay at the Constanza.", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cClean, contemporary, great location and nice staff\u201d", "Author": "Migratory", "ReviewID": "UR8277486", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Constanza for 2 nights in July.

We had a suite and could not be happier. The rooms in Europe are very small so the suite was worth the extra space, especially if you have large luggage. Included was a desk and mirror which doubled as a vanity table. We followed other TA advice and ate elsewhere for breakfast. Some had complained of noises in reviews but we must have been lucky, we never had any noise problems, except for water running. Plus: Staff extremely friendly, very helpful. We wanted to go see the Monsterrat w/o paying the tour fees and giving up our whole day, the staff went out of their way to help us they found out we could take train + railway there directly and for so much cheaper ( 12.60 Euros pp RT) ride took 1 hour one way. Safe area, close by to everything but far from noise. Room was very clean. Cons: No internet unless you have laptop, but internet around the corner at a copy center ( 24 hours during weekdays) its $1 EURO for each half hour and 0.50 for the card. So 2.50 Eu for 1hour. Bed was comfortable, we had a queen but it really was 2 twins put together so you could feel the divider a little bit. Shower had half door which is normal over there. No english channel on TV, CNN international was not working. Spanish music channel was not working either, no clock or radio inside room. Hints: Bring your own converter + transformer hotel had converter but staff didn't know which one to use. Bring hotel address with you to give to taxi, we had no issues but was told by frontdesk there is another Hotel Constanza in Barcelona not related to this one so taxi have been getting guests to the wrong hotel. Grocery store nearby if its closed there's a large one on Las Ramblas (Carrefour) Buy your water and candy as gifts here. Tiny minibar ,we had large water and rearrranged the fridge to fit it in and no one gave us problems. We recommend the Tourist bus where you can get on and off, its 23 Eu pp for 2 days we thought it was well worth it. Just keep track of the last bus. It was still light out at 8pm so its easy to lose track of time. It includes a coupon book which helps. Must do: Ride the funicular de Montjuic amazing view of city/coastline use coupon in booklet.

For those who don't know, The Golden Girls (all 61 years young) are my mum, and aunties Wendy and Dianne. I'm just the PA! Booking Booking the Constanza for the girls was easy. When I originally wrote, I received a reply immediately informing me that the Constanza would be undergoing a face lift and would not be available for my requested dates. I carried on looking at other hotels but it was hard to forget the Constanza as it had been my favourite from day one all those months ago in November 2006. At the beginning of 2007, out of the blue, I received an email from the Constanza with the good news that they would be able to accommodate the Girls! Yippee! From then on it was just a case of getting the right room. We had read, on TA, about an apartment style room with a kitchenette but we were not sure if it would be big enough for 3 adults. I received helpful emails from Mariana, Samuel and Alberto. Mam even made a phonecall to Samuel to pass on her card details (I don't like emailing credit card details) and to enquire about the kitchenette room 605. I emailed again just before their departure date to let the hotel know their ETA at the hotel only to be reassured by the hotel that they were waiting for the Girls and that I need not worry. Taxi I had asked the hotel about booking a taxi to pick them up from the airport (as we had done in Roma), but they kindly informed me that it would be quicker and cheaper just to get an airport taxi. They did this and it seemed to be the best option. A 20 minute ride costing 20 euros (they left 25 euros to include a tip) found them outside the hotel with ease! Staff They wheeled into reception and were given a warm welcome. They took the lift to their room. They struggled with the safe at first but then a phonecall down to reception sent help on the way. Mum said that there was usually just one person in reception so any calls away from the desk resulted in the front door being locked, for safety I suppose. So don't panic if you get there and the main front door is locked. Someone will be with you soon! All the staff were computer literate. Maps were quickly printed out as well as restaurant reviews and directions. Mum forgot to ask the name of the 'breakfast lady', she was very helpful and would make tea if requested, however, the coffee was good with a very adequate continental breakfast. Breakfast Coffee, hot milk, tea, fresh orange juice, tropical juice, hot chocolate. If in doubt, ask! Cereals, fresh fruit, cheeses, meats, tomatoes, fresh bread and cut bread for toast, chocolate cake, croissants and chocolate croissants, egg frittata. Room The room was big enough for three adults. They had a roof top balcony with table and 2 chairs and a stool, no bird poo! There was no street noise at the back of the hotel. The black out blinds are a brilliant and very thoughtful idea. The beds were comfy and wide. The third bed was just as comfy but a bit lower. They just heard the people next door going out in the morning, no ear-plugs needed. Rooms cleaned everyday, and given fresh towels daily too. Very good decor throughout Kitchenette was clean and handy. There was no kettle (use a pan) but a stove top neapolitan coffee maker. A fridge (also with minibar), 2 hot plates and a microwave! 2 of everything else, glasses, cups etc Location Excellent. Easy walking to Placa Catalunya, the hub of all things. They even made their own way to Monserrat for 19 euro! Value for money 180 euro for the room per night + I booked a 6 euro breakfast for 3 adults 5 mornings + 7% tax = great value! Eating Just ask the staff for suggestions. Plenty of tapas bars around and nice Thai rest at the top of the block. They liked Origens 99.9 the best. The one beside the gorgeous Basilica de Santa Maria del Mar. Well, I think I've overheated the keyboard! The Girls would love to go back to the Constanza.

Therefore, I felt compelled to post my review of the Hotel Constanza after my three day visit, which ended on April 2nd, 2007. The pluses: The hotel is in a good, convenient, quiet location. It's two blocks up from the Urquinoana metro stop and not too far from the passeig de Gracia metro stop. In about ten minutes, you could walk to the Plaza de Catalunya and begin your stroll down Las Ramblas (although I recommend the El Born district for cool restaurants, good atmosphere, and beautiful women). I was travelling solo but opted to stay in a suite, which is basically a normal hotel room in the US. Comfortable beds, internet access (not wireless, you need a cable), very clean and modern rooms, cold, marble floors. Even if you stay on the street the external noise factor is minimal, as this area of the lower Eixample is pretty quiet. Nice botique restaurants are all around should you not want to travel far for a meal or glass of wine. The breakfast (6 Euros) is basic: yogurt, cereal, pastries, coffee, OJ (no eggs or hot foods). Service is very cordial and helpful. The vibe here is couples, 30's & 40's, doing their thing, coming back for a good night sleep. The minuses: Not many, but there's one major: Bring ear plugs to sleep (or keep them from your flight). The modern hotel theme, with marble/concrete floors means every room is a theatre for the entire floor. I can hear every word of my neighbors soft-spoken conversation, every door closed, toilet flushed, etc. and I knew they could hear me. My neighbors were pretty quiet, but I could imagine if Mr. and Mrs. Loud Talker checked in. I doubt you'll have to worry about the late night return of the party crew at this hotel, but that would be worse. There are probably better places to stay (like on Rambla de Catalunya above Via de les Corts), but I have to give this hotel its props.

There are just a few inconveniences. You DO need to bring your own toiletries as the one provided by the hotel is quite substandard, there's no room slipper and you actually hear fragments of your neighbors conversation but this is easily solved with a pair of earplugs. All in all, this is a great little hotel which delivers everything as it promises. A real value for money and difinitely more than a two stars hotel. p.s we had a meal at Casa Calvet, the restaurant housed in one of Gaudi's building on Casp street and had to say that it wasn't worth it as the food was just ok but the price steep. Our best meals were tapas at Cerveria Catalana on 236 Mallorca street and of course, the famed Cal Pep (you really, really have to be there like 15 mins before it opens). The Thai Sabai Sabai restaurant which locates just around the corner from the hotel on Gran Via de Catalanes street is excellent and serves Thai food that tastes lke we eat in Thailand, trust us, we are Thai.", "Date": "December 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dortmund, Germany", "Title": "\u201cQuiet!!\u201d", "Author": "Export_Sales_Manager", "ReviewID": "UR6339034", "Content": "I recommend this hotel, if you need a simple, clean, freindly hotel.

My room, 104, faces the elevator, despite my request for a quiet room away from the elevator & noise, can hear everyone's footsteps coming in & out of the hotel, especially at 2 am in the morning. If you're single, request room 111, which is on the other side of the floor, hence less foot traffic.

Nice patio area too - but these are only with the suites i think.

The Constanza has an ideal location, near the intersection of Passeig de Gracia and Gran Via. This puts you within walking distance of the Barri Gotic, Born, and Eixample. We are big walkers, so we also trekked to the Sagrada Famila and the beach. The room was very nicely appointed and spacious; we had a sixth floor efficiency with an outside terrace. We also enjoyed the breakfast buffet at a reasonable 6 euros a head. This is not a full-service hotel with a restaurant, room service, concierge and name-brand toiletries.

Not mentioning all those little bonuses - the private terrace, the WiFi in the room which works like a clock , the air-conditioning which was so good that it made me forget about the horrible heat outside, the cool zen touches here and there, the decent breakfast ... all that at a very reasonable price.
