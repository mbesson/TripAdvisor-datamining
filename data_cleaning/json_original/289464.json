{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not really in Barcelona We found this 4 star hotel in Barcelona on a website called Hotelopia. Our plan was to fly into Barcelona and stay somewhere in the city, then make an international fight the next morning. When I called to get directions, the hotel clerk informed me that the hotel was about 30 kilometers out of town. I called the website to see about cancelling, but was told I would have to forfeit the money I had paid. We rode three trains to get there (thank goodness I speak Spanish). The hotel was very clean, but Spartan. The restaurant wasn't open. The town was an ugly industrial town in the middle of nowhere. We were hesitant to take trains to the airport the next day for fear of missing our fight so we took a cab. 60 Euros!!!", "Date": "Mar 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR862383193", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "SpanishNana"}, {"Content": "Not quite up to AC quality Stayed at the AC Martorell for 2 nights in October. Used it as a base for exploring areas outside of Barcelona (Tarragona, Montblanc, monasteries of Poblet and Santa Creus). We stayed at several AC hotels during our trip to Spain and found this one was not quite as good as the others. It was in a particularly ugly industrial area of town. Despite being in an industrial location there was only expensive and inconvenient parking in the hotel parking lot in an adjacent street. The air conditioning had been turned off as it was judged that October was the start of winter (despite the actual weather, which was quite warm) but luckily we had one of the quieter rooms on an inner courtyard so could keep the window open all night. Looked forward to free coffee and minibar and pastries as at all AC's but the coffee machine was broken. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.", "Date": "Nov 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR475248832", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mirey"}, {"Content": "Unvarying from the AC-Hotels standard, but very good As in other AC-Hotels, little does not mean less or inferior services.Good room with wooden floor and marble bathroom with a huge shower.Good breakfast and the mytical free coffee shop, where you can relax and enjoy all day long (from 11am to 7pm) snacks, beverages etc. for free.Barcelona is not properly a short stroll away and it can take up to 40 minutes by car to get to the center of the capital of Catalunya, but the rates are very attractive in comparison with the downtown's: for the price of an ugly motel you can have a full-service and enjoyable hotel (stayed there on August 23rd and payed 60Eur for a double room bb).", "Date": "Aug 25, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR247854994", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LucaRuggiero"}, {"Content": "Very good hotel The hotel was great and it has been open for only a few months. The room was very good, big, clean, confortable and decorated in a modern functional style. They have a free minibar in every floor hall with water and fruit. They also have a free coffee shop in the lounge with coffee, tea, cookies and drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic. The staff was very friendly. I strongly recomend this hotel. The only drawback is that this hotel is situated 30 Km away from Barcelona which mean you have to drive by car to Barcelona.", "Date": "Jan 20, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR602780372", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Bien Mais ...   showReview(19649844, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR335805915", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "gerne wieder   showReview(16601435, 'full');", "Date": "May 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR874139574", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "genial   showReview(13200108, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR421216851", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "super hotel in etwas komischer gegend...   showReview(11415017, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR486329915", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "la perfection!   showReview(11387960, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR175969770", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Buen hotel   showReview(6178598, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR580387328", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "markbcn"}, {"Content": "Sehr ruhiges Business Hotel   showReview(11359829, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR782415607", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Buon hotel anche se manca di qualcosa   showReview(11359828, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR336390206", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "30km de Barcelone   showReview(11359339, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR232628913", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Buona sistemazione per la Catalogna   showReview(11336583, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR150628563", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d289464-r7172310-AC_Martorell-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "289464", "Price": "$122"}}
