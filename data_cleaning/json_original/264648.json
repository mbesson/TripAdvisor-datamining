It's a 5 minute walk straight up the road to the metro station in Bologna which is 3 stops (4 or 5 minutes!) from Rome Termini Central Station and only 5 stops from the Colosseum. Breakfast is on the top floor and by European standards was very good. There's hot drinks, fruit juices, plenty of soft croissants and filled pastries fresh from the bakery, fresh bread and rolls, hams, cheese, fruit, yogurts, cereal and muesli, a little toaster etc. All the reception staff were really helpful, polite and friendly. The room itself was quite small, but big enough for 2 people only needing a clean place to sleep at the end of a busy day. The bathroom was big with complimentary bath products but if you're after a bath or shower it's worth noting that if everyone else in the hotel has beat you to it, there'll be no hot water left! The room had a mini bar that is very good value for money once you have experienced the cost of stopping at any of the bars and cafes littering the streets of Rome! We stayed for 3 nights and found ourselves eating at the local Chinese on the nearest roundabout to the hotel. It was the only restaurant we could find where we didn't feel we were being robbed of our Euros! For 2 big 660ml beers, 2 starters, 2 mains and a portion of rice and a portion of noodles we paid 23 euros. Compare that with our first night when we went into a cafe a stones throw away and paid 25 euros for a couple of slices of pizza, 1 potato croquet, a mouthful of peppers, one small beer and one very small fruit juice. No contest! We'd definitely stay here again, it was great value for money in a great place which made it easy to get to everything we wanted to see quickly! Word to the wise though - Rome has no efficient queueing system in place for any of the sites, it's literally a free for all, sometimes involving 100s if not 1000s of people. We first encountered this at the Colosseum and I just couldn't believe what i was seeing. It was simply a case of standing 5 or 6 abreast and shoving your way forward into any available gap and I got fed up of giving evil glances to the people who simply drifted into the side of queues because they didn't want to start at the back. If you intend to visit the Vatican museums DEFINITELY book your tickets online before you go. You don't have to stand in the 2 to 3 hour queue if you do this. You are given a time slot to turn up at and you can smugly walk past all the people to the front of the line which in our case, went around 3 sides of the Vatican! It cost 4 euros per person extra to book online, but it's the best 4 euros I ever spent!!", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cshort trip but excellent\u201d", "Author": "shirin r", "ReviewID": "UR124632367", "Content": "I and my friend were in this hotel from 5 to 10 february.everything such as location,staff,breakfast,room servise....was very well.I hope visit rome again.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "saltash", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a long weekend\u201d", "Author": "SaltashOggie", "ReviewID": "UR124578703", "Content": "My wife and I were amongst a party of 14 that stayed in this hotel for a long weekend in mid February.

You need to go to Bologna metro then walk down the road it's about 10/15 minute walk up the road you pass come to a 2nd round about from the hotel.

The country it's self is great metro to colleseum is worth it watch the soldiers if they offer to take photos as after then then ask you for 20euros as we learned!

Room is nicely presented. With wines water cokes etc nuts,chocolate, crisps there. And a honest price list. We seemed to drink a lot yet our bill was only 9.00 euro during a 3 night stay you have to pay Rome tax per person 3.00 euro per night - I think that's standard in rome. It is near a lot of food joints so perfect if you wanted it for wine & dining. The porter is so polite. Ummm can't think of anything bad we slept well room was lovely and clean really warm.

The staff at the reception was more than friendly with us; they even checked us in 2 hours in advance! The room was cozy, clean and with all the facilities (even some sport equipments in the wardrobe) and the bathroom more than what I was expecting from a hotel in Rome. The room also had a small balcony with street view. Furthermore, the location is not unsafe, nor noisy. In fact the area at Piazza Bologna is cramped with students (it is more like a university area, or something). The breakfast was served on the roof garden; although it had heating it was a little bit cold up there, but it was January after all! They had a wide variety of cereals, fruits, yoghurts. Pastry items such as doughnuts and croissants were also available and so were cheese and ham, together with gem, chocolate, honey, etc. They had all you needed for a good breakfast. Finally, the location was not bad at all, a 7 minute stroll from the metro line. As it turned out the metro was the most convenient way of traveling through Rome and it comes really frequently.

Let me first say, the room was air conditioned, spacious and clean. The hotel is not in the centre of Rome (Termini) but about 3 stops away. The metro (subway) is a couple blocks away which is about a 5 min walk. The metro (subway) in Rome is very easy to navigate. Some revieweras complained about the location but I think their gripe is unfounded. We left in mornings to the attactions returned in the late afternoon, freshened up and return to the city centre for dinner. So the distance from the city centre isn't really and issue. It may be 10 minutes back to Termini once you leave the from door of the hotel. Again, location isn't an issue. The rooms were always cleaned when we returned. The minibar was of course stocked with overpriced warm beverages. It kept everthing slightly below room temperature. They decided to make the minibar look pretty but render it useless. My other problem was with the bathroom. It was very spacious (almost the size of a Paris hotel room) but the shower was the size of a postage stamp. A complete waste of space. But they do provide oversized bath towels that was welcomed. The front desk staff were very helpful and pleasant. Five stars! I gave them a list of restaurants that I wanted to vist (from foodie blogs) and asked them to make reservations for me during my stay and they pleasantly made the arrangements. I also asked for directions to some of my restaurants and they printed out the google map and the directions. Breakfast was included and had a small variety of things to eat. It seemed to be your typical European continental breakfast. Bread, pastries, cereal, yogurt, coffee, juice... Don't Europeans eat hot breakfasts? But it was free, so I don't think I can complain. They offered soy milk upon request which was great, I have a milk allergy and I enjoyed the having the option of being able to have cereal for breakfast. All in all, the hotel was worth what we paid.

So to make it special we went to Rome. I did all the usual pre trip research - looked for a 4 star hotel near the city centre and one that could add Italian flavour to our stay. I wanted it to be special. All my research pointed me to Hotel Delle Province - and I have to say TripAdvisor is partly responsible for my disatrous choice...read on So here is the resume of the \"Promise and The Reality\" PHOTOS ; The Promise ; A plush hotel with a welcoming exterior, spacious bedrooms and a beautiful garden breakfast room. The Reality ; The photos were taken when the place had just been built or refurbished and we took the very best angled shots we could to make it look nice. I have some to submit soon of the reality look ! RECEPTION The Promise ; A warm Italian welcome for your important stay with us The Reality ; \"Do I really have to check you in\" .......give me your passports and come back for them later. Your room is 109. When you complain about your room - do it when Im not on and my colleague will go through the routine of ignoring you with a smile. THE ROOM The Promise ; A lovely spacious room with nice furnishings The Reality ; A pokey little room with furniture that did not even match and was looking very tired. Net curtains that hadnt been washed for years masked our view of errmm...scruffy flats with so many aerials on top I couldnt count. The Saving Grace ...hooray - that is if you want to stay in the bathroom for your entire trip. The bathroom was lovely and the shower likewise. Here, I must also say that the room maid did a sterling job keeping it clean and excellently serviced. Pity she is not made the manager ! THE GARDEN ROOF TERRACE The Promise .......its so quaint - look at the lovely pictures !! The Reality - a huge metal door that would be better served on a walk in safe is the gateway to ......a slum ! Drab horrid tablecloths, a mouldy grotty canopy overhead and - well - errm no garden at all really - just rough concrete shelving . Great view of the graffiti smattered walls of the local area tho !! THE BREAKFAST The Promise - A lovely buffet breakfast with excellent service The Reality - A buffet with plentiful supply presented like a market stall - oh and a vending machine for your drinks. 4 star hotel with vending machine for breakfast drinks - pure class. Would have been even marginally ok if the water for the tea was hot - but IT WASNT !! After trying twice - we went for breakfast at a nice nearby cafe instead. HOTEL IN GENERAL The Promise - An Elegant and comfortable hotel centrally located. The Reality - A scruffy hotel with carpets that would best suit the area around the bar where the drinks are spilt. Oh that is - not our bar because we dont have one !! Centrally located if you mean as far east of the city as is possible !! RESUME ......If you haver booked in here - change it whilst you can. If you havent - Dont !! If you do - dont say I didnt try and help you not to If you get there despite all of this - ask NOT to have room 109 Only the valiant efforts of the room maid made me click anything higher than a 1 !!", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cBEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK\u201d", "Author": "DeDe_DM", "ReviewID": "UR82592676", "Content": "The hotel wasnt located in the city center, but it was a short walk to the metro.

We booked a deal through expedia and stayed in Rome for 3 nights. It probably worked out at 200euros/night. Negatives: 1) Location: even though 500m from Bologna metro, Rome's metro is not great. Only 2 lines for central Rome. Walking to the main eating areas takes 20-30mins which is not a bad thing in itself as Rome really is a great city to walk through, however this meant that it took 1 hr to get to any decent lively area for a meal in a Piazza (Navone for example) from the hotel. The Metro also closes at 11.30pm on weekdays and 12.30 am weekends- not convenient if relying on the metro rather than taxis. Staying close to the sights/piazzas/bars would avoid this although probably more expensive. Our next time in Rome will definitely be in touristy-Rome to avoid this problem 2) Service/Breakfast: served on the 6th floor with decent district views. Be warned, standard breakfast only with minimal choice beyond cereal. The bread baskets were not topped up past 10am and everything was whisked away and shut down at 10.29 and 59 seconds. No leeway there. Almost felt like bootcamp. 3) Rooms: tv only had free Italian channels. No CNN or BBC available. Pay-per-view Sky available. We stayed on the ground floor near the back terrace and we had to have the curtains drawn all the time due to passing foot traffic as the windows faced the main corridor. Room was old and tired. Ventilation didn't work in the bathroom. 4) Why 3 star? No room service, restaurant. Ironing not allowed in rooms. They wanted to charge 5euro per garment initially but then reduced it to 4euro per garment. Still a ripoff seeing as they disallowed ironing. Also see points 2 and 3. Advantages: 1) Reception service was warm and friendly. 2) Taxi service to airport at 45 euros definitely worth it. Not only do you avoid the crazy Rome crowds but the route includes driving past the Colosseum and a Pyramid built by an egocentric bureaucrat. Advice for Rome in general: 1) at the airport (FCO) do not listen to the locals. Take the express into Termini (and not the all stops, jam-packed, hot, long and painful line to Tiburtina). Spend the 11euro/person cf. 5.50 euro/person 2)Sistine Chapel is closed on Sundays except for the last Sunday of the month 3) Frommer's guidebook is not detailed enough 4)buy the Romapass for 23euros which allows free use of the public transport system (not the trains from the airport however) and free entry into 2 exhibits.

It took us three attempts before elbows came into play and we successfully managed to get onto the third bus that came along (and there was a wait of 40mins between each bus). We managed to find our way to the hotel four hours later, through the pouring rain and after doing plenty of running around. It was a good way of engaging with the locals and I'm glad that we did this. Most people we asked for help from didn't speak any English but they tried to assist nevertheless. I was pleased with the locals. The authorities are a different breed, they spoke English but couldn't be bothered to help. The Hotel staff speak very good English so we didn't have any language issues and found them to be very friendly. I thought staff member Omar was the most helpful and friendliest. Our room and bathroom were clean and well made up. Air con didn't work so well but I didn't make an issue about it.

This was a nice touch and I had completely forgotten that I had mentioned this in my booking. I just wanted them to wish her a happy birthday so the bowl of fruit was a nice touch. The hotel is in a bit of a grotty location and as somebody else has mentioned it can look a bit miserable after dark when all shutters are down.

An Irish bar across the road but I only popped in there for a quick drink. Seemed okay. The Hotel is 500m from nearest metro station (Bologna) which is a bit of a walk up a hill.

We wanted a suite so we could put our baby daughter to bed in the seperate bedroom at her usual time of 8pm and this would leave us peace in the living area to relax. Upon entering the room we discovered that the living area and sleeping area were all the same room, so were very disappointed. I went down to reception to say that it was a suite we had booked, only to be informed that it was the suite we were given. So be warned anyone that expects a suite to mean seperate bedroom and living area. The room however was of a good size and in good condition as was the bathroom. There was also an exercise bike in the corner, which we were able to make good use of as a clothes peg. Another downside was that to me this is more a large guest house than a hotel as there is no bar or restaurant in the building. However there is a breakfast area on the 6th floor with a nice view. The breakfast was a buffet of cereals, croissants, cold meats, bread and various juices. All of which were tasty and set us up for a days sightseeing. The hotel was indeed about 400 metres from the nearest underground station which meant it was relatively easy to reach various parts of Rome. As we didnt know how to get to the hotel from the main train station (Termini), we decided to get a taxi and this cost us 15 Euro. I would advise people purchase the BIG ticket for travelling around Rome, costing 4 Euros per day (also option to purchase 3 day ticket for 11 Euro) and which enables you to travel all day on the underground or the buses. There are very few restaurants near the hotel, but instead a lot of small shops selling pizza slices which seemed to be all luke warm.

There are so many of them and they are so expensive. How does one choose? Well after an exhaustive search I found the Hotel delle Province. This hotel was built in 2002 so there's no need to worry about damp rooms or a dilapidated building. Other reviews complain about the star rating of this hotel. I can't say that I am very knowledgeable about the distinctions between star-ratings but I found this hotel really lovely. The pictures on the website are very true-to-life and represent the hotel well. The breakfast room was really nice and they served a large and varied breakfast until late in the morning (7:30-10:30) so it was still possible to have a sleep-in. This hotel is well-located near the Bologna metro-stop which is less than 10 minutes walk and the metro is quite cheap. Day tickets cost 4 euro and a tourist ticket for 3 days costs around 11 euro. The hotel is on a well-populated street so there are no worries walking back there at night and I didn't have any problems with noise although I was not staying on the street-side of the hotel. The advantage of staying a little bit outside the city centre is that the restaurants and cafes are not too expensive. My cousin stayed in the centre of Rome a few weeks before me and she found if very expensive to eat near her hotel in the city centre. There is a restaurant and a pub directly across the road from the Hotel delle Province so you don't need to go far if you don't want to. I stayed there in December and the rooms were quite inexpensive. It cost 238 euro for 4 nights although I realise that this price varies depending on the time of the year that you go to Rome. The staff there were very friendly and helpful.

The hotel is not located in a central tourist location, which is kind of nice. It is 2 stops on the subway from the Colesium / ruins section of Rome. The disadvantage to the location is that it's pretty inconvenient to go back to your hotel in the middle of the day if you want to take a break. Other than that, it's fine. About a 10 Euro taxi ride from the main train station. The hotel is a pretty standard hotel - rooms were clean. Our room had kind of a funky smell to it, nothing horrible but kind of noticeable. After a couple minutes we were used to it. The bathrooms are nice and clean - large showers. Breakfast was nice - pretty standard Italian hotel breakfast: toast, tea, juices, fruit, etc. The subway stop is about a 10 minute walk (maybe slightly less) from the hotel. It's the easiest way to get to the places you want to go. Overall, this hotel is fine - I just thought it was a bit overpriced for what it is. Someone else wrote in a review that it should be a 3-star hotel, not 4-stars. I absolutely agree with that. Quick tip for dinner in Rome: There is a great section of Rome with bars and restaurants right off the Piazza Novona (close to the Pantheon). Great small places, local feel, good food. The Piazza itself is pretty touristy - but this section is just a block or two west of the Piazza. This is nowhere near the Hotel delle Province hotel, but worth mentioning.", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cLoved the hotel\u201d", "Author": "wordtraveller35", "ReviewID": "UR8471230", "Content": "We were orginally surpose to stay at the Jolly Midas hotel.

The next morning, I was well looked after by the hotel staff, who provided me with a packed breakfast, as I had to depart before the hotel breakfast session started. The person who had just come on duty when I came downstairs for my bus was most concerned because he thought I would miss breakfast, and was rushing off to get me a packed breakfast when I told him I had one already.

MInuses- Rates far too high for quality of accommodation. Rooftop room with view only open for breakfast 7-10am!!! A very small room with no window and damp on 2 walls. No bar or restaurant, only a lobby at the front door for guests waiting for a taxi etc. No good eateries nearby-fine if you can live on carry out pizza or pasta for your stay. Reception staff dismissive. Enquiries met with disinterest. Too far from the centre running up bills for taxis-we did try the metro and buses a few times but the bus line is not very salubrious for foreigners and we were warned about pickpockets which made us a bit nervous..... Food generally poor and far too expensive. We booked a guidebook recommended restaurant near the via del corso-oh dear -50gbp for a terrible meal Trattorias where we expected home made goodies, not much better. Pluses House staff excellent-cleaner and waitress in breakfast room kindly and warm Rome is the most wonderful city in the world.

We found it quite difficult to initially find the hotel.

The porter that was sent to us to show us to our room, did not even offer to carry our luggage. Topped off by the fact he could speak very few words in English which was very difficult to communicate with him. However, the room and bathroom was very clean and contained all the neccessities in it that made the stay pleasant. The breakfast provided however, was an average continental breakfast. This was not complimented with the waitresses very rude, abrupt and arogant attitude. Which had by this time swayed our oppinion of the hotel completely. The one good thing that sticks out the most about this hotel was, when we had mastered the different bus routes and how to make the varous connections. We found the hotel to be very central indeed.
