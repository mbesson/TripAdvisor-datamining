About a week before our check-in date we received a welcoming email from the hotel's concierge desk. They asked if we had any special requests. I took the opportunity to ask for a high floor room with a view toward Disney in order to watch their fireworks. I received a note back stating that we would get a room as requested. Check-in was a breeze with uber-friendly staff and we did indeed get a room on the 10th floor (Room 1061) overlooking the pool area with a great view of EPCOT for the evening fireworks. Yes, they do charge a resort fee, but we got a discount for being Platinum members. The lobby is beautifully decorated with live plants and flowers (as are the gardens surrounding the entire property), waterfalls, and a live parrot. The resort fee covers wi-fi and wired internet service, the pool area, the fitness center, all kinds of non-motorized boats at the lake, a small family-friendly golf area, and self-parking. Our room was absolutely gorgeous with upscale amenities (different than what you get at a Hyatt Place), very comfortable king size bed, a small couch, desk, flat screen tv, coffee service, and a large bathroom with a large glass-enclosed shower with a rainshower head. All the staff throughout the property were friendly and always greeted us. We did not eat at any of the restaurants on the property. Breakfast each morning was at a nearby Dunkin Donuts that was an easy walk (all on sidewalk). Would highly recommend the nearby Joe's Crab Shack for the best crab legs around.

Let me start off by saying their is nothing \"sneaky\" about the way the hotel charges you. We had some questions about the resort fees etc. and not only did a sales manager email me the breakdown, he also called my to follow up, just ask, they are happy to help! I also had a lot of help from the front desk. I prepaid for our trip back in Feb, and they were very patient while I called my bank to let the transaction go thru. The resort is GORGEOUS! Check in was a breeze, and we got complimentary champagne, as well as buckets and shovels for the kids. We got into our room 2 hrs early. We requested a higher up room, and not only got the 16th floor, but a pool view, which we did not pay the extra for! A couple hours after we arrived I received a gift basket with milk and cookies, coldcuts, and beach goodies, with a lovely card as their \"BEST\" facebook fan! That's how much they pay attention to their guest! All the staff was so super friendly! Front desk, concierge, housekeeping, bellhops..without being the least bit pushy. The housekeepers even made a pint of arranging my daughters dolls in different spots while we were out. Rooms were immaculate. Beds were comfy. Loved the toiletries! Asked for an extra lotion, and they gave me 3! Pool is the most amazing pool I have ever seen! There are 3 total pools. A quiet pool, a big pool, and a smaller pool. The smallest one is heated, so we used it mostly. There is a small slide that my youngest loved. The big pool has a big slide, and is so much fun! My kids also loved the bridge! There are caverns that you can swim under, and several hot tubs. We had no problem finding chairs, there are hundreds of lounge chairs, I have no idea why people complained about that. The property is so pretty to walk thru! I took tons of pictures of just the palm trees and flowers! The walking trails along the lakes are very nice as well. We did not do any of the water activities because our kids were too young, but they looked like fun! They had planned activites for kids during the day, as well as campfires on certain evenings. Beach is not suitable for swimming, buy my kids loved to play in the sand. There were alot of conferences going on, but I did not think that interfered with our stay at all. The lobby was very loud in the evening, but I did not hear a thing from inside our room. The conference rooms are on the far side of the hotel, the only time in really interferes is when you cross thru that part of the lobby from the parking lot, but you can also use the entrance around the pool. Parking is 11 dollars a night, but even after you factor in the parking fees and resort fees, we still paid 3000 dollars less, then we would of at the Beach club resort at disney, which we had originally looked at. Only thing we ate at hotel was calamari from Palm cafe and it was delicious! Food and drinks are pricey, but so is every restaurant at Disney, and you are minutes away from about 75 places to eat. Only con I had was the shuttle schedule. Departure times did not work at all if you stay open to close at parks, so we drove every park day, but it was off season. Wasn't a big deal. This was the nicest place I have ever stayed! Even beat out our Hawaii resort! I will def stay here again! P.s.

The staff at the front desk was friendly and knowledgeable. Housekeeping did a great job in my room. Service at the restaurant, Cascade, was attentive. I liked the room decor. The towels should be more luxurious. They were like what a Hyatt Place or basic level hotel chain would offer. The KenetMD toiletries were wonderful. The rooms can be noisy from the sounds coming from other floors which all open to the lobby's atrium. I woke up a few times during the night due to that. The food at breakfast and lunch at Cascade was mediocre. Pricey for the quality. The resort fee should just be included in the cost of the room since it is a mandatory fee. I didn't find the fee justified. Some activities had additional charges. The pool area looked like it had seen better days. The bicycles, climbing wall, boats, and poolside bar didn't \"wow\" me. There are only two buses that go to WDW and it only goes to the Transportation and Ticket Center in Magic Kingdom. From there you use Disney transportation to all 4 parks. The buses leave the Hyatt at 8:50am and 10am. They return 6pm, 8pm, 9:45pm, and 11:15pm. I found this extremely limited compared to other area hotels. It appeared that the exterior of the hotel was getting painted during my stay, so affected rooms could not access their balconies. Also, the fitness center was closed for remodeling. Overall, my stay was good. The hotel is better than most of the others in the Downtown Disney area.

We also had them provide breakfast and lunch at the conference room and it was probably some of the best food the I have had as it was fresh and hot and I was even able to get it without mangos or papayas(glazes,dry fruit)as I am allergic. I thanked the food services staff as I only had to let them know 1 time that I was allergic and each day they informed me of what contained mangos and papayas and either brought me a different dish or the dish minus the fruit. The Hotel staff were great and provide the little things that you might forget or cannot carry on board your flight(toothpaste, deodorant,etc). even if you don't know what you want to do just ask the valet guys and they can give you a list of things to do places to eat and go. If it was a question on the room the front desk staff cleared it up in a matter of minutes. The cleaning staff kept my room clean and all I had to do was leave a little note for extra coffe and it was there each day. It is a short walk to other food places if you don't want to eat at the hotel but there are about 7 different restaurants inside the hotel. so if you are heading for Orlando and looking for a good place to have a meeting as we did or just visit I would recommend the Hyatt Grand Cypress.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "chris50Boston", "ReviewID": "UR129228152", "Content": "This hoptel is exceptional in every way.

Clean and attractive room. Our boys loved paddle boating, riding bikes, running along the trails, and the pitch and putt golf. Personal preference on this... the location was \"too commercial\" for me. I know some people love to be right in the mix so those people would love this location. Lots of restaurants and touristy shops nearby... close to the outlets and Publix (although anticipate TONS of traffic delays). On the negative side: the pool area was TOOO crowded and extremely dirty. I know it was at capacity but I think the staff really should have done a better job with maintenance. One day there was actually feces all over the floor in the boys pool bathroom. Disgusting! My other big complaint is the price gouging. Having stayed at Hyatts on business before I've seen this done.... but this hotel is clearly for families and charging $11 for a yogurt parfait is just wrong. $11 for a small bowl of chips and salsa?

I booked the trip on Orbitz, and compared to a lot of other booking sites I found this one great because we could book the last day free, if we stayed for 5 or more. So we did that. However, while the rates look great for what you're getting I strongly suggest you look into it. For instance, we booked for 169 a night (during Easter week). I thought this to be excellent, because the grounds are quite beautiful and even though the hotel was packed, there were 3 huge pools and plenty of seating and lounge chairs for everyone. Most other hotels were 10 or 15 dollars more for the same thing, so we went with this one. When we got to the hotel, we were dissappointed to find that the valet parking was 23 dollars a night. We chose to park ourselves in the self-parking lot (which was quite a hike from our room). But, to our dismay, the self parking is charged to your room as well. 11 dollars a day to park at a hotel. This was horrible, to waste 55 dollars for nothing. Also, there is a 22 dollar a day fee for using the hotel amentities. They have row boats, and water activities, and somehow they get away with charging 22 dollars a day for these, without allowing you to deny these services. My kids barely used them, so I feel like it was a waste. If you add that up, you see this hotel really charges 200 dollars a night easily (and this is for the smallest most basic room with 2 very small double beds) I cant imagine upgrading to any other room. Everything else in the hotel is expensive as well. The food by the pool is ridiculously over charged, and 2 drinks by the pool cost my husband nearly 25 dollars, plus tax and tip. We felt like we were broke by day 2. We never used room serivce because of the price. Another mistake we made was going to the Sunday Brunch. We were told on arrival by the bell hop, that the sunday brunch was fantastic and was something that we could not miss. However, it was small and once again extremely over priced. 24 dollars a person for eggs and bacon, mediorcre at best. With tax, once again it was over 100 dollars for my family to eat breakfast. Yes, the grounds were beautiful, and the pools spacious however I feel like this hotel is ripping people off with their booking rates. I am not hard for cash, and normally I would never complain but I want families to know what theyre getting themselves into. If you're looking to save money, this is not the place for you to enjoy. There is a service charge and fee for EVERYTHING. Our bill was so expensive when we checked out, and we barely did anything at the resort itself. We went here because we thought it would be a great deal, however we paid more than double than what we thought we would.

The rooms are basic, remodelled and clean. Hotel staff supported anything we needed. Not much of a Consierge desk available to guests - only a small area where 2 people we trying to sell tickets to the nearby attractions. Unless you wanted ticket to a park or dinner show, you were on your own. One of the best restaurants we dined at was at this hotel - Cascades. Every meal there was excellent!. And the restaurant staff always went out of there way to make sure everything we needed was done. We booked via expedia at a very good rate for this type hotel but there we some added fees - $11/nt for self parking and $22/day Hotel Service Fee (which covered everything you might need at the hotel - internet, paddleboat rental, pitch n putt, use of tennis courts, use of microwave for reheating food, free filtered water machines and many other features -- overall we felt the fee was worth it since the rest of the time we never felt like hotel was nickel & diming us).

For a long time I have intended to stay at The Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress ment as I always liked the look, location & The Hyatt brand and so on The 6th of March my family & I fulfilled my wish when we castayed for 15 nights but I am terribly sorry to say we left very disappointed. I am glad to start on a positive note and say that the courtesy & help we received from the front of house staff was excellent; from The Check-In desk & Bell-Hops to The Concierge and Pool/Leisure Club staff. They really seemed to enjoy their work and their smiles showed this! A huge Thank You to them all!! The ground and public areas of the hotel are wonderful and it was great to be able to walk and cycle around the property. Merlot,(The Macaw) was a star and I hope the cockatoo is well soon! After a very welcome glass of bubbly during check-in we were shown to our rooms; I did think it a bit strange that despite being a family group; one member of whom is handicapped and has limited mobility, we were not in adjoining rooms; I did enquire about this and was told there were no rooms available at the time but as soon there were we would be told. We never were but that wasn\u2019t a huge issue just a bit of an inconvenience. My room was a good size with the most fabulous view (Thank You Steve Ballot) across to Downtown Disney & Epcot beyond, but it just seemed a tad unkempt and as if it hadn\u2019t been prepared properly. Sadly my first impressions were correct as not only was I missing towels, toiletries etc. when I went to store items in the safe I found a bag full of condoms (unopened luckily!) Q-Tips and other personal items. On the way for a well-earned beer in The White horse I stopped by the main desk and told them of my find! AMANDA and offered to move me but after 20 hours of travelling and having unpacked I didn\u2019t really relish the prospect. Kindly they offered me breakfast for two of my group the next day which was an appreciated gesture. The feeling of lack of care & standards were also evident in my Mother\u2019s room which not only was missing bedding, towels etc there was no bedside light (The lighting in the room was poor) We later discovered the inner voile on the window was missing; this left you with a choice of having the curtains drawn, with no privacy or complete darkness.The design of the hotel meant you were very overlooked. Sadly the lack of service became apparent during the course of our stay; the rooms never really seemed to be cleaned properly. It was hit or miss if toiletries would be replenished, trash emptied; indeed I had to inform house-keeping that my room had not been vacuumed for 5 days! Who knows how long it would have gone without being done if I hadn\u2019t let them know. When you are staying at what is billed as \u201ca Luxury Resort\u201d & a Hyatt to boot you do expect a certain standard and while we had no problem paying the daily resort fee one would have expected at least a bottle of water in the room to use in the coffee maker \u2013 which I have to say was quite useless & leaked everywhere! We did know advance of our stay that there was going to be some repainting of the property however we were shocked at the level of noise form this work, which could be heard everywhere. I understand that most people staying are either out all day at one of the parks or attending conference but it was impossible to have a lie-in (it started at 0830 and included weekends!) or simply relax in your room; I can only describe the constant drilling as being held captive in a dental surgery. I lost count of the number of guests I heard complaining to staff about this issue. Hardly conducive for a relaxing vacation! The \"gangs\" of chino-clad conventioneers roamed the corridors and public areas at all times so if you have an adversity to lanyards, polo shirts & people shouting at each other maybe best to avoid this place! Having returned from the park one day My Mother was horrified to find the door to her room wide open. It would appear that one of the chambermaids had left this open; we always made it routine to check the doors were closed properly upon leaving. We informed the Front Desk who said security would be up right away. After two hours of waiting no security had appeared and as it was getting near Midnight we checked nothing was missing & went to bed. Security did contact us the next day as we returned to voicemails informing us that the locks had been fixed as there appeared to a problem with them closing properly. The final sorry tale in this whole episode was when dirty towels were left in our bathroom. And when I say dirty towels I do not mean ones that we had used after bathing and were wet. These were from who-knows-where and I really don\u2019t wish to dwell on what marks covered the WHITE bath sheet but we were disgusted. How on earth could this happen? I have never encountered this before \u2013 even when staying in the developing world. I wanted to Love The Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress, I really did as I said at the start I came away very disappointed. Next time it's back to The Hard Rock or we will try The Hilton Bonnet Creek.

The first trip was for a short mother/son trip with my 9 year old in late October. The hotel rooms were the perfect size for 1 and 3/4 people. The pool complex was beautiful (waterfalls, hot tubs tucked inside of caves, rope bridges and waterslides) but only one tiny pool was heated to just about 80ish degrees. Burr, but doable. The other pools were not swimmable at all this time of year. I assumed that it would be too costly for the hotel to heat the whole pool complex over this cold, off season and didn\u2019t worry too much about it. Plus, since it was off season, we didn\u2019t have to share the little pool with many people so it was ok. Now, my second trip was not as simple and all the flaws became OBVIOUS. Please read on to see if these issues would play a role in your stay or not. The room: The attractive, 2 dbl bed room type that seemed so nice for just my son and I was now shared with my husband, 5 year old daughter, my son and myself. First, the bathroom is, for lack of a better word, stupid. The shower has \u00bd a glass shower door with the other half of the shower WIDE open, leaving your rear end fully exposed if anyone dares open the door. There is no curtain or water speckled glass to hide you in all your glory, even a little. The toilet is also in this same space. This is not a big deal if one is traveling with thoughtful people willing to wait until the bathroom is vacant before using the toilet, but kids and husbands are not always that way. Imagine taking a shower and having your 9 year old say he needs to come in and go #2. Super! I hated this bathroom. Also, the bathroom door was a sliding door that slid between the bathroom and the closet. If I were doing something in the closet and someone wanted to go in the bathroom, the door would slide shut in front of the closet, kicking me out. Then, when they come out, the door would slide open to the bathroom again and shut on the closet again. Arg. A mom getting clothes together for herself and 2 kids (my husband is often able to dress himself) might need to be taken out of this room in favor of one with padded walls. Club Level: Total waste of money. I usually stay club level. We love the snacks and perks. Robes in the room, cocktails, treats in the evening. Not here. This hotel has the worst \u201cclub level\u201d. No key card access to the floor, only to the \u201cclub\u201d itself. The Hard Rock in Orlando (much more family friendly and upscale than other Hard Rock Hotels) has tons of options for breakfast and lots of pleasing sweets for young and old. The Grand Cypress, however, had few choices for breakfast. Snacks were often raw veggies and similar (yuck) and sweets were things like lemon bars and some sort of dark chocolate espresso thing that I can\u2019t imagine anyone under the age of 40 liking. Cocktails were billed to your room \u2013 no complimentary (aka: included in the extra cost to get a club level room). Also, Grand Cypress rooms did NOT have bathrobes available to guests. (??) I\u2019m not really understanding what the extra fee was for, maybe it was the very pricey broccoli. Restaurants: Other than the pool service, there were 3 restaurants we explored on property. Hemmingway\u2019s. Very pretty, upscale. Good calamari soaked overnight in buttermilk or something. Steak was ok\u2026 not worth the almost 30 smackers. Cascades is the main, quick but still table service restaurant. They serve buffet breakfast in the morning. HOLY COW. Price for 2 adults and 2 kids was about $80/day \u2013 FOR BREAKFAST! Not to mention that one day the \u201cchef\u201d making waffles in the back, came out after 20 minutes to bring us our waffle holding it in his bare naked hands and dropped it on my plate. (gross.) One of the managers was so upset by this he kept giving us a little something here and there throughout our stay to make sure we were happy. Moral\u2026 Be polite and let them know about problems and this hotel does try very hard to accommodate your concerns. Good customer service here. BUT, too expensive and not great food\u2026 it was just alright. The third restaurant was White Horse. It says it is a sports bar and grill, but don\u2019t try to get a burger or nachos here. It is only appetizers and sushi \u2013 not a single main course or anything that one could pretend is a main course. Not very sports bar like. If a restaurant could have an identity crisis, it would be this one. I hope one day it seeks out therapy because it looked nice enough to eat in, it just didn\u2019t have much to eat. Pool: Oh, the worst. Yes\u2026 it is so pretty. So very, very lovely. But, our second trip was at spring break. Nice weather\u2026 hot, even. The hotel was at FULL capacity, but when booking this hotel again, I thought no worries the pool is so big, it will be fine. However, they only heated pool was AGAIN the little tiny pool\u2026 for ALL the spring break guests. Only a handful of brave people (probably from Alaska or one of the Poles) dared to swim in the non-heated pools \u2013 for a second. This hotel would have only had to heat the pools up a few degrees and with the hotel at full capacity, they should be able to afford it, but they just didn\u2019t. (Cheap or poorly managed? I don\u2019t know.) So, ALL the guests crammed into this one little pool\u2026 kids colliding, parents fighting for chairs close enough to watch kids without having to squeeze in themselves\u2026 ugh, the humanity. The beautiful pools are ONLY an asset to those traveling peak season when Florida has been scorching long enough to heat the pools naturally. If you are traveling off season or either shoulder season and you want to swim \u2013 GO TO ANOTHER HOTEL. Cost: You can get good deals you can get bad deals on rooms anywhere so let\u2019s look at other charges. Room service \u2013 crazy. Cascades \u2013 reasonable *if you order off the breakfast menu* but the price for the breakfast buffet is pure insanity. Dinner was ok. Hemmingway\u2019s is expensive. Pool service was the best value, but not cheap - but I have no regrets here. Good burgers and watermelon margaritas, too. Also, ALL guests should know that parking is an additional $17/dy unless you valet park, then it is $25/dy. Ouch. PLUS, you are charged about a $20something/dy resort fee on top of your room rate and the room taxes. These prices add up so fast that you can double your bill with all these sneaky, little charge here and there. Even the smores that you can make by the fire pit on weekend nights (This was fun!) cost $18 per kit. Bottom line: This hotel is a pretty hotel. If you get a cheap rate, don\u2019t think you are going to avoid paying through the nose which is fine if you are expecting it. They are going to getcha if you aren\u2019t. The pool is lovely, but only worthwhile when NATURALLY warm over peak season. There are nice amenities like the little beach by the pond and the paddle boats and activities for families like smores, but this hotel, despite its location, is clearly more focused on in and out business folks and convention visitors because they don\u2019t have the family traveler in mind with regard to the design of the hotel, the rooms, the warmth of the pool, the price of the meals and the poolside activities for kids were so poorly executed even my young kids began to try to just tune them out. Final word: Because this hotel was sold out for part of the stay we stayed half of our trip at the Hard Rock. Not my first choice because of the reputation of the other Hard Rock hotels, but with the free express pass for both Universal parks and it\u2019s walk to the park location, we thought we\u2019d give it a try. This was a MUCH better experience and if you are interested in my comparison, please feel free to read my review of that hotel which I plan to write and post next.

I had a wonderful time and will definitely go back, but I'll go back more informed. It really is a gorgeous hotel. The grounds and pool are what make it for me. The grounds are lush, expansive, and have many sculptures that give a Japanese garden look. There are 3 pool areas with one pool being almost bathwater warm. There are also 3 outdoor whirlpools...one with a waterfall. Actually, there are waterfalls all over the pool area which I love. There's a slide and also a swaying bridge that hangs over one of the pools. There are quite a few activities on the premises such as tennis, boating, rock climbing, and raquetball. There is a bar in a rocky grotto which is part of the pool area and also has waterfalls around it. Very nice grounds. My concern is the nickel and diming that occurs here. I will definitely go back to Grand Cypress because I absolutely adore the pools and grounds, but I'm going to be very careful with my money. Breakfast of Crab Cakes Benedict, bacon, juice, and coffee, ran me $38.64 with tax and 15% tip. A simple Pina Colada at the pool bar \"On the Rocks\" was $15.06 after tax and 18% tip. At the outdoor bar, the 18% tip is automatically added which I didn't know at first. I left an extra $2.00 above and beyond this steep price before I realized there was an automatic tip. The lobby bar doesn't add the tip and I don't know about the other bars. Another surprise is the $22 resort fee cost per night. Since I stayed at the hotel much of the time, I guess it wasn't that big of a deal. For people who are using the hotel just as a place to sleep, it's something to keep in mind. If you want a higher floor, it's an extra $9 and if you want a Disney fireworks (pool) view, it's another $15. With the Triple A rate, there can be some really great deals at this hotel which also include free breakfast. The weekend breakfast buffet is good quality and expansive. The weekday breakfast is also very good and is served in a pretty restaurant called Cascade with 3 sides of the restaurant floor to ceiling windows that look out on lush, tropical foliage. There's also a beautifully designed cascading waterfall that goes from floor to ceiling. I personally wouldn't get breakfast here without the Triple A free breakfast. It is gorgeous and has real good food though. I highly recommend this hotel for vacationers. I'm not a business person, so I can't give good advice in that area. If you have extra time to hang out at the hotel, then the $22 resort fee may be worth it. There is a lot to do and it's a lovely resort. It's very close to Disney, but the shuttles from Grand Cypress don't run often so it may be better to rent a car. Overall, very nice...but be aware of the hidden costs.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mikeandjen2002", "Title": "\u201cOverall a great spot with a few issues...\u201d", "Author": "mikeandjen2002", "ReviewID": "UR127614277", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 days recently and have mostly positive things to say. It was a family of four with two young kids (ages 7 and 4). The resort is gorgeous, the facilities are amazing, the staff is wonderful, and the upkeep was top-notch. I saw other reviews saying that the property was dirty or unkempt and we saw nothing of the sort. We typically stay at high-end properties so we have a point of reference. Our kids loved the stay. In fact, they ranked the stay there second only to Magic Kingdom. They rated the resort ahead of Animal Kingdom and Sea World. That's saying something. The pool is a kids paradise, the beach is awesome, the boat rentals, the bikes, the hiking trails, and the running paths - all was terrific. I don't see how anyone can complain about the modest resort fee ($20 per day) when you get all of that included. if you don't want those activities, then don't stay at this kind of property! I will say, however, that its not inexpensive and not the type of place to be seeking value deals. They will nickel and dime you to death on just about everything and you just have to make the decision going in that's it worth it and that you're happy to pay it. We did, and enjoyed ourselves. Again, if you are budget conscious, there are other places to stay. We only had two gripes about the property that made us give it 4 stars. First was the kids camp. They bill it as this wonderful activity-filled day for the kids and the reality couldn't be further from the truth. Our kids spent a half-day at the camp and while they did do some activities, they spent most of the time indoors in a tiny, cavernous daycare type room watching movies. The room is small, has no windows, and has a few scattered toys. Our 7 year old was bored to tears and our 4 year old tired of it within an hour. We were disappointed, and so were they. Even with this bad experience, our kids still loved this property as indicated above. I just do not recommend Camp Hyatt at this location. The second gripe has to do with the health club. It is small, cramped and lacks decent equipment. For a hotel with over 700 rooms a workout facility of less than 1,000 square feet just wont do. The machines are on top of one another, the weights are inadequate and it is claustrophobic. I went 3 times on 3 different days (6:30am, 8:00 am, and 7:00 pm) and at all times the room was packed. In some instances I saw people show up and walk away because it was so tiny and crowded. The Hyatt touts this \"stay fit\" program of theirs but that health club really, really missed the mark.

We are basing this review on our experience before ever even checking in. We booked a 10 nights stay, staying in a double lake view room (we planned on doing the theme parks to the max so no need for anything more). We used a UK company, Dial-A-Flight (very good, used them 3 times now), who found exactly what we wanted after beating 2 major package holiday providers who will for the sake of integrity, stay anonymous ;) We found out after we had paid that there was a 'resort fee' applicable each night, which was a very honest mistake on Dial-A-Flights' part, so I took 10 minutes out at lunch and called the hotel to clarify the negative reviews on Trip Advisor as each one appeared to have experienced the same issues. I spoke with the rep who confirmed that we would have to pay a compulsory \"resort fee\" for the privilege of using the golf course, swimming pool, free internet access (although the hotel rep did not see the same funny side I did of this one considering you have to pay for free internet!!) and use of bicycles. In summary, I was told that no matter if I wanted to use all of these facilities or not, I would have to pay the resort fee. At this point I did try to speak with a supervisor as I don't see why we should have to pay for services such as golf and bicycles when we would not be using them, only to be confronted with a \"that's the rules and so I don't really see why you have a problem with it\" attitude. Considering how much we had already paid for the room, this extra 'tax' was unacceptable so we managed to get our booking with this hotel cancelled and we were booked into the Hilton Parc Soleil who informed us with a chuckle that not only is parking free, but that the only charges we would incur would be for extras we CHOOSE to pay for!

Yes, there is work going on, on the lake side view, so definitely ask for a pool view at the moment. Also, the higher the floor, the less noise from the open atrium and better views. But the facilities are second to none. Yes, I don't understand why the resort fee isn't just included in the room rate, considering it is mandatory. But for what you get, and if you use them, it is fabulous. The pools alone are like a little waterpark on its own! The pitch & put is in an outstanding setting, and the running trails are what dreams are made of - for a lazy runner like me, it made me want to run just for the scenery! The prices are a little steep, but you do realise that in the first instance when you arrive, so you can get around that if you choose to, eg breakfast outside the complex only minutes away.

At least one of the pools was open 24 hours, which was a nice bonus (for those that like a late night swim). I loved the caves theme surrounding the pools. There was also a bar within those caves, which was quite cool. There are lots of activities (biking, golf, kayaks, rock wall, etc), but we ended up just staying poolside and lounging. The only negative about all this is the $22/fee for those activities...but after seeing what they offer, and even just the pool experience and such, I don't mind it so much. Self Parking was $11/day. Some would complain, but I don't mind as this resort is very private/gated, and the lot is very close to the hotel (even though it seems far away as you pull up to it).Valet parking I think was $20+ day. They had several restaurants, but we only went to the so called \"sports bar\". That was kind of an interesting experience. It's more or less a sushi/tapas placed dressed as an old pub. Talk about mixing it up. Food was actually excellent, but very pricey for what you get (again, it was tapas, so really didn't expect a full meal). The rest of our stay we ended up going outside of the resort for meals, though we did eat lunch poolside one day, and it was excellent. There are many restaurants within a mile of the resort. The hotel does have a nice lounge in the lobby, which is open late, with lots of comfortable seating to relax. Really like liked that. Overall, we had an excellent experience...will go back for sure.

The water is not heated (or wasn\u2019t when we were there) and was slightly too cold for the kids, especially in the grotto areas.

I can't say enough about how beautiful and tranquil this hotel is. From the moment of check in (we were given Room 1454), where they treat you like royalty and really know what \"CUSTOMER SERVICE\" is! I did not eat at any of the dining facilities, but I can imagine that the food is a scrumptious as the grounds. The pool area is beautiful and very large, with at least 2 slides that I saw. There is a rope bridge that goes over the pool area which is really nice. They have a lake where you can rent canoes or those boats with 3 large balloon type wheels and you pedal them. I would recommend just walking the grounds to decompress and take in the scenery. The area and transportation to and from Parks. This monstrosity of a hotel is NOT on Disney property, so you don\u2019t have unlimited transportation to and from the parks. The hotel is close to Downtown Disney, but is about a 2 mile walk. The hotel also offers a complimentary shuttle to the Disney Ticket & Transportation Center (this is where they take you to continue your journey on to each park). The only way to get to Magic Kingdom is by Ferry Boat or Monorail. Monorail and/or bus go to Epcot, only a bus goes to Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios Park. One drawback was that they are limited to the times they pick up from the hotel and transport back to the hotel. They have 2 pickup times in the morning 8 and 10, and depending on when you visit, 3 times that they pick up from the Disney Ticket and Transportation Center (this is the only place the Hyatt Shuttle takes you). This can be quite limiting in that you can\u2019t always get out of the parks, and back to the Ticket & Transportation Center in time. If you miss the 9:45 shuttle at night back to the hotel, you need to wait for the 11:15 pm bus. If you are visiting Epcot, you will need to give yourself time to get from Epcot to the Ticket & Transportation Center\u2026 I found it frustrating and you started watching your time and not enjoying the park. If you miss the shuttle, there is a taxi you can catch, which can cost anywhere from 20.00 to 25.00. We were running for the 9:45 bus and knew we would miss it, but when we got there, the bus driver said he decided to wait because there was no one there. I think the Hyatt should \u201crethink\u201d the transportation to and from the Ticket & Transportation Center. If you don\u2019t know what the Ticket & Transportation Center is, this is where you can purchase tickets to the parks, and where you catch the buses to Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios Park, or the monorail to Magic Kingdom and Epcot. Busses from the Ticket & Transportation center only take you to Animal Kingdom, Downtown Disney, Hollywood Studios, and monorail only runs you to Magic Kingdom and Epcot. I personally like the monorail because you have a bird\u2019s eye view. , you can purchase tickets if you don\u2019t already have them to the parks, and where you can catch the Ferry or Monorail to Magic Kingdom and Epcot, and a bus to Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios Park. I found it kind of limiting the times that the hotel provided. If you don\u2019t have a rental car (which I was told can add up, with gas, parking fees, etc) the hotel does provide a limousine service to the Ticket & Transportation Center which will cost you $27.00 each time you use. The hotel also provided shuttle service to the outlet mall that is located nearby. What I liked: 1) Hotel is beautiful 2) Customer Service Impeccable 3) Comfortable & Roomy Rooms 4) Beds are fantastic 5) Private bathroom 6) Shower is wonderful! 7) Free wifi 8) Quiet Rooms 9) I needed a band aid and they asked if I needed medical assistance\u2026. Customer service! 10) Shuttle service provided to the outlet malls 11) Limited shuttle service to Disney Parks What I didn\u2019t care for: 1) The only thing I did not care for is the shuttle bus to and from the parks, Hyatt might want to rethink the times and consider being a little more flexible. If you want more flexibility getting to and from the parks, I would recommend finding a place on Disney Property, other than that, there is nothing NOT TO LIKE and enjoy about the Hyatt Grand Cypress.

Am I glad I did. I passed last year and after seeing how nice it is, am sorry I did Check in was smooth and although we were there early, they were able to give us our room right away. I believe it was Raphael who checked us in, very pleasant. From what I understand they were almost at capacity so we were verly lucky. Russell, took our bags to the room and my husband actually remembered him from the year before. He is extremely personable and answered the couple of questions I had concerning transportation to a Cirque de Soleil show I had booked earlier. ( Show was truly amazing and I only wish my husband could have gotten to see it. The cab ride was $ 12.00 each way. Spent day 1 at the pool in designated quiet area, a very nice touch.Ordered a burger. It was cooked to order and delicious. The second day I asked if I could order a fish taco I had seen on Cascade menu. This was not on the poolside menu but they were happy to accomodate me. It was amazing. Fish was fresh and tasty. Bloody Mary was also very tasty and spicy as I requested. The service around the pool area was exceptional. Night one I ordered room service. Chicken tortilla soup and buffalo wings, delish! I then proceeded to lock myself out of my room while putting the tray in the hallway. I was pretty embarassed having had to take the elevator and walk to the lobby barefooted. Security was sent up to let me in a a timely an efficient manor. She also made me feel better by saying people did this all of the time., lol. Toiletries in bathroom were top notch, body lotion, spa soap, shampoo and conditioner. The also included toothpaste! I had a little issue with the handles in the shower trying to figure them out but eventually did. This is because there are a couple of different options which are available to use for your comfort,again a plus. Trellises lounge in lobby was very nice. I went there a couple of times in the early evening to have a glass of wine. The bartender Khai was very friendly and made me feel comfortable even though I felt a little awkward sitting at the bar alone. Had dinner in the White Horse Sports bar, night two. They had a special the bartender recommended, salmon tacos. Again, fresh & delicious. I did take advantage of bike riding on the trails both days I was there. There are 3 different trails for jogging/biking based on how far you wish to jog/ride. The grounds are amazing and clean.They did have a nice health club as well but I did not use it, wanting to take advantage instead, of the beautiful outdoors. I requested and obtained a late checkout. My husband had a business meeting in the morning so this actually was a nice perk for me. Also, his meeting ended early so he got to sit by the pool for a couple of hours and relax a bit before leaving. The staff was very accomodating. While checking out I dealt with Sierra who was extremely pleasant and smiling. She also oferred us a glass of champagne. I did express to her, just how wonderful I thought the staff was. I believe the staff here to be exceptional with friendliness and service being key. I would definitely love to return here. It was a nice getaway for a cuple of days. Ionly wish I could have stayed longer! Maybe next time. I cannot rate the value since this was a company paid trip. Noise was not an issue for me as it had been stated by other.

As for cleanliness-when we checked into our room my husband found a book on the floor by the bed, we thought nothing of this as any maid could make a mistake and overlook something but later when I found a dirty woman's bra beside the chaise I really was quite disgusted and it made me quite worried about the other things the staff could have missed...eww.

I alerted a waitress on the staff at once, while she agreed that the display was absolutely distasteful when we walked back by there later that afternoon they were still there! Unless you want your children picking dirty adult under garments or explaining why they would be left there in the first place you may want to find different accommodations. As for tranquility- we were shocked when we were awoken to what sounded like drilling during our 1st morning, when we called the front desk to find out what was going on we were told they would be working from 9-5 every day for the duration of our stay, so much for peace and quiet. As for the staff- when checking in the front desk attendants attendants seemed ignorant of matters they should be aware of- I have a certified service animal for my disability and it has never before a problem at any Hyatt or any other hotel for that matter but the clerk said she would have to charge us a myriad of fees associated with keeping a \"pet\" at the hotel. I tried to explain it wasn't a pet and extraneous fees violated the Americans with disabilities act per the dogs certification she became huffy and told the other attendant to leave the fees on there until a manager could be consulted. This was obviosly just an honest mistake but I would expect a hotel of this size to better educate its staff especially when I called way in advance to make sure they were aware of my situation.

The elevators are spaced in such a way that when they arrive,if you're not quick enough, the doors are closed and they are gone.

We particularly enjoyed the bike trail around the extensive grounds, and the \"big slide\" whilst not all that big (its certainly no \"Plummet Summit !) did give a better thrill ride than your average pool slide, due to its better than average acceleration rate towards the end.The heated pool is warm and open 24 hours. The only really decent capable member of staff we found at this hotel was Ben from Austraila - very on top of his job; so very kind, friendly and helpful - I hope that The Hyatt will recognise what a superb member of staff they have in this guy. Bad; We did not have a great \"first impressions\" experience at this hotel - We were suposed to have a 'Lake View' room. First off, without warning they put us in a room at the back of the hotel (an entrance/drive view). When we found this out, on entering the room, we went down to complain and they said they would put us in a 'lake view' room but there would be no access to the balcony. We said fine, we weren't bothered about a balcony, but on entering our 'lake view' room they failed to mention that this section was under major rennovation, complete with builders' gantrys everwhere on this section, their ropes dangling past the windows, and a large \"DO NOT ENTER\" sticker posted across our window ! So this is why there was no entry to the balcony - nice of them to mention it. Another trip to reception ensued - not what you want when you first arrive at a hotel all tired with kids and waiting to unpack. We complained again as we didn't think we should expect a \"building site view\" - not for the money the Hyatt is charging. By this time I was dreading speaking to the receptionists - they just have that way of making you feel YOU are the problem, not the hotel ! I spoke to another receptionist - he did a half hearted look through inventory and (rather) quickly concluded there were no other rooms on the \"pool view\" side. So we were stuck - with nothing more than an apology offered. As we were only staying 2 days we put up with it - if it had been more I'd have booked out there and then, and although we had to contend with workmen going past our window and looking in on us each day (yes really - we are talking about The Hyatt here) we could at least console ourselves with a view of the Disney fireworks each night. Pool side food was stone cold, and the kids breakfast (we had free adult breakfast) was expensive...especially by the time you add the tips. On reflection we should have gone 2 minutes down the road to Sizzlers $4.99 all you can eat breakfast, and still would have been better off paying for 4 breakfasts there ! The Ugly; The $33 daily compulsory resort & self parking fee and 18% automatic gratuity on your food & drinks ! Please don't tell me this is competative Hyatt - we stayed at the Orlando Hilton and your charges are way above those, and the staff & service were way better ! Whilst the lobby area is beautiful, if I had a child under 10 years I would not be staying here - it is a health & safety ticking timebomb. I would love to know what Safety Inspector approved this building's design - it is so easy for an inquisitive/unattended child to climb up & fall over the railings of open plan walkways, which look down from great height into the open lobby below. Right up to the 15th floor, there is one heck of an open drop - it gave me the shudders everytime we walked past this section, even though my kids are 11 and 14 years old ! What madness for a hotel design within such a prime family holiday area ?

I have been able to sail every time we visited in the past so this was dissappointing. The gym is small and there was a line to use the treadmills, and some family had a child using the exercise equipment, and last but most important, they have a very unpleasant doorman by the name of Dave, who is very rude to guests if you do not let him take care of your suitcases, since he only cares about his tip. Other than these 3 areas, it is the best hotel in Orlando. is right next to Disneyworld and centrally located regarding restaurants, highways and even the premium outlets.

It was my 5 year anniversary and after a failed trip to Key West we decided to look into heading back up to Orlando, and boy am I glad we did! After some extensive research on hotels in the area I came across the Hyatt Regency. I read a lot of mixed reviews, some people stating customer service issues to high fees, but the good out weighed the bad and we booked our 2 night 3 day stay. For starters I want to debunk the fee issue that keeps popping up in a lot reviews. Its actually pretty clear, yes there are fees associated with the hotel, like most resorts there is a daily fee for amenities. It is a $22 per night fee which includes a fabulous array of on site activities, which include 24/7 access to their stunning pools, kayaking on the lake and other lake activities, gym access, arcade fun for the kids, lake side hammocks, fire pit, put put golf, plus more! Now in regards to the $75 per night fee, this is not a fee they charge you unless you use room service or other hotel services. It is simply a temporary hold that the hotel places on pending status on your balance along with whatever other remaining balance is owed from the nightly rate. If you do not use any other services then the $75 per night is not charged and you will only be charged once checking out your remaining balance. In my case we made a deposit equaling half of our weekend total and actually used the room service and it was credited towards the $75 per night fee. We were charged the remaining amount when we checked out. We were even left a break down of every transaction in a balance sheet under our door the morning of check out. The hotel is not trying hide these fees, if you take the time to call them or read through your itinerary you will know all these things in advance instead of being \"surprised\" at check in. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by their friendly staff and Merlot, the lobby parrot. We were even given each a glass of champagne to enjoy on our way up to the room! We had booked a king room and it had a lovely view of the property and pool. The room was very clean and I especially loved the modern decor of the whole hotel. After the long drive up from Miami we decided to spend the evening in the hotel and order room service and a movie. The food was very delicious and I loved the fact I was able to see a movie that was currently in theaters with out having to leave the hotel. The best part is that even though we weren't able to finish the movie, the friendly check out girl removed it from our bill! We took a walk around the resort and were very impressed by all the art, gardens and romantic pool side ambiance of waterfalls, fire pit and lake view hammocks. The next morning we headed down to Cascades, just one of their on site restaurants. As a AAA member we were given each free breakfast vouchers for each night we were there at check in, which we could choose from the buffet or a single menu item. We went for the buffet. Which even though we only went up for one round, were very impressed with the selection, like individual spinach, cheese, egg white cups, fresh fruits, pastries, freshly made waffles and pancakes and deli meat and cheese spread. We were headed to Disney for the day and though we didn't use, the hotel concierge can get you tickets so you can skip the lengthy lines in the park and they also offer transportation to and from the hotel since there is a $14 parking fee at the parks. We spent the day in the park and returned to find the room freshly stocked and cleaned with towels, sheets and toiletries. We again ordered room service for dinner since we were so beat from the day in the park and once again were very impressed with the meals. Our server went above and beyond for us and I really wanted to recognize the much appreciated service. After realizing we did not receive vouchers for the next mornings breakfast and being told we had to go down for them at the front desk when I had called in from the park, our server said he would find out for us and he came back up with our vouchers! Again breakfast was wonderful and the floor manager for Cascades came over to our table a second time and made conversation and remembered us from the previous day. These little acts of kindness really place this hotels customer service on the top of my list of things I loved about the stay!

My wife has back problems and had surgery a few years ago. She needs a bed that is firm and the bed at the Hyatt Grand Cypress was not a good fit for her. Not that the beds are bad, they are very comfortable but she can't sleep on a mattress that has the pillow top on it. I informed the front desk and the head housekeeper George got in touch with me right away. To make a long story short, George was able to find an old mattress in the warehouse that was firm and did not have the pillow cover and they set up a whole new bed for my wife. We were both very appreciative. Now I'm concerned when we go back, we might have the same issue and won't be lucky enough for that mattress to appear again. If it wasn't for George, we would have had to check out after the first night. The hotel itself is beautiful and although the weather wasn't great during our stay, my wife and I still had a great time. I used my points to upgrade to the Regency Club and most nights we just ate dinner there. I do not feel it's worth the extra charge for the Regency Club to be honest but if you have points, I would suggest you use them because it was nice to have breakfast and a light dinner there every day. Years ago, before they moved the Regency Club, I feel it was much better. Not that the staff isn't nice, they were great. Just the club itself was more cozy and the drinks were also included which they are not anymore. There is a small fee for alcoholic drinks which is not expensive (soda and coffee drinks are free) but to me charging for drinks kind of cheapens the experience. I do think they need to redesign the lounge because it has a cold feel to it and is nothing like it used to be. They do charge for parking now which has been noted many times on these boards which I wasn't happy about and add that to the $22 resort fee, your bill adds up very fast. I just wish they would take out the resort fee (and I know what it includes) but just put in into the price of the room upfront. The parking plus resort fee added over $132 to my bill at the end which is a lot. It's just easier to budget when it's all included. Regardless, my wife and I did have a great time at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress and hopefully we'll be able to return in the future (if I can work out ahead of time the bed issue due to my wife's back).", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Paul, MN", "Title": "\u201cA very very pleasant stay...\u201d", "Author": "CariocaGirl", "ReviewID": "UR124738441", "Content": "I have not stayed at Hyatt hotels much, but attending a conference, it was the hotel of choice as it was also the conference center.

Now, for my detailed review: First, I must say that this review builds upon prior two review of this property -- for further information and some more details on this property, please see my prior review: -February 2011, entitled: \u201cA truly AMAZING 4th of July Weekend!\u201d (posted July 6, 2010) My wife and I always love staying at this Hyatt property when we are in the Disney area, as it is often less expensive than the Disney Resorts, and it has far better pools and customer service! If you are headed to Disney World, this property is in the perfect location and should not be missed! Upon arrival, check-in was extremely quick and easy. We we met by the valet, who quickly took our car and assisted with our bags. A quick word on parking -- if you have not stayed at this property in a while, be aware that parking is now an additional cost, but, that takes this property in line with all others in the area, so that is to be expected. And, the cost is quite reasonable, with self-parking at $11 per day, or Valet at $23 per day. The Valet Service is so quick and efficient, I highly recommend spending the extra money for the Valet. Upon entry into the beautiful lobby, we were immediately greeted by another staff member by name, and directed to the front desk. This property truly excels at customer service -- from the moment you pull through the front guard gate, you are always greeted by name, as the valet and the front desk staff appears to be radio'ed ahead with your name and to expect you. The main lobby continues to amaze, as the property continues to change the lighting and the current blue lighting scene is absolutely beautiful! At the front desk, we were again greeting by name, and check-in was extremely quick and pleasant. We were greeted by name, and we were each given a glass of excellent champagne. The agent told us that we were in a beautiful Lake View Junior Suite, as we had used a Diamond Upgrade Certificate. Having stayed in basically every room class, I was truly excited to see a Suite -- and, let me tell you, if you are coming in for a longer stay, definitely splurge for a Suite, as the Suites at this property are excellent! After our quick and efficient check-in experience, we hopped onto the elevator and quickly traveled up to our Suite on the 12th Floor. We were in Room 1207, a \"Junior Suite\" with a Lake View. The room was perfect for us! You walk in and enter into a Parlor area with a half-kitchen area. To the right is the kitchen, with a wet-bar, ample cabinet space for entertaining, and a wine chiller. Then, as you proceed in, you enter the parlor seating area which has an extremely comfortable couch and chair. The parlor also has a large flat-screen HD-television with a DVD player and a surround sound system. On either side of the television unit is a set of sliding doors that lead into the bedroom area. The bedroom is a very nice sized room, with an excellent King Size Hyatt Grand Bed, along with another HD-television. Then, if you continue into the room and to the right, you enter the bathroom area, equipped with excellent upgraded bath amenities and a large shower/tub. Finally, both the parlor and the bedroom have large balconies with truly excellent views of the Lake. All-in-all, a truly wonderful suite -- again, fully worth spending the extra money! Our main goal of the weekend was to have a fun pool day, and this property always allows for that. The pool has recently undergone an extremely pricey renovation, and it looks AMAZING! The pool now has ample plush double loungers, each with a push-button for poolside service. Also, large shade umbrellas have been installed for those who wish to have shade; these new additions provide for ample shade for those who want it, as well as plenty of open spaces to take in the beautiful Florida sun. The pools here are truly amazing, and some of the best in Central Florida -- if you just want a relaxing pool day, this is definitely the property for you! In addition to all of that, do not forget the food -- this property offers truly excellent food! First, for those staying in Regency Club Rooms, this is one of the nicest Hyatt Regency Clubs in the continental United States, offering beautiful views of all of the Disney Theme Parks -- including beautiful fireworks views! And, in addition to the amazing foods, the food offerings are top-notch for a Regency Club. In the morning, there is an ample Continental Selection, with a few hot items -- make sure to try the french toast! In the evening, there are also ample hot foot options. Definitely do not miss the Regency Club at this property. Also, the pool-side food service is wonderful! Extremely quick and efficient service, strong and tasty pool-side drinks, and very well cooked food. I highly recommend the poolside hot dog for a quick and yummy poolside meal! But, the best of the best is at this property when it comes to food -- whatever you do, do not miss Hemingway's! This is, by far, one of the best restaurants in the Disney area -- the food is EXCELLENT, and the service is to die for! I do not think that there is anything on this menu that is not truly tasty -- I highly recommend any of the fish items, as they are always extremely fresh and succulent! All-in-all, the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress is one of the nicest hotels in the Disney area, and I would highly recommend it over any Disney Resort!

We were blown away the first time and couldn't wait to come back a 2nd time. A couple disappointments may be all the nickel-and-dime fees. First, the resort fee is a hefty $22 a night. Also, it seems as if parking was free on our first stay (Dec 2010), but is now $11/day (Dec 2011). We don't typically stay at such swanky properties, and the feeling that you are getting charged for all sorts of things can be pretty frustrating. For us, we stayed at an extremely discounted group rate associated with a local soccer tournament. So we couldn't complain @ paying half the $125/night group rate and having the resort fee waived. The grounds are beautiful. Greatest pool area ever. Pictures and words don't do it justice. The waterslide in the large pool was much faster than expected! This was a pleasant surprise. Although the slide is connected to the unheated pool, it was actually quite refreshing to hit the 60F water on a warm, mid 70s day. Pitch and putt golf is a lot of fun. A much more substantial activity than the typical putt putt golf. Rock climbing wall was a hit with our kids. One of the 4-seater bikes was apparently undergoing maintenance, so only 1 of them was available on the day we inquired. Great to be able to rent bikes 'free' (included with resort fee). We never made it to the tennis courts or the paddleboats, but there is so much to do here to stay busy or stay relaxed. Love this resort. The rooms are really nice, great modern feel and furnishings. One thing we found odd was the shower. Last stay, we had a king bed room with sleeper sofa. The shower was fine -- if I recall, the marble foundation was a good 18\" high, and the glass door started up from there. This stay, we had 2 double (queen?) beds. The shower in our room seemed different: the glass door went all the way to the floor, and large amounts of water leaked/ran/splashed onto the bathroom floor no matter who was using the shower, kid or adult. One of our kids left her camera somewhere during the stay, and the staff was able to return it to us. We appreciated this very much, although we waited close to half an hour in the lobby for the staffer to appear.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mt.

Many reviews have covered the good aspects of this resort - the pool area, the grounds, the activities so I will concentrate on the things that no longer make it great: Whilst this is still a nice higher end 4 start resort hotel it is no longer the best in Orlando and cant be described as 5 star any longer. Despite what the management might want you to think. As many have said, the hotel has recently gone through a major renovation and the rooms are now very modern - but closer to what you would expect from a downtown business hotel than a Florida/Disney area resort. There are some very strange design issues with the layout of the new rooms - not least of which the closet/bathroom door - which is just plain weird and can lead to trapped fingers etc if you come out of the bathrooom without warning. How much did they really save by just having the one door ? The corridors now have a whitewash, breezeblock look which makes you feel like you are heading to a stadium locker room, not a deluxe resort guestroom. The previous magnificent tropical lobby has also been, well - destroyed - in favour of an \"environmentally friendly\" bamboo and astroturf look. The old oriental works of art are now at odds with the new look. We much preferred the previous Key West style to the rooms and public areas but can understand that many people prefer the modern look of the new guest rooms at least. This is a big resort and the pool and beach areas, along with the many activities are great and provide a welcome respite after a day at Disney. The resort fee is worth it if you use all the facilities - the recently introduced $11 self-parking fee however is nothing more than a pure ripoff plain and simple. Totally unnecessary and unjustified - particularly as the self parking area is someway from reception and the lifts. Also dont go expecting a very personal service - this is a large chain resort. Not once in 20 years has it ever even been acknowledged that we were repeat guests. Whilst some of the employees are great we have noticed a definate decline in many areas. There seem to be a lot more temporary emplyees who dont seem to know what they are doing. Training is obviously not much in evidence. The restaurants are good - but expensive.As a result most guests I imagine eat off property and this, along with the hard economic times has led to a reduction in service. The market/counter service area did offer a slightly cheaper alternative but now seems rarely open and the variety of food on offer has been severely reduced. The redesigned Regency Club floor is now not worth the money. The new lounge is small and crowded. The food and beverage service is a shadow of what it once was and the decision to charge a subsidy for alchoholic drinks is again a rip-off given the premium price you pay to stay on the club floor. Avoid and spend your money on a pool view room instead. The room service menu has gone through another change and seems to be aiming for higher end gourmet rather than the sorts of things guests actually want from room service at a resort hotel in Orlando - again a weird choice. The main problem is, the management of the Grand Cypress are still trying to market the hotel as one of the top end resorts in Orlando but those days are over. The Ritz Carlton Grande Lakes and the Waldorf Astoria both now offer a much better all around product on great properties without the visible cutbacks and penny-pinching the Hyatt has undergone. They offer great service in modern surroundings but without the rough edges the Grand Cypress now has. Its still a good quality hotel close to Disney but they just need to decide what type of guest they are trying to attract and be honest and stick to it.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "CrispyRice", "ReviewID": "UR123284251", "Content": "Beautiful building and grounds.

There is a resort fee of $22 and self-parking is another $11, so if you're just looking for a place to crash in between spending all day at the parks, this probably wouldn't be worth it. But, if you're looking for a destination in itself, the fee includes several things - canoes, bikes, paddle boats, a small rock climbing wall.

The hot tubs were wonderful after a long day of visiting the local attractions. Nice to have them open 24 hours. Little kids enjoy the fine sand beach but no swimming permitted in the man-made lake due to the potential for alligators - yikes!

First, let me start by saying that I am a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member. I stay in Hyatt hotels about 30-45 days per year and have never had a problem with a Hyatt hotel. Until now. My wife and I flew into Orlando after staying at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza in Los Angeles, which was a pleasant experience. Upon arriving at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress, we were first given the wrong room. As a platinum member, we are guaranteed the bed of our choice and we requested king. We got two doubles (not even a queen), but this wasn\u2019t really a big deal at that point. We just had the bellman ask the desk for a king room. After speaking with the front desk, the bellman asked if we would mind a room on the pool side with a sliding door that wouldn\u2019t open because they were doing construction. \u201cWait. What kind of construction,\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just painting. No noise. And you get to see the Disney fireworks from that side,\u201d the bellman replied. Sounds good to me. We accepted. Now, where we\u2019re from, no one paints with a jackhammer, but apparently, at the Grand Cypress, they do, because while my wife and I were napping after a 5-hour red-eye flight, we were awakened by jackhammering in the room next door. (And when I say awakened, I mean, jumping so high we almost hit the ceiling.) I immediately called the front desk and asked for a second room change, which they gave us, on the same floor, down the hall. We could still hear the drilling and jackhammering only a little bit fainter. At this point we gave up sleeping and went to the pool. Oh yes, we were told that they\u2019ve been doing the construction since the fall and it\u2019s 9-5 every day. The construction continued throughout our stay. Under no circumstances should a hotel be charging guests $220 per night to stay in a room, or even or a floor or in a wing, where that kind of construction is going on. Another note about the hotel. The location could not be any worse. We are frequent visitors to Disney and have stayed at several Disney properties, the Swan and Dolphin, and the Marriott World Center with no problem at any of those hotels. With the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress, if you decided to drive, I would budget 30 minutes JUST TO GET OUT OF THE HOTEL COMPLEX. During peak season, every day, there is a backup on Winter Garden Vineland Road, which is the only road you can access from Grand Cypress Boulevard. It will take you 5-10 minutes to get onto Winter Garden Vineland, and likely another 10-15 minutes to get to Apopka Vineland Road, which is approximately a block or two away. Apopka Vineland itself will be bumper-to-bumper to I-4 AT ALL TIMES OF THE DAY, whether it\u2019s rush hour, or the lunch or dinner crush at the Crossroads shopping complex or Downtown Disney. For instance, it took us 30-45 minutes to get to Downtown Disney, which is around the corner from the hotel. A few other people have mentioned the fees at this hotel. I am generally aware of the resort fee when we visit a Hyatt Grand or Regency, but one fee did irk me. Self-parking, which used to be free at this hotel. You will be charged $11 above and beyond your hotel rate and resort fee for self-parking. Clearly, the hotel felt it was losing money because most guests were choosing self-parking and foregoing the valet, so they instituted an $11 fee for you to park your own car 400-500 yards away and walk yourself to your room. If the hotel is losing money, raise the resort fee (which is clearly described when you book your room online). Don't hide a fee and tell me about it at the front desk after I've already rented a car and driven my sorry self to the hotel. Anyway, bottom line. I love Hyatt. I\u2019ll still stay at Hyatts, because this hotel is not representative of most. I will never stay at the Grand Cypress again. The employees of this hotel were kind and offered the same level of service at any of the other Hyatts I\u2019ve stayed at and enjoyed (except for shifting us down the same hallway where the construction was occurring). However, this hotel is far from meeting up to the Hyatt standard. I fault management for the construction issue. The location can't be helped. You have many options in the Disney area of Orlando, I suggest you choose another.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ottawa", "Title": "\u201cI Love it....I love it not.\u201d", "Author": "lakomka2003", "ReviewID": "UR122601809", "Content": "I stayed at the Hyatt strtingon 25.12.2011. I was very much looking forward to the experience after reading the reviews. And I must say, some are totally justified. Beautiful pools, beautiful grounds, great activities offeredin the 22$/day resort fee. I love the toiletteries. Big size. I could have filled my suitcase going back home (if not for the airlines restrictions!!) as the maid added more every day ! The atrium is stunning. Going to the 18th floor and looki8ng down is an thrill on its own. Bed was very comfortable. Staff very friendly. Loved that glass of champagne on check in! It was great to have the hotel shuttle to the Maingate any time of day. The same shuttle drove us to the Golf Course (5* !) where we were given free clubs tees and balls. Very friendly staff there as well. The 9 hole Pitch and putt course is also awesome. The bikes, the canoes etc.. i wish the weather had been warmer to use everything more extensively. The Art Boutique/gallery is very nice and a nice addition tothe hotel. Very unusual pieces, that i would have loved to purhase! Owner was very informative, not pushy at all. A real art lover. These were the Pro's. Now the Con's IMHO. The pool is great .. probably in July/aug. , but with 15 degrees outside temp. , it was more like a Polar Bear swimm. I put my legs in the water and got cramps from the cold ! This side of the pool stayed pretty empty the whole week... The room: No matter where your room is, the view is always nice. We got eventually a room with view of the front of the hotel, but we also could see the gardens and the ponds etc...no complaint here. :I had phoned in advance to advise of our late check-in so a room - as we ordered with 2 double beds- could be available and ready. On arrival we were offered a king size (which my son refused - he is 10 and does not want to sleep with mama). So we were given a room with 2 double beds. I found the bathroom really weird. No shower stall, no door, no real vanity, not even room to put a cosmetic bag ! It was late so we stayed the night but in the morning taking a shower was no fun at all, and as we were staying the whole week, I requested to be moved. I finally realized why the bathroom was so unpratical: I did not have a wheel chair !!! I think it is great when hotels offer \"accessible\" rooms (please indicate WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE !! ) but dont give them to guests who do not have a wheel chair and pay a pretty good price to have a nice bathroom, not a shower curtain and a flooded floor after each shower and just enough space to put your tooth brush. Enough whining: we were moved at lunch time to another room, king size bed though -son not happy- :-( but with bigger nicer bathroom, and AWESOME shower stall, with double glass doors. Just loved it. Yes, I did hit my son on the head a few times when he was opening the safe in the closet and I was opening the sliding bathroom door at the same time ...he survived the ordeal though... BTW...A/C was LOUD !! TV: during my last stay in Orlando (the Great Peabody) my son was able to watch kids cartoons at no extra costs (i refuse to rent movies in hotels i Orlando). I do not find it OK to have to pay for the basic TV shows like News and kids cartoons. WIth the 22$ fee per day, you would expect a minimum TV service. Accoustic issues: One night, the room under us was playing music so loud that my son could not fall asleep. There is not much that can be done, but during the extensive renovations, this should have been addressed. I finally phoned the front desk and the music stopped. Restaurants seem very nice, but very expensive...so we ate out most times. Except for the Palm Caf\u00e9, where the food is good and affordable. However I cannot understand that the hotel management allowed a whole group of guests to get their food at Subway, bring it back to the hotel, and take over 2 tables outside, where guests who have purchased their lunch inside shouldbe able to sit. There wasno room for us to sit and eat. Just those 2 tables filled with Subways wrappers. Is there no policy about that!! If you buy your lunch at Subway, then eat it there! Not at the Hyatt. It looked like a public picnic area. Ice machine on the floor was broken. I told themaid several times, but it wasnever repaired. No big deal but I had to go all around to get ice. My fault I guess. I should have told the front desk. Transportation: true that more shuttles shoudl be avaialble - Although this is not a Disney Hotel-. But the fact is that most guests ARE going to need shuttles to go to parks. WHen you have small chidlren, you cannot expect them to last a whole day at the parks, so that a more frequent shuttle service should be available. The expensive Limo service at the front is not an option: we needed a drive to a parking lot nearby to take the FRE shuttle to Bush garden. Price was $20. Drive to TAMPA was free, thank God ! Our transportation budget was way too high. ROOM KEY: we had trouble several times with our room key. We were locked out on 3 occasions. WILL WE COME BACK ? Not sure. We might because the grounds are so beautiful and great for children. The activities are awesome. and the toilettries :-) !!!! and the unusual atrium,,, So....YES we will come back !

We loved Merlot, the macaw. We usually stay at the Disney Boardwalk Resort but wanted a different experience on this vacation. As others have commented, the property is very large. However, I cannot comment on the facilities as we only used the hotel to sleep before heading out to the parks. As for our room (I am only writing about our room because there are a few different configurations. However, I think many rooms are like ours), it was very SMALL for two double beds. I really don't know what they were thinking. Who did they think would be sleeping there? The beds are MUCH TOO SMALL for two adults so I guess they felt that the each adult would sleep with a child (The last thing we wanted to do!). They should put king-size beds in these rooms and sell them to 2 adults only. The closet door situation is dangerous. If someone is coming out of the bathroom and someone else is by the closet, you could potentially decapitate that person by unwittingly pushing the door into them. There needs to be more room for luggage. We always seemed to be tripping over it. The built-in piece of furniture that runs the length of the wall can be a real pain if you drop anything behind it (You can't move it and it is practically impossible to reach fallen objects). THEREFORE, DO NOT PUT SMALL OBJECTS (E.G. JEWELRY) ON TOP OF IT. I have no idea why they have a \"cool box\" instead of a refrigerator (You cannot put formula or medicine in it). So, if you want cold soda, go to the 7-11 around the corner and buy it cold and then put it inside. When something cold is placed inside it will stay cold. As I always say, the pillows are mushy foam, so if you hate them as much as I, bring your own. I feel that there were just not enough restaurants on the property. Breakfast at Cascades was fine but a 45 minute wait for dinner was ridiculous! I understand the situation with the shower door. I have the same in my house. The reason for the half-door is if you are taking a bath, it prevents you from feeling closed in. However, since most of us are not bathing, a full door should have been installed. Also, the situation with the resort fee. Every high-end hotel does this. What I don't understand is why cheap hotels can offer free breakfast and wi-fi and the luxury ones charge for everything. I disagree with others who felt that the service was impersonal. I felt that all the staff members were pleasant and helpful. So in conclusion, I would try another hotel.

If you are getting a car, just get used to paying the $23 for valet parking. These guys were great! Then again, we did tip well each time they got the car out. We would have liked if the parking charge was included in the resort fee. Aside from that - no major problems. Good to know: Lots of restaurant options around the corner. From Dunkin Donuts and McDonalds for breakfast to Mexican, Chinese, Steak, Italian... all within two minutes drive of the hotel. While the entrance of WDW is two minutes from the hotel as well, it takes about 25 minutes to drive to Magic Kingdom. Be prepared to shell out $30 for a cab ride if you dont take the sparse offerings of shuttle services.

The only snag was that the we couldn't check in right away, but that was due to the people staying in the room before us. Apparently they didn't feel \"check out\" times referred to them! However, the staff accomodated us as best they could by holding our bags, giving us keys to the Regency and Health clubs, so we had somewhere to relax, or change to go to the pool. I can't blame the hotel for inconsiderate guests. Our room was beautiful, very comfy beds, great views and very clean. Personally, I was very happy to see a Keurig one cup coffee maker in our room. That was very nice! The pool area is absolutely gorgeous. There are 3 pools, one of which is designated as a quiet area. They are attached to a beautiful grotto type building with waterfalls, whirlpools, small indoor pools, the health club and a bar. There is plenty of seating inside and out. Also, the poolside service was excellent. In addition there are bike rentals, paddle boats, a rock wall, sandy beach, hammocks, etc by the lake. Absolutely perfect for families; my children loved it! As for location, it is perfect for those visiting Orlando attractions, but don't necessarily want to stay on one of their properties. From our room, we could see that we were right next to the driveway for Disney. We could actually see all of Disney from the hotel. Sea World is only about 10 minutes away, it was great.

However I had a hint of things to come when the hotel receptionist who checked us in was about as welcoming as an icicle. When we pointed out that breakfast was included in our rate, she acted as though it was the greatest burden to check the system only to find out that of course it was.\u00a0 There were other issues with the reception which I'll get to later but there are serious sound issues at the hotel. The rooms ate fantastic but the doors to them are seemingly paper thin which means that every conversation that occurs in the corridor is equally audible in your room. We were woken every day by people chatting, walking etc in the corridor. Please note that we have kids aged 2 & 4 so we wake up early anyway so to be woken by other guests is really saying something.\u00a0 To add insult to injury, we returned back from the theme parks mid one afternoon only to be greeted by incredibly loud drilling noise from the room above. My wife wasn't feeling great and needed to rest. When I phoned reception to complain I was told that it was maintenance work and I'd have to wait nearly 45 min for it to finish. You don't pay to stay in a hotel room to be disturbed by maintenance work. If there is necessary work then the very least the hotel should do is warn you of the potential disturbance or clear adjacent rooms to the work. After numerous calls telling reception that this was an unsatisfactory situation, a very helpful man called Brian asked the work to stop and provided us with $100 credit. This went some way to compensate but still left us with a very bitter taste in our mouths.\u00a0 The final straw was when we checked out. The reception tried to charge us extra for using the Internet despite the fact that the resort fee that we had paid for was meant to include this. They tried to argue that our resort fee was a reduced rate and therefore didn't include it! This was never explained to us and so having spoken to the manager they waived it. We then looked again at the bill and they had charged us for breakfast and didn't include the $100 credit! This was rectified but was yet another unnecessary hassle.\u00a0 So- this is a great looking hotel, lovely rooms, facilities and location. However and this is a big however- there are big problems with the acoustics and the reception fee management is undoubtedly questionable.\u00a0 I think it's possible that our case might have been unusual but I think it's only fair to share our experience.

I took a little time to tour the property and it was worth it. There is a golf course, a little western themed areas for kids in the summer, beautiful landscaping, a lake where you can take advantage of all kinds of watersports and even a fire pit to spend sitting by the fire on a cool evening. Good food at the restaurants there, too. The lobby is beautiful and even has two tropical birds to entertain you.

It is very close to Downtown Disney but because it was built before DTD, there is no conveinent pathway there. You have to go past the front gate onto Apoka and Vineland, walk until you get to Hotel Boulavard. This takes over half an hour to walk. There are no shuttles to DTD and a cab is about $12. For the $22 a day \"resort fee\" there should be a shuttle that goes there, if only a couple of times a day. The bus that goes to the Disney Ticket and Transportation Centre runs only twice a morning, thats it. It returns twice in the evening only. A cab costs about $25 without tip. The staff is very pleasant and efficent, but you need to ask very direct questions as they are not forthcoming with information. The reason I titled this is because I think the balconies are hazardous for toddlers and small/overactive kids if they're not watched 24/7. The hotel goes very high, 17 stories and the balcony railings (outside the room and inside facing the atrium) are only waist high. This would get very tiring for parents constantly being on alert. If a person is afraid of heights, ask for a groundfloor room or go else where. The \"general store\" was almost never opened and the nearest sundries/snack store is 7/11 a 5- 10 minute walk from the front gate. If you need milk in the middle of the night or a bag of chips, this is your only option, unless you order very expensive room service. Rooms are a very modern design that has little privacy if you have kids. The shower has only a half glass door, toilet and sink are all in same room. You can't lock the bathroom door!! It has a very strange sliding door that also opens the closet, making it very inconveninent. Everything is a very open, miniumal modern concept that looks great in magazines but really lacks functionality and practicality with kids.

But upon reading poor reviews, I get there's been a change in the recent past. On the positive side - I like the modern decor. Check in was quick with friendly people, champagne is a nice touch. Concierge, bellhops, valet, room service, wake-up call people all polite, friendly, helpful. The landscaping is beautiful. On the negative side - The shower! There's only half a door. No matter how careful we tried to be, every shower led to the floor and bathmat being soaked and water everywhere. No matter how hot the water, and even if the bathroom door is closed, it's still chilly. It's just a bad design. Also, trying to figure out how the shower works is a challenge. There are no hooks to hang bathrobes, and only one very short towel rack. The bathroom/closet door - it's a sliding door, so either the bathroom is closed or the closet is closed but you can't close (or open) both at the same time. It's an accident waiting to happen, and it's annoying. Despite the fact that the decor is pretty and looks newly done, there's a certain shabbiness to areas that is noticeable. In the open elevator, you can see beams and structures need a good paint job. Overall the pool area is beautiful but it needs more attention with general upkeep. The only restaurant we went to was the Palm Cafe when we first arrived. We walked in and it looked like it was closed. Thinking we'd get service outside, we walked out and were told by a waiter that we ordered inside and they brought it out. So we went back in, ordered and went back out. (We saw this scenario repeated with many people, all wandering by us asking where they were suppose to order.) The only open table had not been cleaned - 3 beer cans and the surface was obviously not wiped. The food came out pretty quickly and while the basic order was right, details were not (toppings, etc.). The waiter was about to walk away without taking the beer cans, so we called him back. The maid service was so-so. I always had to look at the beds to see if they'd come because they never neatened up the dresser area. I know they don't want to touch things but we've been in enough hotels to know what it should look like. I never saw a card to indicate whether we wanted the sheets changed, and they were not changed. I spilled soda on a pillow case and noticed that night that it was not changed. Also, each consecutive night (3) the sheets got more and more loose. THE SPA - If you look forward to a good hotel spa, this isn't it. I only went for a pedicure but talked to others in our group that did massages and facials. The odd thing is we were all very happy with the person who provided whatever service we got. But the spa itself looks just like an old nail place in a strip mall. No decor, no ambiance, badly in need of paint and a new ceiling (water damage), mismatched furniture, general shabbiness and old equipment. A TV was on the whole time, and staff used their cell phones. Definitely not a spa atmosphere! It really looks like an old Walmart nail salon rather than a Hyatt spa.

I LOVE the Grand Cypress, always have. You probably picked up on a little animosity from the title of my review. I'll get the ugly stuff out of the way quickly. The combination of the resort fee AND a parking fee has crossed the line of what I consider good business. Parking should be included in the resort fee. Do a comparison to other hotels in the area... You aren't going to find BOTH fees being leveraged by more than one or two properties. Not even Disney, the KING of capitalism, charges for parking when you are a guest at their hotel. So, why charge it at Grand Cypress?? My recommendation, include the parking charge with the resort fee and even consider making the resort fee an optional add-on. For those guests that are going to use the services it includes, it's actually a really great deal. But, when you levy it without giving your guest a choice, it should just be rolled into the rate--period. OK, enough of the gripes regarding recent changes. If you are looking for an exceptionally pleasant place to hang your hat, Grand Cypress is wonderful for doing so. The staff are really great here and try to make your stay memorable as much as they can. The rooms are comfortable, but not overwhelming. The recent renovation took the hotel from a \"Key West\" style motif to a more modern look and appeal. Overall, I like what they changed. Love the birds in the lobby atrium--Kula has always been my favorite!! The pool is unique and a great place to spend a day. Plenty of activities to try out and the tennis courts are EXCELLENT here! How many hotels have clay courts you can play on?? (not many!) Playing tennis on clay courts makes the resort fee worth it by itself, but then again, I'm a tennis player and appreciate it. I still think the resort fee should be optional to give guests a choice. Food and beverage at Grand Cypress doesn't disappoint, but I will say that the Regency Club appears to be declining in quality and offerings. Grand Cypress used to be able to even pride themselves as being one of the only properties in the Hyatt system to offer a complimentary cocktail on their Club floor (which should be the standard), but even they have gone the other way and now charge for drinks. Oh well.... I've never used the buses for the parks, but it's nice to have the option if you don't want to drive. For the staff--well done! For the management--reconsider your recent changes in policies and operations.

This was my second Hyatt stay in the past couple of months. (the last in Tampa ) I have to say, Hyatt has customer service down to a science and all the big chains could take more than a few lessons from them. When we mentioned that friends we coming to visit us for the time we were there, but staying somewhere else, they handed me free parking passes for them. It was also mentioned that this was our 29th anniversary and magically, an hour later, champagne and chocolate strawberries appeared in our room! When I called with a question or to thank the desk for our treat , they answered my call , \"Hello Mrs Sarine, is there some we can help you with?\". Once again, customer service to the top! Robes and slippers were delivered without asking. Very nice! Every, and I mean every, employee we passed in the hallways or lobbies or pool area, always greeted us with a smile and asked if we were having a good time and did we need anything! Unheard of! We had made reservations for their famous Sunday buffet and what a treat that was! We have been on many cruises and none of them equaled the presentation and selection and taste that this experience did! We stayed for 3 1/2 hours sipping champagne and listening to beautiful piano music! All of this included in the price! Upon leaving, our table servers gave us hugs and wished us many more years of happiness! Never has any restaurant done that! All in all, the building , the amenities, the service, the people, the food, ( we also ate the night before at the white horse. Fabulous !!), was over the top!

The attendants at the pool area are excellent as well. They are quick to fetch your drinks or food and can answer just about any question you have regarding the hotel.

Try to take time and eat at Hemmingway\u2019s. The atmosphere is very quiet and nice. Take time to have a drink at the intimate bar or even sit out on the patio (it is screened so you don\u2019t have to worry about the bugs at night.

I researched and researched and looked at practically every review on tripadvisor before finally settling. I still had reservations but this resort was ranked extremely high so I went with it. With that being said: Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress is absolutely gorgeous! From the walk through the front door to the room itself. The lobby area is amazing. Upon arrival at 9:30pm we received a glass of champagne and check in was fast. (however the night staff couldn't give much information in regards to transportation besides their shuttle which only left like once a day). When we got to our 10th floor room I was truly stunned at how clean it was. Not amazingly clean, but very clean. I found a stain on one of my pillows that looked like marker (not like body fluid or anything). There was a small stain on the chaisse lounge chair but nothing so bad I couldn't look over it. I absolutely loved that the shower was NOT directly next to the toilet. For some reason that just grosses me out. The toilet was in its own private little space. The tub was cool but only had one door that swung out. LOL! kind of weird. The bathroom door and closet door are one in the same. *Watch your hand when closing it though because I smashed mine :( We had a poolside view along with a view of Epcot so we were able to watch the firework show every night! (You don't have to get a poolside view to see the show though you can just stand in the hallway) We took a tour of the entire resort at night and it was breathtaking. My 4 year old son had a ball going up and down on the glass elevator. There are so many beautiful waterfalls and exotic plants and trees to see. Merlot the bird is gorgeous! The pools are freezing even though they saiy its heated. That was really only the part I didn't care for. The beachfront is so beautiful. We did the paddleboats for about 10 minutes but our legs started hurting so we had to turn around. Transportation: Really does suck as far as the resort goes. They have a shuttle that takes you to Disney at 8:10a and 10a and comes back at 6p and 9:45p and to Seaworld at 9:15p. Thanks to the day crew concierge we were able to figure out that Lynx bus runs right around the corner from the resort every 30-35 minutes on the hour. You just have to know how to to work it. $2 bucks each way and kids ride free. Since the resort was such a long walk to the front we called the Resort shuttle to pick us up from the security desk every night to take us back up to the resort. We did the same thing when we wanted to go out for the day. Food: We only ate the breakfast buffet once and it's good but not the greatest. Not sure it's worth $21. They did have a nice variety though. They were doing construction on the rooms but we didn't notice any noise. The staff were very friendly.

In addition, I was not informed upon check in that there was a fee for parking. I did not find out until my wife joined me on the last day and they told her. I feel that $22 for a resort fee and $11 to self park is absolutely ridiculous and price gouging. For the extra $33/night I will choose to stay in different resort going forward. It is a shame because the Grand Cypress is a great property. The highlight of the stay was Rafael at the front desk.

At check-in it was obvious that the hotel was not busy, so we asked for a room with a nice view. The front desk person was very nice and gave us our key card and a complimentary glass of champagne. We arrived in our room opened the curtains and found that our view was of the parking lot, back down to the front desk my husband went. Second room did have a much better view. As for the room, we found it comfortable and the bathroom to be nicely updated. I have to agree with another post that commented that the bathroom was not cleaned properly; there was black hair on the floor, totally disgusting. We did have adequate towels and toiletries. We also called for an item we forgot and it was brought to the room quickly. The shower is very nice. Also, the rooms are either paper thin or people have no respect for others. We could hear the family next to us yelling and carrying on at 12am on 2 seperate occasions. We ate at the White horse twice and both times my meal arrived cold, but I fell in love with the waitress Marcella, she was a doll! She was fun and sincere and we just loved her, so we just let the food being cold and taking forever go the first night, by the second visit we were completly annoyed and had to ask for a manager. We arrived before a family of 4 and they had ordered, eaten and left the restraunt before we even received our meal. The issue was addressed by the manager, the servers were the only thing keeping it from being a terrible experience. The grounds and the pool were fantastic! My husband and I enjoyed the paddle boats, the bikes (first time out my bike had a flat tire), played ping pong (they charge .25 for the ball, LOL), and stayed at the pool as much as possible. The pool has a 2 slides and on one of the days there was barely anyone at the pool and we joined some other adults and had a great time on the large slide. The pool service was great! They have a quiet area and as a couple traveling this really appealed to us (just wish those with children would pay attention to the signs). As others have mentioned, forget about the shuttle, totally inconvienent. Leaves 2 times in the morning and comes back 2 times in the evening. We went to the Halloween event at Magic Kingdom and ended up having to take the towncar. It was $25 one way, we then had to take a taxi back at midnight, that was about $18, add the tip in and we paid almost $60 round trip. We still figure that between the car rental fee, disney parking fee and hotel parking fee it, it ended up being about the same. Most of the employees we met and received service from were awesome!

The hotel has recently been renovated, and the rooms include a nice flat screen TV, comfortable beds and linens, and a little balcony where if you are on the back end of the building you can sit out and see the fireworks at Disney. Contrary to what a previous review stated every staff member we encountered was helpful and informative. They even gave us a welcome glass of champagne at check in which I found to be a nice touch. The lobby of the hotel is quite impressive with the soaring atrium which is open all the way up the 18 floors of the hotel. The hotel is located a short walk to literally 50 restaurants and an easy drive to all the sights in Orlando. The best part of the resort however is all the things to do. They have a wonderful pool, with a small slide, and a slightly larger one, and it is open 24 hours, except when lightning is in the area. The hotel is on its own lake, and they have pedal boats, windsurfing etc available (included in the resort fee, which I will discuss later) They also have an extensive jogging trail, a pitch and putt course along the lake, and bikes that you can take all around the property. We did not plan on golfing but they had a fantastic special for $79 for hotel guests which included unlimited golf (we played 27 holes) rental clubs, shoes, 6 golf balls and transportation to the 45 holes of Jack Nicklaus golf at the Grand Cypress Golf club. The reason I said it was almost perfect though is because of the fees. I booked on priceline so I was not aware of the fees before I booked, we did get a terrific rate of $70 per night on priceline, but you do have to pay $22 resort fee, and either $23 for valet parking or $11 for self parking (the lot is easy to find, and unless you are really unlucky should not be more than a 5 minute walk to the elevators). I really hate that so many hotels are now doing this, I for one would never book a hotel directly that had a resort fee. Having said that compared to many hotels that offer very little for the resort fee, you do get bike rentals, paddle boat rentals, free use of the pitch and putt, local calls, wired internet so there is some potential for value, but the vast majority of guests probably dont use those on a daily basis. If you are planning on staying in Orlando to enjoy the beautiful weather then I would highly recommend this property, if however you are going primarily to explore the parks I would save some money and look for a little more cost effective property without the resort or parking fees.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cgreat swimming pool and jacussi\u201d", "Author": "mango34", "ReviewID": "UR118674218", "Content": "excelent place to stay. it was a pity that Hemingway restaurant was not open yet.

But the bad points are much longer: The first negative was trying to find the parking lot. They had 2 or 3 signs that we passed pointing ahead to 'self parking', but then nothing to actually indicate where it actually was, so we drove by it twice before guessing that it was one of the turns that we had passed because it had a gate further down the road. I would think that an actual sign posted at the entrance to the parking lot might be a good idea. Next was dealing with the front desk staff. They were all very young and very clueless. They didn't have our room ready despite reserving a month earlier and calling a week earlier to confirm. Now this wasn't at 1pm, this was at 7pm, and it was, according to a staff member, their slowest week of the year. During this early experience and all subsequent dealings with the front desk staff we fully learned how incompetent they were. The room decor was awful. Before reading that it was actually a recent upgrade, I truly thought it was some really old out of style stuff desperate for an upgrade. Then I read that it actually looked that way intentionally! Now I'm not very stylish, but I'm pretty sure that the Brady Bunch living room look is not the current style. It reminded me of stepping into my aunts 'funky' 1970s living room in her trailer when I was little. I could almost smell the incense burning. The 'Disney Shuttle' is a joke. Despite basically being on Disney property, they only had one or 2 trips to Disney each day. So you either go on their time schedule or you're out of luck. The maid service was also bad. Maybe I'm picky about maid service, but to find 8-inch hairs still in the sink and wet washcloths on the floor of the shower after a cleaning doesn't impress me. One day after having ice in the bucket the night before, we returned after the cleaning to find that the maid had returned the bucket to its spot on the dresser, but still with the melted dirty water from the prior night. And if you like new soap each day forget it. After using the same soap for 4 days I finally threw out the stub that was left and still got no replacement. I had to go grab some from the maid's cart myself. Of course I can't neglect to complain about the fees. Even with our great $116 AAA rate, the $22 resort fee, 12.5% taxes and $12 parking fee took it to over $160/nt. That's almost a 40% tax in my opinion which is absurd. Has anyone seen any other property that charges a resort fee AND a parking fee? In the end, the real downside of this place is the terrible service. I think my girlfriend described this place perfectly at one point when she said that it seemed like the actual staff had taken a vacation and it was now being run by their children. (One of the staff members actually told me she was 17 years old) I just cancelled my next reservation that I had planned here for next month and will be staying somewhere else. If service is impotant to you, you should do the same.

We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and I had contacted the hotel about a month before to advise this and that I would appreciate a nice view. I also pointed out that there seemed to be a mistake on our booking as it had it down as a double and could they please make sure it was a king. We arrived at the hotel after a long drive in very heavy rain and were greeted with a glass of champagne which was very nice, and wished a happy anniversary, so obviously the receptionist could see the notes and my request. We therefore thought everything was ok, however this is where it went down hill. Firstly we were informed of the 18 dollars per night mandatory charge for the hotel services, which I informed the person that we would not use as we were only there for 4 nights and were most of the day and evening at disney and universal, however we were told that we had to pay. IF ITS A MANDATORY CHARGE THEN PUT IT IN YOUR NIGHTLY RATES. It's just a way of the advertising a lower room rate that it actually is. Second. We then arrived at our room to find 2 beds and not a king as requested, to add to this we were given a room on the side of the hotel that was being painted so we had ropes outside our room and were not allowed to open the doors, which meant we could not watch the fireworks. Add to this the noise during the day and having to keep the curtains pulled as the workers could see in. We did complain but were told this was the only room, I am sure what they meant to say is that this was the only room in this level and they would not upgrade. All in all out of all the hotels we stayed at on the east coast tour this was the worst, and although I am a Hyatt member I will never use them again....THANKS FOR RUINING OUR ANNIVERSARY.

Used the Mears Transportation Shuttle from the Orlando Airport (reserve online $34 pp rt) we didn't rent a car since other family members had one. We arrived a few days earlier than family and stayed extra day than other family members, so we were at the hotel without transportation but it wasn't a factor for us. Did notice that the self parking lot got full and people parked on resort road, maybe to avoid the fee. It should be noted that people who are not staying at the hotel (Villa owners) can have a membership to use the services at the Pool , tennis, golf, so parking for them is pay service. Should consider waving the fee for hotel guests. We took advantage of all the services of the hotel. Pool area was lovely. Towel exchange for card setup. There are folks who put out stuff to reserve lounges but after a few hours people start realizing nobody is using them and moving the stuff to one chair, so if you reserve a lounge be there to use it. Lake with beach area great for little ones to play in sand, hammocks, boats, bikes, small golf course. Recreation staff very good. You can purchase pool floats and inner tubes for around $10, but if you bring them deflated from home they will inflate for you. Children (adults too) love the 2 slides, waterfalls and the rickety bridge. Took lessons at the Tennis Acadamy with Lynn, who was wonderful and patient with us. Concerige (Jannelle?) able to get us tickets to parks and answer every question and request. Check in was fast and efficent, offered champagne, Mariann explained everything about the resort fee ($22) and the layout of the resort complex. Took the hotel shuttle to the Golf Clubhouse (lovely place) for dinner at Nine18 (great food at country club prices). Breakfast buffet ($21) at Cascades was popular with great and friendly staff (Greg). Palm Cafe serves some great sandwiches and snacks ($$). Food and drinks are expensive but your on vacation live it up within your budget. If you want you can get the shuttle to and from the guard gate and walk to lots of nearby chain restaurants(Olive Garden, Dennys, Sizzler, Pizza Hut,etc) and a 7-11. We did and saved some on meals like dinner. Most of our other meals were out at the parks or the surrounding restaurants. We did not use the shuttle for WDW. Room - rates were good for the area, we got a special by taking advantage of a Hyatt package. Amy our housekeeper was so helpful as was Hotel Engineering. We had a room AC problem they explained could not be fixed immediately so they quicky moved us to a new room. Where we had a AV problem with the movie ordering service (outside vendor) - again Engineering quicky responded and did their best to explain and tried to fix the problem. To be honest we weren't at the hotel to watch movies so it wasn't a huge thing. The rooms were tastefully decorated in a contemporary style. Nice soft beds (pilllows were to soft/flat for my preference). Coffee and tea making supplies and had a cooler to keep your water chilled. Cooler is not a refigerator but after a few hours warm drinks were cold. The rooms have AV and computer hookups,where you can charge your camera, iphone, nook. WiFi included in resort fee. If you go up to 18th floor of Atrium you can see the fireworks. Unless your going to spend 24/7 in the room I don't think it matters which view you get, Buena Vista, Lake or Pool. The only problem we had with the room style was the closet/bathroom door. Door panel slides to cover one or the other so if someone is at the closet and someone is leaving the bathroom well you end up banging into someone. Staff - I cannot begin to express how friendly, helpful ALL the staff were. Every staff member said \"hello\" or \"good morning/afternoon\". After a few days they know your name and greet you by it. Showed genuine interest in how things were with you, hows your vacation?, did you have fun at the parks?, etc. Requests taken care of efficently. Staff was very professional.

I had to attend a wedding on Sunday. I arrived at the front gate and had to be verified as a guest to be allowed in and I then proceeded to the self parking lot ($11 per night or $30.00 for valet) and drove by it. I recommend to the hotel to have a large sign noting it on the main drive. After parking I made the 10 min walk to the main lobby. The hotel was busy on this holiday weekend, but I was checked in and on my way to the room with in 10 min of getting to the front desk with my complimentary glass of champagne. I arrived to my room to find that it had not been cleaned properly. While the bed was made and the room appeared clean, on closer look you could tell the room had not been vacuumed from the past guests. Food, nail clippings, clothes tags and other dirt was on the rug. The surfaces of the dresser, desk & bath marble had not been cleaned either. So I picked up the phone and explained the issues to the front desk and I was quickly assigned a new room with several apologies by the manager and clerks. My new room was fine and clean! The room itself was a nice. It featured a king size bed, desk, plenty of storage and the room was a corner unit offering 2 balconies overlooking the pool and Walt Disney World. The bathroom had a standup rain shower, large sink and vanity and separate toilet space. In addition the room also featured a large screen T.V., refrigerator and safe (which is nice to store valuables). The bed was fine and very comfortable. Noise from the hall and room next to me was loud. There were many families with many kids that get up early :) The best feature of this hotel was its pool area. The pool is huge offering large waterfalls, 2 water slides and many whirlpools. The resort also has several water sports (sailing, paddle boats, canoes, etc) on its lake. There are several other options worth looking into while you are there. The resort does charge a fee of $20.00 per day for this. It clearly is spelled out during booking at the Hyatt site and before you check in. The staff I encountered was extremely friendly and always greeting you in the halls, etc. I did eat a few meals on the property and the quality was fine and they have several eating options, fast casual or fine dining. For a great breakfast check out their buffet. A few issues I do have with the hotel: - The hotel needs a main bar area as a focal point. They have 2 bars as I could tell - one small one in the lobby and a \u201csports\u201d bar that was out of the way and never busy. - The walk from the self parking is long and can be far depending how full the lot is. I returned late one night only to find the lot was full and I had to park on the main driveway in the bike path with others. The lot is also gated. You need your room key to get in or out. - I could never get an internet connection on my wireless device. I did not say anything as I did not really need to use it, but it is part of the $20.00 resort fee. Overall this is a great place to stay and be your base as you visit the local attractions. You are about 10 min from Downtown Disney and 20 min to the main parks.

The hotel is part of the 1500 acre Grand Cypress complex, which also includes the Villas at Grand Cypress and several golf courses. The hotel was built in 1984 and was one of the first major \"off property\" resorts in the Disney World area. Overall, this is a great hotel, with clean, well appointed rooms, wonderful (if expensive) restaurants, a great atrium lobby, a great pool complex, and lots of available activites. The Disney Parks are all about 15-20 away by car, Sea World and Universal are just a bit farther. My first visit to this hotel was over 20 years ago, not long after it open, when I was a kid visiting Disney World (while my Dad was attending a conference at the hotel). I was fortunate enough to end up at this hotel via Priceline about 5 years ago, and once again got the hotel via Priceline on my most recent trip. The are three pools at the hotel. The smaller pool is heated and has a small water slide; the larger pools are connected by a swim through, under the rocks passageway; one has a larger water slide. Durring our stay in late August the pools in general were not that crowded, and the kids were able to go down the slides as often as they liked. There are lots of other activities available at the hotel - including a rock climbing wall, a fitness center, bikes, walking and jogging trails, and even sailboats. They are all included in the resort fee. The hotel is designed as three wings that seperate off the large, full atrium lobby which extends the full height of the hotel. The recent $45 million renovation (completed in 2009) improved one of our few complaints with our last visit - the very dated tropical themed rooms have now been updated with a sleek, contemporary look. If you visit, make sure to check out the hotel's extensive art collection - there are elegant statues and other works of art located throughout the hotel grounds - the large jade sailing ship in the lobby is espcially impressive. The lobby birds (a Macaw and Cockatoo) were also favorites of the kids. Still, there are a few complaints and quirks with the hotel. The renovated rooms are generally very nice but have a few problems - the combination bathroom/closet door is a terrible design - by Dad (who stayed in a seperate room) caught his finger in it, and I got hit by it while looking in the closet as someone else came out of the bathroom. The vanity looks great, but it's a free standing unit so it's easy for small items to fall off the sides (and nearly impossible to retrieve them). Our unit had a bathtub with only a half door - the back half was open to the rest of the bathub without even a curtain - this isn't a great design in a room with kids and a detachable spray nozzle in the tub. The most serious complaint is a near total lack of electrical outlets in the room - there is a high tech looking set of connections to the TV (altough does anyroom really need to plug in an HDMI connection to the hotel room TV) - but nearly no useable outlets in the room. The nightstands were also very small, and there was no table between the two beds in our room. The TV looked nice, but only had standard def channels, but your missing the point if you visit Orlando to watch TV. There are also some issues with the overall layout of the hotel. There's no easy way to get to the pool. You'll need to take the atrium elevators down to the lobby, walk across the lobby along the edge of bar area, and then down a flight of steps to the pool level. Alterantively you can take another elevator, but this requires walking through a restaurant. It's not terrible, but it's not great area, espcially if you kids plan on visiting the pool often. The self-parking lot is also poorly located. I guess the original idea was to have guests park in the main underground lot up front, which has elevators that come directly up to the lobby, but this lot is now valet only (and thus very expensive). For those not on expense acounts the self parking lot is further back, and requires a walk through the conference area of the hotel to get to the lobby. The kids didn't mind the walk much, but I can't imagine the conference attendees really appreciated the regular flow of kids back from Disney World through their events. In addition, the self parking lot was originally free (and open) until recently, the conversion to a pay lot seems haphazard; it now takes even longer to get in and out of, and the card reader system didn't seem to work well (my parents needed a replacement card to get out of the lot, and there were often waits getting in and out of the lot as people needed to repeatedly swip to get the readers to work). It was bad enough that there was often a hotel employee sitting in a card that seemed semi-permanently assigned to the lot just to keep it working, and at other times the exit gate was just left open. And of course, self parking is no longer free - it's $11 per night. Parking fees are becomming more common in the area (although parking is free at the Disney properties), but it's still an added expense you'll needed to factor in. A larger expense is the resort fee - which is $22 per day. It does include a lot of stuff (boat and bike rentals, fitness center, a great pool complex) but all told it's an extra $33 per day beyond the room rate (plus tax) that most guests will need to spend to stay here. Overall, I've enjoyed staying at the Hyatt Grand Cypress and would recommend to guest visitng Disney World - but I'd also consider other options for our next visit. At first glance it seems much cheaper than staying at a comparable Disney resort, when you factor in the fees and parking at the Disney parks ($14 per day, but free if your staying at a Disney property) things get a lot closer. If your paying full price for the Hyatt it might not be worth it, but unlike the Disney resorts there's also deals available for Hyatt (or, if your like us, you'll be able to get it through Priceline, where it's a real bargain). The other major consideration for families is the room layout. The Hyatt is almost entierely traidtionally designed rooms, with either two double beds or a single king. Our kids were young enough that this worked out OK, but for families with older kids (or more than 2 kids) there are many suite properties in this price range that would probably be a better choice (which is probably what we'll chose on our next visit). Still, overall the Hyatt is a great property in a great location, and if it fits your needs (and you can get a good deal on it) it's definately recommended.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Choice for Off Property Disney Location!!\u201d", "Author": "tlhighfield", "ReviewID": "UR117534658", "Content": "This was our second trip in a year and we love this place!

Our kids wanted a resort experience in addition to going to Disney and they got what they wanted. The hotel is immaculate and the grounds and gardens are impeccable. The pool was great and we loved the slides and waterfalls. There were plenty of high end lounge chairs and seats so seating at the pool was not a problem. We enjoyed the resort activities when not in Disney including the pitch & putt golf and kayaking/sailing. Everyone was nice and professional and it has a very high end feel. They cater to business travelers as well and you could see the difference vs a family only hotel. The rooms are basic and nothing special but have nice bathrooms. the double beds are small so be prepared to get cozy with your significant other. We have kids so we needed the room with 2 doubles. We asked for a Lake view and were given one even though we paid for a garden view which was nice. We even could see the Disney fireworks at night from the room. The only caveat is the transportation to Disney. There are 2 shuttles, which are actually city buses from an outside company, in the morning. They only take you to the transportation center at Disney and then you have to find your way to the parks. Its OK for Magic Kingdom since its right where the bus drops you off but the other parks require you to get on a Disney bus which we found very crowded at times. There is also no shuttle to Disney in the afternoon from the hotel so you are forced to take the car service used at the hotel. A few days we went back and forth to Disney and paid about $100 in car service and taxi fees. If you don't rent a car, then be prepared to either spend the day in Disney and wait for the return shuttle at 6pm or pay to use a taxi. THE HOTEL REALLY NEEDS TO ADD A SHUTTLE TO DISNEY IN THE AFTERNOON AND AN EARLIER RETURN AT 4PM. If you want to go to Disney at night to see the fireworks you're going to pay for it. Just make sure you rent a car since Magic Kingdom is not really close to the hotel. That was the one mistake we made. Just to add, the food in the hotel is expensive and caters to the high end diner. There really wasn't anything our kids would eat on the menus at the 2 restauarnts we looked at. There is a cafe to order burgers and sandwiches but we couldn't find anyone to help us after 7:30pm. We used room service a few times and it was great and quick. I will add that we had room service breakfast one morning and it was incredible. We ate in the restaurant another morning and the food was not good. The breakfast buffet at $22 was terrible and very low end. It should have been an $11 breakfast not $22. For $22 I should see a crepe station, omelet station and belgian waffle maker. There was a women in this closed in area making pancakes and she looked like she would rather be somewhere else. You can walk to Denny's or Mcdonalds if you have time in the morning but its a bit of a pain crossing the roads to get there. All in all its a great hotel with a great resort experience.

I am a hotel snob and spent days researching hotels in the area and settled on the Hyatt Grand Cypress. I found the $22/day resort fee to be acceptable with all the amenities offered but was turned off by the $11/day parking fee. If they need the extra money I feel they should put it in the room rates. The parking lot isn't super close and its on the property. I can understand hotels that are downtown charging this but felt a little frustrated they were. We arrived and I was in awe of the gorgeous hotel. The wait at the desk was only a few minutes and they upgraded my room to lake view for no additional charge. They never disclosed to me that they would be putting a hold on my card for $75 a day for incidentals. I found this to be extremely high and had to wonder how people staying a week or 2 could afford this. We are a credit card free family and therefore I ended up having $225 held out of my bank account for 4 days. We went straight to our room and it was beautiful. My only complaint was the bathroom and lack of privacy it offered. The shower door makes you feel as though you are on display and no others can get ready while you are showering. Now my only SERIOUS issue with the hotel was this.... our bathroom had tons of hair on the floor in the toilet area. It was out in the open and disgusting. Since we arrived at 7pm and it was my sons bedtime I went down to report this but asked them not to come to the room until the next day. I was a little disappointed that the staff didn't even seem concerned that the room wasn't clean. As for the grounds? Gorgeous. There was so much to do and I felt we needed a lot more time. The pool is a lot of fun, our favorite place was hanging out in the caves. The resort fee is worth it when you consider all the activities you get to enjoy. We took out the bikes, a paddle boat, Kayaks, went swimming and went golfing. We didn't eat a the restaurants as I felt all were extremely pricey. I understand that it is inline with 4 star hotels but even the higher end Disney resorts offer lower price options. We did eat chicken by the pool for lunch one day (our family shared 2 chicken tender baskets for $24 after the $3 delivery charge and tip).

The pool area, I was glad to see, had plenty of lounge chairs. I liked the fact that you had to give them cards to collect towels at the pool. To get your card back, you have to turn in the towel. This keeps people from leaving a towel on a chair even after they have left the pool area. The thing I didn't like was $16 poolside drinks. C'mon, even if you can afford it you still feel ripped off. Lower the price and you will sell more drinks. The golfing with the kids was great, too, as was the trails and bike-riding. I did not mind the $22 resort fee, as all the amenities made it well worth the price.

I guess I will begin at check-in; our room was not ready as we arrived way early but with a combined effort from Anna and Fred they found us a great room and a glass of champagne. This is a huge hotel and the grounds are beautiful, the lobby was wonderful with the birds and all the staff asking if they could help with anything, special thanks to Steve Ballot as we asked him for help on more than several occasions in the lobby. My wife and I had the best crab cake sandwich and Caesar salad in the Palm Caf\u00e9 (twice) a little pricy but you\u2019re on vacation. The pool is great for whatever your needs are quit time, kids pool with small slide and this one is heated, and large pool with waterslide and water volleyball. Now our room was great the first night two double beds and plenty of room for the four of us. There was an air conditioner issue with the whole hotel but I must say the staff handled it very well knowing some guest would not be happy. I cannot credit Fred Ditto enough for his great attitude and willingness to try his best to make people happy. Rooms facing the pool can view the fireworks each night but you can take the elevators to any floor above 8 and look at the fireworks through the big glass windows. We would go to the parks in the morning and then be back to the hotel pool and yes lounge chairs are hard to find but not impossible we found 3 or 4 together each of the 6 days we were there. We did take advantage of the Regency Club, a bit crowded but great breakfast, cookies during the day and hors d\u2019oeuvres and drinks at night. I do have two negative comments on this beautiful hotel but by no means would stop me from coming back but I read enough reviews that I feel I must have full discloser.

We have a pool and live on a golf course but it was fun to get away for the weekend and \"play tourists\". I was really looking forward to sitting by the pool and having someone serve me for a change. lol The resort is beautiful as all of the reviews have stated. Our room was great and I love that every room has a balcony...it was tiny but just the fact that you have sliding doors & a little area to step out onto is really nice. There is also what the hotel calls a \"cool box\" in every room. They won't call it a fridge because I guess they think it doesn't get cold enough so there is a sticker on the inside of it stating that it's for \"medicinal\" purposes. I put a few cans of soda in ours & it was perfect. Kept them nice & cold and was really convenient being that there are no coke machines around. The resort fee is well worth it, the kids did the rock climbing, we went out on the lake in the paddle boats, and my husband & son did the pitch n putt golf twice. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly. I only have 2 complaints. The pool area is beautiful and of course everyone wants one of the nice cushioned chairs under an umbrella by the pool. Our first day out to the pool, we found a spot easily because we didn't check in until about 3pm so by the time we got down there, lots of people had already gone in for the day...probably to get ready for dinner and such. Well, I didn't realize what a hot commodity these seats were. We didn't get to the pool until around 11am on Saturday & there wasn't a spot to be found. Don't believe the signs that state you can't save chairs and that your \"stuff\" will be removed from them after an hour of inactivity. I sat in what felt like \"steerage\" (a chair with vinyl slats-no cushion-no umbrella) all day. I kept an eye on one pair of loungers with 2 fun noodles and towels on them and they weren't touched all day. When I went up at 6pm, they were still there. My husband said that when he went to golf the next morning at 9am, every single lounge chair had a towel or beach bag on it...but very few people on them. It's unfortunate that people are so selfish and rude. As far as I could see, there is no staff enforcing this \"rule\" so it just perpetuates the problem. Obviously people learn after their first day there to go down & put your stuff on a lounger as soon as you wake up. Even the day we checked in, we only used up 2 loungers, even though the two next to us were open because I don't feel like my kids should use them up. They are pretty much in the pool & on the slides the whole time. My other complaint is the price of drinks. Holy cow! I know this is a resort & I fully expect to pay more than \"happy hour\" price at my local bar but $13 for a frozen drink & $10 for a simple vodka cranberry? That's pretty excessive in my book. A bottle of water was $4! Even at Disney, the water is only $2.50. There are several water \"stations\" around the pool outside but the water is room temperature so if you need cold water or a coke ($3) expect to shell out some serious money. Just a heads up that they also add on an 18% gratuity. I actually like this idea so I don't have to do the math or worry that I \"shorted\" the waitress, but the prices are really out of control in my opinion. Overall, the trip was nice & we would probably go back. On a side note, we went to the Bluezoo restaurant at the Dolphin hotel for my \"birthday\" dinner. I woke up at 5am with major food poisoning (don't get the fish!) My poor husband had to pack us all up and get us checked out while I spent every second in the bathroom & then hurried through the lobby & out to the car with a plastic bag for the ride home...thank goodness it was only a 30 minute ride!", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stokesley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDon't hesitate book your Orlando stay at the Hyatt!\u201d", "Author": "Camber123", "ReviewID": "UR116435072", "Content": "I stayed at the Hyatt at the end of July with my husband and 2 sons, we all loved the hotel; we've been travelling to the states for the last 5 years and this was one of the best hotels we've stayed at.

Parking is a nuisance and comes with an $11 daily charge, restaurants and snacks are ridiculously priced, and although close to the parks, you still need to drive and park there.

I got an email from the hotel to make sure I was set with our reservations (from the Hyatt Concierge) and to see if we needed anything else. They answered my questions via email and called on our check-in day to see if we needed to have connecting rooms or just side by side. The Front Desk Manager (I think it was Jimmy) called to let me know he was changing our rooms since I needed to have connecting rooms since our kids were with us. We arrived at 2pm and our rooms weren't ready yet (check-in is at 4pm so this is understandable). They offered us the champagne at check-in which was gladly taken!! We walked around for an hour until they called me to let me know that one of the rooms was ready. We had access to the Club Lounge which we gladly used. Saved us a boatload of $$ since all 7 of us could eat breakfast in there. They also have snacks & cookies in the afternoon, appetizers and desserts at night. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants since they were pretty pricey. Brought food, snacks, and drinks to keep in the room (made PBJ's for lunch) and we went out to eat offsite at night (Rainforest Cafe, Chilis, and ordered pizza at night). If you order pizza, they call you when its at the front date and you have to drive out there to get it which is kind of a pain, but apparently they had some security issues before so that is why that policy is in place now. I can't say enough about the pools -- was great for kids and adults. They have 3 separate pools and we stuck to the back pool with the bridge since that is where the Big Slide was. They had activities for the kids each day. Brought a cooler bag (from Sam's Club) and stocked it with water, sodas, and beer. I read reviews about how expensive drinks were so this was great for our family and kept us all fed & watered for the day. We went for a few night swims which was tons of fun --- not many hotels have a 24-hour pool!

My wife and 2 children (aged 13 &12) stayed for 12 nights earlier in July in 2 adjoining rooms. The rooms themselves are nice following the recent refurbishment and the beds are probably the most comfortable you will find in any hotel room anywhere in the world. The staff are still friendly and efficient and the pool and amenities are still the attraction they always were. The reasons we won't be back are (i) the hotel has introduced a parking charge of $11/day plus tax for self-parking since the start of July. This is an addition to the $22/day plus tax mandatory resort fee per room. This means you will be paying at least $33/day on top of your room rate (more if you valet park). I view this as little short of extortion. The resort fee up until now supposedly covered the parking costs so this represents a massive hike in costs for no increase in service. (ii) The bus service to the Disney parks has substantially reduced in terms of frequency and coverage. The old bus service used to drop off/pick up at all the Disney parks. Now the service only drops of/picks up at the Magic Kingdom transportation center. This in itself is not the deal breaker as you can use Disney's excellent transport network within Disney World but there were only 2 drop offs per day (8:50am and 10am) and the first pick up wasn't until 6pm. This meant you had to spend a minimum of 8 hours at a theme park to use this service and if you wanted to go in to the parks later in the day, forget it! Also because there were so few buses, each one was packed solid. Standing room only in most cases. On our previous visits, we used to enjoy going to the parks in the morning and then returning to the hotel for a swim or a bicycle in the afternoon. Now this is impossible with this schedule. We chose to drive and pay the $14/day Disney parking charge rather than be limited by this restrictive schedule. The $22/day resort fee looks even poorer value for money as one of its constituents is this 'bus transport'. To me, it was a service in name only. In summary, I believe this Hyatt has lost its way. It always has had large conferences running and I'm sure they bring its main revenues but the leisure travelers (such as ourselves) were also well served. Now the leisure traveler appears to be nothing more than a hindrance to its main business. They are looking to extract every last cent from the leisure visitor whilst offering the minimum possible by way of service. We stayed at a Hyatt in Anaheim in California last year and they knew who their main customers were - it had shuttles running to the parks every 30 minutes.

The resort had so much promise that fell flat due to mismanagement of staff and lack of interest in making money by providing customers with more than posh surroundings. That said the surroundings are very nice consisting of Quasi-Asian themed grounds with a huge and lovely pool with waterfalls and caverns. Nice hidden hot tubs buried though out the caves. Beach area is quaint and the golf course was fine. All well worth the extra daily $22 resort fee. Additionally, the room was clean and modern with a breathtaking dual balcony view of the pool and beach area as well as EPCOT. Sadly that is where the resort experience ends and the problems start. The place is a disorganized mess of mismanaged staff and hotel services. I hate to say this but the place is pathetic when it comes to providing value or even interest in the guests\u2019 money beyond assorted fees. The parking fee of $11 is spent on a lot that people park anywhere and anyway they please and is not secure. It was the second day of my out and about before the front gate stopped me to complain that I did not have a pass on my dashboard. I informed them that no such item was mentioned on check in but that did little to dissuade the attitude of the Yenta operating the booth. The electronic control gates to the lot were only down once the entire 3 days of my stay so anybody could come and go as they wished. Perhaps that was to facilitate the \u201cchild fetishes ball\u201d that was going on but still the lot lacked security for the extra fee. Extra fees are everywhere and you generally stumble upon them by a casual comment from staff or the fine print on a card or computer screen. $9.99 for wireless internet access & $15 for failure to return each pool towel in a timely manner, really? Every hotel I have stayed in during the last 5 years has had free wireless internet as well as paranoia free pool towels. So instead I used the complimentary wired internet as I only wanted to check for entertainment and food services in the area. I did not want to have to look for those things but that is another area the resort falls flat on. The restaurants and bars are open very odd hours and for very short periods. One lower level restaurant was closed for the high tourist summer season!?! There is not any entertainment to speak of in the resort even the piano at the lobby bar was never staffed during my weekend stay. The bar service was a joke and either poorly trained bartenders or management\u2019s policy dictates that your drink should be %90 ice and a thimble of the actual drink itself. That may work for margaritas but Tom Collins and Rummy Cokes should be slightly more drinkable at $10 a pop. The restaurant we did find open during casual hours served and excellent breakfast but we were unable to find anything beyond an over priced snack bar available during most of the day. Apparently, idle food and bar space is the norm and god forbid they should hire any local talent such as singers or DJ\u2019s to utilize the space to generate more food and bar revenue as well as entertain the guests. I have stayed in lowly Holiday and Comfort Inns that have live entertainment and they were cheap resorts! The last issue is the support staff. They are slow, constantly visible, and unsupervised. The maid\u2019s service carts were constantly in the same hallway from dawn to dusk as well as the same dirty dishes. The grounds keepers were in the way all weekend doing little other than blocking the walkways with large pipes and buckets to spread mulch in theory. Mostly the \u201cgreen card free\u201d all male ground crew just stood around in small groups eyeballing the pool area while holding their groins with both hands. That may be entertainment on Orange Blossom trail but not really that family friendly at a resort next to Disney World! I could go on but I am tired of writing as you are probably tired of reading.

I was considering the Waldorf for this vacation, but opted for the Hyatt because I thought it would be a better option for the kids. I think my choice was spot on. The Hyatt Grand Cypress is the PERFECT choice for young kids. However, it is not what I consider a luxurious hotel. The rooms were conspicuously small and just did not have the feel of a high end resort. That being said, the resort grounds are stunning and the pools are fab!! The amenities that you receive for the resort fee are well worth it. We did everything...kayaking, paddle boating, rock climbing, biking, and kid's activities at the pool. There are two slides (big and small) that the kids loved. My husband (and a lot of other husbands) also loved the big slide! I went down once and that thing is super fast.

The bellman checked all of the drawers and under the bed before we checked out (he found two shoes and a sock! :) We also booked the Regency Club which was lovely and saved us a lot of money for breakfast and snacks throughout the day. So, what I didn't like... I am not a fan of the balconies as they are not very safe for young children (in my opinion) and also not large enough to put a chair on. I also noticed a lack of attention to detail in the hotel and around the pool area. The staff should be more diligent about picking up trash on the ground. And, I really dislike dirty windows. I know that keeping windows free of dirty, sticky little hands is nearly impossible, but please make an attempt. Someone should be cleaning windows 24/7. I was not happy that the even the sliders in my room during check-in were not clean. These two little things could easily be improved upon bringing this resort up a level. Overall great vacation, but next time I'm going to try the Waldorf.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cProbably would not return...\u201d", "Author": "1970sunlover", "ReviewID": "UR115704209", "Content": "I don't want this to sound like a completely negative review, because the resort does have a LOT of positive things. Upon check in, the woman at the desk advised us she didn't have the room we requested ( mind you, we booked this 3 months prior ). We requested two double beds/pool view. Asked us if a King with a sleeper would be OK. We advised her it would NOT be OK and she basically told us we had no choice, as they were overbooked. Asked for a manager, and after waiting about 10 minutes, she emerged from the back room and said she \"found\" us a room. Also, we did get complimentary champagne at check-in, which was a nice touch. The grounds of this resort are beautiful. Attention to detail is very evident and one can tell they do take pride in this. The pool area is gorgeous. There are little streams around the pool with ducks and flowers. They just got all new wicker chairs with nice pads around the entire pool area. The pools themselves, are gorgeous. The main pool, which is not heated and some of the 9 people in our party found it to be chilly. After speaking with a returning guest, we did learn that they actually cool this pool. Apparently if they didn't, it would be around 90+ degrees and not refreshing in the 95 degree July weather. For the most part, I did find it to be refreshing, but on the cloudier days, it was chilly. Moving on to the food...we didn't have any dinners at the resort as they were very expensive. Every restaurant you could possibly want is within a five minute drive of the resort, so it wasn't a problem. However, on the days we didn't do the parks, we did grab lunch by the pool and the prices were reasonable. Drinks are definitely on the expensive side. $13 dollars for a Pina Colada/Daquiri and around $6-7 for a 12 oz. can of beer. Bring a soft sided cooler with a beer they sell there, ie: bud light, corona, etc. Much more economical. Now for the rooms....They are small. We had myself, my husband, and our 12 year old daughter, so it was a room with two doubles and it was just small. We only stay at 5 star resorts when we travel and this was very small in comparison to others we have stayed at. There are just two deep drawers to put clothes in, and the closet to hang garments. It is not enough storage for a family to unpack. Our 12 year old decided to live out of her suitcase for the week. Also, yes, the rooms are renovated and clean, however, I personally, was NOT a fan of the decor. Just TOO contemporary/cold for my liking, but to each their own. The bathrooms are nicely equipped. However, the water pressure in the shower is HORRIBLE!! Also, had to call maintenance TWICE during our stay, as the toilet decided it didn't want to flush anymore. Again, I believe this was due to the inadequate water pressure. This went for the sink as well. Brushing your teeth was a five minute ordeal. Housekeeping was fine, but nothing spectacular. Pretty much just made up the beds and gave you fresh towels. Overall, a beautiful property, but in my opinion, not five stars. 3.5-4.0 at the MOST. Also, the $11.00 per day SELF PARK is ridiculous. It is a good 10 minute walk to get your car. Unfortunatley, we didn't get to use many of the onsite amenities, as we were running around to the parks, but they DID have a lot to offer.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cooper City, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort\u201d", "Author": "Aworkingmommy", "ReviewID": "UR115635799", "Content": "One of my favorite resorts.

The pool area is congested and had to wait 15 minutes for towels one day. Attitude of staff is poor - requests a room overlooking the pool and when we were allocated the room it was in a position where another room can see in - we asked to be moved and were placed in another room which we were happy with. We unpacked our bags and noticed there was no sofa bed for our 7 year old son - we called reception and spoke with the manager who said that they were unable to put a roleaway bed in the room as it was policy and we would have to move rooms. When I said we had unpacked and I didn't want to move rooms and asked where should my son sleep the response was we can charge you for another room and he can sleep in there!! Obviously we packed up and had to move rooms - no flexability just bad attitude. Housekeeping is of a low standard - the beds are quickly made up and no vacuuming, no refilling of shampoo etc. The hotel seams to be geared up for business conferences and place holiday guests as a second priority - I would suggest that alongside the $45 million refit they should spend some money of staff training and customer service. They have just lost a long standing customer and I would not recommend this hotel if you aim to visit on holiday - maybe if you are on business!

At night it was absolute heaven to go down there and relax while browsing the net. The two birds in the lobby during the day were also a nice touch. I really loved the rooms. They felt fresh, clean, and uncluttered. The decor was modern but not so modern that it seemed cold. The colors are so comforting that I felt like I had checked into a spa. The beds were SO COMFY! You get three pillows on your pillow top bed and the linen is not hard. I believe it is of a higher thread count. I really liked having the chaise lounge by the window and the little fridge that took the place of the minibar. The bathroom was spacious enough and the shower had both a regular shower head and a hand held. The bathtub was deep enough for a soak. The amenities were I believe of a Eucalyptus scent which I didn't care much for but others might. The towels were not very soft. I went to the restaurant Cascades for breakfast. The restaurant is beautiful and clean. The food was very good. It's not cheap, but it is a lovely place to have a meal. I do recommend it. There are also several restaurant choices within close proximity to the hotel as well as a 24hr. supermarket if you want to stock your little fridge with reasonably priced snacks. The grounds are BEAUTIFUL! I felt like I had been transported to Hawaii or Bali. Rock pools, statuary, waterfalls, beautiful vegetation, a sand beach, bridges, volleyball net, boat rental, three pool areas, water slides, a rope bridge over the pool, several hot tubs, poolside refreshments,......WHEW! It was amazing. I made a point of spending time wandering the grounds or just sitting out there to enjoy the scenery. It was so beautiful out there. I can't say enough good things about it. The self-parking is a bit of a problem. There isn't enough room in that lot for a hotel of that size. Several nights I came back to the hotel and couldn't find a parking space so I had to park wherever my vehicle would fit. The hotel security was very understanding and polite about this. The walk from the parking lot is NOT far so I have no complaints there. Most of the hotel staff that I encountered were very pleasant; from the front desk, to the wait staff, and housekeeping.

We availed of the Family plan which gave us the second connecting room at half price and got the sunshine offer giving us every 4th or 5th night free - be sure to ask. That certainly helped take care of costs. We could have helped ourselves by eating away from the hotel more as it is surrounded by all sorts of both fast and medium quality resturants. I saw many people coming in with Pizza Hut and Perkins boxes . Food prices in the hotel can be quite high and unless you are dining in Hemmingways it wont be that much different from the local eateries so recomend eating out more. There is a cool box in the room which is really a mini fridge without an ice-box - certainly fine for keeping wine/beer and drinks cold. We did not realize until quite late into the trip that there is a self service laundry in the games room but remember to bring your credit card and not room key as I did first time. The pool area is fabulous but I found it a bit too hot to enjoy many of the other activities e.g. golf (which is a car drive away) etc. No need to valet park or upgrade the room unless you really want something extra special - standard rooms are a great size and are beautifully presented. Staff were exceptional throughout and the glass of champagne on arrival really helped kick off the holiday atmosphere. The only sour note was how crowded it became on 4th July weekend - to be expected but not pleasant. Too many adults standing drinking in the swimming pools and impossible to get a sun lounger. The other really busy week is just after Christmas but any other time and it is heaven. Kids loved it but would think slightly older kids would get more from it - no babies paddling pool and would benefit from a free to use playroom where kids could play indoors away from the heat of the afternoon.

You take a choice of 5 glass lifts to you floor, i recommend a high floor as you can go watch the fireworks, epcot fireworks 9 and magic kingdom at 10 we was on floor 17 and the views are breathtaking, although i did not let my young girls go on our balcony as they could fit throu the bars, the room was of a high standard and the cleaners do a very good job and again always smile and say hello, as a family we had 2 double beds and a cot was supplied for our youngest, plenty of room for us and nicely laid out. all of the staff are good and friendly but i do have to mention one in particular who helped make our stay perfect and that was jp who works down where you have breakfast, my two daughters looked forward to going to breakfast each morning just to see jp who was always happy to help us and always smiling and making my girls laugh and if i owned a hotel i would hire him instantly, the breakfast area was beautifal with its large water feature that kept my 2 girls occupied while we had breakfast, the food was good enjoyed the buffet breakfast. alot of people on here complain about the service charge but i thought it was fair for all that was included we went on bikes/canoes/pedlos there was a climbing wall but did not use it as my girls were to young. Now im trying to think how best to describe the pool apart from perfect let me put it this way my eldest daughter 3 would often say to me about leaving the parks to go back to the pool she luved the slides waterfalls and lucky for me the jacuzzis, the pool area is nicely laid out and never felt to crowded, plenty of sunbeds, there is some hammocks on the beach to which is also good for the kids to play on, the flora is beautifal that surrounds this whole hotel and you can often see a lizard or 2 basking in the sun and down at the docks you can feed the fish. theres plenty to do here to keep a family entertained. location was perfect for us as we chose not to have a car, we would take the free shuttle bus in the morning to magic kingdom/seaworld/epcot and get a taxi back depending what time we left which was about $10-15, you have downtown disney 5 minutes around the corner where you have a choice of shops and restaurants and you had some more shops and resturants just over the road on the right as you come out the front gates and if you go to them just stop of at the front of pizza hut where there is a pond with a family of otters living there, here you can find a great choice for food italian, mcdonalds and many more. so back to this hotel what more can i say than it was perfect for my family great location, beautifal and good staff with an outstanding pool, we certainly will be going back there and i reccommend it to any family,couple etc.... and thanks to all the staff that made our stay", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant hotel, staff amazingly friendly.

The staff are the most friendly people ever, the hotel/rooms spotless and facilities brilliant. On arrival we had champagne, given a brief tour of the hotel and shown to our rooms. The hotel itself is breath-taking with its sky high atrium entrance. Car parking is to the side of the hotel, which is just a short walk. It is very secure, which is very reassuring. There were plenty of sun beds around the pool, and even a designated 'quiet area' for those without children. The breakfast is lovely, food was good and waiting staff the again a tribute to the hotel with their friendliness/helpfulness. Breakfast is $21 each for a generous buffet of food inc bagels, ham, cheese, pastries, waffles/pancakes, porridge, bacon, eggs, sausages, omelettes - egg white omelette was great and very healthy. We had this included in our hotel package(book through BA for this) and it was well worth it. My only comment which isnt positive is the cost of drinks around the pool. We paid $15 for two beers and anotherday $8 for a rose wine which was served in a plastic cup(no wine glass). But we ended up in Wal Mart one day and ended up buying a pack of the same beer for $10 and took them down to the pool in a cooler. No one seemed to mind and it made our hotel bill a lot cheaper. Another good tip is to buy a polystryne cooler from Wal Mart which costs just $2-3. We filled this with ice from the ice machines on each floor of the hotel. We would take this out in the car and leave it in the boot so when we finished in the theme parks we could have an ice cold drink. Also good for keeping beer cold around the pool!! We are looking forward to returning here.

The hotel has the best pools, service, and housekeeping around. You won't want to stay anywhere else in Orlando. It is gated, which means only guest can get in, it is near the Disney and Downtown Disney. Lots of inexpensive restaurants nearby, and its an easy drive up I4 to Universal. Tip: bring your own drinks and snacks. They add a 18% pool service charge even when you go to the bar by the pool. I bought one drink and gave a tip only to realize the bartender already got my tip. Another tip: Do the self parking. You can walk up a path to the front lobby. Think about it, if you go to the parks, your walking anyway, save some money and avoid the valet and burn some calories. They have lots to do here: climbing wall, lake with a beach, paddle boats, bikes, and kids activities.

We stayed for 11 days and took advantage of the Sunshine on sale rates which were great! always a perk to join Hyatt's Goldpassport program (which is free) and earn points because those points come in handy for upgrades! We upgraded to a 2 room executive suite which our 2 teenage boys loved and we had our own room...very convenient AND we upgraded to the Regency Club level as well (all great perks of gold passport!) with my points earned. Regency Club is amazing and offers breakfast, afternoon beverages and lite snacks, early evening appetizers, cocktails for purchase and desserts and cordials...it really is worth it even if you pay for the upgrade. The service from the concierges in the club is awesome! The rooms are fresh and clean with colors of the ocean. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are tidy. Now for the resort activities: LOTS to do in the daytime and the pool is the BEST! grab a lounge chair, order a cocktail (pool prices though), slather the suntan oil on and just beeeeeeeee........amazing! the kids love it as much as the adults. Tons of daily activities....NOTE: I mean this with the greatest intention.......This is a resort and meant to be treated as such.......that means the property is kept very nice and by paying the daily resort fee of $22.00 per room, they expect their guest to enjoy the activities. It appears that some families come to this property and seem shocked by the resort fee because they got a slamming great rate and they complain a little because of the restaurants and expensive drinks.....this is a resort and therefore you will have some higher fees to expect at the restaurant so don't be shocked or complain. I agree some fees are a bit over exaggerated such as room service especially but again if you know this upfront then you have options and must keep this in mind. Most important about this property is the amazing staff...seriously, the service is the best and simply top notch.

My husband and I have previously stayed here and were very much satisfied way back in 2003. Reservations were made in early May for two rooms (daughter and I are attending a conference). I have severe asthma and had requested hypoallergenic bedding when room was originally booked back in early May (feathers kill me). A week prior to the conference, my daughter called the hotel and requested adjoining rooms. She was assured that they would try to honor our request. On our drive to the hotel my daughter called and spoke with Mike and requested an early check-in if at all possible. When we arrived at the hotel, valets in abundance surrounded the car. After assurance by the front desk that our belongings would be put in a locked area until our room was ready, we allowed the valet to unload the car and gave him a handsome tip. At the front desk we were told \"we were completely booked last night\". My daughter and I headed off to our conference while our husbands gave credit cards and registered. They left the hotel with the 4 year old in tow giving my son-in-law's cell phone number with the request to call when either one of the rooms were available. At approximately 2 PM my daughter and I visited the front desk and spoke with Jorge. Again, \"we were completely booked last night and no rooms are available\". Jorge gave my grandson a pail and shovel and coloring book and said he had no crayons but the restaurants might have crayons. What? We can't even get crayons for a 4 year old and others speak of the champagne greeting. We again asked about them calling when one of the rooms became available. Jorge said he didn't have a phone number. What? My daughter and I headed back to our conference and finally my son-in-law received a call at 4 pm that one of the rooms was ready. At 4:30 we met up with our family and learned that the second room was still not available. Our husbands informed us that when they went to get the key at the front desk they saw our luggaage cart sitting in the corner of the lobby completely unattended. What? We were appalled since it contained a laptop, Ipad, etc. It is now 4:45. We head off property. We return at approximately 8:30 and enter the second room. Certainly not my idea of cleanliness. A lid but no ice bucket. Call to guest services - Are you sure there is no ice bucket?. Yes. By this time we are aware water is not draining from sink. Husband manages to get drain stopper up but it falls back down. These seniors are tired by this point. Oh - the bedding - feathered duvet and pillows. No facecloths. I'll deal with this in the morning and attempt sleep just with the sheet and no pillows. Call made at 8 am the next morning - need hyperallergenic bedding as requested on reservation, face cloths, and our sink doesn't drain. Off to the conference. 4 pm - neither room has been serviced. Hubby advises that he received a call at 2:30 regarding non-draining sink. There is a tiny lever behind the faucet that works the stopper - \"everyone has this problem\". What?? This is not visible even looking in the mirror but we no longer have the problem - ok. It is after 4:15 when I meet up with Ken (a housekeeping manager) who inquires about my stay. I explain that despite my request, hyperallergenic bedding was not supplied, there were no face cloths in either room and both rooms have not been serviced. He follows me to the rooms and tells me he will have the rooms taken care of and he will stay to see it is done. Foam pillows (yuck) are supplied but Hyatt does not have hypoallergenic duvets (these are readily available in most chains including Marriott and Sheraton). A wool blanket which doesn't even cover the top of the bed is used. Staff leaves and I go in the bathrooms - no face cloths. I find staff in the hall and get the damn face cloths. Guess they are now a request only item. Now the kicker, at 8:15 the next morning, housekeeping is banging on both doors asking what time we will be checking out. What? Regarding resort fees, it rained practically the entire time but no hotel has control over the weather. We just wished we could have enjoyed more of the amenities. There are many new, well run establishments In Orlando. The Hyatt was a huge disappointment. I could go on and on regarding the cleanliness of the room and the attitude of some of the front desk personnel, but I think you get the picture. Oh - before I forget. The check out line was huge. We resorted to the self check out kiosk (we were unable to use the TV to check out). Now we find there are billing issues. I'll deal with this another day.

Here is my experience with check in/out. This is from an email I later sent to the hotel, so that is why it is written in this format. I will be doing my best to get the word out about this hotel as this is a VERY SHADY thing they are doing. And if you read other reviews and I far from the only one! I would just like to bring to your attention my experience during my recent visit. I was there for a conference with my room rate at 109 a night. I was staying for 3 nights. I had my room reserved with my debit card (which has never been a problem at any other hotel EVER!) Your hotel wanted a credit card from me so they could hold upwards to $800 on it! I was there for conference not for fun, this was most certainly not a figure I was expecting to have to pay upon arrival and I didn't budget for it. Plus all the fees just didn't add up right to me anyway...After going back and forth with the woman (Barbara) and asking her to take out a calculator so I could see what exactly she was charging me for we agreed that my charges would be about $400, plus she added a $75 fee to this that I would get back when I checked out on Sunday. I go to the atm come back 2 minutes later and she is asking me for over $500 , I argued that after going over figures we had JUST agreed on $485, she goes and tells me that was before paying the $75 fee. I insist that she shows me her calculations again and this time it actually came out to be $10 less than the original. I tell her I want to know what is going on because none of this is adding up right, especially when I show up here expecting to pay $109 a night. Her response to me was lets not go tit for tat over $10! I'm thinking...are you kidding me!! This is not up for negotiation, a price is a price, either it costs a certain amount or it doesn't. Anyway I then hand her $500 and she refuses to give me the change I should be getting back (about $15) She says I'm not giving this back to you, you can have it on Sunday. I then demand a printed out receipt because all of this is just not right, she refuses to give me a printed out receipt. I tell her I want to talk to a manager and all of a sudden I get a receipt, and my total is just about $400, right where I thought it should have been in the first place. But she still wouldn't give me the rest of my money back, that I would have to wait to get when I check out. So at this point I give up, I tell her I will be expecting my money back when I check out on Sunday and I have this receipt to prove it. She says, yup won't be a problem. So I go and check out on Sunday and wouldn't you know it's Barbara again..and I can't check out just yet because she says I owe the hotel another $330..where is she getting these figures from?? I have no idea!! I hand over my receipt and explain no way you actually owe me money, she says she not giving me my money back and I have to pay what I owe, she tells me that the receipt I'm holding is only for a one nights stay at your resort. So all of a sudden my $109 night room went to $400??!!! I tell her that is not what we went over on Friday, she then acts like some light bulb just went off in her head and says oh yea I remember you, she then tries to give me $60 back. Now my receipt says I should be getting $100, I ask her where the rest of the money went...she said it was for a resort fee, (which we had already argued about and figured out and added into my bill that friday) So I tell her no, that was already included, it's right here in black and white. I finally tell her that I would like to speak to a manager and all of sudden she says she'll give me my $100 back. I don't know what Barbara is doing here or what she is doing with extra money that she requesting from guests but that isn't being recorded into your system, but it might be something that should be looked into!! I can take responsiblity for showing up to your hotel and not being aware of all the extra fees, but who expects a $75 incidental per person per night fee?? That is very expensive and should be posted very clearly on your website. That is a lot of money to throw people off with when they are not expecting it, and then to have the staff be so rude about it. I showed up there on Friday and was apologizing like crazy that I was not prepared to pay all that money and the attitude was just like oh well...it wasn't until I really had to stand my ground that I able to make some headway. I must say..every other detail of my stay was absolutley amazing. But this whole situation should have never happened. I'm not sure if it is because of hotel policy or if Barbara is just a bad seed. But I would suggest some changes. I was at a conference with over 500 people and I was not the only person that this happened to. I personally talked to 4 other women who dealt with this exact same thing, one of the ladies actually had your front desk lady Sierra THROW a room key at her!! I mean this is crazy!! I hope this situation is dealt with immediately. A price is a price, I can't beging to tell you how many times my rate and fees changed it is ridiculous! I even showed up with my printed online reg for that is showing my rate of 109, I don't think anyone on this planet would assume then that your front desk would then cheerfully ask for almost $800.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNice Property, Hit-or-Miss Service, Bring Your Wallet\u201d", "Author": "FundraiserGuy", "ReviewID": "UR114888297", "Content": "We have been to this hotel several times over the last ten years. After a recent make-over we were hopeful to see a fresh face on an old friend. Yes, the hotel was updated, but what we found was disappointing. Some thoughts about this hotel: 1. Resort Fee. Everyone pays it. As we checked in we learned that the nightly rate we thought we would pay was a fantasy. We were required to pay a resort fee of $22 MORE per night plus taxes on that. Whether you never plan to canoe, rock climb or \"pitch and putt\" you will pay this fee. Why not just include it in the rate? If a two-bit interstate hotel can offer free wi-fi, why can't this magnificent resort? Or at least honor the rate we thought we were going to get. Admittedly, learning our stay's price would be higher than we planned, set the tone for the stay. 2. The maid staff is a highlight. The hotel is spotless. These saints clean, scrub and polish all day. Bravo and thank you. It shows. 3. The recreation staff, mainly college interns, were great. Since we paid the fee, we changed our plans to try to the recreation a little. These kids are wonderful. 4. After several stays we have always found the front desk staff to be the least helpful of all staff at the hotel. Surprising and immensely disappointing. 5. I have seen other reviewers discuss complimentary champagne and other similar niceties. We saw no champagne. Don't know how they got it and we didn't, but no champagne. Our overall impression of this hotel was that if you don't pay for it, you don't get it, and getting it is universally expensive. 6. One of the other reviews talked about the aggressive bellhops. They are correct! Two approached our car when we pulled up. When they saw I was only dropping my wife off while I parked, they were discernibly upset that they would not have a chance at a tip (no luggage or help needed). 7. The pool. Oh, the pool. It is gorgeous, and a highlight. 8. The upgrade. Anyone familiar with the hotel will want to know about the upgrades. They alone are worth staying away from the property (considering the price you pay for them). Overall, the hotel is going for a new age, asian vibe in a modern, cold setting. Not warm, not welcoming, not comforting. Unusual, yes. \"cool?\" yes. Hyatt? No. For example. The bathroom and closet now share a sliding door. Slide the door one way, you can get into the closet, but not the bathroom. Vice versa, too. Sounds cool and great until you are getting clothes out of the closet and your son is coming out of the bathroom and slides the door right into your head. This happened twice. For some reason they got rid of the nightstand between the beds. I guess it looks cool, but was annoying. 9. No pride. There was trash everywhere, especially under the bushes. We found something neat in the architecture of the building and asked at least four staff members what it was and how it worked. A couple made up answers, the other two didn't know, but did try hard to figure it out. No one had the pride and knowledge of the property they should. 10. Finally, and this kind of sums up the attitude of many, but not all, at the hotel. The lifeguard was late opening the big slide. When she arrived, she turned the chair to face away from the slide and into the bushes and she started texting, and texting and texting. She was kind of rude, and certainly uncaring. Why? Is this what we should expect at a Hyatt, Resort? for our $22 fee? She was aware of my camera and put her phone down when I took photos of my kids! The hotel is still close to Disney, still magnificent architecture and still has pockets of great caring staff. However, for the price you pay and for the Hyatt name, you expect more. With so many other choices in Orlando, I recommend trying another property until Hyatt cares more about the jewel they have in the Grand Cypress.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cHow one person can spoil it\u201d", "Author": "Ozzytraveller42", "ReviewID": "UR114858803", "Content": "After a long international journey it would have been nice to be greeted by a friendly face.

The hotel is superbly located within easy walk of various shops and restaurants, although we did tend to use a car rather than the hotel transport if we were going out for a day as the scheduled timings weren't convenient for us. The grounds and the pool were as pleasant as we remembered from our earlier visit, the new pool furniture was a welcome new feature, however on close inspection some of the pieces were broken. The free breakfast included in our package was excellent, the regular greeters were friendly and very good at their job, in general the servers were were also friendly and very hard working, but the the stand out member of that team has to be JP who consistently went above and beyond. At reception we were told that the free breakfast voucher included 15% tip and sales tax so we did not have to tip unless we wanted to as this would be on top of the standard tip already included, this is important as one experience which did effect our enjoyment was the attitude of 1 certain member of staff who was sweetness and light the first morning she served us, we encountered the same server the next day and she was plain rude to the point of ignoring us-all because we did not leave a tip!!Ww saw exactly the same thing happen to a lot of other people during our stay, each time it was the same server. This is not acceptable in any establishment let alone a 5 star hotel! We did leave a substantial tip at the end of our stay as all of the rest of the staff had been great. Other slight niggles - rooms not dusted or vacuumed as often as they could be - we realise this may have been because we we're staying for a long time. At the time of our stay the self parking was free but we heard that there was the possibility of there being a charge for this in the future. If this is true then it is a bit steep given that you already pay a resort fee which is meant to cover all of the site facilities. If they were panning on just charging the many people who come to the conferences then this would be more understandable and acceptable. Like many reviewers I do think that it is a fault of Hyatt in general that they do not provide free Wifi, cheap motels can offer this service, why is a 5star hotel brand not able to offer this facility unless you pay the much higher rate of resort tax? Even if it was just free in the lobby and general areas and you paid for in the room this would be a compromise.

The hotel itself is out of this world. The lobby is stunning and the room is superb. We had a lake view room and had a stunning view of the area. If you can afford it though, upgrade to a pool view room. You will get an incredible view of Disney and the firework displays they have at night. The room themselves are superbly sized with our room having a huge king sized bed, sofa and desk as well as a wide screen TV which I think never left Fox while it was on but there are plenty of channels to choose from! There are plenty of choices for eating in at the hotel. It was slightly expensive but you get what you pay for and the quality is superb. The two meals we did have at the hotel were superb quality. We had room service one night and the way it was served to us felt like we were in the restaurant! It was prompt, warm and the staff were superb! If you don't want to pay a lot there are plenty of cheaper restaurants nearby all within walking distance or a two minute drive if you have a car (or order a taxi). They also do a superb breakfast buffet and I ate that much I never needed any lunch! The pools that the hotel have are stunning, although I have no idea how they could get the water so cold when the temperatures were nearing 100F! There are so many things to do, I wish we'd booked a third week so we could sample it all. We did do Disney/Universal most days and so it was handy that the hotel offered a bus within it's Resort Fee. $22 a day may seem a lot but it was cheap at twice the price considering what you got for it. There are so many good things I could say about the hotel I could be here all year. But I can't fault a single thing. Well, there was one minor disappointment....... There are two birds in the lobby, a cockatoo called Kula and a parrot called Merlot. For nearly all of our stay, Merlot barely said a thing apart from Hello. On the last day however he went into a talking frenzy, saying everything you could think of including \"Here Kitty Kitty\"! It was one of the funniest things and topped off a superb vacation!

The room was very average and a bit small for an adult and two pre-teens, but it worked out fine. The bathroom/ closet door combination is though a bit strange and not very practical. The premises are average in style but the pool activities just great for this clientele. It was the climbing wall that won the votes of my sons, but unfortunately with quite destricted opening hours never had a chance to use it. They were not open in the morning and closed before returning from the days activities, pitty. Anyway, the pool slides and grotto, bicycles etc provided some fun for the kids. The service at the pool is almost nonexistent, a big minus. The Club here had nothing to do with my previous hotel in Key Biscayne, and therefore was a quite disappointment. A small club with inconvenient opening hours and very limited servings did not impress. Additionally, the alcoholic drinks had an extra charge. The breakfast was correct for our needs, so that worked out well. Extra plus for a very helpful Club Consierge, who gave us so many tips for the parks and shopping. As said, the hotel is very conveniently located by 15 minute drive from Disney and Universal, two major shoppings, and only 5 minutes away from a Outlet Mall. In the area, there are plenty of restaurants to feed the children for their taste (Subway :-). Last evening we dined at the hotel\u00b4s Hemingway restaurant, and it was really worth it. The food was great and the athmosphere quite nice. We had to rush out though, since the children had heard about \"smors\" session at the \"beach\" and it was about to end in half an hour. Well, this turned out to be fire made so that you could prepare your marshmellows, but after buying the kit from the bar, we had no glue what to do! Good thing there was one parent who was able to give us the instructions.

The room had a 'cooler' refrigerator as there was a warning that medications should not be stored in it. However, our drinks got very cold. A regular refrigerator could be requested. They also had a coffee maker that was located in a cabinet near the floor, which was odd and inconvenient. And save your time, the coffee was terrible. There is a coffee place serving Starbucks in the lobby. My husband and I ate at the hotel's White Horse Bar and Grille located off of the Lobby and everything was very good. Sushi was made to order and reasonably priced for a hotel. We had an escargot appetizer, too, that was very good. The drinks are strong but also pricey! $52 for 4 drinks! The same can be said for the pool bar. Service was pretty slow at the pool bar. We tried to use the chair-side beeper system but a server never came so we had to venture to the bar ourselves. The real draw to this place is the proximity to Disney World, the transporation to the parks and the hotel activities.

The pools were to die for and not quite explainable. I do not normally swim in Hotel pools - however, I could not leave this Hotel without going for a very chilly dip, my husband was amazed. Awesome! Did not have time unfortunately to use any other of the many facilities (check out their website for all that are available), so that was sad. This Hotel is very close to Disney World and would make a great family place to stay. Our main regret, is that we did not book our entire 5 night stay in Orlando here at the Hyatt. The Best Western Hotel we stayed at was horrible and the worst mistake we made. Even though we could walk to Down Town Disney, it was definitely not worth the money (separate review). We had a rental car and could have driven to DTD or taken the shuttle. Lesson learned. You will not regret spending a bit more money and staying at the Hyatt. We would LOVE to return to Orlando some day and will definitely be staying at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress!!!!", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "Carl24_11", "ReviewID": "UR111598699", "Content": "Great resort that offers everything!

We ate in The Palm Cafe twice - it was ok, also ate in The White Horse bar and grill - very nice. The hotel is very close to lots of restaurants so we ate lunch and dinner out most of the time.

The location, meeting facilities, pool, bar and restaurants were excellent. I was particularly impressed universally with the professionalism, competence and courtesy of the staff. It is also in a great location, near lots of restaurants, outlet malls, and the Disney parks. One nice feature, for us, was the good security at the resort entrance. There is a gate guard monitoring who enters. They have a remarkable pool, reminiscent of the pool complexes at Hawaiian resorts, with slides, caves (with bars), hot tubs, and bridges incorporated. There is also a lake and the required resort fee pays for complementary paddle boats, sail boats, kayaks, etc. We stayed on the Regency Club Floor and liked the food, service, and club very much. They had a very nice business center and a very large balcony \u2013 a popular place to watch the nearby evening fireworks from Disney, Epcot and Sea World. My only gripe with the club is that they didn\u2019t have any of the alcoholic beverages they served visible and they had no menu, so you had to place an order with their waiter. Their selection of drinks seemed limited. This is a minor complaint given the quality of the place. The quirky aspect of the resort is its furnishings, d\u00e9cor, and the room layout. I had the chance not only to experience my single room but two of the larger suites. The furniture and color schemes were like Austin Powers \u201cmod\u201d meeting what pseudo 21st century modern \u2013 and it didn\u2019t work. The bed was very comfortable as were the linens. The computer desk, TV and dresser were great. There were also some remarkably inconvenient features \u2013 that our bellman openly warned us about. The first was the \u201csuicide\u201d bathroom/closet door. The entrance to the bathroom is in line with the adjacent closet. One door slides to close either the closet or bathroom, not both. For two people, if one is looking in the closet while the other tries to leave the BR, the closet viewer can get bashed. Twice I almost smacked my wife as I \u201copened\u201d the closet as she was leaving the bathroom. The other bizarre feature was the absence of a door lock on the suite\u2019s guest bathroom. If you are on the toilet in this BR, you can only hope no one decides to enter, as there is no lock and you are too far from the door to hold it closed. We found this in two separate suites. All in all we had a great stay and would stay there again.

I'll start with the couple of negatives from our visit. Firstly I am now aware it appears to be a well known fact that most U.S hotels require a cash deposit usually around $600 upon arrival, I found this out on a recent trip to Vegas but to be sure I emailed the Hyatt Group before our arrival and was told that no charge or deposit will be required. You can imagine having travelled nearly 24 hours via Chicago how annoyed we were when asked for $600 as a security deposit despite getting an email saying no such charge is in place at Hyatt Hotels. I was told I would get it back when checking out but my point was this money is our spending money...what good is it to us when we are going home? We came to a compromise and to be fair they only took $300 as the security deposit. Secondly the shuttle bus or lack of is a real problem, I read a previous review about this and the reviewer was told by the hotel that during winter months only one bus is provided daily but would increase during busier months, I thought this was fair enough but was staggered to find out that the end of May wasn't considered a busy enough month to put more shuttle buses on to bring guests to the parks. All the other hotels seem to have regular shuttles but this 5 star resort didn't, it's really beyong belief. Finally I must mention the one bit of poor service we recieved, my girlfriend had a badly swollen ankle and we rang down for some ice to be sent up to the room, we had to ring 3 times and after an hour some ice packs were finally brought up, that was really disappointing. Oh one more thing, ask for yellow cabs instead of the town cars provided by the hotel as they are a rip off. Ok on to the positives, firstly when you arrive at this hotel it certainly has that 'wow' factor, it's an absolutely stunning resort. The outside is very impressive with ponds and waterfalls everywhere and spotless gardens. Despite a couple of hiccups the staff were fantastic to deal with and 99% of the time did everything to help us. The hotel has everything needed for a great holiday, an amazing pool area, games room, bikes and boat rental, tennis courts, pitch and putt, you name it and the hotel has it. The rooms are nice but not huge so maybe ask for some kind of upgrade rather than the standard room we had but the view over the pool and lake was spectacular. The food at the hotel was amazing from the steak in the sports bar to the snacks in the cafe, I couldn't fault it, a little bit pricey but you are in a 5 star resort. Taking everything into account I would highly recommend this hotel, it's got a great location but the lack of shuttles can be a problem but maybe the hotel will address this. The staff is great, the hotel inside and out is breath taking and the parks aren't too far away so all in all I would say make Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress your number 1 choice on your next visit to Orlando.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fredericksburg, Virginia", "Title": "\u201clike paradise\u201d", "Author": "rodrig", "ReviewID": "UR110442613", "Content": "This hotel is gorgeous.

In fact, staying at this hotel was a bit of a splurge for my wife and I for a quick weekend trip from a town about an hour away. We picked the hotel because it looked to have a great pool. A quick breakdown of the hotel follows. Room: The room was spacious, clean and well appointed with flat panel tv, ipod/mp3 dock and an air filter. While the decoration style was not my taste, I did not hate it either. The bathroom is big and the shower has a regular shower head and rain style head. I took 4 showers while there and each time I had period of hot water (the way I like it) and barely warm water. My wife said the water was fine for her. Pool: The pool is where I was the most disappointed. The pool is massive and has 2 small water slides and numerous waterfalls. It looks really cool. However, unless you are down at the pool to reserve your chair by 8am, don't even bother. I prefer to have chairs in the shade and did manage to grab the last 2 (literally), but I saw many people wandering around looking for a place to place their belongings (and this was at 10 am). Also, call me an alcoholic if you want, but I was on vacation and at the pool by 9:30 am. By 10 I was ready for an adult beverage. They don't serve till 11:00 though. Bummer. The worst thing was a lack of music. Our beer maid kept telling us she was going to get the music turned on but it never happened. Several people around us were also lamenting about the lack of tunes. I am no spring breaker, but the pool scene at this hotel is not happening in the least. My tip: Take your mp3 and portable speakers. Considering we chose the place for the pool, we were pretty disappointed. Fees: I actually spent $50 on a breakfast for 2 people. I am still nauseous about this. And it was not great food either. Pretty tasteless buffet fare. The hotel does have a lot to do but we could barely scratch the surface for the $22 daily resort fee. I did use the pitch and put course which was kind of fun. Like most resorts they know they have a captive audience and they do not hesitate to bend you over on prices of things. $6.95 for a croissant? What a joke!!!!! Parks: We did not visit to go to the parks, but it is minutes from Disney and about 10 minutes from Universal. All in all I would not recommend this hotel for weekend travelers looking to have fun by the pool. This place is more suited to the r&r crowd, which is cool, I just wish I knew that ahead of time.

Please read this whole thing and dont make the mistake we did. First, most importantly they siphon money constantly. Upon arrival they took almost $700 out of our account ( this was not the expected resort fee). Each day after that, they took $25 to $125 a DAY until we checked our bank account and caught it. They called it an \"honest mistake\" but did not give the money back, saying we had to call our bank. After two hours of talking to the front desk, they admitted they shouldn't have taken the money in the first place and would \"look into it\" By the end of a week stay they had taken appx $1100 out of our account in ADDITION to our prepaid rooms and resort fee. Second, the walls of this hotel are very thin. I could hear the man upstairs urinating ( and could tell it was a man). The hotel maid, although polite, shouted loudly every morning in the hallway from about 7 to 9 am. The hallways overall are extremely loud. YOU MUST bring earplugs. Third, our toilet clogged almost everyday. The maintenance man said this was because too many people in the hotel were using toilets at the same time ( what?). Beds are very hard. Fourth- bugs. There were spiders in our room and we were bit by fleas?bedbugs? in our bed during the night. Manager said it was mosquitos but it was only on our feet and ankles and while we slept under the covers. Fifth- there is no balcony. It is only a ledge you can step out on. Cigarette butts were on our \"balcony\" despite the no smoking policy. Sixth- about a week in, we were locked out of our room one night when we got back around midnight. At this point we were so frustrated with the hotel and were exhausted and hungry. I went downstairs-visibly angry- and told the front desk I was locked out. She called security and said \" I had no ID\" and \"I could wait\". After waiting for 15 mins, she began apologizing to the other guests in line because I was tapping my fingers. Frustrated, I went to the other person working and said I needed to talk to a manager. She told him I \"could wait because I was being disrespectful\" At this point I was in tears and the manager pulled us aside. After we explained everything to him, he said he would reprimand her. He was very surprised at the amount of money that had been taken out of our account. He credited some of it back. I got everyones names and am writing a letter to corporate. Oh also, though the parking lot is not really far away, it is too far to be walking after an exhausting day at Disney. It is also not reasonable for a disabled or elderly person.

During our 2 week Orlando vacation we spent the first week at the excellent Hilton Grand Vacacations Club on International Drive before transferring to the Hyatt Grand Cypress for the 2nd week. At the HGVC we had a 2 bed suite which was huge and the overall feel of the resort was one of high quality and cleanliness. In contrast the 2 double bedded room we had at the Hyatt was tiny and not really suitable for a family stay. There is barely any storage space which meant we had to keep most of our stuff in the cases which was a bit of an inconvenience. Also, as there is no balcony that you can sit on and have a late night drink together and the 2 double beds are pretty close together you end up going to bed at the same time as your kids (ours are 9 and 6)! The hotel is a huge unappealing 1970's style building, however the rooms have been refurbished recently and are very stylish, but as mentioned more suited to a short break or business trip. Some of the external areas look in need of refurb - for instances the wooden tables outside by the first pool are very tired and shabby looking and not in my opinion in keeping with a top quality hotel. The saving grace for this hotel are the pool areas complete with water slides and waterfalls which the kids loved and the children's pool was heated to a pleasent temperature. Also, the sandy beach by the lake and options of kayaking, canoeing, bike hire and pitch and putt golf are all excellent. However, you do pay a compulsary fee of 22 dollars per room per day to use these facilities. For such a long established hotel that clearly does cater for family holidays (based on the pool and leisure facilities and not the rooms!) there are some surprising oversights. For instance if you want to get an ice cream for your kids you cannot get one around the pool area despite the fact there is a kisok handling pool towels and selling pool inflatables etc.. You would think they would have a small freezer inside this kiosk which would sell ice creams, but no, you have to go into the Palm Cafe inside the hotel where there is a strict policy about putting on your t shirt and shoes! So, when the kids want an ice cream this is a real pain in the backside particularly when you have lotioned up to keep the extremely hot sun at bay! I mentioned this to the lady who was working in the poolside kiosk and she just shrugged her shoulders as if to say that's just the way it is. Message to management - please consider introducing a small freezer for ice creams in the towel kiosk - I can't be the first person who has raised this an an issue? A big positive are the hotel staff who generally were excellent, particularly the folks working in the breakfast restaurant who were very accommodating and friendly. So, to summarise, the Hyatt Grand Cypress is a good but not great hotel with nice, stylish bedrooms that unfortunately for us were impractical for our family vacation.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful location...terrible housekeeping\u201d", "Author": "beachgal054", "ReviewID": "UR105429977", "Content": "My husband and I recently spent a week at this resort while visiting in the area.

The most unbearable part of our stay however was the room and the housekeeping staff. The room was small for 2 people, not enough storage for a week's stay, no couch or love seat (only a desk and a single chair with an ottoman). The room was on the 8th floor overlooking the generator. It was so noisy that you couldn't open the balcony door for fresh area. The balcony is useless anyway. It is too small to stand or sit on. I expected much more from a room at a Hyatt.

The worst part of the stay was housekeeping: they never emptied the ice bucket, replaced the drinking glasses or left us new washclothes each day.

We were a large family party using 4 rooms and staying at the hotel as a base for 2 weeks at the theme parks . Despite having paid up front for all 4 rooms with a lake view we were split up around various floors upon check in , with 2 of the rooms having a view of the carpark, this took a day to resolve with one of the check in attendants telling my mother she was lucky to have a room at all as they were full and had had to bump people off . As these rooms were paid for in advance there can be no excuse for this attitude. Upon check out there were over 500 USD of incorrect items on my mothers room account that was swiftly removed and 76 usd of incorrect billing on my room. BE AVISED and check your bills, or pay cash . I waited patiently at the desk to get my bill adjusted and when the erroneous check was found i was not even offered an apology. The resort itself is nice with large gardens and grounds , but the only heated pool is small and hence overcrowded as you will struggle to spend a lot of time in the un-heated main pool. Poolside service was on days good and at other times pitiful with it being far faster to walk to the bar under the waterfall to place a drinks order . The poolside tables have a beeper attatched to them that you press, presumably for service, but an attendant told me that is frequently fails to work . Rooms were ok , our room 333 was for some reason a good metre or so slimmer than my relatives rooms down the hall ! The beds are small, storage pitiful for 2 weeks . room service was very speedy and efficenint. The restaurants are not overly expensive and the food is not overly bad. If you are looking for fine dining in Orlando then you have come to the wrong city. The hotel was frequenty over run by Conference guests, who lay claim to bar areas etc and this can be frustrating as they seem to take preference over regular guests . At the white horse for instance we were told we could not reserve a table for 7 pm for 13 people so we duly arrived at 6.30 pm to make sure we would get in .

We booked through an agency and requested ahead of our trip adjoining/ connecting rooms. On arrival at reception we were told this was not possible, unless we paid $25 per room upgrade fee. (Stayed at Hyatt Bonita Springs at beginning of our holiday and our request was fulfilled without any problem. A fantastic hotel with great customer service!) My husband and I were travelling with my parents and our four year old daughter who just loves popping through to her grandparents room, hence our request. It was suggested that because we had booked third party that was the problem and that no requests had made made by us!! I offered to show e mail copies but not interested. Incidentally we are hyatt gold passport members...not made to feel so here, felt like second class citizens. We were to be given rooms apart with the possibility of moving later in our stay, so had no choice but forced to upgrade. After some haggling we were offered connecting rooms paying only one upgrade fee as the other room was for disabled guests and I quote 'people don't like these rooms' ..what? Then the horror really begins. We arrived in our upgraded rooms , (which are identical to any other room other than looking on pool and have a plug in air purifier ), to find the toilet had been used, urine on seat and floor, yuk! The 2rooms were generally dusty and crumbs over floor but our 4 year old discovered the worst problem in ours by standing on someone's toenail! Clippings everywhere and skin scrapings. There is absolutely no excuse for this in a hotel like this and especially in a so called upgrade. House keeping called twice before the room was cleaned properly. After my husband insisting on seeing a manager, the duty housekeeping manager came up and eventually hoovered herself. She apologised and offered a free breakfast! During the rest of our stay random charges for valet parking and Internet use appeared on our folio and this led to several calls to sort out. Again we were told because we didn't book with hyatt....... which I do not understand, we paid the $18 dollar +tax per day resort fee. The whole experience was spoiled. To end on a positive note, Raphael who checked us out was superb and the first truly helpful person on front desk. He brought through his front desk manager to querie our up grade fee since we had so many problems, but Henry was not interested, he said he would speak to staff?

Decided on a 4 star as there were a few things that do need attention. All in all this place is one of the most beautiful resorts I have stayed at.I am an avid gardener, so, walked into the lobby and just stopped and stared. The lobby is amazingly beautiful. Check in ~there were some issues. I had emailed and called several times after making the reservations requesting a high floor and king bed.(same I requested at booking) Also called the morning of check in and was assured there would be no problem. Checked in and was told we were on the 2nd floor as we had requested a smoking room. Told them we had cancelled that request several times, as recently as that morning and were told we would be on at least the 8th floor. To make a long story short we went round and round..being offered double beds etc. I stood adamant and refused anything less then what we had requested and were promised. Finally we were given the room we booked. Every person (except the front desk personal) we encountered was friendly and kind. Our wish was their command. Can't say enough positive about most of the people working there. Many go above and beyond. The room was beautiful, as was the view. Really glad we hadn't accepted what they originally were going to give us.Agree with other posters about the closet/bathroom door being poor planning. My only concern with the room was the balcony. We always have breakfast on the balcony when travelling. Never book resorts without a balcony for this reason. The balcony here is very narrow. No furniture as there is not enough room. Not sure why they didn't make the balconies a foot wider to accommodate a small table and chairs.This was a huge disappointment for us. Besides the balcony, the room was perfect. House keeping was excellent except for one day. The regular gal knew us on sight, filled our requests and was a very nice person. One day we had a different housekeeper. She took our robes and didn't return clean ones. Did not leave any of the shampoos etc we had used. No face clothes etc.Besides the one day everything was fine. I can not comment on the food as we only had Starbucks(in the lobby) each morning.More great employees there! We did check a couple of the restaurants and found them pretty over priced; so dined off resort every day.We were going to order room service late one evening. Decided against it after seeing there was a $3 charge for using room service and a 21% gratuity automatically added for each order. It is not that we are 'cheap' per se and have stayed at many 5* resorts. But, that's just tacky. You order room service, pay the price of what you order and give the person bringing the food a tip~ that is how it is suppose to be. The grounds and pools are phenomenally beautiful. The gardens and plantings are perfect. As mentioned at the beginning of this review I am an avid gardener; therefore knowledgeable and critical at the same time when it comes to landscaping. This place gets an A++ in my opinion. Their landscapers definitely knew what they were doing.The pools were some of the nicest I have encountered. The only other concern was the parks transportation, or lack there of. If your going to offer transportation then you offer it on a regular basis, not once or twice a day. I do understand this is not a Disney resort, but that should not matter.I have stayed at at least a dozen non Disney hotels and they all offered transportation every couple hours to and from the parks. IMO this is just skimping offering transportation only a couple times a day/evening.I expected a resort of this caliber not to skimp.

I was led to a two seat waiting area outside of two massage rooms. There was no robe, no tea, no serenity music or atmosphere. This was like going to your local small town \"spa\", not somewhere that I would pay $100+ for a massage. The masseuse herself was not bad. She seemed well trained and she was very nice, but my massage was far from deep tissue. This is, however, not the spa you would go to for the \"Spa Experience\". Shame on Hyatt for having such a shoddy operation. They should either shut it down or completely revamp it. Bottom line: We will return to the hotel because of the nice rooms and the tons of extra activities. I will never set foot in that spa again!", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but a few small problems.

But the good thing is I got to my room after checking in @ 3:00 which took an hour to get the rooms ready. but that wasn't the important part. the important part of my stay was the room itself. As soon as I got in the bedroom, I was blown away and surprisedly enough the bed was very comfortable and I had no problems with the room. lets get too the bathroom itself even though it looked like there was no drainage system to the faucet. the part I didn't know about the faucet until the second day of my stay was there is something that turns the faucet on and off and it was in the back of the sink. The service was okay, but nothing to write home about. The concierge for example for the first night didn't know anything about downtown orlando and thought there was bars and that was it. the blond headed chick was nice but she would recommend places that were closer to the hotel. but let me tell you as a person who dose his research, isn't going to go to all the touristy places, so I said let me take the risk going to downtown orlando, But surprisinley enough I was right all alone that Downtown orlando is a nice place and it took me only 20 minutes to get there. Even though the concierge says that going to downtown disney is only 30 minutes away. I didn't belive the second concierge and I knew that with google maps that they were printing that all of the conierges that print out directions are wrong about the exact time to get from one place to the other. The time on the clock was 5 minutes wrong, but lucky for me I brought my ipod with me and I woke myself up with the alarm on the Ipod. Food at white horse bar and grill was mediocre and meaning by that was the server took our order and it took like an our for the server too come out and get our food. as soon as my food arrived my crab cake sandwich was luke warm, but tasty. Would I ever recommend eating at the hotel. probably not. but If your a person who dose the research and doesn't need staff recommending locations. then this is the place for you.

Our room wasn't ready (not until 4:30 PM - grrrrrr) so we had 45 minutes to wait. We left our bags on a bellhop cart and went out to see the grotto, pool, and all the resort part of the hotel has to offer. Climbing wall! Paddle boats! Fitness center! Three pools (one heated!) A sandy beach on a lake (that you can't swim in due to alligators. Oh well.) The staff were extra nice. We were in room 503. Its kind of 90s chic - furniture was scratched up and the carpet seemed clean, although it had stains. KUDOS to Maria, the housekeeper, she cleans thoroughly. The bedding was okay, no fitted bottom sheet, so the mattress pad (yuck) was exposed during the nights, and no comforter/duvet covers, only sheets (which I kind of found gross, as we all know that hotels do not wash the duvets/comforters after each guest.) I'd have been a bit more 'okay' if it was enclosed in a true covering. Lighting was poor, but aren't all hotels really bad at that? The clock radio near the bed was 1 hour, 25 minutes off (to the early side, so sadness to anyone who didn't notice and missed a plane!) We had to get online just to figure out how to change the clock (Involved removing the back plate, etc.) The light in the bathroom did not work near the sink/mirror. Called reception, and it was fixed immediately, but I surprised these items are not checked out by housekeeping in the first place. Bathroom toiletries are wonderful!!! The bathroom was nice except for two problems and one suggestion. First, there is no way to stop water from coming out of the shower under the door. Otherwise, the rainshower is great. As for the trendy sink - it doesn't drain down as is is flat-bottomed. All the toothpaste and other gunk just sat there. Not much hot water out of those trendy taps, eh? One suggestion: the ceramic soap holder and ceramic vase - are these breakable items necessary on an already cramped counter/sink? Now for the noise. The doors in the hotel are they heavy fire doors of old. Slam! Slam! Slam! Of everyone around - some jerks, some not - as I found our door slammed too when we tried it. Last SLAM! was about 1 AM. First SLAM came at 5:30 AM, and catapulted us out of our sleep. The hallways echo loudly as the rooms near the center of the hotel are close to the openness that extends from the lobby to the tip top of the building. Nothing is free in this hotel. The business center with two PCs and a printer costs to use. (I walked out.) Internet is $10 a day or including with the resort fee, if you have that. The Palm cafe told me that coffee was free in the lobby, but I was charged $3 a cup. Valet parking is $20 a day, but the self park is down the road for free. We had no problem parking at all, even with two conferences going on. The restaurants are pricey, so without a car, you'll be strapped for a place to eat. Orlando Ale House, Dunkin Donuts, Ihop and Walgreens are about a 20 minute walk outside the resort gate. We rented a car, so unsure how much the shuttle from the airport cost. Another nice thing was the mini-fridge in the room. Nice! And it wasn't a mini-bar so no fear to open it! We'll stay elsewhere next time...We weren't SOOO disappointed, as we felt it was value for the price we paid, but its the little things that are so easy to fix - maybe in the next renovation. Additionally, I'm not sure if there are nicer rooms than the basic room we received, so its hard to warn people away...but then again, we do like to sleep after a long journey to get to our lodging, and we did not get very much sleep at all in this hotel.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing resort atmosphere, loaded with amenities, you don't need to ever leave\u201d", "Author": "Maripat34238", "ReviewID": "UR103191614", "Content": "This was our first time at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress and we wanted a relaxing, pampered weekend.

I had reserved an executive suite. The hotel had been kind enough to contact me (as a member of the Hyatt Gold Passport programme), and in this connection, I chose to do an upgrade into an exectuive suite, so that we would have two rooms - i.e. one for our son to sleep in. The room: We had a corner view with a view over the pool and lake, and not the least the fireworks from Magic Kingdom every night. A nice little touch. I very much like the interior of the room - everything very new and contemporary. Another nice little touch was the note from the maid on the bed asking at what time of the day we would like to have the room serviced for the time of our stay. A good idea. On-site: The hotel has some quite nice restaurants - apart from the cafe (forgot the name) by the pool, which was pretty bad. Lousy service and crappy food. On the other hand, especially Hemingway's was a fantastic dining experience. Their seafood dishes are spectacular. We went there twice, even with a baby (which they went out of their way to please with special orders and kind smiles), it was a relaxed and first and foremost culinary experience. Would recommend it to anybody. The pool area is second to none - a vast area with pools and waterfalls, and a heated pool for the winter and the little ones. Could not have asked for anything more. The negatives: Despite requesting an early check-in, we could not get our room when we arrived at around 1.30 pm. Had to wait until 3.30 pm (I believe) to get the room :( As at least one other reviewer has noted in this forum, we were also there in early March when there was a conference with a band playing by the pool for most of the evening, which was a massive disturbance, as our son needed to go to sleep well before they finished the guitar solos. I complained about it at the front desk but was not offered any kind of compensation, which I thought was not so forthcoming. As a member of the frequent visitor (Gold Passport) programme, all they would have had to offer was a couple of thousand points, and we would have been happy about it. Not the best handling of that situation in my opinion. As others have mentioned, another negative about a hotel as large as this one is that all distances are so vast. Probably took me between 5 and 10 minutes to get from my room to my car. But that is pretty hard to do anything about.

Compared to the quality of the hotels in Orlando, this would be at the higher end, without question. The rooms are lovely, and the cleanliness of the hotel itself is excellent. Location wise, it's not walking distance to International drive, and is only accessible by taxi or car. This basically means that if you don't hire a car, you will have to depend on the shuttle services provided by the hotel, which not all parks and attractions are provided for free. As a typical example, we had tickets for the Wet & Wild park, but had to pay $38 for two adults to get us there, which only took 15 minutes. The part is actually across the road from Universal Studios, and if we had known, would have ordered the free shuttle service from the hotel instead. So although paying the $25 daily hotel service free, free travel only applied to some of the parks. Another matter which greatly annoyed us is that complimentary breakfast was included in our package, which included tax and 15% gratuity, which we had in writing from the hotel. Despite this, we were on one occasion in the middle of eating, when one of the waiters rudely interruped to mention \"I know you have a voucher for the buffet breakfast, which means I get nothing, and indicated that we should leave him a tip\". Neadless to say, we refused to sit in his breakfast seating area, and it left quite a bad taste taste in our mouths after that bad experience. We feel strongly that the $25 daily hotel service fee should be part of the hotel cost, which isn't cheap. We feel that a hotel should as policy, let you use their facilities; pool, gym, use their towels etc as this is what the minimum requirement of providing a satisfactory service without having the charge their customers for the previledge. I have stayed in many hotels worldwide, and have never came across this charging policy before. 'Mears' the taxi company the hotel use, were quite aggressive about tips. Although they appear rather overly friendly initially, if you don't tip them, expect quite a nasty reaction! All in all, not a bad hotel. Location isn't perfect, if I was booking again, I would look for a hotel in the north nearer the main theme parks. They also need to rethink the hotel service charge. We walked away with an additional mandatory $250 bill upon checkout just for staying in the hotel, and it does make you think you are being charged just for staying there using facilities you believe you have already paid for when you book your room. So if you are going to stay in the Hyatt, you will need to budget for this additional expense.

We \"always\" stay at a Disney property. Since we planned this trip last minute during winter break most hotels were sold out. This hotel is BEYOND EXCELLENT in every way. The staff is friendly, helpful and efficient. The lobby is gorgeous. I would recommend the self-park as it's easy and free. The rooms are very large compared to most hotels in the Orlando area AND VERY CLEAN! I hope they keep it this way! The bed was comfortable...again very clean. The room has a small frig, and lots of draw and closet space. Highly recommend asking for a high floor---9 or up. Some of the lower floors have trees that block your view. And, if possible, get a room overlooking the pool/parks. You can watch the fireworks in some rooms. If this is not possible, you can take the elevator to a higher floor and watch the fireworks from the hotels large glass windows (many ppl do this). The property is gorgeous with multiple pools (only one is heated--the middle pool). I found the other two pools to be freezing as if it was filled with ice. One of the three pools is an adult pool. There are several fun slides throughout the pool area. The amenities the hotel includes with a daily fee are absolutely worth the cost. Great little man-made beach, bikes, surrey, canoes, rock climbing wall next to the pool area etc etc. Lots to do on the property. We enjoyed the talking parrots in the lobby...very fun. The only minus was the strange way the hotel designed the door that opens for the closet AND the bathroom. Not well thought out. If someone tries to get into the bathroom at the same time that another person is trying to get into the safe or closet you can get caught/knocked by the door. It can get annoying. however, I would not let this deter you from staying at this hotel. They have a great fitness center in the middle of the pool area, under a cave. The fitness center is not supervised, and since it's under a cave would recommend going when several ppl are in there (was a creeper in there when one of our family members was using it). There are several good restaurants at the corner of this hotel. You could walk, but I would recommend driving. Downtown Disney is close, and the \"Disney entrance\" is around the corner from the hotel...which is fun for small kids to see as they pass it to get to this hotel.

We are huge fans of Hyatt and stay in the hotels alot. Overall, a great stay and lots of fun. I will highlight a few negatives that would have made our trip even better, and some issues that potential guests might want to know - but we will definitely be back again. Hotel design: this place is HUGE. Don't leave anything in your room and have to run back up for it - it is not a quick trip, especially from the pool and other recreation areas. Free self-serve parking, but again a little but of a walk. Note that this hotel is not great for those with a fear of heights. It is structured around a huge atrium, and in order to get to your room you have to go up a glass enclosed elevator and then traverse a walkway with glass on both sides - if you have a room on a high floor, or need Regency Club access, this can be an issue. We had to get hotel staff to let us up and down the service elevator constantly - which they did with a smile, noting that it happens all the time - or took the stairs, but it was an inconvenience. They did offer to move our room to a lower floor, which we declined due to RC access on Floor 12. Food: We got food by the pool a few times and did the Sunday brunch at La Cocina - Pool service is very, very slow by two pretty surly and inefficient servers - they need another server or two, and the kitchen needs to pick up the pace. La Cocina was to die for, although definitely a $$$ splurge. You will not walk away hungry (unless you are a 10 year old kid - not tons of kid-friendly options on the buffet). Regency Club: We usually use the RC for breakfast and cocktails/heavy appetizers, which we can often stretch into replacing dinner. Some difference about this RC as opposed to other Hyatts we have been to - a bit smaller on the inside, but a huge and gorgeous deck. It is GREAT in nice weather, but when raining or chilly the seats are at a premium. Surprisingly, drinks during cocktail hour ARE NOT FREE as we have found in other RCs - drinks are $3-5. The food seemed to be recycled buffet food (we noticed several clearly recycled items from the Sunday brunch) and their hot offerings are repeated a bit too often. Again, not alot of kid friendly food - most kids won't eat food like cold crab cakes, asparagus and samosas. Other clubs we have been to have had pasta, meatballs, etc. Also we were not sure why they closed the club from 3-5 pm every day and close at 9 - others we have been to stay open the whole day, and later than 9, and they could (and do) clean at night. I am not sure if we would upgrade again in this hotel or just get a breakfast included option. Room design: recently remodeled in a modern style. Beds were comfortable, sofa did pull out into a double. I would like to see more storage space, but it was just adequate for the 3 of us for 4 days. There is nowhere to put suitcases except on the top of the closet. The closet/bathroom door is a strange frosted glass barndoor style that slides to cover the closet or the bathroom, but not both. This is ok, except that you don't have alot of privacy in the bathroom as there basically is no \"door\", and the light from the bathroom pours through the frosted glass (which wakes up everyone in the room if you have to use in the night). I also did not see where you could lock the \"door,\" which led to a few embarrassing moments and gave new meaning to the words \"knock first before entering\". Shower did not have a bathing suit drip line - strange for a FL hotel centered around a pool. Other issues: One main complaint that we had about the hotel is that this is a place that tries to be everyone to everybody with limited success. They bill themselves as a resort with all of the amenities for kids, etc. (including pools, boating, pitch and putt, game room, bikes, etc. - awesome) - BUT this is very much a conference hotel catering to large groups. For example, one day that we were there we woke up to the staff building a HUGE stage, with lights, towering sound system, etc. next to the pool - basically blocking full access to the one heated pool on the property (and it was chilly, so the others were not really useful). They also blocked off half of the pool deck for tables, buffets etc. This culminated in a reception that evening with a band in which took \"this one goes to 11\" as a challenge. They played from 7-10 p.m. and basically drove us out of our room, because the sound was unbearable - even though the guitarist did a pretty mean Santana impression. There was no warning or apology about this incredibly intrusive event to other guests. (When we lodged a complaint, they immediately took half off our room rate for the night - but had they at least warned us in advance when we checked in or by a note under our door the day before, we could have at least planned to be out for the night.) Another night they shut the pitch and putt down at 5 p.m. for another event. If you are going to restrict acccess to resort amenities (which they really should not do anyway) then at least let guests know in advance. All in all, really a great trip - if hotel management would pay a little more attention to treating their regular resort guests better (as opposed to their conference guests), it would be 5 star.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "reading pa", "Title": "\u201cIncredible!!\u201d", "Author": "dyltrips", "ReviewID": "UR99540017", "Content": "The grounds and gardens have an oriental flare and are so beautiful.

The grounds were lush and fabulous, the rooms contemporary with views of the fireworks and the lake/pools/beach, Epcot, MGM and Disney. Ask to be placed on that side of the hotel. The pools were wonderful with hidden whirlpools, lots of waterfalls. Things for kids to do, things for adults - the lake - sailing, kayaking, paddleboat, etc. There's a $22.50 resort fee/day that you can opt out of if you do not plan on using the pools, 24-foot rock climbing wall, health club, shuttle transportation, 9-hole golf, tennis courts or bikes. Valet is $20 and while self park is free, I believe it's a little distance and challenging to find a spot. Wireless Internet is $9.99 one time but beginning 3/1/11 that will be included. Currently there is hard-wire internet. Refrigerator but no microwave. Also - if you want bubble bath and need a tub, get the double rooms; King rooms only have a shower. Chaise in room for comfortable reading! I really can't say enough about this- oh- Starbucks and Seattle's Best coffee served on site though not full menu.

Also, great for a wedding. The only hold back would be that (my) door was not cut all the way to the floor but had about 1\" open.

Amenities fees: We were not informed that there were a $22.50 mandatory fee each night that we stay that should have been stated when we checked in for the Amenities that we did not use. Housekeeping: When we came back the room was cleaned but our clothes were moved into a pile, knocked over my luggage and all my clothes were spilled out and they just left it there. Apparently we had a bag of candy that was open and it was full but when we came back from Disney World it was only a few pieces left.

Great service. Lobby renovation still ongoing\u201d", "Author": "Bitboy11", "ReviewID": "UR96974381", "Content": "When I visited Florida for Xmas break this December, I visited Orlando for 3-4 nights with my wife and 5 y.o. son, to take my son to Orlando resorts. As usual, I sought out a Hyatt near to Disney and settled for the Grand Cypress resort. We always try to book places which offer a separate bedroom for our son at a reasonable price. After poking around on the Internet, I decided to call Hyatt direct and - voila - got the best deal - extra room at half price! Likes: Upon arrival, we got two adjoining rooms arranged quickly, with the lake view. The rooms were very nice, plush, clean, recently remodeled in very good, neutral taste. Very helpful, friendly and efficient staff. Dislikes: 1. Lobby and hotel grounds renovation was in full swing during our stay. All the work stopped in the evening so the nights were blissfully quiet. There was no room noise in the morning but, for some reason, the hotel had to shut off hot water and electricity for a couple of hours every morning, on one occasion without prior warning. This delayed our departure to a resort. To be fair to Hyatt, they gave a me a whopping, further discount off my room rate for the water trouble. 2. The parking lot was part closed, and, once parked, we had to enter the hotel through the side wing and walk past the work crews making terrible noise dismantling the interior of the hotel's business conference rooms. Frankly, we were not too bothered by this as the noise was limited just to that area. 3. My past but admittedly outdated experiences of food service in different Hyatts in the US were [relatively] positive. However, the Grand Cypress breakfast buffet was utterly disappointing - mediocre filtered coffee, horrible fried-to-the-crisp-bacon, tasteless fruit, soggy eggs, etc... I peeked into the a la carte plates of people next to our table but saw nothing encouraging -- sugar glazed cinnamon buns smothered with maple syrup and other abominations. All in, it cost us $60 for the three of us! I allow that Hyatt restaurateurs know well the preferences of their key US clientele and thus don't hold much hope for any improvement in this area. As bad as it was, it's still better than breakfast at any of the resorts (see below on how we coped with this on subsequent nights). 4. WiFi broadband that is offered as part of the $20 daily service charge is way too slow at 768K speed, and the available WiFi speed upgrade was something like $10 per day! Fortunately, I managed to connect at normal speeds via Boingo hotspot that was within range in our room. On the balance, we were very happy with our experience, save for the food, and would recommend it to anyone. Side Note: Orlando generally falls short in quality of food one gets in nice places in large US cities, London or Western Europe (or Eastern Europe or Asia for that matter). We coped by: - having breakfasts at a bagel place in the same mall as a Whole Foods supermarket (Turkey Lane Road); - picking up boxed fresh egg/tuna salads and bread at the same Whole Foods supermarket for having lunch at resorts (where food is beyond awful).", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rock Hill, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cAll of the staff are friendly, helpful and very informative.\u201d", "Author": "camran1101", "ReviewID": "UR96931421", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel from January 31st to February 5th and found it very relaxing and enjoyable.

Rooms were fine and reception staff did their best to get the three rooms near ( although my son decided he would like a higher floor, again the staff went to the trouble to get it ) The resort it self was wonderful, sand,lakes,boats,golf,bikes,pools,hot tubs etc. There was something for everyone of all ages. Our flight to London was canceled at the last moment due to bad weather. The hotel let us keep the same rooms at the same rate and all the staff were very helpful. I am not sure what that lady wanted ( I did see her still there a few days later so things couldn't have been that bad ) maybe discount ! We had no trouble with noise from workmen infact we had no trouble at all and will certainly go back to hotel when we go to Florida", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "livingproof1984", "Title": "\u201cGood but lacks the truth..\u201d", "Author": "livingproof1984", "ReviewID": "UR93569072", "Content": "I am staying at this hotel. It is a great hotel in general. It is very beautiful. Although, service is lacking. Every time a question is asked to them around the hotel especially the guest services/reception area, it's like asking for their first born child. Rude and unprofessional. The shuttles at the hotel? Don't even count on it! I have stayed at hotels all around Disney World and the World and I can say this is the worst one for shuttles and service. Twice a day for shuttles? Please! 2 Star hotels around the same area offer shuttles every 30 minutes to the parks. Upon asking guest services on the phone why it was only twice a day I was told \"that's just the way it is\" It's not like a can have a choice of taking a shuttle in morning and one in the afternoon. No the shuttles are all in the morning and leave before 10am.. I'm left with no option and no choice but to take a cab at this supposed to be or claim to be 4 or 5 star hotel. Why are we paying a $20 service fee at this supposed to be resort when no service is offered? Isn't at least one of those stars rating supposed to accomodate your guests needs? I'm sorry to say this hotel is not even close to the star rating it claims to be. Not to mention? Calling the front desk or guest services at least twice letting the phone ring for over 5 minutes and having our calls unanswered? Then proceeding downstairs to the lobby witnessing nobody at the front desk? This is unacceptable and not to the standard of hotels at this kind of rating. I have honestly gotten better service at 2 or 3 stars hotels. I think it's sad that I have to write this review on here when I was expecting a perfect and magical stay.

Loved the fact that they have a man-made beach on the resort. It was a nice alternative to be able to lounge and sun bathe there than around the pools. The pools and hot tubs are nice and are open 24 hours. Which, for us, was great. We would go to the heated pool and hot tubs later in the nights (usually around 12:30-1:00am) so that it would be quieter and more relaxing. The room we stayed in was nice. I had read other reviews complaining about the room's size and the bathroom. We had absolutely no problem with either. The room was plenty big for 2 people and our suitcases were put away behind the desk the whole time and didn't take up space. Our bathroom had a closing door (non-sliding)and although the closet is situated in the bathroom there was no problem with it. The toto rainshower was nice and our shower had an actual door and there was no problem with water going on the floor. Just wished they had an actual towel bar to hang up our wet towels. There is a small one for a face cloth but that was it. Our only little hiccup was check-in. We had arrived from an overnight flight (we arrived at 7:30am) and there were no rooms ready. We had requested an early check-in, but I do understand it was New Year's Eve weekend and they were at full capacity. So we went for breakfast at IHOP and when we came back we only waited around for about another hour or so before a room was ready for us. Barbara (the young lady who checked us in) was very helpful and understanding and gave us a great room looking over the pool and over at Disney. The location is perfect. You can walk from the hotel (10 minutes) to great restaurants, walgreens, grocery store and other amenities. So there are other options for you to dine if you don't always want to eat at the hotel.

Public areas and rooms fabulous. We chose to self park. Resort facilities were absolutely magnificent. Well worth the $20 p/night fee. included numerous activities, pool with water slides, newspaper, self parking and much more. You could certainly spend your entire holiday here without ever leaving. Great, reasonable food around pool area (thanks Vonda!) I think that the test of a great hotel is the way that they deal with customer problems.. This hotel excelled in this respect. We has a small \"glitch\" which involved us being asked to move room after one night despite my pre-stay e-mail and discussion at check-in. Anyway, mistakes can happen and we were so impressed with Mike at Guest Relations who kindly offered us breakfast vouchers for the inconvenience it caused us. It was not expected but much appreciated. Thanks Mike. In summary, this has to be the best hotel in Orlando and I look forward to visiting soon again.

This year we decided to try something different. My husband always researches every resort on Trip Advisor first and writes to other reviewers to get the best information. We took a day trip with our kids to Orlando for New Year\u2019s Eve and wanted to check out the Hyatt Grand Cypress property. As we approached the front gate we had a horrible experience with customer service with the security guard Joe. We let him know we were thinking on spending our Anniversary here this year and were looking forward to seeing the property. Before we could even finish the sentence he cut us off and said \u201cNo one has time for that today\u201d and started to walk away. I explained again that this was for our potential extended stay, he again cut me off and just picked up the phone in his booth. The whole time he was really arrogant, like we were bothering him and shame on us for even expecting that we were going to get into this property- which by the way we check out each and every property before staying each year and have NEVER been treated like this, never been told we can\u2019t come on property either. Found that really odd. By this time his attitude had made up my mind for me. I told my husband to forget it that I do not want to pay for service like this. He told Joe never mind that I had made up my mind and the exact words that came out of his mouth were \u201c That\u2019s okay, I\u2019m sure they can live with that.\u201d WOW! Did he just say that? Basically, you can\u2019t come in, I\u2019m not sorry about that, and you aren\u2019t worth my time or the hotels\u2019. He could have easily explained the policies and apologized for any inconvenience due to the busy holiday. Hyatt- you really need to screen your employees better. Maybe Joe is right maybe you don\u2019t care if one family doesn\u2019t book a vacation with you, but you have now bought yourselves one person that will spread the news on how \u201cgreat\u201d your customer service is before even getting inside the hotel.

We got a good rate online and breakfast included as AAA members. We both got the flu on our honeymoon, so we spent more time at the hotel than at the parks. The staff at the Hyatt provided excellent customer service. We were greeted by the doorman immediately and helped promptly by the bellman. Both could tell we were very sick and asked about us. Later that day, they sent us up some wine with a congratulations/get well card. Our room was great, very clean, comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, and quiet. We ordered soup and grilled cheese from room service. The room service attendant delivered it to us in bed and then called a short while later to ask if he could bring us something to make us feel better. He brought us an assortment of cookies and cakes with 'get well soon' written in chocolate on the plate. Really? What did we do to deserve this (besides getting the flu on our honeymoon)?

We found the drives to downtown Disney and the parks very easy. Lots of restaurants, fast food, and stores nearby. Also an immediate care and minute clinic very close, which we needed to go to when we were so sick. The only downsides (and they are very tolerable) are the self-parking is far away (but a walkway is provided), there was construction in a bunch of spots (but it's the off season so expected, and didn't prevent us from doing anything at the hotel), and the wired internet is a little slow (WiFi costs $10 a day).

I found a great winter rate that couldn't be beat. For the price this was really the best find for what we were looking for: hugely discounted rate, clean, shuttle to both parks, and 4 star. Our rate included a discounted base rate, every third night free, and free breakfast which was a huge plus. Not only did it save us money, but also spared us from the low quality food at the parks. Pros: Very clean! Maybe it was due to the recent renovation? I'm very picky about cleanliness and overall I thought the hotel really made this a priority. The maids also did a wonderful job, were very professional, and went out of their way to say hello and ask us if we needed anything every time they saw us. One of the biggest reasons we chose this hotel besides price was that we didn't have to change hotels to go to Universal. This was the only hotel we could find that had a shuttle to both Disney parks and Universal. We didn't want to change hotels or rent a car. 1/2 acre pool. We never got to use it because it was too cold, but it's impressive and there's lots of great comfy looking lounge chairs. They didn't tell us when we booked that 1/2 of the pool was closed for renovation. We could have been annoyed if the weather was warm. The White Horse Restaurant blew us away. The first night we ate there because we had no choice. The next three nights we ate there because we wanted to. The chef(s) are simply amazing. I'm hard to please and I was impressed. They pay attention to every detail and everything is cooked to perfection. Even the salad dressings were spectaular. The ranch has real buttermilk and the italian had bits of soft cheese. The meats and veggies were cooked perfectly. We had the best meals there. I would highly recommend it! Bravo and thank you to three of the most wonderful staff I have ever encountered at a hotel! Please excuse me if I spell your name incorrectly. The staff around Orlando come from all over the world so I've included their country. Attmane (from Morocco) at Cascades restaurant really made our stay a 5 star experience! He is so welcoming, professional, attentive, and a big smile every morning at breakfast. Excellent, superb service! Erwin (from Haiti) at the White Horse restaurant. He went out of his way to make us feel extra welcome and special. He was so excited to welcome us back every night for dinner and wanted to make sure that our bread was super fresh.....straight from the oven. He is a great asset to the hotel. Ricky (from Cuba) is the most professional waiter I have ever seen. He is 100% focused on making your dining experience perfect, but warm and welcoming at the same time. All of you made our experience at the hotel 5 star to say the least. Thank you!!!! Cons: Lots of construction still going on which were not notified about when we booked. There was lots of noise and changes to the shuttle bus pick up and drop off locations. The worst part was when we didn't have water or electricity for a couple hours two days in a row. On the first day we weren't notified about now having water and that almost created a big problem for us. The shuttle times to and from the parks are very limited (not like the disney buses which are constantly going). We tried to get the times before we booked the hotel, but they made excuses and wouldn't release that information. When we got there we found out why. You are bascially stuck at the parks from morning til night if you take their shuttles. Otherwise, you have to pay extra for a cab. It would be nice if they offered additional times. The bathroom door is a sliding door that also doubles as the closet door. It was very difficult to keep it from rolling back open.....all the way open! It would be nice if they added some kind of latch to it so you can have privacy. One thing that really irked me upon arrival was that it was only around 6:30 pm and there wasn't anyone out front to greet us or offer to help with our bags. We arrived in a stretch limo and no one offered us any service. There was lots of other cars with people unloading in front of us and they didn't recieve any service either.

Everything ran smoothly at the hotel and all the employees are really friendly. I had requested a corner suite on a higher floor and they gave us a room on the 7th floor with a view of the lake. We could still see the fireworks at Disney everynight which was great, but not the epcot fireworks, but one show was enough for us. The corner suites have 2 seperate balconies and it seems that they are a little more private than some of the other rooms. The room itself was big enough for the 2 of us, not a lot of storage space though just two small drawers and the closet. The bed is really comfortable and you can swivel the TV towards the bed or the comfy chair they have in the room. They also have different ports for usb, hdmi and other cables built into the entertainment unit which is great if you're bringing any of your own equipment. We got wifi included in our rate, but it was a little annoying as you had to log in everytime you wanted to use it, but the connection was pretty fast. They have a safe in the room, the battery was dying in ours but the maintenence guy came right away and fixed it for us. The sliding door for the bathroom is a little annoying, but you get used to it. The bathroom was nice and I loved the rainhead shower. There is a lot to do on the property and it's all included in the resort fee. We used the kyaks and the water bike and the lake is really pretty with all sorts of birds and I saw some fish and a turtle too! They have a rock climbing wall, but it's really only for kids as it's not very high and looks pretty easy. The pools are great, but in November the big pool really is too cold which is a shame because it's a much better pool than the smaller one. I went in the bigger pool a couple times because they have the big waterslide going into the big pool, but I couldn't stay in for more that 5 minutes even doing laps because it was sooo chilly. When we were there the small pool was 88F and the big pool was 68F. In the summer I'm sure the bigger pool is a much more tolerable temperature. The hot tubs are also nice, but we would only go in if there was nobody else in them as they are all pretty small. I loved the fact that the pools were open 24 hours. We also had breakfast included in the rate and it was definitely worth it. You could have buffet or a la carte, but pretty much everything on the menu is available in the buffet so we just had that everytime. It was busy everytime we went down, but never had to wait long for a table and the food is always being refilled and was really tasty. Coffee at the restaurant was not good, but they have lots of different teas and juices. They do have shuttles to and from Disney and Universal, but they only run a few times in the morning and a few times at night so we didn't take them at all. We drove to downtown disney and parked for free and then took the shuttle to the disney resort and then from there took the bus to the park. It took a long time and next time I think we'll just pay for the Disney parking. In conclusion, this hotel is beautiful, really clean and bright and lots of great employees.

My husband and I are avid travelers and we've stayed at many hotels all over the world. Mind you, we are not wealthy, but I've learned that you don't have to be to stay at a place like the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress. Everything was great from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out. Breakfast at Cascades was delicious. Our reservation gave us the option of complimentary breakfast at Cascades with the option of buffet or menu items. I ordered from both on our 4 night stay, and enjoyed the food from both. The hotel itself is phenomenal. There is so much stuff to do, so many activities that makes the resort fee worth it. All you have to do is actually take part in the activities or amenities the hotel offers and then it won't bother you to have to pay the fee. The pools were a little cold, but still divine and service at the restaurant as well as front desk was exceptional. Everyone says hello and treats you like a million bucks, even if you don't have a million bucks. The only problem we had was with the express check out.

I had requested an early check in and was assured a room would be available shortly. We left our bags and went to Cascades for lunch-fantastic crab cake sandwich and Angus cheeseburger.

I can also understand about the shower...the door does little to keep shower water off the floor....but nothing a towel can't fix. I didn't mid at all that the mini-bar was gone but was slightly annoyed when we found it was not a refridegerator (as many descriptions, including the hotel, stated) but a \"cool box\"....it said that it was no intended for milk.

We knew about the resort fee and didn't care. Just to have the secure parking was enough. The parking was far away from the main entrance, but you could either go through the ballrooms up through the pool area and go into the back of the lobby, so it wasn't a big deal to us. The room was very clean and we felt very safe. We had a fantastic view of Epcot and Magic Kingdom and saw fireworks every night (if we were back in our rooms!). This hotel rocked and I would definitely stay there again. The only two things I can say was that for our family, after 6pm there was no real casual food. We aren't kobe beef and lobster people and would have loved to have some place for sandwiches or the like. However, we did order room service one night and while the selection wasn't too casual, the prices were reasonable (for Disney/Orlando) and the food was perfect!

We had the privacy key in the door and we had till noon...I know they have a job to do, but really, what if we were sleeping? The woman didn't take too kindly to my answer of \"some time before noon\" and left it at that....I have till noon....wait till we pull the privacy key or the front desk tells you we checked out.

Other eating options within walking distance: Millers Ale House is across from the entrance to the resort and had great wings, food, and drink specials. Subway and Qdoba are also close enough to walk to. Husband played golf and found all the courses to be beautiful and challenging to play. Don't miss playing the East course. The only thing we found to be awkward was the layout of the rooms. Pool view rooms offer an amazing view of the pool, grounds, and fireworks every night at Epcot and Magic Kingdom. However, they don't offer much privacy as you can see into other guestrooms due to the angle of the layout. We just made sure we pulled our curtains closed when we needed privacy.

So I started to check Tripadvisors reviews. After a couple of days I found this hotel and as I have a huuuuge fright of spiders and other bugs I wanted to stay in good hotel. And OMG I was not wrong by choosing Grand Cypress!! This hotel is the best hotel ever I have stayed in!! A huge, beautiful lobby and friendly personel to meet you! We were offered champagne as we arrived. And the room... EXCELLENT, very clean! Thank you Rosemene! Next morning I woke up early due to the jetlag and opened the balcony doors and was amazed by the beauty of the premices! I fell in love with Florida that moment <3 Our room was facing the Disney Downtown Resort Hotels but was still beautiful. We were on the 12th floor so there was no noise from anywhere. And the pool, AMAZING!! I must admit I was a little sceptical could these reviews be true here on Tripadvisor but after staying there my scepticism has vanished. This hotel is just as great as everybody here tells so!! And thank you Steven for your help the day we were leaving! It was nice to talk with you and I hope we have the chance to come back one day! And then just a little wish... As everything was so well organized my only hope was that there would have been a few more complimentary rides to the theme parks during the day. Now they left quite early and the return was late. It would have been nice to take the early ride to the theme park and then return to the hotel in the early afternoon and then get back to theme park for another run. And one tip, you can walk to Disney Downtown area. It is about 2 mile (3,2 km) walk but if you are in good shape, you will walk it easily. There is walkway the whole way thru.

The pool area was also very pleasing with a heated pool and a unheated pool which given the temperture was a welcome relief. The pool area also had a quiet area and no smoking was allowed at the pool side or near the pool decking, being a non smoker i really appreciated this. There is also a lovely lake around the hotel where you can sail or paddle boat around the hotel. The restaurants in the hotel were also very good, the White Horse Sports bar served the best sword fish i have ever tasted and my husband was equally impressed with the steaks. We also went to Hemmingways which is the hotels fish restaurant, the food here was excellent and does serve steak if you dont like fish. Our package also included breakfast in cascades which was great because if we had been paying for this it would have cost $60-$70 daily. There is a wide range of choices for breakfast, after 14 days my husband and I had practically ate all options, and I would recommend everything on the menu. The staff were very nice and our regular waiter Abe was outstanding in the service and attention he provided to us.

We usually stay at the Hard Rock at Universal, but I was looking for something with a little bit of a better price. Upon looking at TripAdvisor, which I always do before going anywhere, I read the reviews for the Hyatt and decided that we should check it out. We got a good rate that included all the activites and shuttle service, so I figured what the heck, it's a Hyatt. When we pulled up to the hotel I was pretty much hanging out the window saying \"oh how beautiful!\" The grounds are gorgeous! We decided to self-park and forgo the $20/night valet. I've heard the complaints about the proximity of the parking lot to the hotel. There is nothing to complain about there. As we were going up the escalator to the lobby, my husband said \"you couldn't find anyrthing cheaper?\" (not knowing the rate I got) thinking this would cost him an arm and a leg. I said \"just wait, you will love it!\" We were greeted by name upon arrival at the front desk and they gave us glasses of chamagne! As the bellman was going to take us to our room, he said he would show us around and tell us a little about the property. That was such a nice extra touch! He told us we would need more than 2 nights and he wasn't kidding. When we got into our gorgeous room, my husband immediately said, \"do you want to stay an extra few days?\" YES!! Unfortunately, due to his work schedule, he was not able to get a few more days off :( We had some unused Disney passes, so we went to Disney's Hollywood Studios for the afternoon. We came back to the hotel about 8:30 and went swimming and in the hot tubs which are open 24 hours. What a nice way to end the day! We decided to spend our last full day at the resort because there was just too much there that we didn't want to miss. We had a great lunch at the pool with some frosty beverages too! :) Service at the pool was great. We did a lot of walking around the grounds, biking and even got in some kyaking. This property is close to Disney, yet a world away. The grounds are spectacular, the service everywhere was top notch, we fell in love and will be returning as soon as we can!

The ladies at the activities area were super and made sure we were well looked after. Dinner that night (after swimming and paddle boating and rock climbing wall) was at the white horse tavern in the hotel--the food was very good and the wait staff really attentive and lovely. that night we made S'mores at the outdoor fire pit--great fun! The beds are super comfortable --the rooms are so quiet--really ! i was sort of shocked-- and we returned each day (exhausted!) to find our room well made up with fresh everything. the fridge in the room allowed us to keep some things in the room which was great. One thing i REALLY appreciated was that I had arranged for my Uncle to join us for an evening in honor of his birthday--I didn't want him to get asked about the bill or anything--and he was not--Jorge made sure to put a note in the file -- I am not sure how it was arranged, but they even managed to put us on the same floor which was great--Dinner at their Hemingway's restaurant was really superb--the seafood was VERY good --equal to any of the really great restaurants here in NY (and nicer since it wasn't in ny--for me at least, since i live and work here!) --our server, Jean arranged a really terrific dessert for my Uncle (and was totally great in explaining the menus and accommodating the kids--) She is a wait persons wait person--truly a pro----and I got a thank you note the next morning from her....Huh? isn't it supposed to be ME thanking HER?? that is the first time that has happened!-- The breakfast buffet at Cascade is really great--the kids loved that they could pick and choose and our server Jose was another stellar example of the thoughtful service at this hotel. The concierge and a young lady at the desk were able to help us decide what water park we should go to ...... Our last night we ordered room service and the room service operator (again , no name ! sorry!!) was great--figuring out a vegetarian option that was terrific--the food arrived nicely presented and hot things were hot and cold things were cold-- (maybe that doesn't sound like rocket science, but they are obviously on their toes). This Hotel has something for all--there are bikes to ride around the grounds (expansive and gorgeous--we didn't have a chance) kayaks, canoes, paddleboats, sailfish are all included with the small resort fee as is a great rock climbing wall-- the pool area is really incredible--Huge, three separate pools and hot tubs-- the bathrooms are spacious and well lit and the toiletries are from portico and lovely. On our last night i had some trouble with the electrical system of our rental car--it was late --I dealt with the rental company but was unsure whether the car would start in the morning (we had to be at the airport at 6:45 am ) I explained my situation to the desk upon checking out (at 6:15 am) and the asst Manager, Rusty escorted us to the car to make sure it started and to trouble shoot in case it didn't -- Thank you Rusty--and everyone at the Hyatt who made our stay SO great! you will certainly see us again (and i hope sooner rather than later!!!)

Free bike useage around the property with appropriate trails, nature trails for walkers and more are all very worthwhile. The property is manicured meticulously. The countless fountains, tropical flowering plants and water gardens will have you turning your head to see what's next around the many walkways that lead to the massive pool. The pool is indescribable. Its resemblance to a rainforest/mountain oasis is well done and simply beautiful. The pool stretches around through a rocky cave-like area where you will find the, \"On The Rocks\" bar and excercise room and gameroom for the kids. There are (2) water slides. One for the kiddies and one for the bigger kids. A freind and I both tried the larger slide and gave it a \"thumbs up\" for the thrill factor. The pool staff offer some activities that will keep kids on the go. There was a water slide contest for the kids measuring the fastest time to get to the bottom of the slide. I had lunch twice at the hotel. The crabcake sandwiches (one in the Cascades Restaurant and one pool-side) were excellent. I was unable to dine at any of the other 5 restaurants the hotel offers, but I have heard if you are big on breakfast eating, the morning buffet for a $25/pp fee is one that is unreal. I had the misfortune of getting a grease stain on a silk shirt at a meal during the week. The dry cleaning staff was quick, courteous and had my clean shirts waiting on my bed and pressed perfectly the same day that I had them picked up. The hotel staff was very accomodating. I had a surprise of a close friend coming to visit with her family and they were able to give them a room across the hall from mine. Furthermore, on the day of checkout. I realized after accessing the internet with a laptop, the high speed cable was in disrepair and I was unable to disconnect it from my computer. A call was made and they had a computer tech on site that arrived to my room 5minutes after I made the call. He was able to fix the problem and got the broken cable out without charging me a fee. Maid staff was friendly and thorough. There are cheaper hotel deals in orlando and you might save a bundle by choosing others. However, you will not get the service at these places that I received at the Hyatt Grand Cypress.

The gym was relatively small but had good facilities. Leisurely bike roads around the resort were a great way to explore and get some exercise, and the same was true of boating on the lake. The location of the hotel was brilliant \u2013 a central location but plenty of space around it. We did not have a car, but taxis were relatively inexpensive to get you to parks, malls and restaurants - there were also a couple of good restaurants within walking distance if you wanted to head out on foot. Complimentary buses are provided to the Disney Transportation Centre, from where you can connect to all the Disney attractions, plus one bus daily to Sea World Universal studios. However, the bus return times were often so late, we were forced to use taxis to get back - even on the one occasion when we stayed at Epcot to see the fireworks at 9pm, we were too late for one bus, but had an hour\u2019s wait for the next!

Great pools and other activities!\u201d", "Author": "wondermind", "ReviewID": "UR74793370", "Content": "I definitely would stay at this hotel again. I would say that the best part about this hotel is that it has many activities for both adults and kids to enjoy. I won't list those here and you can always go to the website to read about them. We were checked in by a very nice young lady named Cristen. She treated us kindly, offered each from our party a glass of champagne upon checking in. I had booked two rooms (one for me hand hubby, and one for my brother and his family) and Cristen arranged for our rooms to be adjacent to each other. She even gave us rooms with views of the fireworks upon our request. It was a smooth transaction. Things I like about this hotel: Every room has a balcony. Our rooms were spacious-- the bathrooms are even more spacious than I've seen with other hotels. I loved that! I've stayed in 4* hotels where only one person would fit in the bathroom at a time; so spacious bathrooms are a plus for me. The location of the hotel is right in the middle of what seem to me a very touristy center. You don't have to drive far for supermarkets, restaurants, or gift shops. Walmart is just 3 miles away. Orlando Premium Outlet is about the same distance away. The bad part about being in the middle of everything is that traffic on the stretch of road where this hotel is located was always always bad! I hated all the people who made U turns.. They just slow everybody down. I'm from Seattle, and I'm just not used to the idea, and thank goodness I don't have to get used to it. This hotel has great swimming pools with slides. My 8-year old niece loved the pools and slides-- me too actually! We both spent 7 hrs playing in the pool one day. Free self-parking: This was great. Many hotels charge you at least $10 a day to park, but it was free here. I heard some posters complain about \"long walk\" to the self-park lot. I couldn't believe it when i saw that the lot was right next to the hotel building. Seriously, does the lot need to be in the lobby for it to be considered close? Even when the lot was full-- and it always was during our stay because of some teen pageant events-- the farthest we had to walk was from one end of the building to the other end-- and that was less than a block! If anything the \"long walk\" is probably from the room to the lobby because the hotel is very wide. Here are my dislikes: When Cristen told us that our 2 rooms were adjacent and were accessible by doors in the adjoining wall. I was thinking how neat. But in practice, I think this configuration works large families where parents want to keep track of their kids. It is not so great for multiple families or adult couples. This is because the doors are not soundproof like the walls are. When I was near the doors between our room, I could hear almost everything that was said on my brother's side. I also found that my other wall has the same door set that led to another room. I don't know if only specific rooms are configured like mine.. but luckily for us, there were no guests staying in that other room; else it could have been a big annoyance for us (and for them). Then there was the sliding door that multi-tasked as the closet's and bathroom's door. Prior to arriving to the hotel, I had read reviews and was well aware of the complaints against this door and warned my husband about it. We did not run into issues as we worked out a system where we would announce each time we come out of the bathroom and open the door. This is so that whoever was at the closet would be alerted and move out of the door's way. It's pretty odd, I know, but I understand and agree with most posters that complained about this door. I saw for myself how people could be physically hurt by it. And I understand that the purpose was to be efficient and save space, but sometimes ideas aren't so great in practice as they seemed on sketches. Like I mentioned, the doors were no good at soundproofing. This means that you can hear everybody in the hallway as well.. Also, the door closes very loudly; it just bangs against the door frame-- there's no rubber on the door's frame to at least absorb the sound. My room had a refrigerator, but my brother's room had a cooler that looked like a refrigerator instead. I called and requested a refrigerator for him, but they wanted $25 for the switch! That is crazy! I'd never heard of hotels charging $25 for a refrigerator before. Most rooms should come with refrigerators in the first place! Now that i think about it, I think this charge is what I dislike the most. In conclusion, the dislikes I've listed did not interfere with me and my family enjoying our vacation.

I was not dissapointed. The hotel is very well run and a stones throw from Disney,we had a car but there is a shuttle bus and you could actually walk if you felt like it.The food and service were excellent,the breakfast is one of the best hotel breakfast i have ever had and the food in Hemmingways was superb.

Bellow you will find out why and why I didn't like soo much the prices. Check in-Check out Before coming to this hotel I heard that when you do the check in they give you a champagne but it never happened and the day I was doing the check out I saw people with champagne. But I don't know if it was because of the late check in but I didn't get it, still there were some problems. Of course the check in lady was new and first she gave me a normal room and then I remind her I booked a Regency Club and she just changed the cards.... I hoped a higher level. But the check out was totally different plus I got late check out. The young men was super professional and offered me a great service and even gave me two 100 usd coupons for my next stay. Nice touch! I would give a 4 out of 5 but because of the great service of the check out I will give a 4.5 out of 5. Rooms Well of course they had been renovated. They are awesome, with a great design and incredible beds makes the rooms great. My room was in the sixth floor and it had views of the parks although not great but you could still see Magic Kingdom and Epcot. The bathroom was a mid-size one with a nice shower. What I most like about the room was the bed and the flat tv. I think this room was one of the best hotel room I have ever stayed, I really liked it, I just think they should have a mini bar that actually cools things and had food :( I give a 4.8 out of 5 Location The location is just great but not perfect. It's about 10 to 15 minutes to the parks, remember that the shuttle that takes you to the Ticket and Trasnportation Center of Disney takes 25 minutes. It's not too far from Universal and various Shopping Malls including the best one: The Mall at Millenia. I think that the location was just good and it's great for people going to parks and also to some malls and some other attractions. I give a 4.8 out of 5 Regency Club As I had access to this club Im also going to review it. So first the whole Club has space for about 50 people more or less just that half of the club is outside and the other inside, what\u2019s the problem with that? HEAT It\u2019s so warm outside that you can\u2019t have a breakfast or be there more than 15 minutes. In this club there is all kind of foods, I think they start at about 6:30 a.m. with some coffee and then at 7 with the Continental breakfast which each morning we took which consist in 5 types of cereals, fruits, yogurts, bagels with salmon, cheese, etc\u2026 3 types of juices and milks as well coffee and some biscuits. So there is not too much. After the breakfast there is small lunch, then the club is closed and at 3 p.m. is opened again for some snacks and at 5 there are cocktails with some canap\u00e9s, and until 9 there are some biscuits and coffee. What I also liked a lot it was that they had two computers, one of them a MAC!! And some printers free of charge. There is also a nice terrace and a concierge. So the only complain I have is that it was too cold inside and there should regulate the entrance, I think they give many accesses to more people than they should. Oh and the first day I went there was a WORM IN MY APPLE!!! Still I give a 4.5 out of 5 Restaurants I don\u2019t remember exactly how many restaurants they are but we just had a breakfast once at the Cascade which it was a buffet and it was above my expectations. The food was good and the prices as well. I\u2019ve heard before that there was a place where they made you waffles and put them chocolate inside, well not anymore. Because I just had breakfast only one morning I can\u2019t really say that was excellent 4.7 OUT OF 5 Amenities It was a shame that I couldn\u2019t even enter the swimming pool, probably because the first day I arrived 4 hours later I should, but they were awesome and I heard the same about the bicycles and the boats that they were included in the Resort Fee. The Fee included the rent of bicycles, boat also to use the Rock Climbing Wall, self parking (the first night should be Valet) and transportations to the park so it wasn\u2019t too bad. Im not going to rate this because I didn\u2019t use the pool or the other things but I still think you should stay here because of this. Xtras So the hotel had transportation to the parks, it had 3 different time options in the morning and other 3 in the night to the Ticket and Transportation Center, which you then need to take another bus or monorail. I think there should be 4 at least in High Seasons. There was also a Mears office, which offered us a great service. The lobby is just incredible and the concierge is also great. The internet that is included is via a cable and it\u2019s says that it\u2019s slow but you can pay one that is faster, but I will just stay with the free one is not that bad. The self-parking is also included and it can be good or bad it just depends in your luck. You might get a spot right exactly in front of the entrance or even 100 meters of the entrance. Also as I said before the first night should be Valet, after a long drive or a flight and you have all those bags it\u2019s just better. I give a 4.6 out of 5 Price The rate was about 235 a night which the bad thing is the extra taxes and the resort fee, so I would stay here for a rate smaller than 200 so after the taxes and the fees is just 230. I don\u2019t think the price was perfect but just good. But I think the service was great the only complain was about the club (the worm inside the apple) and the check-in lady. I give a 4.4 out of 5 Overall After counting all votes we have a rate of 4.61 which makes the 5 points. I really recommend this hotel because it\u2019s renovated the location is great and the amenities awesome just try to check a good price.

I booked late in the day on the fourth of July and the Hyatt still went out of it's way to give our family the best view still available for the fireworks. When I checked in the reservation clerk told me when and where to expect the fireworks. She also provided the adults in our party with a complimentary glass of champagne. Such a nice touch!! We ordered hamburgers from room service and while they were room service priced -- they were DELICIOUS!! Plenty of condiments were provided on the tray and the lady who delivered our meal was super pleasant. (One adviso -- a 20% tip is already included in the room service bill. I missed this although it is stated on the menu. So we tipped twice. Whoops!) The fireworks went off just in the order explained and we had a slim little balcony to view them from. It was exactly what we had in mind for the 4th. The next morning we enjoyed the hot tub and gorgeous lagoon pool. We were able to get breakfast from the lobby coffee shop for around $15-20 -- which I consider reasonable for a resort in Orlando. As opposed to many other hotels in the area, you actually get a ton of amenities for the $20 a night extras fee. Sadly, we only had time for the lagoon pool. The atrium lobby was gorgeous, the staff was very friendly and the rooms had ample space with gorgeous contemporary bathrooms. The *only* warning I would put on this hotel is for people with a fear of heights. It is a high hotel with many of the exterior walls and elevator made of glass. For us it was neat, but if one was afraid of heights, you might want to request a lower floor. We spent the rest of our trip at the Loews Portofino for the Express Pass perks to Universal. Honestly, I think this was a mistake. The Express Pass didn't work on the Harry Potter ride and the Portofino was twice as expensive as the Hyatt. Other than the Universal privileges, these hotels were completely comparable, with the Hyatt being much more affordable and welcoming. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to families headed to Disney. It's just off property and you get a four star hotel without the four star price. I don't know if it is your best jumping off place for Universal as you have about 10 miles of the very congested interstate to navigate. Hyatt does have a Universal property and I suspect it might be as good a deal as the Cypress. I wish I had found out first hand!!

The hotel has a lovely swimming pool area with slides, caverns, hottubs, waterfalls and more. We made use of the golf course, canoes, cycle hire, etc so didn't feel too bad when eating the huge food portions in the restaurants!! Even though you have to pay a fee for these services we thought it was worth it on the days that you just want to spend at the hotel and do what you please. We used the complimentary hotel tranportation to the nearby Disney theme parks. A great service but like others, I do wich they had an afternoon pick-up as it would have made things a bit easier. We also made use of the hotel shuttle which will take you from the hotel down to the front gate. This lets you saves time when going to dine in the nearby restaurants/bars and also saves the legs after walking soo much at the Parks!! We were lucky that our room overlooked the lake and later on in the evening we could watch the fireworks from the various theme parks nearby. The rooms were very modern and beautifully decorated - liked the glass panel on the wall which supported the tv!!. Very comfortable beds as mentioned in previous reviews.

I was pleasantly surprised with how spotlessly clean everything was. Super comfortable beds. My daughter complained when we got home last night that she was the hotel bed back. I was originally put in a handicap accessible room. These rooms have no drawer space and no vanity, to allow room for a wheelchair. I did wind up moving, as that room was not a good fit for us. The regular room had a countertop with storage underneath in the bathroom and worked much better for us. The closet/bathroom door combo was a little weird and the closet is tiny. The luggage rack kept getting caught on the door. An extra inch would have made a big difference in the usability of that feature. Staff was fantastic, very professional and courteous.

We got a very good rate, as I am a State Government Attorney; with the Government Rate, I was booked in a \"Buena Vista Double.\" However, as a Diamond, I was Upgraded to an absolutely AMAZING corner room on the 8th floor that faced both Sea World and Walt Disney World. Unfortunately, there were not any Suites available, but the front desk clerk actually apologized for that -- there was a BIG wedding during our stay, so I assume all the Suites went to the bridal party. But honestly, with the view that I had been Upgraded to, I did not even care about a Suite! Check-in was extremely smooth and efficient. We left our car with the valet, and as soon as we entered the lobby, we were greeted by name by not only a porter but the front desk as well. It appears that have a system for radioing ahead from the valet, and I truly appreciated the personal touch. At the front desk we were greeted with some wonderful champagne -- even offering a refill upon completion of check-in. The front desk clerk spent the time to go through all of the available rooms to try to Upgrade us to the best possible view ... she definitely succeeded! As for the Diamond check-in amenity, I chose the food/beverage option, selecting a nice Cabernet with a Key Lime Dessert ... both were exquisite! After such a quick and efficient check-in, we took the beautiful interior/exterior glass elevators up to the 8th floor, and quickly found our room ... true to my profile, the room was at the end of the hallway, as far away from the elevator and ice machine as possible. We walked in and were amazed ... the room was so truly beautiful! We had a wall of glass on each side of the room -- due to the corner room, we had 2 sliding doors/balconies. The balcony at the end of the bed overlooked Downtown Disney, and you could see Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot from there, as well as Sea World in the distance. The balcony on the other end of the room faced out over the beautiful pool and waterfalls, with an amazing view of the Magic Kingdom and the wooded areas of Lake Buena Vista. Some of the most perfect views that I have ever seen from a hotel room! These views made for such truly amazing fireworks viewing. Each night, we were able to see fireworks from all theme parks in the area. And, on the 4th of July -- WOW! That's all I can say ... some of the best 4th of July fireworks viewing in my entire life! First, at 9p we could see the Magic Kingdom's special holiday fireworks from one balcony. Then, at 930p we got to see Sea World's from the other balcony, followed by the special holiday fireworks from Disney's Hollywood Studios at 945p, Epcot's special holiday version of Illuminations at 10p, and finally, the Downtown Disney fireworks at 1030p. And, in addition to all of that, we could see countless other fireworks in the distance from each balcony as far as the eye could see ... a member of the room service staff told us when he delivered our dinner on Saturday night that we could see fireworks from the coast -- I hadn't believed that until the 4th, but he was definitely correct! The room was a little smaller than I had expected, but it was very nice. The Hyatt bed was extremely comfortable, and all of the furnishings appeared relatively new and well kept. The room also had a fridge, so we were able to go to a local liquor store for fireworks beverages. As for the Regency Club, I would agree with most others on here that it was too small ... at peak breakfast and evening hours, there was barely room to move. And, on the 4th, it was very overcrowded -- but, to the Hyatt's credit, they very quickly opened up an empty guest room across the hall to make for extra room. This seemed par for the course for the Regency Club staff, who were extremely kind and courteous the entire stay, each trying to go above and beyond to assist Regency Club guests. As for the offerings in the Regency Club, the food was pretty good. The breakfast was standard continental breakfast fare, with pastries, cereals, cold meats and cheeses, finished off with coffee and juices. The all-day snack offerings features some nice snack mixes and cookies. The dinner options were always tasty -- but, my only critique is that there never was a hot option ... on the 4th, they had amazing beef skewers, but they were served cold. A hot option would have been nice to have. As for the liquor selections, top notch, and the staff was always very happy to make another drink. My only complaint for this property would be with the food selections, or lack thereof. Although there are four restaurants on property, there just did not seem to be too much of a selection. Two of those restaurants, Cascades and Palm Cafe, had the exact same menu -- I had expected Palm Cafe to be more of a poolside burger place, but it was not. Honestly, there was no simple small burger place to eat. The White Horse did look very nice, but it was more fancy than the \"sports bar\" feel that it was explained to us. It just didn't seem like we had much of a food selection for more than a few nights ... that is the only thing that I would think needs improvement at this property. But, despite my critique of the food selection, as for food quality, what we did have was AMAZING! This property offered some of the best room service that I have ever had at any resort, and the room service staff was extremely pleasant. Also, we splurged for the \"fancy\" meal at Hemingway's our first night -- some of the most amazing scallops that I had ever tasted! And, while dining, the restaurant manager stopped by to personally check on us, and we even found a hand-written \"thank you\" note from our server slipped under our room door the next morning. Absolutely superb service! As for the recreation facilities, the pool was fantastic -- or should I say, the pools were fantastic! With the amount of families staying at the resort for the 4th, I had expected the pool to be too packed to enjoy ... but, that was far from the case. The three inter-connected cave/waterfall pools were amazing! We always had plenty of space to enjoy, and it seemed that pool chairs were always available. Additionally, the poolside activities and water sports -- i.e. paddle boats -- were very fun! All in all, this was an extremely excellent stay, and I would highly recommend this resort to anyone! Truly amazing customer service by all, and I will definitely be back soon :)", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oro Valley, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGood Value\u201d", "Author": "berniss", "ReviewID": "UR69837749", "Content": "There are many pros and cons with this hotel. I would like to start off saying I would stay there again, due to the value received. I am a Hyatt Diamond member and stayed there for the points and amenities I receive as a Diamond member. The hotel appeared to offer many benefits, with a good proximity to Disney, for much less than Disney properties. I will get the negatives out of the way. We were charged for valet and someone else's lunch. So, check your bill carefully. There were problems with the computer system that sometimes had me as a platinum member and sometimes had me properly listed as a diamond. Our room wasn't yet cleaned the first day when we returned at 5pm and had left the room by 8:30am. Towels, washclothes, soaps, etc. were not replenished. Also, the room is an average size, with a large bathroom, but it is the most dysfunctional room I have ever had. There was absolutely no closet space, except for a half rack in the bedroom. Not even a skirt could be hung in the closet. Drawer space was limited to two drawers. The bathroom, while large, had such a tiny sink area, we had to store our things next to the safe or in our suitcases. The tub/shower combo, while modern, should have come with an instruction sheet. I couldn't figure out how to use it. Also, the walls are rather thin. The Regency club, while nice, was too small to accommodate all guests. On a positive note, service levels were pleasant and high. The included breakfast was very nice. Food served in the Regency Club was excellent. The hotel decor is attractive. The room is very pretty. Positives in the room include great views, good lighting, a very large in room safe and a refrigerator. The bed was comfortable and the views were great. The facilities and grounds were truly resort-like and were lovely. The proximity to Disney is very good. If you are prepared for the negatives, the hotel is in no way a bad experience and it is a pretty property with plenty to do and good service levels. I have stayed at the Peabody, the Swan, The Crown Plaza, the Hilton at Disney, the Buena Vista Palace, as well as Disney's Grand Floridian, Carribean Beach Resort and the Yacht and Beach Club. It isn't quite as convenient as the Swan to Disney, but the rooms are more up to date and the resort feel is much better. Of course, the Yacht and Beach Club and Grand Floridian are superior properties, but they are much more money. You do need a car to go back and forth to Disney but you are only about 10 minutes away with average traffic. You are also about an equivalent distance to Sea World. I can recommend this hotel--especially if rates are good. It is a shame, that with the new refurbishments, whoever designed the decor did not take functionality into account. They tack on a $20 per day resort fee, so make sure you take advantage of the facilities and take this into account when pricing your stay. You also have to pay for parking when going to Disney at a hefty $14 per day. Disney hotel guests get the parking for free, so factor that in as well.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshunt", "Title": "\u201cThe most fantastic hotel we have stayed in!\u201d", "Author": "DaniellaVandepeer", "ReviewID": "UR69757445", "Content": "We have just returned from a fantastic 2 week stay at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress.

The storm already passed and we watched the radar and it was clear. So we all went swimming and so did other guests. About 30 minutes passed and a security guard said they r shutting it down for an approaching storm. I didn't argue with him b/c i wasn't gonna cause a seen but I was furious. Other guests voiced what I was thinking. Kids were upset and it was just crazy. I would understand if there was thunder in the distance but everything had passed and it was clear.

This hotel was PERFECT. It had everything we wanted. While the Hyatt is very close to Disney, we were looking for a hotel as our entertainment and this one was a perfect fit. Although we have year passes to the Disney water parks, we never left the hotel to have fun. We obtained this property by bidding on Priceline at a great rate. We were given a room with a view of \"Buena Vista\", but did not mind not getting the prime view as the room was the same. Rooms: The rooms (and hotel) are all newly renovated so have a sleek, modern look. We loved the clean, uncluttered look. The bathrooms are also very modern and well decorated. The shower is a \"rain-head\" shower which is a nice touch. The beds were very comfortable with nice linens and a down comforter. The pillows were not down, but it is possible that this could be requested. We also had a small refrigerator which was nice for keeping lunch meats and other snacks for the kids. Our room had a king size bed and a full size pull out sofa. Grounds: The hotel is in a gated community with large grounds. This is great for bike rides and jogging, Access is limited so is a bit more secure than other areas. The main areas of the hotel are impeccably kept, very clean and in good repair. The decor is clean and uncluttered. The lobby is impressive, a nice first impression. Pool and Activities: The pool is a spectacular \"lagoon style\" with waterfalls, caves, water slides, a volley ball net and 3 Jacuzzis. The $20/day resort fee is a bargain as it includes: use of bicycles, kayaks, sunfish, paddle boats, rock climbing wall, in-room wired internet and transport to Disney parks.

My room was on the third floor. While the hotel is built around a large atrium and noise from the atrium and bar/lounge area located there traveled up to the area surrounding the elevators, once in my room, it was quiet. The rooms are nicely updated with blue glass features and dark wood. The bed was outstanding as were the bed linens and pillows. The best feature of the room was being able to see the Disney fireworks from my hotel \"balcony\" (used lightly as there is no sitting feature available). My room overlooked a great pool area and the hotel has created a park with trails through it. The pool was so inviting that I went and purchased a bathing suit so I can utilize it.

His name was JP and he made us feel right at home. The pool and grounds here are the best in the United States. It's like a gigantic tropical garden. The health spa located in a grotto/cave next to the pool can't be beat. The service at the pool was A-1. Our only oservations regarding the room was there was no water pressure for cold water and the rooms are only 360 Square feet which was ok for us but for a family? Also the toilets are not private enough from the rest of the bathroom. But to us these were insignificant. All rooms come with awesome views and we were upgraded to a pool/fireworks view at no charge. We stayed for a week and it was the weekend of the Hindu wedding which made all the papers because the groom and wedding party actually arrived on an elephant. We were hearbroken when we had to leave. One note: avoid the California Grill in the Contemporary Hotel at all costs as it will be the biggest disappointment you will have on the trip. Thre are tons of great Disney restaurants which are much better and don't get sucked in by the California Grill view. The food is 2nd rate and the portions are tiny with out of sight prices. You don't need the view when you have a fireworks view at the Hyatt. Russel and all of the people inside the Hyatt lobby were so good with tips for eateries and for avoiding lines.

The pool is open 24 hours a day, which I really liked, and their grotto pool has to be one of the best pools I have ever been in! I went swimming at 4am and loved it! I didn't eat at the hotel; I ended up walking quite a distance to restaurants and a grocery store, but it wasn't that bad because I enjoy long walks.

The second room wasn't quite as nice, but it was still great! Activities are plentiful here, and I sure didn't want to leave when it was time to go!

I agree that after reading the last few reviews I felt I should say my part and hope it helps with the difficult task of choosing a hotel to stay in when you don't know the area. Location: Secluded and private within it's own gorgeous grounds with a golf course, lake and tennis courts (they even have a nature trail that we went one day with bikes rented free from the hotel). It is 1.8 miles from Downtown Disney and they offer bus shuttles to all Disney parks, Seaworld and Universal. There are a lot of places to eat within a 1-2 mile radius from the hotel, aswell as there being about 4 restaurants within the hotel itself. We walked to dinner almost every night, it's a lovely picturesque walk which doesnt take long. We hired a car for 2 days and it was handy to get around or if you want to eat out further away at night, but it's definately not essential - although it would be cheaper to not rent from the hotel. The hotel: I walked into the lobby and was wow'd by the stunning appearance - little fountains, statues and friendly staff who offer to help at every opportunity. The room itself was immaculate and cleaned everyday. We had a view of the city rather than the pool (which would have been ideal) but it's a great view none the less. If you order breakfast in Cascade try the Bennedict - lovely! The buffet breakfast is only on weekends but there are fresh waffles and pancakes and bacon,eggs, pastries, fruit etc. There were a lot of conferences - true, and you did have to walk past suited people but i saw a lot of other people walking around in their pool wear and no one seemed to mind. Pool and facilities are fantastic with little jacuzzi's everywhere and poolside service. Some days the pool was so quiet we were the only ones around - if you like peace and quiet it's great but if you want more of a nightlife I would go closer to I-Drive. One thing I would say - is double check everyday if you go to the theme parks, the times of the shuttles. One day they didn't mention the 11pm bus wasnt running (luckily we were on the 9pm one). I felt so happy to be staying in this hotel and I know my boyfriend did too, the resort fee does sting you at the end but I would pay it again to stay there, it's definately worth it.

When we were faced with choosing a hotel this time my husband suggested we try the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress again since it had been renovated. What a huge mistake. There was no comparison to the Ritz or the Hyatt's former self. The rooms were OK. They changed the location of the club and it really has gone downhill. This is no longer one the best in Orlando. The offerings at the club have spiraled downhill offering nothing but a few stale cookies for the mid day offerings, uncomfortable seating and they are under staffed. We arrived late afternoon after they had just removed the evening offerings. The interesting part is a couple came in after us and the staff brought them out plates of food that had already been put away yet we were not offered the same courtesy. How rude!!! After a day of travel it would have been nice to have been offered the same as other guests but I guess this did not occur to the staff. Not nice. The offerings in themselves are much more limited.

Upon check in we were NOT advised that we would have a resort fee on top of what we had already paid for the hotel. The resort fee is 12 dollars plus tax per night however the hotel also added a further 15 dollars per night resort fee onto each night of our stay. Which resulted in our resort fee being 27 dollars per night plus tax. I spoke to the staff at the hotel regarding this they said that this was an error and that the resort fee was 12 dollars per night and that we would not be charged for the additional costs. However upon check out of our first 7 nights we were charged 27 dollars per night plus tax. I again had to speak to staff who again said it was an error however they only said this when I disputed the amount. If this was an error why then was a also charged a further 27 dollars per night for the final 2 nights of our stay after our cruise. Again staff said it must have been an error again this was after I had to dispute the charges, again we were happy to pay the 12 dollars per night fee but no more.

We ate in the hotel once - for breakfast - it was extremely poor to the extent that we could not eat it and we were charged 45 dollars for both.

On a journey to International Drive we were charged 50 dollars, on a return journey with a different cab company we were charged 30 dollars. A large amount of the hotel staff were very unfriendly.

The breakfast buffet within the hotel was also amazing and the most incredible waiter even had the entire dining room sing happy birthday to my six year old with a personalized plate of goodies (written in a chocolate script). I was more than satisfied with this resort and stay - I was absolutely impressed. I positively know that this would be THE place I would stay if I were lucky enough to return to Orlando. My only complaint is that with Disney so close and only seven days to stay we didn't get enough time to spend at this amazing resort for our vacation!

Seriously????\u201d", "Author": "jennsabell", "ReviewID": "UR60989670", "Content": "I'm going to do my best to give a fair review here. After all the research I did selecting this hotel, I want to help others with this post. Let me first say that while I'm not a seasoned world traveler, I've stayed at some pretty nice hotels in my time (Atlantis, The Breakers, Ritz, Princeville Kaui)--so I know a thing or two about quality service and don't mind spending high $$ when it's worth it. First the good stuff. There are three large beautiful pools with water slides and waterfalls ((great for kids)). There is a beach area by the lake with FREE bike, kayak, and paddle boats to use. Running trails. Pitch and put golf. There is a rock climbing wall (only open 12-3) and various kids activities throughout the day. The service staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean. Grounds are beautiful. As for the bad/ugly: This place is BIG TIME expensive--and I'm not quite sure why! Be prepared to spend 16$ (NOT including \"service charge\" or tip) for a salad served on a paper plate. I have NO ISSUES DROPPING SOME CASH ON VACATION, but if I'm eating a 20$ salad, it better be amazing--and this was not. If you like to drink by the pool, your gonna spend at least 6 dollars (w/o tip) for a beer 12$ or more for a mixed drink. There is ONE heated pool (82degrees)--the other two are FREEZING (62 degrees). With this said, you better reserve yourself a chair by the heated pool EARLY if you want a spot where you can watch your kids! Some people had their chairs staked out before 7 am! ALL FOOD AND DRINK OUTSIDE/BY THE POOL SHUTS DOWN BY 6PM!!?? If you plan on enjoying an \"inexpensive dinner\" by the pool ((like the infamous 20$ salad)) you can forget it. There is nothing else casual/inexpensive to choose unless you have a Dominos pizza delivered to the pool area. I don't know about you, but trying to get three tired kids to behave at one of their two upscale resturants after a day at the park would be a nightmare, so make other arrangements if you are back in time for dinner/cocktails. This was the worst part for us, as we love to sit by the pool until late in the evening and watch the kids play while having some drinks and casual dinners. It didn't happen here. There are smokers in the hotel--and you will smell it in the halls. I have read other posts on this site that support this claim. Finally, review every bill--they overcharged us once at the White Horse Resturant, and then overcharged us by TWO DAYS at checkout! Glad my husband recognized the error or we would have overpaid by over 500$$ !!!! Overall--pretty nice place, but we won't be back. If I had to do over, I'd probably try the Ritz/JW Marriott or go back to a Disney Property for the $$ we spent.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cleveland", "Title": "\u201cNever again\u201d", "Author": "nagirroc", "ReviewID": "UR60926936", "Content": "I 'won' this hotel through Priceline, and got it for a good price.

Our kids call it our home away from home. Sadly, I have to admit our last trip was disappointing in some ways. After the recent refurbishment, the once lush, gorgeous lobby is now stark and cold. The redecorated rooms are okay (our kids preferred the new design), but the sliding closet/bathroom door idea is ridiculous and the sleek, spartan look isn't particularly practical. Honestly, it's hard to believe they got much \"loyal customer\" input on the ergonomic aspects of the new design. The biggest negative change is the room service menu. They used to have a varied menu with great selections for the kids and it was open 24/7. After a long day at the parks, we always looked forward to returning to our room and having a relaxing, delicious dinner in our room. Now the room service menu is limited and pricey, especially the children's menu, which now offers mostly junky fried foods. What a disappointment! It's clear they are focusing on guests from the numerous conferences they host simultaneously and no longer catering to families. In fact, the hotel was so crowded with conferences and reunions and weddings that we were never able to park in the guest parking lot, but had to park about 1/2 a mile away and hike back to the hotel each night -- not what you want to do after walking around WDW for 10 hours! Also, I needed to print out something and was directed to the business center. Even though we paid for Internet service for our room, I had to pay for a different, very pricey internet service in the business center in order to use the printer. Even the cheap hotels give you printer access these days - but not the Hyatt! On the plus side, the wait staff in the Cascade Restaurant was as awesome as always! They remember us from visit to visit and even remembered that we usually come on my birthday -- so they surprised me with a cake. Jose in the Cascades is outstanding!!! Also, Hemingway's is the hidden jewel of Orlando restaurants. It's one of the finest meals we've ever had. The folks at the front desk were cordial and helpful as always and the grounds -- especially the pool and slide -- are amazing. Our kids love the many activities -- swimming, boating, rock climbing -- and since most of the hotel guests are attending conferences the pool area is never overcrowded.

We let the concierge know that we were there on our anniversary and he placed us on the top floor, the 18th, with a view over all of Disney. We watched the fireworks from both MK (8pm) and Epcot (9pm)! It was so cool. Location is perfect! The hotel is close to downtown Disney with several restaurants on location. While they do have several restaurants on location, hubby and I opted for dining out while we were in town as there are ton right around the corner, so I cannot comment on the food of the establishment (sorry) Parking is free, unless you opt for valeting, There is also an $18 resort fee, but that is because they have pools, hot tubs, and bikes for you to use. They also have a beach and sailboat, and I believe paddle boats (BTW, most of the resorts in the WDW area have comparable resort fees). They do have internet access as well for a fee which we did not utilize. All and all it was a beautiful newly redesigned establishment that I could find no fault with. However, if I had one recommendation for the establishment, it would be to include some bathrobes. Great hotel, would stay again and definately advise others to stay here.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel with a smell\u201d", "Author": "richpill", "ReviewID": "UR57495882", "Content": "We went Florida to go the visit Disney world.

We had been here prior to the remodel and were very happy to see that they had completely upgraded the rooms to more acceptable design. Previously, the rooms were green and hideous. New remodel has a more contemporary, sleek look with flat screen TV and hip art. Now, a few things they definitely did not do right on the remodel: 1. As mentioned in another review, I don't know who designed the new single piece bathroom/closet door -- but whoever did this must not have considered how dangerous this design is. If someone is using the closet area, where the safe is, and if someone is in the bathroom, they can slide the door without notice and seriously injure whoever is at the other end of that door. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Twice, my kids slid the bathroom door open and WHAM smacked the safe closed. If someone had their hand there, we'd be at the hospital. Whoever designed this should be barred from designing any further hotel rooms. The next act of stupidity was the new shower design. They have installed a half piece of glass on a hinge that is supposed to look cool -- but results in water ALL OVER THE FLOOR. Stepped out of the shower and nearly landed on my butt. Had I slid into that one piece door -- it would have been a real domino effect. Speaking of which, there's no lock on the bathroom door? WTF? No privacy travelling with kids. Terrible design. A couple other things we didn't like: The tv remote is useless. Doesn't do anything to the volume. They moved the center night stand where the phone should go. If you are on the bed furthest from the phone, you have to get up and walk all the way around. Finally -- let's talk about the food. I'm sorry folks, but the Hyatt has lost their mind with their menu. Where the heck do you get off IN THIS ECONOMY to charge $15.00 for eggs? C'mon. That's $60.00 for (4) people. And if you want it sent to your room, add a $3 service charge and 20%. The whole thing is ludicrous. Should have a $7.95 or $8.95 breakfast and make it reasonable to eat in the hotel. I can WELL AFFORD the $15 -- but refuse to spend it out of principle. It's just absurd. There are 15 other places to eat across the street and I'll spend my money there and get some value. Now, with respect to the location, grounds and room value -- it's excellent. We have stayed on the Disney property in the past and it's not worth it. We will however carefully evaluate the Ritz and new Hilton next visit as it is clear that the Hyatt has lost touch with reality on the other details besides the price of the room. One last comment about the parking. The $20 per night valet is also absurb -- and the self park is not THAT far.. but does fill up.

Where do I start, well the re-furbished room decor is a matter of personal taste, personally I loathe beige, it is singuarly boring and uninspiring particularly in a 'tropical' setting, but worse is the design faults in the rooms. A single glass penelled sliding door to cover both the bathroom entrance, then slide it along to cover the warddrobe space, so impractical. When I exited the bathroom one day, pushing the door to the right, I nearly took my husbands arm off as he was trying to put things away in the safe - which is so low down in the wardrobe area you have to get on your knees. The door slammed into the safe door which in turn slammed into my husband's arm. Also in the bedroom there was an armchair and a foot stool. The chair has such high arms to it that when you get in the chair, which then sinks down lower than the adjoining footstool, you can't get out (I jest not!). No phone by the bed either. A tiny amount of full length hanging space in the wardrobe, sufficient if you are there for a few days on a conference but not at all enough if there on a holiday of a week or more. Housekeeping seems very ad-hoc, good when it is done, but sometimes one would wait until late afternoon to get the room serviced. On to the Resturants now. Well La Coquina when it is open, ie Chefs Table on a Saturday night or Sunday Brunch is fabulous and highly recommended. Hemingways has gone severely down. They used to serve wonderful lobsters, with finger bowls, bibs etc. Now all you get are pale imitations of what a lobster should be, ie small, very small and a heated damp towel. All the restaurant seems interested in, judging by the form they give you after the meal, is whether the server addresed you by your name. There is nowhere on the form to comment on the food which has deteriorated markedly. The Palm Cafe which used to have good casual food available is now a former shadow of its past. The grocery section is seriously underwhelming,and the salad bar where you used to get lovely salads is now non-existant. It also closes about 5pm each day. Cascades is only open for breakfast. That too is a hit and miss affair as the breakfast buffet seems to be on and then off the menu at the whim of the chef. We were told several mornings that yes there would be a buffet the following morning only to arrive that morning to find no buffet because there weren't enough guests in the hotel!! We were then told the breakfast buffet was 'guaranteed' at the weekend, like hell it was. No buffet. When we did order from the menu every order came with a mistake no joking, and as for trying to get more than one pat of butter at a time that too was difficult and proptracted. I actually felt sorry for the staff as they were embarassed by the whole set-up. We had some friends who drove down from outside the State to see us.Naturally on arrival we wanted to get them coffee etc. Bearing in mind this is a 5* hotel. The best we could get was a do-it-yourself coffee in paper cups from the Palm Cafe and even then they only had de-caf not regular available. In all that vast reception area there was no-one available to get us and our guests a decent cup of coffee in china, maybe with some biscuits or cakes. It is unbeliable. We ventured over to the Ritzt Carlton, oh my goodness what a difference. We felt really welcome, the resturants there are amazing and open. The rooms (we asked to be shown round) are fabulous. The Regency Club equivalent is to die for, everything there you could possibly want, unlike the re-vamped Regency Club at the Hyatt which I had a sneak preview of. Decor more beige, and for goodness sake don't let your chldren out on to the open terrace whch is a death trap. Railings round and then for good measure lets put some window-type boxes there as well just so the kids can clamber on them to get a better view of everything - you are 12 flights up!! This hotel says it has spent 65m dollars on its renovations, all I can say is 'you were done'. The designers, architects and suppliers must be laughing all the way to the bank, and as for the Management cost-cutting consultants, you have cut so much I for one don't want to return, which probably means you will cut more, but still you want the Conference business not the private individual holiday-maker who look for different things. The end of a 25 year love affair, I will not be returning. It is blatently obvious that the hotel has had in management consultants who have trimmed everything to the absolutely bottom line. Whilst this probably doesn't effect you if you go on a Conference where everything is provided and it is easy for the hotel to budget and cater for, as an idependent guest it is a disaster. What should have been a nice relaxing holiday in lovely suroundings with first rate staff and amenities became quite honestly an uphill struggle the whole visit.

She made a few comments under her breath and proceeded to tell us that she wished people would learn to read! By this time the people behind us had noticed the sign as well and back out to pull in the correct lane (I guess we were not the only ones who couldn\u2019t read) The guard went back in her station and came back out with our parking permit and also with an apology for the way she acted, explaining that she had had a long day. Thank goodness this was the only incident like this and the rest of the stay was great. At check in we were given a room on the 14th floor, although it had a gorgeous view I quickly figured out that I am a bit afraid of heights and this was a little too high for my liking, so we went back down to the desk to request a room on a lower floor and they promptly moved us to a room on the 3rd floor, much better :) Although they were doing construction on the hallways on this floor it didn\u2019t bother us and we never heard a peep from it. We had a refurbished room and it was wonderful, very clean with a super comfy bed. The only minor complaints (so minor I probably wouldn\u2019t even call them complaints) were that the shower, although it looked very nice, leaked huge puddles of water out onto the floor. We just set a towel outside the shower when we used it and that seemed to fix the problem. The other negative was that the balcony was tiny, with no room for chairs so you can\u2019t really sit out there and read a book or enjoy a drink, but once again not a big deal. The property itself was gorgeous and huge; we didn\u2019t even get a chance to explore everything. The only downfall to the property itself I think was that the main pool was not heated, it was very cold. The smaller heated pool was okay though, but still a tad cool for my liking. The poolside bar service was great, although I found it easier to just walk the 30 seconds to the bar and order yourself a drink instead of waiting for the waitresses to bring your drinks which usually took about 10- 15 min to get after ordering, whereas if you go up to the bar yourself it takes about 2 minutes. I think the best part of our stay had to be the breakfast, it was amazing. The service was absolutely outstanding everyday, minus one day when I think they were a bit busier than expected, but even that day it was good, and the food was amazing all 6 mornings we ate there. Although the breakfast was my favorite part I don\u2019t think I would eat there had it not been included with the room as the prices were a bit steep for breakfast. All in all the stay was great; we had a clean comfortable room, great service all around, as well as a delicious breakfast every morning. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone looking for a higher class feel, but although I loved this property and our stay was amazing I\u2019m not sure I would stay at this resort on future visits if I had to pay full price. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not worth full price if you are looking for top notch, but we actually feel a bit more comfortable at a not so fancy place while we are on vacation, but if the price was right we would defiantly stay again.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sandwich, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort for adults and kids.\u201d", "Author": "jb187", "ReviewID": "UR49438117", "Content": "Stayed here for two nights after booking through Hotwire.

However, this was the first time we've ever stayed here and it was easily the best hotel we've ever stayed at in Orlando. We wouldn't hesitate to go back there. The pool area is huge and outstanding, with the constant soothing sound of waterfalls. The pitch and putt course is excellent and really sharpens your short game up. The Racquets Club is very good, with about 10 courts, some of which are hard courts, some of which are clay. There's a basketball court, a beach volleyball court, a grass volleyball court, all of which are very good quality. The gym's not bad, but bizarrely, as with most American Hotel gyms, is quite old fashioned. It's perfectly useable for a holiday gym though. The lake is great for kayaking or for using a pedalo, and just soothing for being there. There are also some running trails set up that take you round the hotel's grounds, which are extensive and very well looked after. I'm not sure they've got their measurements right on their running trails though. It felt a lot longer than 4.7 miles. The main reception/atrium area is very impressive, brightened up by the entertaining macaw and cockatoo. It did sometimes spell a bit odd though. We were in a refurbished room on the 18th floor and it was very nicely done and very quiet. Some people have commented on the fact that they think the rooms are too small, but what are you planning to do in your room that requires so much space? The room sizes are fine. Also, people have commented on the fact that the hotel food is expensive, which it is, but why would you eat there when you have a plethora of really nice restaurants just outside of the hotel grounds? There's a Dunkin Donuts (great for breakfast), a Macaroni Grill, a Chilis, an Olive Garden, a Sizzler etc, etc. Also, yes they do quite have a conferences there, but I think it adds to the atmosphere of the hotel, even if most of them are attended by the chinos brigade.

Our recent stay was terrible, firstly when we checked in we were hit with the resort fee $18 per night, we asked what this was for and what it included and was told it was for the use of the Gym, Bicycles, Pedalos, Etc. We explained that we would not be using any of these things and therefore would not be paying, after a lengthy discussion with the lady at the reception she agreed to waive the fee, however the fee with a reduced rate appeared on the account review on the T.V. We then spoke to the Manager who agreed to drop the fee, but spoke to me in a very patronising manner. Next we had a garden view room on the eight floor, it overlooked the front of the Hotel, nice gardens but also a view of the car park, but worst of all the huge air con building, the noise it emitted was unbearable!!! My husband went to the reception at 4am. to complain. We chainged rooms the next day to a room on the 14th floor, it was a bit better, the balcony door did not fit properly and had to fill the gaps with newspaperto stop the whisteling sound of air, but we still had to buy ear plugs, the noise was just unbearable. It is the first time we could not wait for the holiday to end. I fully understand that the Hotel has to make money but the constant corporate functions being held in the walkways from the car parks is very intrusive, it`s difficult to get a path through the people at times, could they not hold these functions in the massive rooms set aside for such things! I dont suppose they consider how intimidating it is everytime you return to the Hotel. Also the newly refurbished rooms seem quite tacky and have lost the luxury feel. I have issues with the shower door, the water pours out onto the floor. Also the sliding closet/bathroom door is a stupid idea (somebody will be injured). To sum up, this Hotel is constantly costcutting E.G. you used to get complmentary coffee and orange juice in the mornings on the 9th floor, there used to be a candy dish on the table in your room toped up each day, there was a pianist playing a grand piano in the lobby all day, etc. etc. In fact with all the hidden charges the Hotel has become a rip off. With regret I could not recommend this Hotel any more. I won`t even talk about the lack of reasonably priced places to eat in this hotel.

The staff was excellent, the room was very nice, the swimming pool was far superior to the one at the Disney resort and the kids just loved the colorful parrots in the beautiful and huge hotel lobby. Add in boat rentals and tons of other things for kids to do, and you've got a fantastic overall package of activities for family members. We were too busy at the Disneyworld parks to take advantage of most of the options the hotel provided (except the pool which we hit just about every day), but we enjoyed every minute we spent at the Hyatt. While there are multiple shuttles taking people to all the local attractions, we rented a car (Priceline $25/day) which provided us with more flexibility. Little kids can be temperamental when they get tired so the inexpensive auto rental and the flexibility it afforded us to skip the Disney trams or Hyatt shuttle bus was well worth the nominal added expense. If I had paid the full retail rate for this hotel I probably would have felt it was still well worth the expense in comparison to what Disney offerings for a similar price, but getting it for a steal on Priceline made it all that much better.

We were only able to drive for about six hours before exhaustion took over. With shame, we stopped at a Radisson Hotel in Louisiana. It has recently been refurbished / renovated and it was very nice. They offered a nice continental breakfast and then we continued are trip east-bound. Along the way, we saw the deviation towards Destin beach and we couldn\u2019t resist. We veered off the highway and found the most beautiful beach ever! We\u2019ve visited the Caribbean, Hawaii, California & Florida beaches and this one was by far and large, an unexpected surprise. It has all the tourist trappings; but the sand and the water are just amazing. We were hesitant to leave; but leave we did (already four hours behind schedule)! Already making plans to go back and dedicate a trip just to that area! We arrived in Orlando many hours later, tired and exhausted. We had read other postings about trying Priceline.com for discounts at the Hyatt Regency-Grand Cypress Hotel & Resort. Since this is one of our favorite destinations/lodging in Orlando-we decided to give it a try. We were able to get an $80/rate (plus taxes & resort fee) per night! The reason for the discount is likely that they had a lot of construction going on at the hotel; but we did not have any hassles because of it. Our room was one of the renovated rooms and it was very nice. Bummer that we had to pay to have internet access (and not included in the daily resort fee either); but parking was free and the grounds are just fabulous! We decided to spend our first full day at Animal Kingdom. We contacted someone via Craigslist for discount tickets. They met us at the park entrance and while we had to wait, we got into the parks for about $30 per person less than the pricing at the gate (approx. $90 for a family of 3). Animal Kingdom is a park that can be done in about half a day and we enjoyed it. As expected, food at the parks is expensive-so budget that in\u2026 Our second day in Orlando, we spent at the local Premium Outlets shops, getting a massage (ladies) and golfing (guys). We had dinner at the Texas de Brazil (kind of like a Fogo de Chao) and it was very nice, tasty and close! Our third day was spent at Magic Kingdom. This is always one of the tried & true places to visit. This park does take ALL day to visit; but we enjoyed it immensely. After a very tired and long day, we went to the Hyatt pools to relax! This trip was a combination of theme parks / 5-day cruise itinerary. So, we headed off to Port Canaveral to board the Monarch of the Seas. While a very nice ship, it is the oldest (?) and much smaller than our previous cruise experiences. It has all the amenities of the newer ships; but scaled down in size. We always purchase an inside cabin-since we don\u2019t spend much time in there anyway\u2026 Our first stop was Coco Cay and we were really, really looking forward to the snorkeling. Unfortunately, there was an abundance of jelly fish in the water (way too many to count and EVERYWHERE). While we were constantly \u201cstung\u201d, it was more like an itch and none of us had a bad reaction to them. The water was murky at best and with too jellyfish in the water, we were not inclined to stay at the main beach. After the cruise provided lunch \u201cbuffet\u201d which is plentiful, we walked farther to the less populated beach areas. We found one little stretch that did not have hardly any jellyfish, was shallow and just wonderful! My husband enjoyed the shaded lounge chairs while I enjoyed looking for shells with our son (age 10). After that, we spent some time at the huge water slides provided at a charge ($20/pp). Our son had a blast! Finally, another fun and exhausted day had come to an end. Our second and last stop was in Nassau (Bahamas). We got on the ferry to Paradise Island (Atlantis) and regretted it immediately. Not only did it take FOREVER, but it also made a few of our friends very sick (too much rocking!!!). Way too much time is spent cramming every available tourist into the tiny, ill-kept boats. Never again. Once we arrived at Paradise Island, we had to still walk quite a ways towards the Atlantis resort. Yet another reason to take a taxi the next time around! Atlantis is a beautiful property. You can see most of the aquariums without paying for the armband/bracelet. In fact, while we paid for our bracelets (about $75/pp), one of the other families did not and they had no trouble getting in/out of the \u201cpaid only\u201d areas\u2026 One of the \u201cpaid for areas\u201d was a private beach and it was a \u201cWOW\u201d beach, beautiful indeed. They had plenty of lounge chairs, some with shade and they had staff coming around offering beverages. Some locals offered the wave runners / jet skis and for about $75 for 2-3 hours, it was well worth it. This is definitely a place for negotiating the price down aka: the initial charge was $100 for 45 minutes\u2026 Be sure to eat early because many of the on-site restaurants close around 2pm! They do however, have a nice sit-down restaurant close to the casino that is reasonably priced. We visited the casino for a little while (evening) and then headed back to the boat by 9pm. We lost all of our \u201cinvestment\u201d while our friends essentially made back their trip $$ at the slot machines. Go figure! Our day at sea was enjoyable and we pretty much relaxed all day long. My cousin and I enjoyed playing bingo; but never won (we never do) and got to really enjoy the ship. We did our little souvenier shopping while the boys played poker in the casino. Again, donating money to the cruise line\u2019s coffers\u2026 We packed our bags and got ready for the next day. While we drove to our relative\u2019s homes in West Palm Beach for a few more days of leisure time, our friends/family flew home. They took the cruise shuttle to the airport without any delays, problems. They did have to get off earlier though\u2026 We took the more leisurely route and had breakfast (on the ship) and lounged around until they essentially kicked us off the boat (J/K). Our drive to WPB was uneventful and we had booked our stay at the Hyatt Place (close to CityPlace). It was \u201cnew\u201d and very upscale, updated and central to almost everything. Parking and Internet access was included in the rate (one night at $100 and the 2nd at 50% off). We visited the beach, family and had an all around nice time. Too soon, it was time to start the drive back home. A long trip; but very enjoyable.

Couldn't believe they arrange a super-sized baby crib (Grand Floridian Resort offered a full-size crib, but this is even bigger!). The location was perfect ~ close to good restaurant and it is right next to downtown Disney. It is true that somebody complains the $18 resort fee ~ but what ~ this includes your parking, local calls, and all the amenities in this resort including swimming pool, bike, rock climbing (too bad no free internet). I think it is good value and for sure will come back. Oh yes, parking is a little far away, but not as far as described by others. I don't see any security concern even I parked the car alone at night.

Overall we had a great time. Check-in was great with a glass of champagne and a guided tour of the hotel by the porter as he took our bags to the room. The room itself had a great view over the pool and lake and you could see the Disney fireworks in the distance from the balcony. It had a great bathroom with a massive shower, loads of wardrobe and drawer space - it just lacked somewhere to store suitcases out of sight. The room was really clean and had a good standard of cleaning throughout the stay - even when we had slept in and they had to come back later. We also took advantage of room service pizza, which was quite expensive but huge - so actually not that bad value for money. The only complaint with the room was there was an ajoining door to the next room, which meant any sound travelled really easily between the two rooms. Also there were some building works going on which were quite noisy during the day time - they also resulted in the fire alarm ringing for about an hour one evening. However, when we complained, the staff were very apologetic about this and gave us a discount on our resort fee at the end of the holiday. Next the facilities. Basically your resort fee covered the use of the pool, fitness rooms, golf, canoes, sailing, bikes, tennis, table tennis, volleyball etc. If you are planning to spend a lot of time in the hotel, there is plenty to do and it is pretty good value. However, as we were out all day, nearly every day, we didn't really get the best value although we did use the bikes once and go out in a canoe. The main pool was a bit cold in April - it suffered from being very large with a lot of it in the shade. It was fine for actually swimming, but if you wanted to just bob about, there was a smaller heated pool and 3 hot tubs that were never very busy. I also made use of the Beauty Salon to have a hair cut. The food and drink was great throughout the hotel. The lobby bar was a great place to have a beer or a cocktail at the end of the day. The service was always great and there was also a guy making sushi to order. As we hadn't really had much sushi before, the staff were really helpful in suggesting what we might enjoy and it was delicious. There was also the White Horse which was a pub-type restaurant. People dressed quite casually and there were TV's showing various sports. We had two great meals there and although quite expensive, you got bread to start with and a main course was enough to satisfy our big appetites. We had steaks one night and burgers another. There was a poolside bar, which served snacks at lunchtime - although these were more like full meals. They also had a waitress service at the sunbeds. The weekend buffet breakfast was great. At $20 it was expensive and yes, there was a Denny's a short walk away which was less than half the price, but the selection in the hotel was great, so we ate there a couple of times when we were having a late start. Pancakes and waffles were made to order, with Mickey Mouse ears for the kids (and for big kids if you asked nicely). There was loads of fresh fruit, cold meats, cheeses, Sausages, bacon, eggs, hash browns, oatmeal, cereals, croissants, bagels, toast, sticky buns, bottomless coffee, tea, orange juice and water served to your table (I don't think our cups were ever empty!) and loads more I can't even remember. Probably our favourite place in the hotel was Hemmingway's - the fish restaurant. It was set overlooking the lake and we ate there three times. The food was superb - really fresh and delicious. On the first two occassions, we just had main courses. Again, you were served bread to start with and this was more than adequate. On our very last night we treated ourselves to a proper 3 course meal, with oysters, cerviche, delicious alaskan king crab and very indulgent puddings. Even though the restaurant was quite quiet, the atmosphere was great and the service was fantastic. The waiter was really knowledgeable about the food and was able to make some great recommendations. We never felt rushed, even though we were the only ones left at the end. The manager even came and spoke to us, who we had seen on our first day and asked us how our honeymoon had been. We made use of the hotel bus to go to Seaworld, but then decided to drive to the rest of the theme parks, so we could come and go as we wanted. The hotel was really handy for Disney, with only a 5 minute drive to Downtown Disney. It was about a half hour drive to get over to Universal and one hour to Busch Gardens and Kennedy Space Centre. It was very handy for getting onto the highway, but despite that, the hotel felt like it was in the middle of nowhere.

Usually they have the waterfalls all lit up in the pool, it is just beautiful, this time the waterfalls were turned off at night. This is just a small detail but something I looked foward to . Second change that I didn't like is the lobby, it use to be a plant and garden atrium, very pretty to see, now most of the plants are torn out and they have gone with this asian theme, with weird statues, very plain and boring not anywhere near breathtaking like before. Also now the free buses that take you to the parks doesn't take you anymore to the individual parks , they take you to a transportaion center where you get on another bus for the Disney park you want.

Here is our take on Grand Cypress (from which we returned today) Pros: Big facility -- pool complex is impressive, plus water fun like boats, plus bikes and bike paths If you ask, you get great views of the nightly MK fireworks and Epcot fireworks. Personable, welcoming service at the towel hut poolside and in Cascades, the Main Dining Room (went there for b-fast for 2 ams) Super-close to Disney. We were 5 minutes from Downtown Disney and maybe 15 from the Magic Kingdom. Great location. Plentiful fresh squeezed oj.... the best! Cons: They are under construction at the moment. 4-5 floors taken up by this plus rooms on the various other floors. Forget this hotel if you need a nap for you or your children during the construction work day. They are just not good at explaining things. Didn't explain the voucher system (some days you need one for kids, other days not) so we wound up with a billing snafu; sent us a VERY long out of the way to Capital Grill for dinner. Sent us an equally long out of the way to get to Starbucks on the way to airport as we departed. Self-parking is really out of the way. $12 valet at front door. With the construction, on the floors they have guests staying, they should at least wipe down the construction residue from ledges and railings each day... it is THICK with white powder floating up through the huge lobby atrium! It is the downside of having such a massive (and wonderful) pool complex -- but skimming the pool for residue is a must and is being overlooked. Must skim out the floating, dead crickets, yellow jackets, and floating fruit (a pear... dismaying to swim by a pear) even when the pool is open 24 hours. I saw folks power washing lounge chairs, but they also need to be checking on the pool detritis. Finally, poolside bar service is a rare, but wonderful, thing. This hotel would do well to amp its profit margin by shilling for more drinks poolside. There were more than a few thirsty parents, honeymooners and just plain, wonderful people THIRSTY for bar service that was far too infrequent given the expanse of pool. We stayed in a brand-new refurbished room. No desk or desk chair in the room... this is a huge minus... sometimes you need to talk to a restaurant or the concierge for some length of time directly to make a call. Sometimes you need to do work in your room. They are really casting their lot with the family (and not the business) traveler when they don't put a desk and chair in the room. The lobby, with its Asian motif, is grand, but not comfortable. If you are meeting folks for drinks or a meeting you will find it hard to have a warm, comfortable conversation in this lobby. We may be back... because of PRICE! The asset of the pool and its close location to Disney may encourage a return visit. We hope by then some of these Cons are worked on!

We booked 1 room for my wife and I and another for my daughters family. We always visit the theme parks before the heat and crowds set in.

As with the decline of service in all areas of this country \"no one knows anything\" \"no one is responsible for anything\" ....and the Hyatt follows that course. In the morning we went down to the cafe in the hotel to get some fresh fruit for breakfast. We found the cafe closed off and empty. But you could get a $20. buffet breakfast of pigfat and all kinds of other unhealthy crap. I asked if the cafe was closed to drive people into the $20 a plate breakfast and was told unashamedly \"yes\". Such poor construction that any time you spent in the room you had to listen to doors slamming in the hallway outside. The maid staff also hollered to each other and slammed each door as the went in and out. The resturants are a complete overpriced waste of time.

We went down to complain and were told that the renovations were taking place on the 5th floor (no kidding) and the noise would stop at 6pm.

We did not mind being separated as it was much quieter! The 2nd floor room was an older room; the 10th floor was a renovated room. The older room had an 80'd decor but was otherwise fine. The pressure in the shower there was fantastic! The 10th floor renovated room was very beautiful--a calm, spa-like decor. The beds were comfortable, but as others have stated, the water pressure was pretty low. Our only complaint was that with a glass door on the shower unless you are very comfortable with your companions, you couldn't have one person getting ready while another showered. Therefore we tried to use the hairdryer in the room itself, but there was no plug anywhere near the mirror. Not a huge deal. The hotel itself was fabulous. The elevators were extremely fast and we never had to wait more than a minute to get one. We did not eat in any of the restaurants as they were rather expensive and since we had a car we were able to go to many wonderful Orlando restaurants.

That being said, it's a small price to pay for the ammenities this hotel has to offer.

The two previous reviews I wrote were glowing, but I am sorry to say that my recent stay has left me feeling much less positive about the Hyatt Regency, than before. I have read a number of recent reviews, which are very positive, despite the current renovations, but these do not reflect my experience. Firstly, you should beware - the renovations currently taking place are both extensive and intrusive. I estimate that 60% of the rooms are currently out of use, and are at various stages of renovation. This means that there is a high level of noise during the day, specifically from jackhammers, and there is often a slight haze of dust in the air in common areas, with an accompanying smell. The lobby ornamental water feature is drained, and the lobby gardens have been dug up - although now largely replaced - albeit at the cost of an unpleasant smell of organic manure over a period of a few days! A major issue, is that the elevators which form a central element of the access to the hotel lobby from the self parking lot have been temporarily removed - meaning that access to the lobby is either through the fairly dark and winding garden paths, or by navigating some blind corners to access a small lift, located in a, at night usually deserted area. This is a significant issue - I am a well built male (although that would make no difference against a gun or knife) but felt uneasy accessing and waiting for the lift up to the lobby. I would say that this is a no go area for a lone female, who would have no option really, but to pay for valet parking. On the plus side, the outside garderns remain beautiful and untouched, as do the three large and very pleasanr swiming pools. I have no idea whether there are any plans to change these as part of the renovation. Again on the plus side, the renovated rooms look very good and modern, and are comfortable, with improved, high powered air conditioning, which had absolutely no problem in coping with outside temperatures of up to 39 degrees. On the minus side though, the rooms ore something of a triumph of form over practicality. They look good, but have design shortcomings. There is insufficient drawer and storage space for four people - only two large drawers, and three further very shallow drawers. There are no bedside tables with drawers - just an open shelf arrangement. There are only three (that I could count anyway) additional power points - two of which need you to get on hands and knees to access beneath the bedside shelves, and one of which, is very awkwardly placed behind the main console - which does not provide enough of a gap to use a plug connected to a UK adapter. Another review mentions the showers, and it is true that it is possible to get a lot of water on the floor - but only if you are careless! It is worth mentioning though, that the water pressure in the room is extremely low - I was told as part of a green initiative to use less water. Again, another minor design irritation, is that a space of about two inches has been left between the ends of the dresser and the adjacent walls - just wide enough for things to fall down, but not wide enough to get a hand or arm in to retrieve them! I do wonder why designers do not elect to spend a few days in their creations to test their practicality! My last comment is about the staff, who I have always felt are the most significant strength of ther HYatt. Clearly, given the unavailability of a very significantr number of rooms, staff must have been laid off - which shows at peak times, when for example, managers can be seen clearing dishes and waiting in the restaurant.. We all felt that there was a subtle change in the staff attitude, which is difficult to put a finger on - perhaps a reflection of the changed ambience in the hotel at the moment - there were virtually no conventions during our two week stay, and the huge majority of guests were leisure guests, many of whom had obtained very cheap room rates - this did subtly change the atmosphere, and led the swimming pool area to be busier that on our previous two stays, despitethe greatly reduced room availability. Overall, I have no doubt that the Hyatt will be great to stay in again, once the renovations are completed and the teething problems above have been rectified (assuming they are rectified!). You will have a pleasant enough stay if you go just now, but try to do so on the basis of reduced room costs - I think most people would be unhappy in the extreme to pay the full, normal room rates for a hotel undergoing renovations to the extent that the Hyatt is.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cWould go back tomorrow...\u201d", "Author": "gorgegeorgie", "ReviewID": "UR33829446", "Content": "Just returned from an amazing stay at this hotel.

Room is very well designed - refrig, lighting, flat screen tv, and front av hook ups for tv. HOWEVER, the bathrooms, although beautiful, are a engineering failure in my opinion. The showers cause a flood every single use ! The doors do not prevent water from running right onto floor. The rain shower head as well as hand held head and wonderful but the floor flooding is a danger and I forsee major problems with both safety and mildew ! The other room we had with the bath tub was an equal nightmare. There was a shower door on the tub but it only covered HALF of the tub. When you stand in the shower you have the glass door and then where the door ends there is.......NOTHING !! It is open and all the water sprays right out onto the floor.

We did not find the construction to be noisy or disruptive. Housekeeping excellent and very kind and accommodating as always. Our Bellman Robert was exceptional - informative and extremely friendly. We kept him talking so long I was afraid we would get him in trouble. All in all it is still a wonderful place and will be gorgeous when completed but the bathroom flooding is extreme. Keep everything that you do not want ruined off the bathroom floor. I had a toiletry bag and hairdryer that got destroyed by the water !

It was a blind bid for a 4-star hotel in Orlando. We were very pleasantly surprised when we drove up to see a beautifully landscaped, gated resort right off International Drive. The front desk gave us a welcome glass of champagne and we rode the glass elevator up to our room. We asked for a pool view room and we could see the Epcot dome in the distance. The pool complex is beautifully landscaped and has one pool that you swim through a cave with waterfalls to get to another pool area. There are a couple of waterslides, one that is high and more like a waterpark. It would be good to allow a day or half day just to enjoy the pool area and the lake on the property. They have free paddleboat, canoe, kayak and sunfish rentals. We used their bikes to ride around the resort paths for an hour one late afternoon. The hotel lobby is tropical and lush. The parrot, Merlot, and the cockatiel bird looked happy and well cared for. In the evening they were taken off their lobby perches and hopefully rested privately. The breakfast buffet in the morning is top-notch, pricey, but worth it to us for a vacation splurge. There are made to order pancakes, and extensive egg, meat pastry, cereal and fruit buffets. The service was friendly and excellent. It was about 20 minutes or so from the Grand Cypress parking lot (we self-parked) to the Epcot parking lot. Overall, the friendly and professional staff are the best thing about the Hyatt Grand Cypress. From the doormen, to bell hops, to housekeeping, restaurant staff, and the front desk, everyone was the most consistently professional I've encountered in a long time.

But was surprised, that starting exactly at 9 am on Saturday construction noise (very loud) started\u2026 There was no construction noise on Sunday. But I just wished the front desk had informed me in advance about Saturday. The hotel was great. The pool was amazing !!! I had lunch at the pool and found the prices to be OK and the food quality very good. Our room had not been renovated yet, but they had pictures in the room of what it will look like in 2010 following the renovation, which looks to be very modern and trendy. I did not mind the current d\u00e9cor, but rooms and the TV\u2019s are definitely dated, but well maintained. I was surprised how small the rooms were, while I got an upgraded pool/late view, the rooms all seemed to be standard size. I had 2 double beds there were desk in the room. The room also had a fridge. There was a small balcony that was too small to even have a chair on it. For couples the room size is fine, but I think for a family of 4 they would be too small. The bathroom was large. There was clearly some water damage in the bathroom, which I assumed they hadn\u2019t fixed since they were about to renovate the rooms. Also sometime the shower water was only luke warm even, even in the off hours. Customer service, check-in and out were easy and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. I was excited that there was a shuttle to Disney until we found out its times. Only 2 drop off times and 2 pick up times. Drop off was either at 8 or 9 am , but pick up was either around 7 pm or 8pm. We had to leave the parks by 5pm/6pm as we had dinner plans so the evening pick-up time didn\u2019t work. We ended up driving in ourselves. While the housekeeping staff was very friendly, when I first arrived into my room there were some paper debris on the floor on my room (that you couldn\u2019t miss).

We had a double queen room and it was $230 per night. Service was great, everyone was very nice, rooms were cleaned every day, room service was fast but outrageously expensive. FOOD: First night we got there late and ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and a shrimp cocktail and it was over $50. We ordered breakfast one day - 2 ham and cheese omelettes with one side of bacon and coffee. That was $60. Hamburgers are $15, you get the picture. Poolside mixed drinks: $14; martinis in the bar: $14 Bring a lot of cash because you are going to need it. Even though it is really expensive, the food was very, very good. So at least you get quality for what you are paying. We were going to order pizza one night and they told us they won't even allow pizza delivery guys on the property, which forces you to buy their pizza and pay their prices. The pizza was pretty good though. CAR SERVICE: At this hotel they have town cars ready to take you wherever you want to go. A 10-minute ride to Discovery Cove cost us $40. The driver pretended to not have change and said he couldn't reach it in his pocket and would need to pull over \"up there\" to find the change. His way of having us tell him to just keep it. We found the local Taxi service to be less, a 10-minute ride being $15. FREE BUS TO SEAWORLD/UNIVERSAL: There was a bus that left in the morning and came to get you late afternoon from either Seaworld or Universal. The driver said that the bus would be in the same spot to pick us up at 6:10 and it was never there. We were forced to get a cab, which cost $17, to bring us back. He told us that they swing by right where they dropped us off. I assumed this meant that they picked us up there. No, didn't mean that... the bus was there because we saw it leave, but it was parked way down where other busses were and NOT by the park benches where the trolleys go... so if you are going to use that bus, keep this in mind! FOOD ALTERNATIVE: On our last day we went for a walk to the Orlando Ale House right outside the hotel ground across the street and wished we'd have found that place our first day. I had a 1.5 pound lobster for $15 (Wednesday only). Beers were a buck... wine was $5. WALKING DISTANCE - WHERE TO GO: We did walk to downtown Disney from the hotel. I think it was maybe 2 miles. Was nice to burn some calories. There is also a little store around the corner off the property called, \"SUPER MARKET.\" We stocked the hotel room fridge with some stuff from here. The water in the hotel room was horrible tasting so we got some water, some wine, and miscellaneous munchies. To buy bottled water there was I think $3 or more each. There was no microwave in the room so all the leftover food kind of went to waste. BEACH: There is a beach at the hotel with cool peddal boats you can take out (all free). We tried a few but didn't spend a lot of time on it because my 11-year old was kind of freaked about the \"beware of alligators\" signs. There is a cabana where you just sign the waiver and they help you into it and they are there when you get out to pull you up to the pier. Someone is also always there watching with a motorized rescue boat. The lake is very small so it's not like you will get lost and they also said that they haven't seen an alligator there in 8 months. BAR: Already got into how expensive the drinks were but there is a sushi bar right there in the bar and he made the most excellent sushi ever. Cost for 6 spicy tuna rolls was $9.50. POOL: Pools really are nice, with waterfalls and just a very clean, nice setting. There is only one heated pool and everyone was there. WORKOUT ROOM: Very nice workout room with a steam room, a sauna, and nice showers. ONE PROBLEM: There was a $130 salon charge on our bill that we didn't make. They said I had a massage but I didn't. Someone apparently charged something to our room and the hotel would not immediately take it off, they said they had to investigate it. This was a couple days ago now and we still haven't heard from them. Wherever you go you can just charge everything to your room so I guess there are some crooks out there who like to charge their stuff to other people's rooms and that is what apparently what happened to us. They better remove the charge or I'll be back on here to let everyone know they did not.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBeen here before and keep coming back\u201d", "Author": "Vanderneucker", "ReviewID": "UR26351125", "Content": "I have been to this Hyatt several times.

We thought the prices were acceptable for the convenience considering the overpriced unhealthy junk at the theme parks. We had the chef's table La Coquina dining experience which was very enjoyable and delectable. Also, I fully recommend you take the free shuttle over to the Villas to the Club Restaurant and have breakfast there (better than the Cascades). Their dinner there was great too. You can also go to the street using that shuttle and go to a whole strip of restaurants (usual American fat food). The service is fantastic. When the shuttle didn't show up (first day of schedule change), they arranged another shuttle to pick us up and waived our resort fee for that day. We used the shuttle to Seaworld to take the I-Ride trolley ($1.25) to get to the Prime shopping outlet stores. But the way back is difficult and we had to get a taxi back ($20). As another reviewed wrote, if you want to come back later or earlier than the last shuttle back from Disney, you have to go to a Disney resort (but that gave us a chance to visit them and check them out) by Disney bus or monorail, then take a Disney bus to Downtown Disney (free - it's all shops and restaurants), then actually if you cross the street and catch a taxi in front of the Hilton, it's only $5 or so (instead of $12-15). Hope the tips help. This is a fantastic resort. And the \"warmed\" pool was nice for a quick dip although it's cool due to February weather. It got busier at the end of our stay (Presidents Day).", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at the Hyatt - Couple of \"Gotchas\"\u201d", "Author": "Aslan99", "ReviewID": "UR24646149", "Content": "Great stay at the Hyatt.

BUT BEWARE: 1) Golf is $190 for guests + $65 club rental. The course is NOT WORTH THE MONEY! I would peg it as a $50 course. No character, adjacent to ugly freeways and vacant swaths of land, grass off fairways all brown, clueless greenskeepers refuse to clear greens when hitting. I drove by the Disney courses with envy after being ripped off at the Grand Cypress course. 2) The bus to Disney takes off only at 2 times in the morning ~8AM and 9AM, and the first run back in the evening is ~7:30PM. If you aren't planning on a 12+hour theme park day, you have to find your way back to the hotel by taking a disney bus to a resort, then to downtown disney, then a taxi to the Hyatt - about a 45min-1hr affair. 3) Downtown Disney is close, but not walking distance.

We booked via Priceline for $102/night plus the $15/night resort fee. I was concerned after reading some reviews about the pool and old decor - do not be concerned. All the pools were open and while the room decor was dated, it did not detract from the beauty of the hotel or the room comfort at all. The hoel is currently undergoing rennovations which we noticed, but it was not in any way a problem. It appeared as though they were starting with the rooms on the opposite side of the hotel where we were staying. Upon check in we requested a king room with a view of Epcot so we could see the fireworks. The staff was very accomodating and gave us one on the 14th floor (1449). My husband and I were there to visit the Disney parks without kids for a change. The hotel is very close to all the parks. There was a wedding and a convention while we were there but neither were a bother or concern. One pool is heated and a few people swam in January. There were several hottubs which we had almost to ourselves for one night. They have tennis courts, golf course, rock climbing wall all included. My only complaint is the resort fee is not really advertised upon check in and it's charged on your card as you check out. I think they should just include this in the nightly rate. I would stay at this hotel again for sure if we were not going to Disney. The staff and the grounds were great. The rooms were very large and comfortable, just a little dated. The view from the balcony is very pretty. My only other comment is for those going to Disney - This was our first time going to Disney without staying at a Disney resort. While the hotel was very close to Disney, it's very hard to beat the convenience of staying at a Disney resort because of all the shuttles and the extra magic hours. This hotel does have a shuttle going to Disney - but the schedule was not very often - so I would not count on it to get you to the parks. If you can swing it stay on Disney property if you are going to Disney - if you can't swing it this hotel is a great alternative but you'll need a rental car and plan to pay for parking at Disney (parking is free at the hotel if you self park). (Which reminds me some people said the parking lot was soooo far. It's not far. You can walk right out to it if you cut through the ballroom.)

First, there is a security guard/guard shack at the main entrance of the extremely large property. That was a plus. We followed the signs and drove up the hill to the lobby entrance. Very nicely decorated with an Asian/Buddist theme, little statues, ponds, greenery and chairs made it a very relaxing lobby. The gigantic Christmas tree and gingerbread houses didn't really seem to fit the decor. Our check-in was extremely prompt, and the desk agent friendly and warm. A ride up the glass elevator took us to the 3rd floor. The carpeting was in very good condition, the hallway in good repair. My 5 year old daughter, while waiting for her dad to return from parking the car, announced that she hopes our room is beautiful. When she unlocked the door, she yells, \"Mommy, our room is beautiful!\" And, indeed, it was very comfortable, clean, and relaxing. Although it was in a Martha Stewart, garden theme, it was definitely in my taste. (My sister-in-law on the other hand said it looked like an \"old lady\" threw up all over it.) The headboard, and curtains were white with a large maroon based flower pattern. 2 large pillows and a bolster sat on each bed. All furnishings, carpeting, and linens were in excellent condition. Minimal sign of wear. The bathroom was oversized and following suit, was in perfect cleanliness. No mold, mildew, dust, or dirt. I could have taken a white glove and not found a speck! A weighing scale sat in the corner of the bathroom, very nice Eucalyptis Portico spa bath products were on the sink, and towels were in abundance. The A/C worked well, and I loved that there was a ceiling fan! The safe fit my laptop, and the fridge was a nice amenity to have! We ordered room service - MISTAKE! $54.00 for 1 pizza, 6 wings, and a piece of cheesecake. Although the above was absolutely delicious, I wouldn't pay it again.... Not to mention, I woke up around 6:00 AM with terrible stomach cramps. 2 things that frustrated me - the parking. On the opposite side of the hotel, it took about 15 minutes to walk to the car from the room. The parking lot is huge, and late at night, hard to find a spot near the entrance. Since we had to pass through the convention area, I peeked in some of the meeting and banquet rooms. This would be a great place to hold a meeting. And, around 10:30 on the day we were checking out, no one answered at the front desk. I tried calling twice with no answer. I also didn't get a chance to check out the grounds, since we really just had time to sleep there.

Why can budget hotels offer free internet but more expensive ones charge? There are four or five restuarants in the complex but their hours often meant that only one was open. We didn't use the pool but to do so would have meant walking through the main lobby. Perhaps it comes down to the fact that we prefer smaller, more intimate places.

There was no closet door and the bathroom to quote my wife was \"like something you would see in a dorm room\". We moved to a room on the 15th floor but it was 2 beds not a king. The view was fantastic we could see both Epcot and MK fireworks from our balcony. Ask for a pool view on the higher floors for this view. The room was very dated and old. The bathroom was ok - but the vent in the bathroom was completely blocked with dust and dirt - had to have maintenance clean it - they \"must have missed that one\". Overall we were very disappointed with the room but I will say that the service was good when we did call to complain. The grounds are really nice. We rented a bike and rode around the property - wish we had more time to explore but we were too focused on the parks and shopping. In summary if you are using this hotel for a base for the parks/shopping (it is close) but the room will disappoint. If you want to enjoy the grounds you will like this place.

To add insult to injury, there was a $15 per day resort fee levied on our bill upon check out (which was not advertised prior to our nonrefundable online booking and payment). $15.00 per day is not a significant fee, but there should be some value or benefit tied to the added payout. The rooms and decor were severely outdated and tacky. The rooms reminded me of a high end nursing home. The tv was bulky and tiny. The shower did not work properly as the water poured out in one opening (similar to water coming out of hose), as opposed to regular shower heads that separate the water droplets.

We also used one of the hotel's taxis to take us to the mall and the driver arranged a time to collect us. In fact the staff could not do enough for us and always made time to ask my daughter where she had been that day. Likewise the hotels bus drivers who take you to all the parks at scheduled times. Just a small tip each journey and they would offer to drop us at a restaurant en-route when we returned from the parks and so cheerful and chatty. We also used the transportation to get to the hotel's equestrian centre do not try and walk there !!!. We went on a western trail ride in the morning through the woods and it was cool and refreshing. The centre is excellent and again friendly and helpful staff.Even if you don't ride you can sit in a rocking chair on the verandah and relax and little ones can have pony rides or lessons.

I had requested a king room with lake view on my reservation, but this was not visible upon check-in, so I asked the receptionist and she 'upgraded' me to a room with a view of epcot (to see the fireworks, which is a nice bonus). Room 803 was nice, a fair size with a king bed. The bed itself wasn't very comfortable as it had far too many (feather) pillows - 6 in total and a duvet sandwiched between two bed sheets, which got very tangled up when sleeping. We had lunch once at the pool, where the the food was good and the service was just ok. The pool is the great part about this hotel. It's huge with a large 'alcove' area, nice temperature, a number of waterfalls / spa tubs and most importantly it was clean. Resort facilities - We only tried the driving range (not enough time), which was good, but would have been much better with some overhead cover (the sun was VERY hot). First Negative : The in-room fridge was locked with no key in sight. We rang down twice for the key, but to no avail. On the first evening upon our return to the hotel we decided to ask reception for the key, which they gave to us straightaway and so we made our way up to our room. Unfortunately, when we returned to our room we realised we had locked our keys in the room, so my husband went down to reception. 20 minutes later, my husband returned, quite furious- reception had asked him for proof of ID (I had booked the hotel in my maiden name). It didn't matter that we had both been to see the same receptionist literally 2 minutes earlier, nor the fact that my husband had left his credit card details at check-in. Even the manager was useless at sorting this out and despite saying they would send someone up to speak to me to confirm who my husband was, no-one actually turned up. Second Negative : The patio window was extremely dirty, especially on the outside. For a 5-star hotel, I find this quite unacceptable. The internal walk from the self-parking lot to reception takes you through all the hotel conference rooms, which isn't ideal when you are not staying at the hotel for a conference.

There is a large attached conference centre and the hotel is more geared up to conference delegates than holidaymakers trudging back to their rooms with bags of towels. The typical guest is a delegate making deals on his or her mobile 'phone. This means that the pool is always under-used. There are also many other facilities (sailing and pedalo on the small lake etc). After paying for three rooms for two weeks they tried to charge us eighty dollars to keep one of the rooms on for three hours but then changed their minds. Again this would be a formality in a European holidaymakers hotel but this is a conference hotel where they are used to guests charging everything to their companies. The rooms are very good, there are a few niggles though such as knobs coming off taps, fiddly light switches, dripping showers and TVs at funny angles so the remote will not work. They charge five dollars for a warm bottle of water but give you unlimited free coffee! There is an (empty) fridge in the room which you have to ask for the key for. It says you will be charged 45 dollars for personal use but I think this is a hangover from when it was a fully-stocked minibar. Madness. TIP: Not all the rooms are the same! The best rooms on each floor are X23 X24 X47 X48 X71 and X72 where X is the floor number. These are on the ends of the three arms of the hotel and have a double aspect. X26-X48 (even numbers) and X49-X71 (odd numbers) have a view of the fireworks at the Disney parks each night. In general with this hotel the higher, the better. Try not to get a room by an ice machine which is noisy. There is also a big waterfall in the breakfast room which is so noisy it is better to sit away from it. Lastly if you plug your PC into the hotel's Ethernet you will be asked for 12.99 dollars a day for Internet. If you leave it unplugged then T-Mobile's wireless network is 9.99. Although this is technically for a day, providing you do not drop the connection it tends to keep going until (for example) you have to reboot your computer for other reasons. (TIP: Turn off automatic updating which reboots your PC in the middle of the night). The service is good but sometimes you have to repeatedly ask for it for example outside the atrium at night it is very difficult to get served. Europeans sit outside on warm evenings whereas Americans tend to want to sit inside in air-conditioned comfort. Overall this is an excellent hotel which has a bit of a problem integrating the high-powered delegates from all over the US with the few European sunseekers who discover it.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service\u201d", "Author": "boomeruk", "ReviewID": "UR16304014", "Content": "I stayed at the Hyatt for the second week of a two week holiday recently with my wife and 4 year old daughter. We spent the first week staying at the Hard Rock hotel so it was going to be interesting to see the differences between the two hotels. The first thing to notice is this hotel is massive, i mean massive. The grounds seem to go on forever - all of it seemingly very well maintained. We self parked and went in via a side entrance which takes you past the large conferencing suites, up an escalator and into the main lobby which is a highly impressive atrium that goes up the entire 18 floors of the hotel. The first thing that grabs you attention, beyond the size of the property is how polite all the staff are - i mean all the staff not just the front desk and bell desk. one example is a day or so later we were walking to the car and i was in conversation with my wife and a groundsman ahead who was using a leaf blower noticed us approaching and stopped his machnie whilst we passed, smiled at us and then only turned the machine on once we were out of ear shot. The style of the hotel is a great contrast to the Hard Rock hotel, whereas that hotel goes for a cool, modern look the look of the Hyatt reminds me a bit of some Vegas hotels i have stayed in and can seem a bit 'Golden Girls' in the style of the decor. Not a problem, just an observation. Our room on the Regency Club level was lovely and the maid service was timely and efficient. The Regency Club lounge was rather smaller than i expected but the quality of the staff and food were excellent (I personally prefered this club room to that of the Hard Rock but both are perfectly acceptable). The major difference i noticed between this club room and the hard rock club room was that at the Hyatt they had a 'cordial hour' between 8 - 9 pm which was an adults only affair. Cordials turned out to be a 'beer, wine, spirits and deserts / chocolates hour' ! Wireless internet access was available throughout the room via T-moblie at $10 a day and wired internet access was available in the rooms but seemed pointless given the wireless availability. So far so good so do i have any reservations about the hotel? Well yes. Travelling with a 4 year old i tend to spend alot of time worrying about what mischief my daughter might get up to. My first concern was the hotel atrium. the Atrium is effectively a hub and the hotel has three accomodation wings that connect to the hub. To get to any of the accomodation wings you have to go up the lifts in the atrium and then walk along a walkway that skirts along the atrium. this walkway has a glass walled rail around it that is probably no more that 40 inches in height. I just would have felt more comfortable if that rail had been 50 inches tall as i felt is was just low enough for my daughter to attempt to climb if i didn't keep a watch on her. Given we were on the 11th floor ..... My other concern was the pool area. The pool is massive with three pools (two interconnected), water slides and watefalls etc (again it reminded me of the pool at the Mirage in Vegas) so it is easy to loose sight of an active 4 year old. Given my daughter cannot swim properly then i obviously want her to be able to enjoy the pool safely yet for some reason the pool did not have any life guards. Given the hotel employee so many staff it seems bizzare that they don't have life guards especially as they told me they have mostly families staying at the hotel. In most respects this hotel is amazing, the service is impeccable - the best I've ever experienced in a large hotel, the grounds lovely, the food great etc but I'm still very uncomfortable about the lack of lifeguards and the lack of height of the rails on the skywalk corrider to the rooms.", "Date": "May 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Blanc", "Title": "\u201cNice Place To Stay\u201d", "Author": "codespewer", "ReviewID": "UR16271389", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress.

The staff are very friendly and attentive. They have a nice Sushi bar in the hotel but prices kept me away from the other two hotel restaurants. Drinks were pricey also as I heard someone paid $17 dollars for a pool side margarita, no it was not the fish bowl kind. Two pools one heated and one not heated. I did not go in the unheated pool as it was way to cold. The water in the pool is saltwater which I hate but it does cool you off and the kids I saw did not seem to mind. Free use of bikes, sailboats on good sized pond. I would recommend the Olde Ale House (name might not be exact) restaurant across the street from the entrance to the hotel property. Its a sports bar and this one makes my top 5 sport bar list BWW being #1. I ran into a local couple that runs a restaurant in Kissimee and they go there to get away from there place so you know the price is right.

The room was small for the price and dated as others mentioned, but we didn't care since most of our time will be spent outside. We just wanted a pool view for the daily fireworks (Epcot @ 9pm and another @ 10pm). I do want to warn parents of small children, the railing on the balcony is very spaced out so watch your little ones. My oldest is 7 and his head and body can fit right thru them so I kept the balcony door locked at all times since I also had my 2 and 5 year olds with us. It was still scary knowing my 5 and 7 are capable of turning the lock and opening the balcony door themselves. Another thing was the entrance door. It's not seal to the carpet. I would say it's about 1-1.5 inch off the ground so you can hear hallway noises easily. Our floor was quiet, but I felt bad every time my kids left the room. Housekeeping was great and done everyday for the 5 days we were there. The landscaping was beautiful. As mentioned by others, there were plenty to do that was included in the fee: canoeing, sailing, paddle boating, kayaking, biking (free - even had 6 and 4 passenger bike cart, along with bike with toddler seat behind, and helmets for all). The pitch-putt was fun and entertaining for my boys. There are 2 swimming pools and 2 slides. The smaller slide is in the heated smaller (kids) pool. Side note: it said heated to 81 but it felt more like 71. The big pool is BIG and has a BIG slide, but you have to be of a certain height (i like to say 48-54 inches). We were hardly on the big pool cause it was cold. The sign said 71 but it felt more like Lake Michigan, low 60's. The shallowest part of both pools is 3'6, with 10 being the deepest. There are 4 hot tubs, but only 3 working ones when we were there. There's also a beach area with nice sands and provided sand toys for the kids to play, and hammock & shade for me to lay in. We didn't use the arcade, but there's one. The playground is no longer there. :-( The gym was great and I tried the equpments out one late evening (awesome), but never made time to work out. The gym and pool/hot tubs are open 24/7. Security walks thru the area often so you're more than safe. The bike, boating, putt closed at 6. We always went out to eat so I can't comment on the resturants on site. The hotel is a 10 minutes walk (kids' pace) to the main road where all the restaurants are. BTW, there is free parking and I recommend you use it if you want to save $$$. It seems far, but it's not at all since it's located by the pool. We self parked the whole time and enjoyed the nice 5 min stroll thru the pool grounds to the elevator. Parking was not busy when we were there (April 18-23) and the elevators were quick. We never waited more than a minute. They have a bus shuttle that takes you to the theme parks. It leaves at 9 and 11 and picks you up at 7. I think I covered everything.

We had an excellent stay there. I wouldn't normally comment on check-in, but the woman who assisted us really was exceptional. With the exception of one guy who worked in the gift shop - who was only so-so, everyone at the Hyatt was friendly and helpful beyond what I expected. The man who took our bags to our room offered a brief, interesting tour that gave us our bearings at the hotel. One man doing maintenance, stopped to explain some of the art we were looking at in the halls. The doormen were always there and always friendly, and the restaurant staff were excellent, too. Shortly after arriving we went to the Sports Bar. A man upfront and the hostess apologized for a 30 minute wait, but offered to call Hemingway's (another restaurant on site) so that we could be seated immediately. We took them up on the offer, walked to Hemingway's and were greeted and seated immediately. The grounds are amazing, and reminded us a lot of a past trip to a Playa del Carmen resort. Technically the Hyatt has two pools, but it looks like one. The smaller one was 82 degrees, on the warm side for our taste. The other pool which is enormous, was 71 degrees, a bit on the cold side, but still doable on a 80+ degree day. There is a long cave like area over part of the pool that is beautiful, shaded, and fun to explore. At the lake, we used the walking trails, Hydro bikes, Aqua bikes, and paddle boats at no additional cost. We were in Orlando to perform at a relative's wedding, and had hoped to have some fun, but also be able to relax. As busy as this hotel is, we really did feel like we could relax. It didn't seem to keep the same hectic pace that much of Orlando has. The included hotel shuttle we took was a very comfortable coach bus. The shuttles ran exactly on time and was so much easier than driving and parking at theme parks, as we have done in Orlando in the past. We had a lakeview room with two double beds that were very comfortable. The rooms are decorated in a Florida style and were immaculately kept. Before you go, look for a picture of the bathroom wallpaper, so you aren't surprised when you get there. The bathrooms are good size and clean, but not as nice as the rest of the room. One downside for us was the price of food. We expect to pay more for food on vacation, but it seemed to me the price exceeded the value? The food we paid more for was delicious, but I'm not convinced it was worth the price tag. All of the kid's menu selections at the hotel that our kids chose were reasonable and nicely done. The only major glitch we encountered was that we put our Room Service breakfast card out the last night, so that we could have breakfast in our room before leaving for the airport. When the food didn't come, we called and were told security had never picked up our card. They did apologize and provided our food in just over 30 minutes. Our driver had arrived a bit early.

Room service took a little while in the evening, but that was to be expected on a rainy night like it was. If you are afraid of heights, ask for a room towards the bottom since all the elevators are glass. I love heights, so it was fun for me. The service was out-of-this-world- no joke, everyone went above and beyond to try to make our stay extra enjoyable since the weather was such a damper. I recommend this property to everyone.

The bathroom was also spotless. My meeting accomodations were also very nice. The lunch and dinner that the hotel provided for the meetings was very good, and the dining staff were EXTREMELY attentive, but by no means overbearing. Again, staff everywhere around the premises were friendly, helpful, and always had a smile. I have stayed all over the country in 5 star hotels, but this hotel definitely had the friendliest staff I have ever encountered. One minor suggestion: it is very hot and humid in Orlando, and it would have been nice if the hotel had complimentary water in the hotel room (1 bottle was $5).

This hotel was the first resort hotel to be built in Orlando (\u201884); it is starting to show it\u2019s age even though the rooms underwent renovation in \u201801. The smallish king bedroom needed updating. The Good: the staff was extremely accommodating, from the gate at the resorts front entrance to the front desk, the staff that was fast and efficient. We dined in two hotel restaurant facilities (La Coquina Chef's Table and Hemingway's) were both excellent and the dining service was well above par. The maid (Amy) on the floor (9th) was very helpful, accommodating and efficient. The hot water in the shower was plentiful, albeit the bath tile was showing its age with mildew stains throughout. Valet service was fast and efficient. The Bad: Attended several conference meetings over 2 days. Inside the meeting rooms including the Grand Cypress Ballroom and on the opposite side of the meeting hall area, AT&T\u2019s cellular phone service received no signal in most areas of the conference center at best. Most of the time many of us had to go outside to make calls, retrieve messages, email or vmail. Other attendees with Verizon and Sprint\u2019s service complained about the same issue although management seemed to be oblivious to the issue when asked. With the proliferation and availability of cellular repeaters that are mostly used by businesses that want to boost signal strength inside big office buildings, I find it obnoxious that management has not addressed this problem in the business wing of this \u201dresort\u201d hotel. In my room, the noise from the hall traffic was noticeable due to the large gap under the door\u2026rolling a towel and stuffing it under the door cured this issue for the second night\u2019s stay. Noise from water running in pipes in adjacent and upstairs rooms was prevalent at all times of the day. A pet peeve of mine is the inability to run the in room A/C fan constantly to drown out these typical noises; this option was not available in my hotel room even though the hotel\u2019s website advertises \u201cIndividual air conditioning control\u201d, you can adjust temp only.

Since staying so short had not time to use the outdoor facilities but on closer scrutiny looked well designed and seemed to offer all one could possibly want. 24/7 pool access, being a Scandinavian I have to say that is something other resorts in Europe absolutely should consider. A downer, well for me anyway, was a fairly expensive and far from adequate internet service. Surprisingly poor performance on the cable in the room and from what I could judge, the hot stops/WLAN service wasn't any better.

Upon check-in, I requested a Regency Club level and/or pool view and was shot down...the hotel was, as far as I could tell, legitimately sold out per their website and the front desk clerk. I was given Room 1039 on the 10th floor, with a partial lake view. Overall, the room was merely average and appeared a bit dated, yet clean. My only complaint was the the doors to the small balcony had a terrible seal such that the wind howled through the crack at all hours. Not a 5* room by any means; rather, more like a standard 3* room. But the small balcony with sliding doors is a nice touch. I'd hope for more at the direct prices charged by Hyatt for a standard room such as ours. We took advantage of the paddle boats and bicycle rentals and were glad we did since we got to take in the great surroundings of the Hyatt. I also did a bit of jogging/walking on the trails that border the huge lake. The only reason we did not attempt to do more of the activities that were included in the Resort Fee is that it rained for the better part of our stay there. There are also two pools, side by side; one heated, one not, along with three, or perhaps four hot tubs, and two water slides for the kids. I'd imagine the pools are packed during the summer months as tehy are huge and very beautiful. The elevators on one side offer a great view of the Atrium-style lobby; the elevators on the other side offer a pretty nice view of part of the lake. I do not believe we ever waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator. As far as on-site, sit down dining, we only frequented the Palm Cafe at the pool level. Prices here are reasonable, approximately $7-9 for hot and cold sandwiches. The rest of the restaurants are standard hotel fare with jacked up prices. If you are into a night cap or pre-dinner drink, the lobby bar actually has very reasonable prices for drinks which are on par with a typical restaurant ($5-6 beers; $10-12 drinks). The bar was very busy at all evening hours due to the large convention crowd that this resort draws. In the morning, the lobby bar transforms into Starbucks offering sky high prices for coffee and pastries ($2.75 for a 12 oz coffee; $3 for a pastry). However, a nice touch is that you can get a free refill on your coffee with your receipt provided you return the same morning. If you have a car, I'd recommend the IHOP just around the corner on Vineland/535 for breakfast. If you have a car you may self-park in lot 4 at no charge. This requires a bit of a trek through the convention center, but might be worth it to save the $15 per night valet fee. Parking was plentiful and well-lit. Overall, I would not be disappointed if I won this hotel via Priceline for around $100 again, but I do not believe I would go out of my way to stay here in the future.

First, locating the entrance posed a challenge as I thought it was adjacent to the Disney Village area. However, it has it's own entrance on a side street off of Vineland. After finding the entrance, I learned that the property has security at the entrance and one must be a guest in order to receive a pass. The security guard has a list of guests to check your name. The best thing of this hotel is its staff. Everyone from the doorman to the front desk, and housekeeping are very friendly, interested in you and seeing if you need assistance with anything. I had booked a $199 summer special rate and asked for a room upgrade. For $175 more I was upgraded to a corner suite that had a view overlooking the pool and Disney fireworks. The room itself was very clean. Granted, the decor is quite outdated, and I've never been a fan of flowers on the wall. But the bed was the extremely comfortable bed Hyatt has now with nice threadcount sheets, feather comforter and feather pillows. BEWARE those allergic to feathers - make sure you've made the appropriate arrangements prior to your arrival. The room was clean and saw no issues with housekeeping other than the fact that it is a huge property and it takes time for all of the rooms to be cleaned. Housekeeping was working when I checked in around 4:30pm on my floor. In regards to the Parrots in the lobby. I'm a serious animal lover, but didn't feel too sorry for these guys. They are in a beautiful atrium, well cared for and seem to have adjusted well to their environment. Granted, it would be better that they were free, but they are pretty to look at. I was traveling on the off season, so the property was quite empty with people. They closed La Coquina & The Chefs table for that evening and only Hemmingways was open for dinner. I decided to go to Disney Village for dinner. I was chauffered for $10 by a white town car, and made arrangements for a pick up for my return later in the evening. For those interested, I have been at the Equestrian Center in previous years for riding lessons and the center is beautiful and the instruction was good enough that I would return for another lesson if I lived in the area. One challenge I had was trying to find the business center so that I could check-in for my flight for the next day. After finding it ( I had passed it 3 times) I learned that there is a free computer & printer at the right of the check-in desk that you can use for checking in. I found it and the access to log on was very easy to use. I would recommend the Hyatt for several reasons: 1.) Staff is very customer service oriented 2.) Location away from the buzz of the tourists areas 3.) Great place to hideaway and never leave due to the amenities and 4.) High quality bed & bedding.

We were given the highest level of service at every turn & nothing was too much trouble for the welcoming staff.. I had only booked the lowest catagory of room, the \"Garden View\", but the room was lovely, decorated in cool greens & florals. My balcony looked out over the beautiful lake and grounds.. It was very restfiul to sit on in the mornings while i gave my son breakfast, or with a cool drink whilst he enjoyed a nap.. My kingsize bed was very comfortable & made up each day with lots of pillows & a comforter... There was an in room mini-bar, but I opted to rent a fridge for $25 & got my own drinks & snacks from the local store.. It was a very spacious room & I had a roll-in shower room due to my sons disability, which made life easier for us. Maid service was good, and you get to choose which time of the day you would like to get your room serviced... Extras were not a problem, if we needed anything, tea/coffee, towels etc I just left a note with the tip... I had picked this hotel based on the fact that it had more of a resort feel than most Orlando hotels. I intended to spend quite some time in and around the hotel & wanted somewhere relaxing & with plenty of facilities. We were not disappointed.. The hotel & grounds are very large, with many facilities including Bike/jogging trails; horse riding; canoes & peddle boats; tennis courts; a Spa;a fitness centre & Huge pool area, around which they organise activities.... They even do a \"Smores\" cookout, Thursday thru Sunday, in the firepit by the pool/lake area, between 7pm & 9 pm.. There is a world class golf course as well, with two 18 hole & one 9 hole courses to choose from...I didn't get to try this, but my husband has made me promise to take him back there soon, so he can go Play! The Pool area is just magnificent, if a little tricky to get around with a wheelchair... In fact that was the only problem that l encountered during my stay.. I mentioned my frustration to one of the staff, as we had been unable to find our way into the bar area to get a cool drink, after our swim... they were most appoligetic, & shortly after I arrived back at my room, a member of staff arrived with a cooler full of drinks, a fruit bowl & a written appoligy for our inconveinience .. We tried several of the restaurants during our stay & l had room service on two occasions.The food quality was very good & the price quite reasonable for a 4 star hotel. They include a $3.00 charge with all \"in room\" orders which covers your tip. Many services can be accessed through the TV in your room, including e-mails, computer Games & Movies.They charge a small additional fee for these services. If you do not feel like eating in the hotel, just 5 mins walk from the gate of the resort is \"crossroads\" shopping area, with many places to eat. You are also just a 5 mins drive from Downtown Disney & the many facilities available there. The location of this hotel is second to none.... If you manage to drag yourself away from the many activities available in resort, then you are just 15mins either direction to Walt Disney World, or Universal/ Seaworld... Plus there are many shopping locations close by, for all those bargains..! I have stayed many times in the Orlando area, but never in such a fantastic central location.. In fact I will never stay anywhere else again. You will find it hard to beleive the peace & tranquility of the hotel & its grounds, & yet you can watch the fireworks at WDW, from the large viewing windows, on every floor in the hotel, and be in the hub of activity that is Orlando within just a few minutes of the resort gates. Extra costs to be aware of : As mentioned before, the $3.00 charge for all room service orders & the cost of \"in room\" tv services.. There is also a $15 per day resort charge per room, to cover Resort facilities, local telephone calls, etc. You have the option when staying here to self park for free, or Valet park for a $20 charge per day including tax. In my opinion it is worth the extra cost to Valet Park if you can afford it, as the \"self\" car park is quite a walk from the hotel. When you come back tired from the parks & ladden down with bags its nice to just drive up & leave the parking to someone else! All in all.... If you only want a room to lay your head in each night & you are going to out all day in the theme parks, then this would be a waste of your hard earned money !..... But if like me, you want a more luxury holiday choice & will spend time relaxing & enjoying the hotel & its facilities, then I cannot think of a more suitable place to spend your next Orlando vacation than the Grand Cypress... !", "Date": "October 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cFirst Class\u201d", "Author": "DKK031", "ReviewID": "UR10136505", "Content": "We spent 9 days at the Hyatt, 2 adults and 2 children under 12.

Good beds, well cleaned everyday and adequate in size for our party. Restaurants were also very good. We ate breakfast everyday at Cascades, we found the staff here to be extremely friendly and helpful and it helped that the food was excellent too-I would recommend the corned beef hash. We ate a couple of times at the White Horse Bar, which served very good food for both adults and children. We unfortunately ate only once at Hemmingways, but we had a very good dining experience here. We also had room service dinners a couple of times, perfect for a tired family and after being dragged around by the children all day at one of the parks. In all cases, I thought that the prices for meals were resonable. The hotel's amenities are again, excellent. Fantastic pool (open 24hrs). Well equipped small fitness center (again open 24hrs), well marked jogging routes, horse back riding and more. The staff are extremely helpful and service minded. The hotel is well located to the Disney parks, Seaworld & Universal as well as the shopping outlets and certain malls.

We were staying at a 5 bed villa in Emerald Island resort in Kissimmee 15th - 29th sept 07. We normally go to the Renaissance resort near sea world for sunday brunch but found that they no longer operate the brunch. By sheer chance we found the sunday brunch at the Hyatt and what a find it was. We booked the sunday brunch via phone from the UK and requested a round table for 9 as it was a ruby wedding we were celebrating (tables were square). Talk about service, hospitality and quality , this is the place to be. We thought that the Renaissance was good but this was sheer perfection. Our round table had been prepared with beautiful damask fabric on the chairs with green bows and looked spectacular. This is the only restaurant i have been to where you get black napkins if you are wearing dark clothing ( talk about attention to detail ). The smell of the chocolate desserts as you enter La Coquina is divine and they are a pleasure to behold. The food was fabulous with everything from caviar to buffalo to chocolate fountains. Your main course is prepared fresh and you can have as many as you like.Your glass is never empty of their most excellent sparkling wines (without having to ask for refills) and the staff are unobtrusive but there for your every need. The views from the light and airy room are specatcular and the pianist is a pleasure to listen to. All this for $59 dollars. After tax and gratuity with the exchange rate as good as it is we paid less than \u00a340 per head. We were there for 3 hours from 11am and the whole party were just blown away by the experience. The \"happy couple\" were presented with a fabulous dessert plate with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate with the most fabulous Tiramasiu.

Beware of the daily service charge at this hotel, it works out about $15 a day on top of what you have already paid for the room but over 14 days it can add up. One thing that I was concern about was the hotel has parrots on display in there reception, the birds sit on a metal ring for about 8 hours a day !!! just eatting seeds and you can clearly see that they have had there wings clipped so that they cannot fly away. I don't think that this is fair on the birds.

There are numerous outdoor places to sit, there is a well-stocked store, the food is very good, there are more pool chairs than anyone could need and many umbrellas. They have a shack next to the pool that rents floating lounges and other flotation devices and sells sunblock. There is sculpture and art work everywhere. I like nice hotels -- when I have a choice -- and I was just so pleased ... Great golf course. Of course, I had just come from Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort (see my review), so the Hyatt could do little wrong. But I can honestly say that the service was as close to a Four Seasons hotel experience as I have had (outside of a Four Seasons). Just stellar. I am an explorer, and rarely stay at the same place twice, but I left wondering why I would stay anywhere else in Orlando and with the desire to return. Cons? if I must. The room is not big. But our \"garden view\", lowest priced room had panoramic unobstructed views of Orlando. The hotel is showing some wear and tear, but it didn't bother me! This is more of a convention hotel, so you will not have the shear volume of kids and the family feel that other hotels in the area have. But mom and dad were in a much better mood at the Hyatt (than at the Disney hotel)! And at my kids' ages, they didn't notice. There were enough kids in the pool for them. HYATT, READ THIS: As an animal lover, and as a 3 parrot owner, I didn't appreciate the exotic birds on display for 8 hours a day in the lobby on perches eating seeds (should be on a pellet diet) with nothing to do but have kids try to touch them all day.

The kids love the water slides and the waterfalls. We enjoy it just as much at night, especially the hot tubs in the grottos. There are plenty of lounge chairs and many umbrellas, and palm trees for shade. We also enjoy riding the bikes around the resort, the horse back trail rides (book these ahead-they fill up), the boating on the lake, the hammocks over looking the lake, and cooking smores at the camp fire on the weekend nights. There is also a small rock climbing wall now. It is possible to stay here on a budget. Some tips to keep prices down; check the Hyatt specials online, and eat at the pool side cafe called the Palms which is open from breakfast until 9pm. It is nice & air conditioned inside, and you can sit inside or at tables under umbrellas outside. At the Palms fresh fruit is $1 per piece, triple decker grilled cheese sandwiches w/ fries are ~ $5.00, and a large 16\" pizza to go is only $13.50- the same pizza from room service cost me $30.00.

Extremely friendly, very accomodating.

When I arrived (very late on the night of 6/26) several of the gossiping front desk staff scattered when I approached. (Either I smelled bad or they were incredibly lazy or tired) . The one rep that reluctantly approached was \"superficially friendly.\" And failed to help me - with a smile. The one gentleman actually refused a simple request to change the credit card I had used for a depost to my business card. I actually coudln't believe it but I was too tired to argue about it. Additionally, my package included wine and fruit upon arrival - I was asked my preference at check-in but nothing ever arrived. When I asked a question about the included breakfast in my package he rolled his eyes and had to ask someone else. I still am surprised by how bad the front desk experience is there. I saw them try to give free champange to anyone who had a problem (including myself). It was almost a reflex as he repeatedly grabbed the glass - It's as if the answer is always to give the guest a glass of champange - that'll shut them up. It really was unbelievable in what I thought would be a four star hotel. - Dated appearance. The hotel is very clean and very well maintained - there is none of the moldy smell you get in alot of older Orlando properties. Despite this, it has a very old Florida hotel appearance. There are 70's style flourescent lights above the doors to each room - same thing in the closet when you enter and in the dated bathroom. (It's all very clean - just dated). The room was very \"Golden Girls\" with green (think grass) carpet and floral bedspread. The room did have a beautiful view of the lake and well manicured grounds along with a TINY balcony (they are all tiny from what I can see). The bed was comfortable and had a feather top mattress with a nice selection of pillows. - Lots of hidden charges Parking ($20), Internet Access ($10), Resort Fee ($15 - really a way to hike the room rate before you get there) If you are looking to book here - with the extra charges plan on adding at least 30-40 dollars to whatever rate you are quoted. I personally would look for a room over at the Ritz Carlton or JW Marrott Grande Lakes for either the same price or maybe 20 bucks more - the service and modern facilities/rooms blow this place away.

This fee was well worth it for the amenities we enjoyed. Due to the hotel restaurant reviews on this site, we tried to avoid eating at the hotel. However, on two occasions, a lunch and a breakfast, we ate at Cascades. We found both meals to be above average. For lunch, I enjoyed a salad topped with a nice piece of salmon.

My top 10 tips for the family holiday to Orlando: 1. Get 6 25c pieces at the airport if you're hiring a car as you go through two unmanned toll booths between the airport and Orlando. I didn't know this and had to accelerate through the toll which freaked my kids out more than the Tower of Terror 2. It's easy to do the parks (even at the busiest time of year) without queuing for a ride for 2 hours, and that's by getting to the park 30 mins before opening. The parks are quietish until 10.30 3. Whatever you do go to Cirque...I thought that I would hate it but it made our holiday 4. Don't ever pay full price at any restaurant/shopping mall. Google discount vouchers before going. Start at [--] 5. Do your homework, and plan what rides you want to go on. A good start is [--] 6. A park a day is exhausting. Remember that when booking your holiday. If you want to have a quieter time then plan to go every other day 7. Discovery Cove is a haven away from the parks and you get to hug dolphins. Be warned it is pricey 8. Unlike my last trip there seems to be more sherrifs trying to catch you speeding inside WDW. 9. Don't get to the park with the kids at 8 in the morning and expect to still be there for the fireworks at 10. If you do you'll all be tired and grumpy and not appreciate the experience. 10. Book to go to Weight Watchers on your return. Surprisingly a week of burgers and hot dogs plays havoc on your waist!!

The building and grounds were spotless. The landscaping was tropical, lush, immaculate and adorned with sculpture. The setting, alone on a private lake, was a perfect respite from the congestion of the Disney area. The staff was helpful and very polite. Our room was well decorated, and spotless. The pool area was expansive with a huge free-form pool that included several lounging areas that allowed you many options with respect to sun, action and noise. There were always chaises available and they were extremely comfortable with thick cushions. On the down side: 1)There is a $15 per day activity fee that, while allowing unlimited use of the many activities and \"toys\", turns out to be pretty steep over a week long stay especially when much time is spent away from the hotel enjoying the many activities of the Orlando area. Also, my teenagers were not allowed to sail because they were under 18 even though they are experienced sailors. That was one activity we were looking forward to. 2) The food and drink prices are WAY too high. For example, $17 for a pina colada and non-alcoholic daiquiri, $5 for a liter of water in the store, $10 for a hot dog by the pool. 3) The restaurants were also quite expensive with the only casual one (not counting the deli) not open for dinner. 4) Last, but certainly not least, the pools were COLD. The hotel boasts about its huge pool, but doesn't tell you it is not heated. The water temp in the big pool was 64 degrees, about 15 degrees colder than comfortable swimming temperature. Needless to say, everyone complained about the water temp. It was odd to be around a resort pool that is full of people sunning (it was 84 and sunny) yet nobody was in the pool. There is a small heated pool, but it too was on the cool side at 76 degrees. Ultimately, what you have here is a gorgeous facility that caters to high-end conference business and offsets it's reasonable room rates with high-margin food, beverage and extras.

This was our first time in a hotel near Disney as we usually rent villa accommodation. We were greated warmly by the front desk with a glass of sparkling wine (for the adults!) while the children tried to encourage the macaws to talk back to them. We had booked a Regency Club room which included buffet breakfast and evening snacks and beverages. The room was comfortable and overlooked the pool and further overlooked Disney so we got to see the fireworks every night we were in. The pool is fantastic, the kids loved the slide. There is a small slide which is not manned by hotel staff, or a larger slide in the bigger pool which is carefully manned whilst open. The self parking was free, which was a surprise to us, and the walk through the conference lobby, up the escalator to the main lobby was no bother at all. The elevators were busy and we did have to wait. Its a shame some other nationality guests didnt understand the idea that other people were also waiting and decided to barge in the first elevator regardless of the line formed, but nothing that I could complain about. We were on vacation so no point getting stressed over little matters! There is a \"general store\" on the lower level near the door to the pool area, it has limited hours so if you want some drinks, buy them during the day and keep them in your room or ice bucket. We didnt need to do this very often as the Regency Club lounge had drinks available all day, so were were well stocked up! The bus transport to the theme parks was good, punctual and comfortable. Nice coaches with the hotel name painted in big letters all over them. The bus driver told people at each park there he would be picking up, some didnt bother to listen and no doubt missed the return but the driver was polite about it all. Our kids took a trial pony riding lesson on the hotel grounds, a short minibus ride around the roadway and we were at the centre, $20 for once around the paddock may seem expensive but the kids have never been on anything other than a donkey at Blackpool which costs in the region of $5 (depends on exchange rate), and they were on holiday too. Our son was ill one night in the room, and we needed to change the bedding. At 2am we called down and within minutes housekeeping had come to the room with a barrow to take the dirty linen, and a whole set of new linen.

The first impression was that the grounds are stunning, beautifully landscaped and, true to the property's name, shaded by large, moss-draped cypress trees. The spacious grounds give you the feeling of being far removed from the hustle and commercialism of the theme parks, a welcome feeling after a day of Universal/IOA. The enormous atrium lobby is filled with beautiful sculpture, tropical foliage, sparkling tile and glass. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly and presented with complimentary champagne. Unfortunately, and this is my sole complaint about the property, the interior decor of the hotel room was not as impressive. With green and white flowered wallpaper, dark green drapes and carpet, and a generally dated appearance, the decor does not appear to have been updated since the mid-1980s. Oh well. The bathroom was sparkling and the spa-style toiletries were great, and the bed was inviting. Still, the property really shines when you consider its outdoor amenities, the lagoon pools with amazing natural-looking stone grottoes and waterfalls, and the lake with boats available for guests. We really enjoyed a few hours at the pool after a long day of theme parks. I was impressed with the staff, all very helpful and accomodating, especially our favorite bartender - Toue (sp?) , whose great attitude and bartending skills definitely made our Saturday afternoon/evening! Buffet breakfast was on the expensive side, as noted in previous reviews, but tasty (especially the made to order pancakes and waffles with fresh fruit), and the lovely setting is worth the price.

Our family, including young children, stayed at the Grand Cypress for 5 nights in August. It was terrific!! The property is a true \"resort\" destination. Everything that you need for a wonderful vacation is right on the premises. Here are some of the highlights: Hotel - the hotel itself is spectacular. The lobby is filled with lush green plants, talking birds, marble floors and a glass ceiling looking up to the sky 18 floors above. Everything sparkled and it was clear that the staff really cared about how everything looked. They kept it perfectly neat and clean. Rooms - The rooms also were neat and clean, though a little small and very \"green\". Whoever decorated the rooms clearly overloaded on the color green. While the \"double\" beds were pretty small, they were comfortable. The room worked just fine. I highly recommend asking for a room with a view of the pool so that you have the best view and can see the fireworks at night (9 pm). Staff - Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. Eager to please without being over-bearing. The front-desk clerk switched our room to a pool view as soon as I asked and also allowed us to check-in many hours before the normal check-in time. All of the people who worked at the pool were extremely nice and eager to help with towels (including the very welcome relief of the iced towels that they delivered to you as you sat in the sun). Food - We only ate at the Cafe near the pool, but the food was good there. The rest of the restaurants were a little pricey. Pool - By far, the best pool our family has ever seen. The pictures on the website don't truly do it justice. We had a blast swimming through the grottos and under the waterfalls (there are many). You can even swim up to the bar, but it wasn't necessary since the wait staff walked around the pool periodically to take drink orders. The pool was open 24 hours, was the perfect temperature and had a couple of fun water slides. Some people complained about the salty water, but it certainly didn't bother us and wasn't overly salty. Our kids slid on the waterslide for hours at a time and loved it. The whole pool area has the best landscaping and architecture that you could imagine at a hotel. It really is impressive, including a row of hammocks between the pool and the lake beach. Outdoor Activities - For a $13/night \"resort\" fee, we got unlimited free usage of the pool, health club, poolside towels, driving range at the resort's golf course and the pitch and putt golf course next to the pool. My 10 and 12 year old sons used the free golf clubs and free golf balls that they had in the poolside hut to play pitch and putt golf all day long by themselves (with their bathing suits on). Whenever they wanted to cool off they could walk about 20 steps back from the course to the pool and jump in to the water. No hole was longer than 60 yards and the greens were very slow, but they had a great time. The pool staff also frequently came around to ask the younger children to play games such as duck races, treasure hunts, etc. The winners got tokens for the game room at the pool. Perhaps the best of all was free use of the bicycles to ride around the paths at the resort. We took a ride in a 6 person covered surrey bike on which four people can peddle at the same time. It was great fun. Aside from the above, here are some tips that we learned while we were there and some that we learned on TripAdvisor. First, park in the self-park lot since it is very close to the pool area and saves a lot of money. When you come to the security gate as you first drive in, ask them to direct you to the self-park lot. Second, since the food is expensive in the hotel, explore the nearby area for lunch and dinner options. There are many national chain restaurants in the immediate area (e.g., Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, Ponderosa, TGIFridays, Pizzeria Uno, Red Lobster, Golden Corral, Quiznos etc.) and best of all is the close proximity to Downtown Disney, where they are many great restaurants, including the Rainforest Cafe. Third, there is a Wal-Mart down the road, where we went to stock up on breakfast snacks, bottled water and other drinks that we kept in the room. We saved a ton of money that way. Hope this helps!

We stayed at the Hyatt Grand Cypress the last week of July, so this was our end of the summer trip. What an expensive disappointment!!! We paid $230 a night, plus $13 for activities fee and $25 extra for the refrigerator. We have learned a hard lesson as we usually stay on Disney property where you are treated first class; we will always stay on Disney in the future! You don't always get what you pay for!!! The positive is that the grounds are nicely kept and the inside is very pretty as well. Unfortunately, that is about the only thing that is included in the price and one of the only positives about the stay. The pool, while very large, is absolutely FREEZING and THEY ARE SALTWATER POOLS. It doesn't mention that at all. They posted a sign throughout our stay stating that one pool was 85 and one pool was 87, but I doubt that either pool reached a temperature above 80. The pools were dirty the 3 times that we went and although they said someone would come to clean them, they never did. The slides are very small as well. EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE!!! The prices of the food are absolutely ridiculous. The Palm Cafe which is pool side, casual counter service and the \"cheaper prices\" was extremely slow. It is still very pricy! While waiting in line on our second day, 3 people requested money back stating that they had waited 45 minutes for their lunches. We ended up getting out of line and going to the store to buy food. My husband returned before some of the people got their food. The breakfast buffet, which is very small, was $18.50 a person. They added 25% to my husband's drink order, so 2 dacquiris without alcohol cost $14.00. While there is a lot of restaurants to choose from, the prices are absolutely ridiculous, so we ate at Disney 3 of the 4 nights we stayed there. When we checked in they gave us a list of recreational activities, so my 11 year old was very excited. The first morning he ran down to the Pitch n Putt Hit the Pole. It took about 1 minute to complete the activity and he got a game token for participating. We thought we'd try another activity, so he went to the pool treasure hunt. The girl had the kids turn around, threw about 50 tokens in the pool and told them to dive in to get them. This took the kids about 25 seconds and it was over. We decided not to plan around the other activities listed. Golf was extremely expensive, so my husband and son choose to go to a Disney golf course saving about $100. While it states online that you can request several items ahead of time for your room and they will be waiting there when you arrive, that too is false. We requested extra towels, hangers, pillows and a refrigerator and we received them 1 1/2 hours after we arrived. It took 2 trips to get it right, but after 2 hours of sitting in the room they finally arrived. The final straw was on Friday when we went out to get in my car. Apparently they had put new mulch down during the day and proceeded to blow dirt, bugs and mulch all over my new convertibile. We took it up to show the manager and he did accomodate by saying they would part it free in valet ($18.00 a day) and clean it. When we went to check the car they had washed it, but mulch was still stuck all over the top. We told them it wasn't acceptable and one of the valet guys said, all you have to do is wash it. It appears that we are going to have to take the car into the dealer to get it detailed and send the bill to them. Save yourself money and aggravation and stay somewhere else.

Our overall impression was that this is a legitimate 4 star hotel with an abundance of services and amenities. The grounds our enormous (1,500 acres) with the property situated on Lake Windsong with a nice view of Epcot Center in the distance. The walking trails, bike paths, and tennis courts help create a nice atmosphere and set the stage for a relaxing, family-oriented vacation. The complex itself is so large that it offers a nice alternative for those travelers who don't want to be saturated in the Disney experience. That being said, the Hyatt is only about a 10-15 drive to Sea World and the Walt Disney World resort with easy access to Interstate 4. We found it worthwhile to purchase a two-day pass to each theme park which allowed us to come and go throughout the day. As such we were able to get plenty of rest by the pool. Which, by the way, is beautiful and well-maintained. It is probably one of the nicest we have found in all of our travels throughout North America and the Caribbean. We found the staff to be helpful and friendly throughout the entire tenure of our stay. Some of the previous reviews had mentioned that some are a little \"over the top\" in looking for a tip. Our thoughts on this subject is that this is how these folks make their living. My wife and I are always looking to receive great service regardless of where we stay. This is part of what you are paying them to do. Our room was clean and well decorated. If you fail call them to clean on a daily basis they will only do so once every three days. While we found this to be a little strange, we called and the room was cleaned regularly. It should also be noted that the HRGC is not an all-inclusive resort. As such, you are going to pay extra for all of their services and amenities such as Horse back riding, Camp Hyatt (for kids), as well as golf and other sports. While we did not sample any of the 4-5 on-site restaurants due to time constraints, we noticed that the prices were high. That being said, this is usually typical of hotel dining. There is an abundance of restaurants no more than five minutes outside the resort on Florida Coastal Route 535. During our stay we dined at TGI Friday's, Olive Garden, Chilis, Sizzler, and IHOP. While this is in no way five-star cuisine, you definitely have more than one option if you don't wish to pay inflated prices at the hotel. All in all, we were pleased with the overall quality of the Hyatt including its cleanliness, services, convenience, and professionalism of the staff. We would definitely consider staying there again on our next visit to Central Florida.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cTheft!!!

The hotel is a massive complex in a good location, minutes from the Disney theme parks and I-4. The Hyatt provides complimentary transportation to and from the Disney theme parks. You are first greeted by a security gate check point who directs you to valet parking. Be sure to ask where the self park lot is, should that be your choice. It's a good hike from the parking lot to the check in desk, so this is not a good option for the elderly. The hotel has a wonderful bright atrium lobby and is very inviting. The check in staff are excellent, polite and thorough. You are offered a refreshing glass of champagne at check in. The rooms are standard (perhaps slightly larger than average) and come with many amenities - safe, iron and ironing board, wireless internet (charge) and most have small balconies. Two pieces of advice. Ask for a room with a view of the pool - you will then be able to see the Disney Fireworks at night which is nice. Also, rather than pay the $9.95 daily charge for internet access, buy a T-Mobile Hot Spot Card which can be used at the hotel. This is good especially if you are staying more than a day or two. These prepaid cards can be purchased at T-Mobile or CompUSA. A buffet breakfast was included in my rate and was fine, however, I believe the charge was $18.95 otherwise, which I feel is quite excessive. Bar staff were excellent (as were all the staff). The hotel also offers an hourly shuttle service to and from the airport (charge) for those who have not rented a car and want to save money from using a taxi. I had forgotten my toothpaste and the housekeeping staff delivered a toothbrush and toothpaste within minutes. Service was top notch at this hotel. I never used the pool, but from what I can see it was excellent. Hotel is also on a little lake with paddleboats, however........I was a bit disturbed to hear that there are signs near the paddleboat lake that warns not swim in the lake because of alligators!!! I hope that is a joke. I do reccomend this hotel - it's a big property, but it doesn't lose the service aspect which is nice.

I agree with another reviewer that you should rent a car so that you can make a more flexible schedule and not have to rely on the restaurants on site. I will say the shuttles are on time but the drivers can really get annoying when they are looking for a tip. The scheudles to and from parks are very limited probably because they use a 52 seat bus . I would suggest a smaller shuttle as a trial for in between times / maybe that would work? The bfast buffet is okay although the multitude of servers tended to stand around our last 2 days , so we waited an excessive period of time to get our juice and coffee. Also , the eggs were cold at times but in all fairness it is hard to regulate eggs / maybe they should be changed more often? The palms cafe is convenient but the food is not that great for the money. The ice cream freezer was not working so the frozen treats were melting all over when we were there. The cooler was empty the next day , so they did address it. Cocktails are very expensive and our first round of \"Killer frozen Pina Colatas\" by the pool were warm and way too strong and cost $19.00 . There was only 1 waitress on duty to cover the entire pool area and she did redo the drinks (they were not much better). They need more help and the poolside cafe / bar is not close enough to the pool area. All items on sale at the towel hut are way overpriced as are the items found in the hotel gift shops. We ran out of toothpaste and spent $4.50 on a small tube. Also , the American Miss Pageant came into the hotel and there was no attempt at crowd control whatsoever . They overran the place . Shuttle busses could not get in making existing guests wait longer and walk up the driveway in some cases.Although the problem was fixed by the next day. We waited 30 minutes for an elevator on Friday night because the kids were playing on the elevators and pushing all the buttons repeatedly. Just so you know , we did try the stairs but you are not allowed to use them as an exit to the lobby / They should change that. So beware and check for big events before you go. The Whitehorse food is wonderful and our waiter Luis was the nicest guy as are the managers who check on all customers throughout their meal. A+ to Hemingways you must eat there / it is soooo good and the service is fantastic . Concierge service is very good / very attentive. Do arrange a Kennedy Space Center tour through them / it beats Disney! The candy and occasional soda from the mini bar will cost up to $30.00 which is ridiculous.

There were activities for the kids at the pool along with paddelboats, canoes and other watercraft to use on the lake. Golf and pitch n' putt for the adults along with walking/jogging trials and bicycles. One suggestion I would make in visting Orlando is to rent a car. It cost us less to rent a car then it would have in paying for transportation to and from the airport. Plus you have more freedom in making your own schedule. For example, the Hyatt bus to Disney ran at 8 / 8:30AM and another did not leave until 10:30. Quite a gap if you miss the first one. Also, you are not stuck with just the hotel restaurants (and their prices) for you meals. It was the best decision we made. Lastly, it is small things that bring you back to a certain hotel and the Hyatt provides these things. I'm talking about cold towels to cool off with at the pool, a PC at the front desk for printing your return trip boarding pass, ceiling fans in the room, waitress service at the pool etc...

Though I would gladly stay at this property again and would definitely rate it above average, just a couple of little details kept it from the 5-star range for us. Check-in was a breeze- self parking is readily available on the side entrance to the property, which allows you to avoid the valet/bellhop situation if you only have a few things or would just rather avoid all that. After strolling through many long hallways, up escalators, and through the lush atrium/lobby area, we were greeted by a very friendly front desk agent who checked us in and gave us each a glass of champagne. The lobby is wide open all the way to the top of the property, and full of foliage of all kinds, Asian-themed art, and colorful live birds. I found the lobby to be very airy, impressive, and atmospheric -- if similar to other Hyatts I have previously stayed at. The elevators are fast enough, but were often crowded. As massive as this sprawling resort is, you are never alone - even in the pool at 4am! Speaking of the pools, they are very impressive. Again, they are crowded, but are also large enough that you can usually avoid the crowds. The waterfalls and grottos are very unique, as is the pool bar, tucked beneath a stone formation/waterfall. They do lightly salt the water in the pools (we spoke to the staff member who performed this task on our late night in the pools), so be aware of that. The location is great, a stone's throw from WDW, essentially overlooking Downtown Disney. That being said, you could really spend a whole day or two just wandering around this property seeing all that the grounds have to offer. Even the bars/lounges scattered around the lobby area general seemed to be bustling. As for the room, it was... .fine. We were told we were given an \"upgraded\" room location with views of the lake/bridges on the back of the property. While this was fine, the OTHER side of the hotel, which overlooked the pools and WDW itself (providing a clear view of all the WDW fireworks shows), seemed to have the clearly better view -- we had the lake, bridges, and.... IHOP. (???). Ah well, it was still nice, and I enjoyed the very small but nice balcony from our 9-th floor spot. The room is very GREEN, and has some pretty bright floral patterns throughout. Though probably a bit 1980's and not something you'd ever do to your house, the decor is very airy and fun and does enhance your \"I'm on vacation\" mindset. The room is basic in size and features, and the bathroom is probably slightly larger than average. The toilet is tucked away in a semi-private enclave, which is nice. The rest of the bathroom is essentially basic but functional. The beds themselves are very standard - nothing to write home about, and frankly, smaller than actual kings, IMHO. They are on the firm side and are comfortable enough, but by no means do they stack up to the signature bedding most other major chains have introduced. The TV is small, but gives you a wide variety of choices. Drawer space is adequate. This being said, you don't stay at Grand Cypress for the room - the property itself is in a great location and is a sprawling mega-estate with endless entertainment options and an accomodating staff.

My response: \"In a heartbeat.\" This place isn't on the Trip Advisor list at #2 by accident. I'll start by noting that all comments and critiques that precede this posting are not puffery, and I'll also try not to sound redundant as we go along, but suffice it to say the Hyatt was all business. Pure and simple. No games, no slacking off, no shoddy treatment of guests. They delivered. From the lush atrium, forcing your eyes skyward to view the greenery, from the live birds greeting all who walk by, from the pools to the slides to the bikes to the golf to the hammocks to the bike and nature trails...there's something to do for everyone -- if you're not out and about taking in all the Orlando attractions, that is. For starters, the Hyatt is a chip shot to the Disney properties, i.e., Downtown Disney, Epcot, Magic Kingdom. One would have to be staying at the Contemporary or other hotels on site in order to be closer. The Hyatt shuttle was convenient to all the theme and water parks; however, we opted to rent a car to avoid having to be tied to a schedule. (This mid-40s couple was travelling with their three-year-old son.) Since it was a $50 cab ride one way from the airport to here, and also considering the taxi rides we'd be paying on our way out to dinner, we felt renting a car was a good bargain. With International Drive and other main thoroughfares nearby, finding a restaurant was effortless. Yes, we ate one night at a restaurant on premises, but $40 filets -- tasty, no doubt -- but more bargains were had off the property. Kept the food bill lower in any event. When making a reservation here, the conventional wisdom is asking for a room facing the pools. This way, at night the fireworks displays at Epcot and the Magic Kingdom will be in full view. One won't be confused in thinking it's the Fourth of July, but there is a decent amount of entertainment value in it. Plus it's free. At the pool, finding a lounge chair was easy. The pools (one heated and one not) were never crowded, clean, and there was bar service too. Afternoons seemed to be the time when the kids got back from the parks, changed into trunks, and jumped in to kill time before dinner. As frightening as that may sound, we never felt overrun. There were families grabbing bikes for a ride, or using a paddleboat on the lake, or taking a canoe ride. I suppose for $13 as a resort fee, it's best to take advantage. With regard to the room, it was comfortable, accommodated a daybed, was nicely appointed, and otherwise just as one would expect from a Hyatt property. The outside balcony, while not large by any stretch of the imagination, as others on this site have mentioned, was better than simply having a window. Anyway, it made for better viewing of the fireworks and helped get fresh air in. The deli/food/drink place on the lower level by the pool offered plenty of noshing choices. There was pizza, sandwiches, salads, soda, wine, bottled water, coffee/tea and other beverages. Surprisingly, the prices were not \"stick-em-up\" either. Kudos to Hyatt for that. All in all, we feel completely satisfied with this hotel. They offer full concierge service, including rental car arrangements; the shuttle; gated entry from the main road; four restaurants from which to choose; spa and fitness center; and competent, friendly service. If one is on a tight budget, we'd suggest the Motel 6 up near Orlando, but since most Orlando visitors are splurging anyway on Mickey and friends, it's worth the price to come and enjoy all this Hyatt has to offer.

The sunbeds were more like beds they were so comfortable. There is plenty to do with the option of bike riding, mini golf and any number of floating devices to use on the lake.

Our trip was very much a theme park / attraction based holiday but staying for 18 nights we wanted somewhere that was both close to the parks but also offered a pleasant retreat away from all the theme park mayhem to recover in between - the Hyatt certainly lived up to our expectations. The hotel is magnificent, and the breathtaking atrium an awesome sight with beautiful interior landscaping. We arrived at 3pm on a Saturday and the check-in process was swift, helpful and efficient. We did not have to wait in line for this, I think there were 3 or 4 people behind the front desk. All our requests of a non-smoking quiet room on a high level and away from the atrium and conference facilities were granted, we ended up with a pool view room on the 7th floor with an excellent view of the firework displays of Epcot, Downtown Disney and Magic Kingdom. We had read reports that the atrium can be noisy but this was ceretainly not the case, and had also read that the smartly dressed conference delegates can make casually dressed holiday folk feel uncomfortable, but again I would disagree with this. There were plenty of holiday guests walking around in all sorts of casual clothing from shorts and tee shirts to sarongs and bikini tops and flip-flops and no-one looked out of place. We also hired a fridge for the room and were pleased to receive a full-sized one which fit in the room fine without compromising space. The room decor was colourful and pleasant, and whilst the bathroom wallpaper is a little dated the rooms are kept impeccably clean by a very diligent and respectful housekeeping staff. The room size was adequate and the large marble topped table in the room good for room service meals. Our room had 2 double beds (for two adults and one 13 year old) which were on the firm side but comfortable none the less, with regularly changed linen. There were no technical problems in our room and the air conditioning was fairly quiet and made more effective by the seperately controlled ceiling fan. There are 5 lifts in total and use of these is mandatory as there are no stairs except for emergency evacuation. The lifts were our only frustration during the holiday as there were occasionally long waits for them, notably at certain times of day around 8-9:30 in the mornings, and mid-late afternoon. This was made worse for us as the lifts were undergoing some maintenance during our stay, which meant that sometimes there were one or two out of action. Conference delegates can also cause a bottleneck here at their start and finish times. The pool area is magnificent and although the larger one is not heated and therefore on the chilly side, it was not prohibitively cold and was regulalry used by both adults and children (The weather during our stay was good and daytime temperatures ranged from 80-90 degrees, with nightime lows in the low to mid 60's). The pools and decks were kept clean and there appeared to be staff regularly collecting debris left by guests coming and going. During the peak easter weeks there was a notable demand for well positioned sunbeds around the main pool areas, particulalry the heated pool, and the early morning towel brigade was often out by 8am or earlier reserving beds. However there are so many spread around the large grounds that there was never any danger of not finding ones suitable. The other on-site recreation facilities are very enjoyable and worth taking advantage of. A well maintained and nicely landsacped 9-hole pitch and putt golf course, cycle hire, boating on the lake and a well equipped gym are also included in the daily resort fee of $11 and were never overly busy, even over easter. The hotel restaurants are expensive but excellent and offer a range of dining styles. We enjoyed both Hemingways (for seafood) and the White Horse Bar and Grill (for steaks), and typically if you splashed out on a 3-course meal with drinks and coffe you can easily top $200 plus gratuities for a family of 3. The palm court deli is more cost effective and great for quick meals, a light breakfast, or even to take food back to your room. Service in all of them was impecable. We did not use La Coquina. Having been stung for valet parking charges at the Wyndham Palace in the past, we elected to use self parking and were pleased we did. The self parking lot is only a short walk from the main atrium, with a choice of either an indoor route through the conference level, or a pleasant outdoor route through the gardens, and I would not discourage people from using this. The resort is ideally positioned for Disneyworld, and by using Hotel Plaza boulevard and avoiding the I4 were were able to drive to all of the disney parks and park the car within 5-15 minutes. Even trips to Universal studios took less than 20 minutes. The checkout process was swift and efficient with no room charge errors.

The service is excellent, from the main reservation desk to the doorman, bellman, housekeeping and the restaurant staff, everyone is ready to please. After the mayhem at the Disney Parks coming back to this place is like coming home. We spent three full days at the resort itself, just hanging by the pool, going to the health club, taking paddle boats out on the lake and biking. All of this and more is included in the resort fee. The rooms are a bit small and the bathrooms look outdated but everything is kept very clean by housekeeping and this makes up for the shortcomings. The housekeeping is very vigilant, cleans the rooms at every opportunity. The only restaurant we ate was at Cascade for breakfast everyday. Nice buffet selection with lots of fresh fruit and hot items. Took a few quick bites at the Palms Caf\u00e9, this is at best average. Drinks at the pool are expensive; just bring them from your room. They have a complimentary shuttle service to the Disney Parks, this worked very well for us throughout the time. We rented car only for one day to go to the beach. On our way from the airport to the hotel we asked the cab driver to stop by a grocery store so we could pick water and other snacks, he very gladly obliged. Plenty of eating places outside the hotel within walking distance. The hotel has a complimentary shuttle service to drop guests at the main hotel gate since the grounds are massive and walking through them could take good 10-15 minutes. On your way back ask the person at the security checkpoint on main gate to call the shuttle; it came within 3-5 minutes for us. I highly recommend this hotel.

The reception staff were very helpful, the concierge likewise and the guided tour of the hotel and it\u2019s facilities was very useful. We stayed at Regency Club level throughout and found this to be a wise decision. If you can, specify a pool view room - not only will you have a great view of the pool, but at 9:00pm every night you can watch the simultaneous fireworks from Universal and Disney from your own private balcony. The balcony is small, but large enough to get your party on for the view. We would finish in the parks; have dinner then a few cocktails in the Club lounge just before we left for the fireworks, this worked out really well. The breakfasts in the lounge are also very good, nice selection of pastries and fresh ham, cheese, eggs, tomatoes, lots of bread and coffee/tea/hot chocolate. My daughter (8) loved the pool, as did we. We ate at Hemmingway\u2019s & the White Horse Sports Bar, Hemmingway\u2019s was outstanding, somewhat expensive but the food was worth every penny. The White Horse was pretty good, but again expensive. Location is good if you don't mind driving. We used their cab service to go to Downtown Disney, at $10.00 we thought it pretty good value. The rest of the time we used our hire car, so cannot comment on their shuttle service. The rooms at the hotel really are nothing out of the ordinary, don't be expecting a large palatial room with every facility. High speed internet access is available (at a charge), plenty of TV channels, air-con, celing fan, a couple of beds and a work-table.

All of the parks are within a 10 - 15 minute drive from the hotel.

We requested extra towels which were received in less than a minute! Our water pressure was great with PLENTY of hot water! Each night we found a wash cloth folded in a decorative way on our vanity. The grounds looked like \"the Botanical Gardens\" in every nook and cranny!!! BEAUTIFUL!!! Statues, fountains, flowers and tropical foilage! It was hard to believe this was Orlando and not the Carribbean! All I needed to hear was steel band music which didn't happen. The music by the pool could have been better, but it was ok. The lake was beautiful, where we kayaked, used the paddle boats, a great family time there! My boys bicycled one morning with a fine selection of bikes to chose from (all included in the stay). The family used the \"pitch and putt\" 9-hole golf course which was beautiful! Overall...it was a WONDERFUL visit. There was construction going on in the lobby as well as poolside (putting new walkways in), but it was only to make it even better...and did not interfere with our visit. I would not hesitate to stay there again and highly recommend this property to my friends!!!!", "Date": "August 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery good experience ....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3743782", "Content": "I just finished a five night stay at the Grand Cypress and was very pleased with the hotel, they are obviously very concerned with their guests well being. Whenever we had a question, or were lost, there always seemed to be someone there willing to help us in a friendly manner. In my research of the hotel prior to the visit one post had made the comment that the rooms were outdated, this was not true based on my experience. I had one of the lower level \"garden\" views which would be considered budget for this hotel and found the room to be quite nicely decorated with new and clean furniture artwork, etc. The bath was pleasently large with a separated toilet enclosure and included a scale, which I almost never find in a hotel. The only complaint with the bath was that the drain was slow and tended to collect water, but I did not report this. The room included a work desk with two chairs, more than adequate for business. The TV had excellent sharpness and there was more than enough storage/closet space for two person's clothing for five days. I usually avoid hotels in favor of B&B's simply for the issues of privacy and solitude. We may have just been lucky, but this was the quietest room that I can remember being in. During six nights, I cannot remember being awaken once with the usual door slaming, loud plumbling, 3AM drunks, etc. I have the feeling that I may have been lucky that there were no major conventions during this time. I will affirm one concern that I had read about, namely food pricing, but with a caveat. Our first meal was a Sunday morning buffet that was $18.00, which is no doubt pricey for most of us. But, the meal included French-pressed coffee, a great smoothy and food that tasted and was prepared with high standards. It was not the same old high priced breakfast buffet, and the service was great. We spent two mornings walking to IHOP and Denny's but came to the conclusion that the Hyatt was a far better value than having to walk in the humidity. One last comment, I found the park tranportation shuttle to be more than adequate for our needs with two exceptions. If you plan to be a park hopper, you may need to reconsider either staying at a Disney resort, or accepting that you will need to take what could amount to an expensive ca b ride. You cannot go from park to park directly on Disney's system, you always need to go to a Disney resort first, and then catch another bus to the new park. If you plan to hop in order to catch a later Hyatt shuttle at a later pick up time, give yourself plently of time, and then some. You should also know the pick up location as the parking areas can be quite large. We went right out of the Tranportation Center (note: this center is NOT the Magic Kingdom as is noted on Hyatt's schedule, the center is a hub between Epcot and the Magic Kingdom) when we should have gone left and ended up five minuets late to pick up the shuttle, this cost us about $25 in cab fees. Also, try to leave the firework show early if you have to get back to a resort, what had been an empty Monorail station turned into a massive exodus of guests a short time after the conclusion of a show. This added an unanticipated 30 - 40 minute delay and another missed shuttle/cab penalty. You can get around this if you simply spend the whole day at one park. Remember that the shuttle's leave exactly on time, there is no grace here. If you think that you have an extra five minutes, be prepared to either accept the cab penalty, or have a fallback plan to catch the shuttle at a later time ...", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cOverall Great Experience at Hyatt Grand Cypress\u201d", "Author": "Angeltravel", "ReviewID": "UR3709350", "Content": "My two kids (7) and (10) and I went to Grand Cypress the week of July 8 -July 16. We had a couple of negative experiences, but they were fixed fairly quickly and we ended up having a great time. When we arrived, a beauty pagaent was being held at the hotel and they had given our room away (high floor - swimming pool view) and put us in a room on a low floor with no view and they were out of rollaway beds. I was quite upset about this, but once I asked to speak to a manager - they responded well. They didn't charge us for that night and the next day they moved us to a better room. The next day I took my kids to Hyatt Kids Camp, which is wonderful - especially if you are travelling alone with kids. I went back to the room to sleep, but they were doing construction on the floor and the sound came through the air vents. I called to inquire when this would end and they said it would be done soon and were very apologetic. Later that night, when the kids and I returned from Disney World, there was a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberrys in the room with a note from the manager. The only other issue I had was on the first night when all the teenager beauty queens and their beau's were running around the grounds and jumping off the bridge over the pool - very dangerous. I brought this to the manager's attention and he sent someone out right away. Tips: Kid's room service menu is a great value, the Hyatt Kid's Camp is wonderful and the staff and counselor's are terrific. My kid's had such a good time they asked if they could go back the day we were suppose to go to Animal Kingdom. Please note, the daycare room is quite small - but good for infants and toddlers - however the counselor's take them swimming, bike riding, over to the equestrian center...Pool and slide are great. There is a smaller pool which is heated more for little kids with a smaller slide. Also, ask for a high floor room with a pool view in the left wing as you are facing the hotel. This has the best view of the fireworks at DisneyWorld and Epcot Center at night!!! Downside: Hotel's shuttle service to the Disney World parks don't run very frequently. You end up taking a cab between the hotel and parks a lot. It runs you about $15 - $20 bucks each way. I don't think you can avoid this, unless you stay at a Disney property or don't mind the limited schedule of the shuttles. Extra: We went to Epcot Center the last day and didn't have much time to spend there. I wish we had spent more time there. It was really interesting and the fireworks at night are spectacular. It was really magical with the kids. Also, one of our favorite experiences was at Gatorland. It is old and funky - but what fun for the kids.

One night they had a crab and shrimp pasta salad. We didn't even end up going to dinner! Another night we enjoyed crab claws and spring rolls. Also, later each evening they serve dessert and after dinner drinks. The service from the rest of the staff is exceptional too. The day we checked in, we were without water for a few hours due to construction (which was no big deal since we were going down to the pool anyway). Later that afternoon they sent us a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a note of apology for the inconvenience. Then, when our daugher and her friend (both 16) missed the bus from Disney (due to the fact that it left earlier than scheduled) the manager sent a towncar for them, and allowed us to ride along.

Our week began great. The hotel has great swimming pool and recreation facilities. The kids really loved the riding stables. Our vacation went bad after three days. The pool area was plaqued with petty crime. six guest had personal items stolen from the pool (cameras, clothes, purse). We witnessed a man trying to do the same to us while we swam. The remainder of the week we had to keep someone at the umbrella to watch. We also returned to our room to find it open. (maybe the maid left it, but still open for anyone to get in). Nothing was taken. We had a horrible time getting an elevator. It sometimes took a 1/2 hour to get one to go down to the lobby. We had to take dark stairways that brought you to the back of the hotel and walk around to the front to get your car from valet. (why am i paying $15 for valet) The hotel blammed in on a local beauty contest that was being held in the ballroom. Many people staying in one room or using the hotel to change. This created a problem at the pool as well. We saw many swimmers leaving to go to their cars in bathing suits (apparently not guest of the hotel) Not what you expect from a 4 star hotel. Although the security gate at the hotel checks all cars as they go in, you can just say you want to go to the restaurant and they let you in. Not a good situation.

If it doesn't sense any motion after some time it stops cooling the room. This means that the room is blazing hot when you come back after a long day out. I can live with that. But at night, if you like your room to be cool like I do (eg 67 or 68) you are out of luck. It will only turn on when you toss and turn and in my case it never managed to get below 71. However if you complain they will send someone up to disable the sensor. I suggest you do that on the first day if you like to sleep in a cool room. Another oddity: they won't let pizza guys deliver to the hotel. You have to pay a valet to go get the pizza for you at the security gate a quarter mile away. Therefore, most pizza places won't even deliver there due to the hassle. If you complain they say that it is a 9/11 security thing, but the security gate is just a formality for anyone except for the poor pizza guys -- they just wave everyone through. Sounds like a case of them protecting their profits. This wouldn't be a problem for me except their late late night room service menu leaves a lot to be desired. No pizza after 1 am for example.

Since we are Diamond members of the Hyatt's frequent stay program - \"Gold Passport\", we were able to stay right on the Regency Club level(11th floor). By the way, if you haven't enrolled in Gold Passport and travel quite a bit, think about it...Hyatt always seems to have some great promotions going on for folks to earn free nights or to build up points to use however they like. Anyway, the RC lounge had a hearty continental breakfast in the morning, throughout the day light snacks including brewed Starbucks coffee were offered, then during the evening hours they had hors d'oeuvres plus liquid refreshments. The Regency Club concierges were wonderful, the waitstaff were all nice and every single person that we had contact with, from the valet to the bellhop to the housekeepers were all top-notch. I was very impressed by every Hyatt employee I had contact with. One thing I noticed this time was that the housekeepers were very security conscious. Have you ever noticed at many hotels how some maids leave multiple room doors open at one time? Well, not here...they service one room at a time, with a notice on the door stating that room access is restricted and they are in the room being serviced. We also had turn-down service every night, complete with chocolates and a rose :)...I think this might be because we were staying on the actual Regency Club level this time. We were celebrating an anniversary so our 'special' meal was the Sunday Brunch Buffet at La Coquina...it was great. Pricey(about $55 each?), but included all your coffee, tea, orange juice, soft drinks... and (best of all)unlimited Moet champagne! The food offerings included four kinds of caviar, a cheese table with exotic choices, sushi offerings, fruit (including raspberries, blueberries, strawberries), several superb hot entrees prepared to order, an extensive dessert table(if you like truffles, you'll be in heaven!) plus so many more delicious choices I can't possibly remember... There is only one thing that wasn't perfection...the ongoing road construction on SR535 and on Vista Way(? - I'm not sure of the name, but it's the road that you access the Hyatt from...sorry) is still that...*ongoing*. The wait to turn off of 535 onto \"Vista\"(?) can be several lights long, plus the road construction outside the Hyatt entrance still has that road torn up. The road construction is not a dealbreaker...just something to keep in mind, especially if you have a rental car. I'm sure that once all the construction is finished that easy access will be restored. Make sure you make the time to tour the grounds. The artworks sprinkled throughout the resort, both indoors and out, are beautiful and the plantings could have come straight off of a magazine cover. If folks like orchids, this is the place to see them - I have never seen so many gorgeous orchids. They have programs for kids, plus the resort fee includes practically *all* the activities - health club with free weights/machines/nice facilities, canoeing, kayaking, paddleboats, bikes, surrey bikes, room coffee service, sailboating, daily newspaper, Executive pitch 'n' putt golf, shuttle bus service...practically the only things the resort fee doesn't include are the championship golf courses(including one that was designed by Jack Nicklaus!) and horseback riding.

Firstly, the hotel is very close to WDW (literally around the corner from Downtown Disney) which is important because the two kids are 6 and 8 years old. We arrived late at night, but the atrium was grand and very well lit. My daughter asked if we were back at the Hyatt Regency Maui because this atrium reminded her of the one in Hawaii. Check in was simple and quick. The room with two double beds was comfortable for our family of four, not spacious like the Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton, but comfortable enough. Secondly, the grounds are beautifully manicured and vast as they have 1500 acres, so there is some walking involved which we did not mind. Our room view overlooked the pool area, and we could see most of the WDW parks. (The fireworks shows did NOT intrude into the room.) As indicated with most of the other reviews, the larger and more beautiful pool was cold, between 66-70 degrees while we were there, but the smaller pool was a comfortable 85 degrees and had ample room for my two kids. The temperature of the larger pool would probably warm up in the heat and humidity of summertime in central Florida. Use of bicycles and paddle boats were complimentary. Thirdly, the staff was very friendly and helpful. We had toiletries brought to us within minutes of calling. Elevator wait time was not that bad at all considering there was a large conference full of people from GE, but I did not feel that they really intruded upon us. Now for a few negatives... 1. Two room lights were not working upon our arrival (they were not plugged in). 2. The in room internet connection did not work well, but we were too busy spending time as a family anyways. A business traveler might feel differently. 3. I did NOT get a chance to experience any of the Jack Nicklaus golf courses. 4. There was some road construction at the major intersection outside of the resort. 5. Price... if anyone has to complain about the price, then stay at a lesser place.

Depending on who was reached. I had been about to give up when a co-worker called and said he got the 'good' rate immediately after I'd been told there were absolutely no rooms. We did a conference call back and sure enough this person said there were rooms. \"Very Weird\". Check-in and out was generally not a good experience compared to other hotels, and was surprising for a five start resort. There was a problem with the corporate billing which could have been easily resolved during the week, but was left until final checkout. The staff seem generally not \"customer oriented\". No mention of the problem was mentioned during other calls to the desk. I did not note any staff unfriendlyness, but some seem more interested in taking care of big spenders who are willing to pay over $80 per person for a buffet lunch. The hotel obviously expects to dip deeply into corporate pockets when their employees go to conferences here. Convention food catered by the hotel was AWFUL and made eating off site a desired option. The 'White Horse' bar on site was VERY expensive and had low quality food. Eat somewhere else. Grounds, pool, and lake are beautiful as mentioned by everyone. The rooms are average size but clean, complete with noisy air conditioner and smaller televisions compared to other resorts I've stayed.

The patio door was not air tight (they that happened to alot of patio doors during the hurricanes) and they offered another room or someone can tape it shut and quiet. Because we were already unpacked we chose to stay. The lobby is beautiful complete with parrots , Christmas Tree, Big Monorah, sliding elevators in a beautiful high atrium. The grounds were also quite stunning. The weather was pretty cool this holiday season - mostly in the 60s and low 70s with cool winds so we were not able to use the pools as much as we liked. But the huge pool was unheated so we swam in the heated smaller pool with a smaller slide and used the jucuzzi's as well. The $13pd resort fee covered the pools/newspaper/shuttle service to the parks (universal too) and boats (sail, peddle, kayak, aqua, ) and bikes and family bikes for 4 as well as mini golf-what a deal!

We picked this hotel because of the great reviews here and because it had the most awesome pool. We arrived Dec 2 and stayed until the 9th. Our arrival had us with our mouths agape. We walked into the atrium lobby in the evening and it was so unbelievably gorgeous! An 18 story atrium lobby with palm trees, poinsettias, and a huge Christmas tree all lit up. It was magical. Check in was speedy. We had a great bellman who took us to our room and showed my 9 year old daughter the sights you can see from the hall windows including MK. She was mostly excited about the pool which looked totally awesome at night. In the morning, the first thing we noticed was that we seemed to be the only family there on vacation. This hotel is a convention center so there were convention people (mostly men) everywhere and dressed in business casual or suits. We had self parked and the shortest way to the parking lot was through the convention hall. We felt kind of funny dressed in our \"ready for a day at Disney\" attire which included sneakers, hats and fanny packs. We realized that this place was not as family friendly as we had hoped. We wanted a place that wasn't overloaded with kids and babies, but this place was nearly all adult. Being a Mom, I was surprised to find out that guest laundry meant, give us your first born and we'll wash your undies. Folding is extra! There was no self service laundry which was something I had counted on since we were staying a whole week. Everything in the hotel is expensive. We ate out on the strip every day and night especially since our child is a picky eater and we didn't want to spend a lot on her meal and have her not eat it. The greatest thing about this hotel is that the grounds are simply amazing. From the lobby to the pool, everywhere you look you see the most beautful landscaping and statues. The pool is an attraction all of its own. It has waterfalls and grottos and bubbly hot tubs. Unfortunately the main pool was simply too cold to swim in even when it was 85 degrees out. The pool temp was only 68 and nobody dared go in. There was a smaller heated pool that my daughter got to swim in, but she was really looking forward to the big pool. That was a big disappointment. So I wouldn't recommend the pool after Sept or Oct. Most of the staff was very friendly and helpful especially the bellmen, the wait staff and groundspeople. The desk staff were not as warm and fuzzy. The room was very pretty. You have to like green though! Lighting in the bathroom was a bit dim, but it was very clean and well appointed with a close-up mirror, a scale, full size toiletries, hairdryer and fluffy towels. Very nice. The hotel is right near the entrance to DW. MK and DDD are just a few minutes away. The hotel shuttle didn't run at times we needed so we took our car everywhere we went and paid for parking, so I wouldn't count on the shuttles too much. All in all this place is luxurious and truly beautiful. However, if you are a family planning a vacation, I would recommend a luxury Disney Hotel which has similar amenities but a more family friendly atmosphere.

Im in the travel industry and have to say this is one of the finest hotels in Orlando. For starters parking is free of charge. Atrium is grand and gorgeous. Live parrots in the lobby are a wonderful addition to the tropical feel of the hotel. Check in was a breeze. We asked for a room facing the pool.....which faced Disney property. We ended up getting a corner room 448, we wanted higher, but since we got a much coveted corner room we did not complain. Room was well laid out and had 2 balconies instead of the normal 1. I must admit room decor does need a little bit of updating, but it was no big deal. For those who like the toiletries in the bathrooms, you will love these, they are almost full sized shampoo, conditioner and bath gel. They definately did not skimp......like those annoying tiny bottles found elsewhere. Pools were fantastic. A bit chilly, but who cares when its 90 degrees out and 90% humidity. Reminded me of the ocean temp in Southern California, you eventually get used to it. The pool grottos were also awesome with waterfalls and hidden whirlpools throughout the pool area. I went to the gym everyday and the facilities were top notch, with a wondeful sauna (seperate men and womens) and steam room to wind down in. Also had a great arcade and plenty of free resort activities to take part in. You pay a $13 resort fee, this includes everything: bike rentals (regular bikes and cool 4 person bikes), paddle boats for the lake, canoes, a sand beach on the lake, hammocks, 3 putt golf, regular award winning golf course(for a fee), horse back riding at their equestrian center, miles of trails and paths for jogging and walking, tennis. Im sure there was much more included in the resort fee but there just wasnt enough time to do it all. Lunch at the hotel restaurant is pricey. We checked the menu and no way were we going to pay $10 for a hotel hamburger. One word of advice is to go to Orlando Ale House right down the street from the hotel........a pleasant walk or very short drive. The Ale House has awesome food, great local reputation, good bar and plenty of sports on TV's. Dinner at Hemingways is supposed to be very good. We didnt get to go there. Sunday Brunch at La Coquina in the looby has the reputation of being the best in Orlando------very pricey. Runs around $60. Overall we would recommend this hotel to anybody and everybody. Couples looking for a romantic getaway(nothing more romantic than drinking wine and watching the fireworks over Disney from your balcony), to families on vacation ( the waterslide alone is enough to keep the kids busy for hours........

The resort fee is a nuisance, but we did get to use a some of the \"extras\" that other places don't have (for free anyway), such as bikes. They have horses on the grounds. When we were there, the place seemed practically empty, partly due to it's enormous size and partly because of the earlier bad weather. We did get the breakfast buffet included in our \"package\". It was at the Palms Cafe. It wasn't much of a buffet. Not that the food was bad, but I'm not used to eating breakfast with plastic utensils. It was very, very basic. Not what you would think of as a buffet at all. I think there was actually another buffet in the hotel, which was probably more of what we were expecting. And with the price of rooms there, I would have expected more of a buffet. The self parking was easy. We were considering valet, but when we found the self parking, we were actually happy we didn't get valet. So, the only negative was the Palms \"buffet\".

The staff were extremely helpful and any concerns we had were handled in a friendly and prompt manner. The grounds and pool were amazing and very well cared for which made it an excellent escape from the hetic theme parks. The temperature of the pool was perfect and the other facilities such as the hire of the boats and bikes ..ect.. made a welcome change. We dined in Hemingways on my birthday, and although it was on the pricey side, the food was first class and the portions very large! If you love seafood, this is the place! We did not have breakfast at the hotel however because it was extremely expensive with very little choice. Our room was lovely and we had two large windows where we could lie in bed and watch the Disney fireworks on one side and the Seaworld fireworks on the other, great and very romantic! All the parks were very accessible from the hotel and we did manage to walk to Downtown Disney on a couple of occassions but it is quite a trek.

This hotel was amazing... I loved every minute of it. I can't wait to go back. We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress June 20-24. Our flight arrived at 5 am and rather than pay an extra day for the hotel... we were allowed to check in at 7:30am. The staff was always very polite and informative. We only spent one day at Disney because this was more of a \"stress free\" vacation...all four days were basically spent in and around the property. The pool is breath-taking! You will absolutely love it! It goes through a cave and everything.. it's huge!! The rooms here are above average but nothing \"wow\".. the property and pool are a huge \"wow\".. so that makes up for it in more ways then one. If you plan on staying at this hotel make sure you plan to spend at least $50 per day/per person. Everything is very expensive... I bought two small latte's and the cost was a wopping $9!! The general store and Palm Cafe are the most resonable places to get food but it gets old after a day or two. Be aware that many of the items in the general store do not have pricing.. find out the price before you rip open that bag of chips! After about 9 or 10 o clock there are no places open to eat...if your really hungry you'll have to eat at Hemmingways or White Horse for about $50/for one meal... or you'll be forced to order room service. Even though there were a few downsides.. this hotel is definitely top notch! I would return in an instant! If your very picky about cleanliness, activities, staff, room service etc... this hotel will indeed meet all of your expectations! I loved feeding the ducks and riding the bikes around the property.. that was so much fun! I would give this hotel 4 1/2 stars out of 5...

However we found that 2 of them were joined together through a series of man made grottos to form 2 huge pools. Unfortunately, neither of these pools were heated, their average temperature during our stay was 65-70F too cold to swim in \u2013not just for us but for everybody else and they were both empty all the time, which left the third and much smaller \u2013 but heated pool \u2013 crammed with people. Rooms on the Regency Club floor were well decorated. At times the rooms were not made up until about 4pm though. The breakfasts in the Regency Club lounge were not up to standard, consisting of; smoked salmon, boiled egg, onion, tomato, a range of pastries, a couple of types of fruit and a couple of types of cereals. One morning we breakfasted at the Cascades restaurant in the hotel instead, which was much better. In our opinion the Regency Club rooms were not worth the extra money, that we paid for it. Food items provided during the day, were always the same thing; nut selection and cookies and in the evening, a couple of types of Hors D\u2019Ouvres, which should have been better in a 5* hotel. On the good side, everywhere was clean, staff were fairly friendly and helpful, the gardens in the grounds were absolutely beautiful. The views were fantastic \u2013 we could see both the Epcot and the Magic Kingdom fireworks, the hotel is in a quiet area, but is perfectly located for visiting the Disney parks and Universal.
