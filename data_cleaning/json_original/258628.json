However, they tacked on an extra phone charge of 2.28 per night without telling me. The not-so-friendly manager offered to remove this extra charge--for the first night. After I had been informed then I would have to pay the fee I chose to stay. While I was there, I got two broken coffee pots, so that was a hassle. As for the room, it was clean and generally comfortable. These hotels are built of wood, so you can hear people walking around and bumping into walls, etc.There are several restaurants and fast-food chains within walking distance.", "Date": "Oct 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR121345810", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "cchen2100"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d258628-r20872577-Sun_Suites_Of_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "258628", "Price": "$61"}}
