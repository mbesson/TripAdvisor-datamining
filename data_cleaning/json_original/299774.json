We live in Thailand so its not too far to go for a weekend. I was coming from Jakarta to join my family, who were arriving earlier than me. They were able to check in without having to give any form of guarantee, which was very accommodating of the hotel, and we had also been upgraded to a suite..one of the newly refurbished ones...so the weekend was off to a good start! As previous reveiwers have said, this is an old hotel, built in traditional Chinese style, as an octagon because the number 8 is considered very lucky in Chinese culture, so good Fung Shui! Before it became a Marriott it was called the Tang Dynasty Hotel and it is \"attached\" to Tangs Department Store next door. The hotel has been tastefully upgraded over the past twelve months and, while you cannot change the fundamental size of the rooms, the upgrade has been very cleverly designed to maximise the use of the available space. At the time of writing this review all but the lobby entrance had been upgraded. The major plus point for this hotel is its location, right on the corner of Orchard and Scotts Road, great for shopping and entertainment, good restaurants, and more. Its also only a short cab ride from great places like Clarke Quay and Boat Quay...but then everything in Singapore is only a short cab ride from anywhere!! The Crossroads cafe is THE best location for evening cocktails and dinner, outside, watching the world go by. There is always a great buzz about this restaurant and it offers both indoor (air con) and outdoor seating. This is also where they serve the breakfast buffet which, as other reviewers have said, is just awesome!! They have a new fruit smoothie every day and they are delicious. Oh, and they are putting new Samsung 44\" Smart TVs in all the bedrooms...for you TV techno buffs out there...amazing picture quality.

We arrived at the Singapore Marriott at 3am. We were surprised to find 3 people working the desk at this hour! Because of Marriott status level we were upgraded to a room on the 30th floor with a great view of the city and Orchard Road. The only downside was that the room was small. There was a hairdryer, safe, iron, and ironing board. There were 2 free bottles of water in the room. The bathroom was large with sink, toilet and shower all in one room. Because of my husband has status with Marriott, we had access to the Executive Lounge. The lounge opens at 6am each morning and is very large with lots of seating. In the lounge there is Pepsi, coffee, tea, bottled water, snacks, and fruit. At 5:30pm each evening, there is food out in the lounge and is enough to make a meal out of if you are not a picky eater. For breakfast we could either eat in the lounge, which had a lot of choices or in the restaurant downstairs. We ate in the restaurant both days we stayed there. This is by far the best breakfast buffet we have ever seen anywhere in the world. There were many choices of juices, lots of different fruits, Asian food, waffles, breads, pancakes, bacon, ham, sausages, cheeses, cut cuts, steak, rice, cereals, eggs, and even several kinds of ice cream!

Wide open lap pool, with some cabanas and lots of deck chairs and sun-loungers. Laid-back, relaxing atmosphere, despite the bustle of Orchard Road just below. The Pool Grill which was adjacent to it serves lunch and dinner, and the setting is lovely; looking out on the pool. Pity they are not open for breakfast, because it would make it a perfect place to start the day. However, order room-service breakfast is available for Pool Terrace guests, and is part of the room rate. You can enjoy it on the small terrace area just outside your room. Room furnishings and bathroom very high standard. Deep bathtub and separate rain shower, all in cool, grey granite stone. Unfortunately, the sound insulation of the room is not very good. We could hear our neighbour's TV late into the night, and also the sounds of children screaming in the pool in the morning - woke us up at 8 am !

I did NOT have any issues with this during my stay. This is Singapore, so I would recommend venturing out rather than using the hotels bars and restaurants. There is just too may options so why confine yourself to the Marriott. If you have to stay in, there's great room service and many options for dining. I did stop for a night cap at the outdoor bar and was happy I didn't' miss $18.00 beer night. That is not a typo. Very high price for beer even in Singapore.

The hotel staff were extremely friendly throughout my stay and they were attentive to my requests. As a Platinum member, I was able to gain complimentary access to the Executive loungh which offers ample opportunity for free tasty bites throughout the evening as well as a complimentary cocktail reception from approximately 5-7pm. Additionally, breakfast was available on the 2nd floor at the buffet which was honestly the best Marriott buffet I have ever experienced. The location of this property is fantastic and provides easy access to local shopping and/or dining options. A minimal taxi fare will take you elsewhere if you need to go someplace else to get away from the business of ION Orchard (especially when traveling during December's shopping spree). The rooms are clean and the bathrooms are very pleasant with both a tub and a separate shower. I found the room to be well maintained as well appropriately sized. Although I request rooms away from the lifts/elevators, I was given a room directly in front. However, the sound of the lift \"ding\" did not transfer through the door although there were a few occassions where guests became a little loud during late night/early morning hours. I would have heard theses guests though regardless of where my room was located. In general, I highly recommend this hotel as an option when staying in Singapore - especially during the Christmas Holiday period due to its location as well as decor. However, the cost of this hotel is a bit more than some of the other hotels in Singapore that are newer and perhaps located in less crowded areas. Be sure to look for special offers on their website as well as opportunities you are a Marriott Rewards member. I would love to stay at this property again in my future visits.

I must reiterate again how strategic the hotel's location is. You cannot get any better than being right at the heart of Singapore's infamous Orchard Rd. There is so much to see, do, eat and shop just along that road which makes the hotel oh so convenient. You can visit it all day long and still pop back to the hotel for a little rest before heading out again all with the doormen/staff greeting you warmly at the door with a smile. In terms of location another major bonus is how near the mrt station is to the hotel. Just a few steps away and you can catch a train to anywhere in S'pore (even to the airport). Taxi's are abundant too. Although the rates and prices can be pretty steep, it was worth every dollar spent. The rooms are great and comfortable with a lovely king sized bed. We had an amazing two night's of sleep after the rather uncomfortable stay the night before at the other hotel.

So if you are on one side of the post, you may now know if the other side of post that there is nobody waiting in line....its weird. Workers are nice and polite and friendly, check-in counter gave me iced tea on my arrival (not all 3 times though). They also gave me a pink lugguage tag. breakfast is good, though the noodle station is do-it-youself so that not so good. They have fresh squeezed juices, thats great. Including internet and breakfast, prices in the mid $300USD. Room is large enough, nicely appointed, but does have a little bit of an \"older\" feeling. Due the the 8-sided shape, windows are huge and they have the pull-over drapes. On 1 stay, my pullover drape got stuck and wouldnt pull anymore. On my last stay, right before I left for work, the lights went out on the floor (but not all lights). Taxi in the morning, in front of the hotel, can be a long wait. I am used to Taiwan where you can wave down a taxi anywhere anytime and usually are tons of taxi outside of 3-5 star hotels, there is very few taxi outside of Marriott. I think I've waited for 10 minutes for a taxi, which is a long time to wait. But thats general taxi problem in Singapore where I've waited long time for taxi at East Coast Seafood Center and other places.

I have to say that the location is probably the best aspect of the hotel, right on the famous Orchard rd and its shopping centres. There are an underground tunnel connecting the hotel to several shopping centres and the MRT station, in fact, I used the MRT and the underground tunnel to move from the hotel I stayed the previous night. The lobby was nice although it was a bit dark for my taste, but the check in process was quick. The receptionist was polite and gave me a glass of iced tea (which was very appreciated considering it was very hot outside) to occupy me during the check in process. I requested non smoking rooms but the receptionist told me they ran out of it but told me that they would provided an air purifier if needed. The room was quite big but I immediately found out that there was a construction project right next building, fortunately it was the weekend so the noise was not terrible. The design of the room and the hotel was a bit old and may run the risk of being outdated so I believe a makeover is beneficial to the hotel. The breakfast buffet wasn't bad but not exactly amazing, nevertheless the staff was nice. I had the same experience with the concierge, he was polite and knowledgeable; I asked about how to get to the botanic garden and he explained it clearly, he even offered to call a taxi for me.

While it may be just an average hotel by Singapore's over-the-top-crazy-luxury standards, it very comfortable and would be an upscale Marriott by most American standards. For me, this hotel is equal to or better than the Marriott's in New York or London. Further, it is an excellent value. Like New York or London, you can spend as much or as little money as you want on a room in Singapore, and the quality will vary accordingly. But the Marriott Singapore provides a comfortable hotel with excellent amenities and extras for a reasonable (true, not cheap) price. There are areas that are beautiful (the lobby, the pool, the bar, and the views) and of course parts that could use some upgrading (some of the carpeting). Where this hotel really excels, especially at this price point, is the location. You are steps away from the high end shopping on Orchard Road (Ion Orchard, Shaw House, Tang's, Wheelock Place). The nightclub district is just as close. The Singapore Metro has a station right outside the front door. There are several good restaurants right on the premises as well as within walking distance (and the executive lounge has great food if you have access). You are a short cab ride from the Marina district and the Singapore Flyer. And you are close enough to the central business district to consider this as either a business or leisure hotel. Do ask for a high room; Singapore is a bustling city with 24-hour noise, and the hotel bars are active well after 2am almost all nights of the week. Overall, the Marriott Singapore is clean and attractive hotel in a perfect location.

Another staff member appeared after 20 minutes (followed by 2 more staff) to serve us. I can never figure out why any hotel would take such a long time to check in guests!

We turned the control up to 29C and set the level to Low and the temperature remained unchanged (cold). We had it turned off for most of the time. - Bed was comfortable as per trademark of Marriott hotels/resorts. - Room's furniture and bathroom were standard. - Internet was not complimentary.

Being hexagonal, some of the rooms are a funny shape, but I've never had one of the small ones so I can't complain.

Some seemed quite genuinely pleasant, some just playing at it - and not very well; no follow through or sense of genuine care. This compared unfavourably with staff at the Fullerton, Royal Plaza, Meridien and any of the Shangri La hotels I've stayed at. 6) There's only ONE free laptop (ie not a proper PC) for the use of all Exec guests, with a usage limit of 20 mins - or 30 mins, depending on which staff member you speak to. Toally under-resourced; I'd have thought there would be at least three for a hotel that size. You can borrow an iPad but still .... And there isn't a printer attached either: one has to email whatever you need to print to a staff member; unfortunately I couldn't see an option on the Air Asia website for emailing my boarding pass so gave up and just made sure I got to the airport super early to check-in in the usual way. 7) They don't enforce the laptop usage limit rule: one guest, who'd promised me he would log off 'shortly' then refused to. He became verbally abusive as I tried to appeal to his sense of fairness. The staff member present at the time was a rabbit in headlights and completely failed to help sort the situation out ... very horrible experience. Overall I regret spending that much money at the Marriott and I wouldn't stay there again ... BUT I would go there for breakfast! Interestingly, it's the only hotel (from four I stayed at in Asia on this holiday) which I didn't receive a Feedback Survey request from after my stay.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel with Courtous and Impeccable Staff\u201d", "Author": "pftambur", "ReviewID": "UR101401482", "Content": "While I am a Platinum Elite Member of Marriott's program, this was my first trip to Singapore and this property.

I AM TORN!!! I was treated very well my Fiona and JoJo at Marriott Cafe for the excellent customer service. I would have rated this hotel a 5 stars except for my purse was stolen in Marriott Cafe - so I have to downgrade the score.. to a 2. My trip ended with half a day at the hotel with the Community Police officer and 2 hrs the next day to get the report from the Police HQ. My purse was stolen in front of our noses. No one was in the Marriott Cafe and we were discussing business results over a late buffet dinner. We enter the Marriott Cafe at 9:20 pm meetings and ran to the buffet island to meet the 10 pm deadline. There were two servers who came back and forth to our table but no other customers were sitting around. The Cafe was quiet and had no one else approaching our table other than the two lady servers (change in napkins, removal of dishes, and hand wash dish). At 10:30 pm, I discovered that my purse which I hung on the corner of the chair was no longer there. When I was at the hotel, the hotel GM did not attempt to make correct the situation but did send their Office Manager to apologize for the situation. I requested them to call the Community Police and the manager said that they only come to the hotel if I lost my passport. I was aghast by the news but was too tired to ask for additional support since it was 1:30 am. I spent most of my time calling credit card service centers to cancel my cards. The next morning, I requested for the GM and the Office Manager. They were \"busy\" but the front office did call the police since I asked for additional information. I spent from 10 am to 3:30 pm with the police to have a statement and for the police to review the security tape. The police officers are following leads and are investigating but I had money, business notes, BBerry, and a Coach purse that was stolen. Due to the response at the time of my alarming the Night Shift manager, I was not fully satisfied with Marriott's immediate response and withholding information - so I am putting a 2 for the hotel stay. Breakfast Buffet - expensive (not included as in US) or should have been included as part of corporate discount WanHan Restaurant - fine dining if you are short on time. Very good service Spa and Pool - Outdoor pool which I did not use due to rain, did use the fitness room which was tight but had all the needed equipment. Room - overall - clean, no complaints. Marriott brand is consistent based on its brand name. Service - I experienced the extreme here - From excellent (JoJo and Fiona to Sharon) to the unclear communication and immediate investigation after I notified the night shift manager about my purse theft. I did not have transparency of evidences that were discovered until I requested for the police department's investigation. This left a sour taste in my mouth and very disappointed in Marriott for not havign a clear guidance for their employees for this situation. The Office manager did go out of her way to provide transportation to the airport and police HQ for me. I appreciated that. I will be notifying corporate Marriott and their senior leaders to alert them of such occurences. We had a list of hotels to choose from, and I have been loyal as well as dependent on the Marriott brand to deliver consistent services and experiences during my business trip to Asia. I chose Marriott due to the brand and was disappointed that my purse was stolen while I was in its safe and secured premise.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beausoleil", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location, expensive!\u201d", "Author": "freobhoy", "ReviewID": "UR99457559", "Content": "Stayed at the Marriott for 5 nights at the end February 2011 on my monthy business trip to Singapore.

I have also found the Marriott to be expensive. Sure, you can get good deals, but only some times. On top of your room cost, I found the breakfast at S$38 to be too expensive, especially for a business breakfast - $38 for some fruit, a bowl of cereal and a coffee??? The outside bar is also expensive - a couple of times I've been stung $80 for a 'pub meal' with a couple of beers - that's for one person. Heck, I'm grumbling way too much.

What made the whole trip even better was the attention my mum (who is disabled and in a wheelchair) received. The whole hotel is disabled friendly which is fantastic considering so many hotels are not. The rooms were beautiful. My sister and I shared a pretty standard room which had everything we needed. My parents were upgraded to a suite which had a small lounge area, 2 plasma TV's and a huge bathroom with Bulgari toiletries to match. The breakfast buffet was outstanding.

Plenty of attendants pouring drinks, clearing tables, talking to guests, putting out food- it was a real pleasure. However, the noise from the construction next door is very loud & as is the noise from a bar located near the hotel Note to Marriott corporate- The US Marriott's could learn a lot from this concierge lounge as they are generally poor in food quality & service in comparison. However, the rooms are smaller than normal due to the strange shape building. Also the hotel is 15 years old and needs an updating. The rugs definitely need to be replaced.

However, I think it was probably in line with other hotel restaurants in Singapore & Singapore is much more expensive than the rest of SE Asia. construction next door from new building going up- noise is constant so be sure & ask for rooms on the other side of the building like rooms ending in 09,11. We didn't hear noise from the building construction but rather from a bar outside the hotel where the noise traveled up & we were on the 16th floor! We were told the building construction would go on for another 2-3 years so beware!

How can it be described? I will do my best to describe it. Constant banging from 8:00 AM until 10:00 PM. (OK they stop for lunch and if it rains then they stop as well). I was on the 26th floor and the construction was 200 feet away. But let me take a step back. I checked in and was given a room on the 22nd floor. We came in the afternoon and as I am traveling with my toddler son he took a nap. I heard the banging but it was not bad this day. I have since learned that on days they are pouring cement the noise is tolerable. But the days they are laying the forms to pour the concrete the banging is horrible. Day one was a cement pouring day. Did I mention the bar. No the bar is not part of the Marriott. It is across the street. As it was a week day the band played until 2:00 AM. Since I was on the 22nd floor I could not believe that I could hear a band playing in a bar next door. More than this I could not believe this was tolerated by the Marriott and the residents of the hotels and residences nearby. Honestly I could hear the words to the songs. Creed, Bon Jovi,. If I were 10 years younger and single this would be great and I would head right down. But I am now married and have a toddler. My toddler woke up at 1:00 from the noise. I am not sure what kind of weird acoustics there are to the building but stay away from the band side. I met a woman staying in a suite on the top floor (30th) and she could hear the music. So I called the front desk at 1:30 and asked about the noise from the band and was informed that tonight was special because they only play until 2:00 AM. On Friday and Saturday they play until 4:00 AM. Can this be true in Singapore where you cannot Jaywalk? Since I found the thought of listening to music until 4:00 AM unimaginable, we switched rooms to face the construction and take our chances with the noise during the day. Breakfast buffet is great. But full or angry people who did not sleep the night before. Yeah, Yeah, great location blah blah blah, subway... I would suggest not staying here until the construction is completed and the Singapore government closes the bar next door. There are plenty of hotels to choose from in Singapore. If you must stay here, Listen closely. Best rooms will end in 12 -15. These face the intersection of Scotts and Orchard and the noise will be limited. If you don\u2019t mind noise from 10:00 PM - 4:00 AM take rooms 08-11. If you do not mind daytime noise until 10:00 PM but nothing until 8:00 AM take rooms 01-07 and above 15.

The hotel sits right in the middle of one of the largest shopping areas in Singapore \u2013 during the biggest sale of the year, of course. What that meant to us was that the people watching was wonderful. We\u2019d sit in the restaurant for breakfast and watch all kinds of people walk by. The other thing that really stood out was how easily Eastern and Western cultures, dress, languages and food blended in this city. No matter where you were in that spectrum, pretty much everything was accepted. Rooms Beds were very comfy and the temp was easy to control in the room. Room had 2 standard sized twin beds. Bottled water was provided in the room. Rooms and Bathrooms were nice, but small--largely due to the design of the building. Robes, slippers, safes, hair dryers and ironing boards were provided in the room. One note on the safe --- it was in the closet and didn\u2019t seem to be bolted down to anything\u2026.. Although we had no issue. In room coffee was ok, although like much of Asia was instant. 2-3 kinds of tea were also available. Not uncommon to have to wait for elevators at all times of the day based on how busy hotel is. Concierge Lounge We were given access to the Executive Lounge on the 27th Floor. Staff service there was wonderful, regardless of time of day. There were coffee, tea, sodas and water available from 6am to midnight. Daily modified continental breakfast was available M-F from 6-10am and 6-11 on weekends and holidays. In addition to a huge selection of breads, cereals and fruits, there were a couple of hot options available each day. Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was really good! Those with Lounge access had the option of taking breakfast in the restaurant as well. Complementary cocktails and hors d\u2019oeuvres were served from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. In some hotels, the evening snacks could serve as a substitute for dinner --- this was definitely one of those places! They had salads, sandwiches, hot items, fruits, cheeses, and desserts. Alcohol was available at other times, but was billed to the room. Desserts and fruits were served until 930 each evening. Free wi-fi, as well as a computer that you could use was also available in the lounge. The staff there was also able to take care of our checkout and offered great suggestions on what to do and how to get around. The lounge was fairly busy during both breakfast and happy hour. Breakfast in the Cafe Buffet breakfast in the caf\u00e9 was wonderful! You had the option of sitting indoors or out, and we thoroughly enjoyed the outdoor option. It gives you the opportunity watch the people as the locals are headed off to work. There was a fresh juice station, eggs to order, meats, veggies, local options, fruits, cheeses, cereals, yogurts and a waffle / pancake station with ice cream! Service was wonderful \u2013 both tableside and at the various stations around the buffet. I think this was our favorite breakfast experience the entire trip! Transportation From the hotel, you can access the subway stations very easily. Entrance is right next door. We found it easier to use the Singapore Airlines Hop-on, Hop-off bus to see the city. It\u2019s the perfect way to get around to most of the major areas, and if you are making multiple stops, it\u2019s definitely cheaper than cabs. Most of the hotels have brochures / maps and can tell you where the nearest stop is. There was a stop right outside the Marriott on Scott and Orchard Road. Cost was S$12 for adults or S$6 if you had a boarding pass from Singapore airlines. http://siahopon.asiaone.com.sg/ We used the airport shuttle to get to and from the airport for S$9 / person. http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/getting_around/transportation/airport_shuttle_service.html Also, the shuttle bus out to the night safari, zoo and bird park picks up from the Hyatt next door. Cost of S$4/person each way is cheaper than a cab (depending on number in your party). http://www.bushub.com.sg/additionalContent.asp?ContentID={B8D39D23-A308-4025-8134-CFB5FBFD3D2E} Hotel provided information on all of these. Area There are lots of big malls, little restaurants, pubs, 7-11, drugstores, bookstores, etc. within walking distance. You should be able to find what you want fairly easily without paying hotel prices. On the weekend, it is a popular area with the locals and can be fairly crowded. It\u2019s a great place to people watch. Service Overall, service was top notch. Everyone you saw spoke to you and was very friendly. We were always greeted with a smile. English was VERY common in the hotel. Housekeeping was great, and kept us stocked with bottled water. Room was serviced twice a day. Concierge staff was wonderful. Restaurant staff was fun, friendly and efficient. The front desk staff walked us to our room. Even if a request had to be handed off between staff members at shift change, it was always addressed \u2013 nothing was ever dropped. Pool We took some time to enjoy the rooftop pool at the hotel and it was wonderful! One of the oddest parts was realizing that you were on the roof, several floors above the street, and when you look out across the pool umbrellas, you see more skyscrapers! Pool is a pretty blue tile, and like all tile, can be a little slippery when you are in it. There are some fun lounge areas across the back of the pool area, in addition to the regular lounge chairs. It\u2019s an incredibly tranquil place! Hotel was a great choice. It\u2019s very much at the center of the shopping area, and the pagoda design makes it easily identifiable regardless of where you are. I\u2019d definitely go back when in the area.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Bar One in Basement\u201d", "Author": "pnmehta", "ReviewID": "UR31821655", "Content": "The Singapore Marriott is not a new experience for me or my family.

The airport is about a 20-25 min drive from the hotel.

As a Platinum member I received a nice room on the 25th floor, near the Elevator and below the \u201cConcierge Lounge\u201d. The King bedded was functional for two. There was a Flat panel TV and a separate shower/bath. Upon check in I received a choice of Platinum gifts of which I selected chicken and Beef Malaysian Satay with peanut sauce and a bottle of wine which were delivered to my room free of charge. I also had lounge access (which has free wireless). Two bottles of water per day were provided and we used the Mini-bar fridge to store them. There is a safe in the room. The wireless would have cost $25.00 per day but as our room was near the lounge I was able to piggyback onto the free wireless and not have to go to the lounge every time I wanted to surf the web. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Again Being a Platinum member my girlfriend and I received a free breakfast Buffet each day. I believe the list price was about $25 per person. A great deal as the buffet is loaded thus we did not go hungry on our stay. Though there may be better- it reminded me of a Sunday brunch at some US hotels- and for the price it was an excellent. The Lounge also had drinks, bottles of water, juice, and soft drinks. There was a continental breakfast, snacks in the afternoon, and desserts in the evenings- all complementary for Platinum and Executive level service guests. The location was fairly quiet and was directly on Orchard road which is a high volume Shopping area with shops ranging from good value to out of my price range. The MRT station is directly below and one of the reasons we moved from the Holiday Inn Atrium was more access to MRT with less walking and taxis. Lucky Plaza was a mall very near the Hotel and it had very nice and cheap shops for trinkets such as souvenirs and bags, phones, and cameras. However it is not Simlim Plaza. Overall we enjoyed it, especially the free piggybacked internet and the free breakfast buffet. Though I would not pay the price they ask which at the time we were there was about $350-460 per night using points it was well worth it and we will be back there for 5 nights in September, again on points, and again requesting a room near the lounge so I can get the free internet. A note as other reviewers have commented on\u2026There is a large construction project going on and even on the 24th floor we heard it daily even on Saturday.

I was dog-tired and a little cranky, but the bellman and check-in clerk changed my feelings 180 degrees. They greeted me like I was long-lost family coming home. Singaporans are famous for their friendly nature, but over four days, the Marriott staff exceeded my expectations with their attentiveness, courtesy, and a willingness to go the extra mile to make sure I had what I needed during my stay. It didn't matter that I was using a Marriott Rewards certificate for my room. They treated me first-class the whole way. About 20-25 minutes from the airport (SGD30-40 taxi fare), this hotel is well located on Orchard Road with plenty of shopping opportunities within a few steps. The Orchard Road MRT (subway) station is down any one of several escalators on the property, too, so the entire cosmopolitan city is wthin easy reach. Whether you long for exploring Little India, a stroll along the Esplanade, or a quick bite in Newton, you can get there in just a few minutes from the Singapore Marriott. The cuisine is excellent, and Crossroads outside is a wonderful place to people-watch and sip a cool drink. The Executive Lounge is very comfortable and large, but it is also very popular in the evenings. Two out of three nights I was unable to find a seat during evening cocktails. Breakfast times were also very crowded. While the lobby, Executive Lounge, and other areas were fine, it was apparent the hotel is in need of some refurbishment. Stains on the carpet, worn paint in the hallways, and dated decorations in my guest room suggest it was top-notch, but time has taken its toll. Indeed, Marriott rates it as a Category 6 hotel, just as the JW Marriott in Hong Kong is, but there is simply no comparison. I don't mean to suggest the Singapore Marriott is a poor property. It really is quite good, but some TLC and a bit of money for updates and minor repairs would bring the facilities up to snuff. I can recommend the Singapore Marriott for both tourists and business travelers.

We chose Marriot simply because I am a member of their reward program. The hotel is at a superb location, right in the center of the Orchard Road commercial area. It is convenient. The subway, MRT, is within walking distance through the basement of the hotel. The rooms are smaller than many other Marriot hotels because of the polygon shape of the building. Generally speaking, the hotel staff was friendly and well trained as they are seen elsewhere in the world. Only a few problems occured: First, during our stay, for two nights in a row at about the same time around 10:30pm, a fire alarm went off and an in-room loudspeaker started talking announcing that the hotel was checking the cause of the alarm. A few minutes later, the loudspeaker declared that it was a false alarm. Second, from the third day of our stay, I noticed a wet spot in the corner of the room near the bed. I first thought probably the kids dripped some water on the carpet and didn't pay much attention. However, the spot became larger and wetter. Then I figured some pipe must be leaking underneath the carpet. I called the front desk and they changed my room immediately. On the night we moved to the new room, we opened the roll-away sofabed but the kids said it was uncomfortable to sleep in it. I checked and found the mattress was upside down. I turned the mattress over and guess what I found? A big spot of stain. Other than these, those men in black (security? customer service?) in the lobby seem to be very unfamiliar with the local area. I once asked them the location of Orchard Shopping Center which was three blocks away from the hotel, but they gave me the totally opposite directions. Besides, while wireless internet access is available from the first to fifth floor, they charge an obscenely unreasonable price for internet access in guest rooms for both wired and wireless connections.

The location is fantastic for shopping and restaurants and the subway is very close. The rooms are large and stylishly decorated with panorama view windows stretching all the way across the room. Beds are very comfy with all the new Marriott bedding. The pool area is great with big cushy sun beds and umbrellas. There was a large shallow pool area separate from the main pool. Perfect for small children or for laying in to cool off and still catch some sun. I would recommend adding the executive lounge to your package. The staff treats you like family, and we were warmly greeted by name after our first visit. We were served drinks as if we were in a paying establishment. Staff would stop by and chat and ask about our day. The breakfast and evening buffets were plentiful and satisfying enough that we ate there several days and ended up spending nothing for food or drinks. For breakfast there were fresh salmon and bagels, eggs, sausages, pastries, muffins, dim sum, a wide selection of fresh fruits and condiments and crudit\u00e9s. Fresh juices and hot coffee. You also have the option of eating in the indoor/ outdoor buffet for breakfast if you have executive club privileges. Just don't order a mimosa... S25.00 for one! The dinner spreads were equally nice with dim sums, teriyaki chicken, spinach salad with ALL the fixings, quiches, satay, egg rolls~ just fabulous! A nice variety that changed every evening. We would go in for evening cocktails and end up eating so much that we did not need dinner. Top shelf liquors and very nice wines. You could literally eat at the Executive Lounge and not spend any additional money for food for your entire stay. We did eat out several evenings, however, you could easily survive nicely on what is served there. Our concierge Shelly was AMAZING! She went WAAAY above and beyond the call of duty. All of the staff at this hotel is very service oriented and I just have to mention an unusual circumstance. I became worried about a guest traveling with me. He had open heart surgery in August and I got worried as he was complaining of dizziness, heartburn, and his color just did not look right. Shelly made an appointment for me to take him to a specialist, just to be safe. She sent up directions and even had an employee walk us to the best way to exit and point out the hospital to us. She then extended our check out to 5 pm; when we were not back at the expected time she extended it AGAIN until 6 pm AND arranged for us to have executive lounge privileges again that evening after our ordeal. She remembered that we were moving to The Fullerton Hotel for the remainder of our stay. She called us there to inquire if everything went okay as she had gone home before we got back to the hotel! We also left a computer bag with cell phone and various items in the inside/ outside dining area downstairs. They found the computer and delivered it to us at The Fullerton within the hour. Unbelievable! I did agree to offer an unbiased review, so I have to mention that there is construction going on currently right next to the hotel, and you do hear it though it isn't very intrusive or overbearing. If the rest of the hotel had not been so comfortable and the staff so friendly, I may have been a bit aggravated about it. As nice as The Fullerton Hotel is, I must say that I missed The Marriott Orchard after we moved. The lounge is better and they make you feel as if you are a truly valued guest there.

The bed was exceptionally comfortable (one of the new marriott revive beds) and the facilities in the room included a huge flatscreen television. I would recommend a room on one of the higher floors for a great city view.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Lots of Issues\u201d", "Author": "globaltravelbuff", "ReviewID": "UR8754733", "Content": "I stayed at the Singapore Marriott during a recent business trip to Singapore. The hotel is well situated, in the midst of the main shopping district in Singapore. The hotel has a relatively spacious lobby, a good business center, and well-appointed rooms. Unfortunately, there were several problems that will ensure that I dont stay there again. First of all, my colleagues and I went for some drinks to the bar/club in the basement. While sipping our drinks and munching on appetizers, we saw cockroaches coming out from the walls. Also, on Friday/Saturday nights, the hotel's bars become quite crowded and busy, and hence take away from the serene, business hotel atmosphere of the rest of the week (as I noticed during my 4 day stay, the crowds can get rowdy very quickly...). The biggest issue I had surrounded an electrical problem in my room. Supposedly, my entire floor lost electricity as a result of a short circuit in my room. The hotel discovered this at 9AM on a Sunday morning and called my room to ask when they could get access for an electrician to check out the problem. I offered access in an hours time, and the electrician showed up in 5 minutes! To make matters worse, he spent over 2 hours in my bathroom attempting to fix the problem. During that time, neither the electrician nor the hotel's customer service dept bothered to ask if they were inconveniencing me in any way. Having stayed at many 5 star hotels in Asia, I was surprised not to receive an apology (at the least) for interrupting my sleep on a Sunday AM, and that too, taking over my bathroom for 2 hours. In all, the Marriott is a good hotel if the other hotels in Singapore are sold out.", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo, Japan", "Title": "\u201cGood choice in convenient locatoin\u201d", "Author": "jamesjustin", "ReviewID": "UR8716540", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights during my first trip to Singapore.

If it is your first time to Singapore beware that taxis are difficult to pickup in the evening. During the day taxis are plentiful but at night the taxi lines get long and it is almost impossible to pick one up on the street. It seems most people keep the number of their favorite taxi and call directly when they need transportation.

For location, this hotel just cannot be beat. It is right on Orchard Road where all the big-name shopping is. It is also right next to the Orchard Road LRT Station which makes it extremely convenient to travel around the city. The hotel is beautfully designed and the staff are extremely friendly. I would advise against eating at the hotel however, since prices are steep, as is typical for any hotel. Also, given the numerous cheap, delicious and might I add clean places to eat around the hotel, why eat in the hotel? During our stay, we found several stalls outside the hotel that sold mooncakes, curry puffs, and Singapore beef jerky (nothing like the dry tough version in North America...you've got to try it!!), , as well as food courts in the surrounding malls (some were open early enough for breakfast!) We used the gym facilities several times and found it well-equipped with cardio and weight equipment. There is also an outdoor basketball court. The one negative comment I have about the hotel is the cleanliness of the bedding. Maybe due to the extreme heat and humidity of the country (or just our sheer bad luck), I found the pillows reeked of sweat. I'm not kidding. We requested new pillows (since just changing the pillow cases was not enough) which rectified the problem. However, this was not a pleasant discovery, and really suprised us given the fact that this is a quality hotel.

I asked the desk clerk what were my options since I had a 11pm flight and wanted to shower after the work day. He said I could pay 1/2 a day rate and keep the room until 6pm (which didn't make sense to me since I wanted it to shower and wouldn't get back by 6pm?) Or I could simply check out and they would lock up my luggage. I could shower later at the facilities at the pool or the gym. I decieded to get a gym locker and when I returned for the day cleaned up. Both facilities had showers but I noticed the gym had loads of towels and hair dryers.

I love it and here's why: 1. The location. When I book a hotel room in a major city, my top priority is to be right on top of a subway entrance. If I'm only in town for a few days, I don't want to waste a couple hours each day on walking from hotel to the subway/train terminals. The Marriott is right on top of the Orchard exit, right smack in the middle of all the Orchard Street excitement. You simply couldn't ask for a better location in Singapore. 2. The service is fantastic. I've found everyone from the desk clerks to the bellmen to the fitness club employees to be intensely focused on delivering excellent service. 3. It has an excellent fitness club that is attached to the spa facility. After working out, you can walk across the hall to the spa area to take a shower, sit in the hot tub, sauna, steam room, and a full variety of toiletries. There is some construction going on next door, so the noise is very bad for rooms ending with 06, 07, 08., 09, and 10. The best rooms to get are 12. 13, 14, and 15. The rooms ending with 15, by the way, seem to have the best views down Orchard Street.
