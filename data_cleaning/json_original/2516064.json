She had tickets to the Ellen DeGeneres which was the main reason for our trip. We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel - The Hotel of Hollywood, which was booked through Expedia at a really good rate (128.03 taxes in per night). We neglected to rent a car since the hotel was located near the Santa Monica & Vermont station - a two minute walk - if that. $5 will get you an all day pass, $1.50 to ride the bus, per stop. We checked in on April 4th around 4:30-5ish. The staff at the front desk were nice. We were given the keys to our room and at first glance, I was a little disappointment (can't speak for my friend) at the room. It was definitely dated (wall paper, old fashion curtions etc). When viewing the washroom, we noticed a facecloth (used?) handing on the shower head, and the tv desk looked dirty. There was also no safe in our room, which upon reading previous reviews knew this was the case, however read that you could request a room with a safe. We called down to \"complain\" about the dirty facecloth and to inquire about changing to a room that had a safe. The front desk staff apologized for the facecloth and said someone would come up to remove it. I thought, lovely, so, no new room :( Then they called back to say we would be switching rooms. Our initial room was on the 2nd floor, facing the side street off of North Vermont. The room we switched too was 318, same side of the hotel, same dated room, but cleaner, no safe. Ah well, can't have it all. This room was cleaner, again, dated but for the amount of time you spend in the room, who cares really. The bathroom (in both rooms) looked ok, I mean, it's not the Hilton people. I did notice that there was a vent in the shower...kind of a weird spot to have the vent. In all, we had a good nights sleep, we had hot water, the room was always cleaned upon our arrival back to the hotel in the evenings. No bed bugs to report either - phew! There is no room service at this hotel but you get a free daily breakfast which is awesome. The dining area is located on R1. (This hotel also has an elevator, which in past reviews people posted there was no elevator). Breakfast consisted of mini sausages (awesome), omeletes with numerous veggies to choose from (tomatoe, peppers, mushrooms, onion, ham, cheese, spinach etc.), home made waffles, cereal, croissants, toast, fruit, tea, coffee, juice, milk. The ladies there are great, so, please tip them well :) We ate in the dining area so can't write about staff telling us off for leaving with food. The hotel also has a computer in the main lobby, which is slow. It also sports a pool (didn't check it out but seen a sign), spa (again, didn't check it out but seen the sign). For us being in the city for the first time, we have nothing to compare our experience too. All we can say is that we enjoyed our stay, the staff were friendly and very helpful. We had our days planned out with the exception of our last day, Saturday, and we were wondering what would be best way to get to Santa Monica beach. The guy behind the front desk (he wore glasses, didn't catch his name) told us what number bus to take, where to catch it, how much it would cost, where to get the ticket. It saved us a lot of money - from having to cab it. They also called cabs ahead of time for us for when we had dinner reservations or tours. Can't ask for any better really. We didn't encounter any rude staff, they were all very helpful which made our stay even better. The hotel is out of the way in the event you want to go to Beverly Hills, Santa Monica beach, Venice Beach, but as I mentioned above, is close to a bus station (the ride to Santa Monica Beach from the Santa Monica/vermont bus station took 1 hr, we took the rapid bus), and is close to Hollywood Blvd which is where you'll catch the Kodak Theatre, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Grauman's Chinese Theatre. If I decide to back to LA, I could see myself staying at this hotel again, just because I would be familiar with the area, but I would also check our other hotels that would be more \"central\"...but not because I didn't enjoy my stay. Oh, we didn't venture the streets at night, we did wonder across the street to a convienence store and for 2 girls who live in a smaller city compared to LA, that was about all we could handle ;)", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cWorst ever\u201d", "Author": "Maria D", "ReviewID": "UR127940835", "Content": "Was the first time we stayed there.

We had a late check-in - 11.45pm and had been travelling for almost 24 hours when we arrived at this hotel to be greeted by an indifferent receptionist who checked us into a smaller room that we had booked. We were too tired to object and decided to rectify the error in the morning as we had booked to stay for 3 nights. The room, 117 was small, dingy and dark, with a dirty bathroom. Reluctantly they gave us another room 256, which was larger however the loo flooded the bathroom. Only after we insisted to be moved were we given another room - 111 which was of the same ilk as 117. At 11.30pm that night the door opened and two people started to enter the room - the reception had given door keys to some other guests. The phone rang whereupon the receptionist demanded to know why we were in the room. The following morning we went to reception to say that we no longer wished to stay at the hotel and wanted to speak to the manager as we were appalled with the service and did not want to pay for the lack of service we received. The manager wasn't available and we were told he would contact us at the hotel we were moving to. He did not call, however eventually we did get an email offering a reduction in the payment for our stay, which we accepted, on the understanding that we would not make any further claims.

It's lengthy, but will tell you everything you need to know if you are considering staying here. We stayed for four nights at the Hollywood Hotel. Upon checking in, I was told there would be a $100 authorization on my credit card and that I would be paying for the room once we checked out. Not only did they authorize that fee, they also authorized the full booked stay and the parking, which was 20 bucks a night. To be honest, I prefer to be charged in the beginning of the stay so I don't have to worry about it later, but I also prefer to be told this. Communication was not the best in this situation. The second and third day, we had no hot water and the elevators were not working. This was due to the generator breaking down. We had to take a warm bath using an ice bucket full of microwaved water. Understandable, because things happen. However, we also came back to our room to find an entire shopping bag full of food gone. I would have given the cleaning staff the benefit of the doubt on this one thinking that it could have been trash, except the bag weighed a good ten pounds or so. So, at this point, we had no hot water, had to walk the stairs everytime we went outside, stolen food, and bad communication at the front desk. Then, I log onto my bank account to see an unauthorized hold on my account from the hotel. They couldn't exactly tell me what it was for. Ahh. So, with everything going on, we asked what the hotel was going to do to compensate us for the inconveniences that were adding up. They offered to take parking off for one night. We eventually got them to take it off for the entire stay, so that was nice. Though, it only ended up being for our first three nights instead of the agreed full stay. On Sunday, the breakers in our room kept blowing and maintenance had to come three times to try and fix them. We only had one working plug that night which we used for the space heater. That meant none of us could charge our phones. We couldn't make coffee or use the microwave. Also, the parking gate was broken, so our cars were not that secure. For us, this wasn't the worst stay ever, but it was the worst one we have paid $140 bucks for, hands down. Our last night we went two blocks up to the Travelodge. It's not as pretty on the outside, but everything worked and everyone was nice and friendly. I do want to be fair and give this hotel props for what they do right. The beds are extremely comfy and have thick, down comforters on them. Best bed I've ever slept on in a hotel. The breakfast is awesome and there is a wide variety of foods to pick from. Waffles and omelets are made in the spot! The location isn't as good as it could be for the same price as something closer to the attractions but it certainly is NOT the ghetto. At all, not even close. I never felt in danger during my stay here. In conclusion, will I stay here again? No, not likely. Had we been compensated more, perhaps. But we weren't and nothing worked. We were on vacation and had to deal with everything being broken when all we wanted to do was enjoy ourselves. I will say that I don't think my stay was a good representation of the hotel because these things do happen sometimes. However, the way in which the staff handled our inconvenience was not appropriate nor helpful. It's a nice hotel and would've loved to come back but there are other hotels out there just as good that are cheaper and friendlier.

We arrived to our first trip to LA so excited to have the worst customer service at the reception desk by a very rude man who was most unhelpful and full of attitude. The pictures show you the back of the hotel the front is a dive and very poor the room was absolutely frozen in the evenings. We had a blocked toilet and they have no maintenance team i was aksed to use a plunger and fix the toilet myself! As for breakfast you are better off at mc donalds! They have no choice and 1 lady who cookes the eggs for you leaving you in a queue for almost 30 mins every morning and you are not allowed to have more then 1 serving of eggs! Be warned these are not real 100% eggs when i asked if i could have a fresh eggs cracked i was told the liquid they have in the bottles are eggs but i saw the lady go to the kitchen to refil the jar and she opened the refidgerator and poured out som liquid from a carton and mixed something else in it what on earth were we eating! then the only other option is toast. the rooms are so dated and need work, the bedding was dirty with stains on the sheets and they are most reluctant to help you. you are charged to park at the hotel so even if your deal states free parking as did mine which i showed them clearly in black and white i was told i had to pay the daily rate of $18 per night plus tax. I have never met such rude front desk staff and the only time i saw the lady at the front desk (looked spanish or even philipino) smile was on my checkout when she was busy flirting with a wealthy male customer discussing cars so another lady served me instead that i had not seen in my whole weeks there and she was acutally the only member of staff who was helpful and understood what customer service was. the only one good thing i have to say is that it is very well located and we spent all our days out of the hotel to avoid being in such a small dingy stuffy dirty place. this hotel should be 1* and shut down!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here.\u201d", "Author": "j3an7", "ReviewID": "UR125065938", "Content": "The Hollywood Hotel is nothing like the pictures they have posted on Priceline or their own website. The only thing that looked the same was the fountain, but that was a disappointment because you can't even see the fountain from the front. The fountain is actually located in the back of the hotel, in the parking lot. I booked the hotel for a total of four people. When I checked in, I was told they were going to charge me $30 for the extra two people because when I booked the room through Priceline, I supposedly only reserved the room for 2. The man checking me in told me that it was okay that I had four people but then only two of us would be able to have breakfast the next morning. So anyway since the breakfast was already included in the room price, two out of the four of us went downstairs for breakfast the next day. A lot of people who have reviewed this hotel gave great reviews about their breakfast, but truthfully, it wasn't all that. BEWARE OF THE OMELETTE LINE! They have one person who makes one omelette at a time. We ended up waiting 20 minutes for one omelette. As for the room, it was picture perfect, up until I really tried to get comfortable. The bed was hard, had me tossing and turning all night. The sheets were white and made the room look clean but once I got onto the bed, I noticed there were strands of black curly hair all over and surely they weren't ours as we do not have curly hair. The room was very hot during the night time. The air vent/fan did not circulate enough air at all. We couldn't even leave the sliding door open because of the \"shared balcony\" and the fact that there wasn't even a screen to the sliding door. The hotel provided shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, and even a shower cap. The bathroom was okay, until I got into the shower.

The only downside was that Sunday morning they only had one person making the eggs and omelets so it took awhile. The room was a good size and the beds were really comfortable. The bathroom was adequate, but it was a little annoying having the hold down the button on the blow dryer, I suggest bringing your own. The outlets in the room were really loose; I had to watch carefully when I was curling my hair because it kept coming unplugged. It was nice that we were able to park our cars behind secure gates, but my only major complaint was that we had to pay $18 a night for each car. Just FYI, when you check in they have you write down the names of all the people that are staying in the room and use this information for the complimentary breakfast.

In all areas and/or department of the hotel. One staff member, in particular, stands out a bit more. The front desk girl, Gisel. She is always friendly, smiling and I was bolstered at the fact that she remembered my name. Great smile, we exchanged some laughs and as always, friendly. I told her I wanted to treat myself to Boiling Crab and she immediately told me of a place up in Hollywood and Normandie that I was unaware of; The Boiling Shrimp. She explained the difference, other than the name of course, was the waiting factor and also the commute. I never knew there was such a place near by. Anywho, I settled in, relaxed a little on my comfy bed and set my way off to eat. Glad I went and glad it was recommended. The next day I enjoyed myself some complimentary breakfast and went out for a walk. As I returned to my room I ran into the charismatic Gisel again and she inquired about my stay and also my dinner. I told her about it then she began telling me of other places in the vicinity to go eat at. Being a food blogger myself, I was impressed by her knowledge of decent dining spots I myself have also enjoyed. I went back to my room to an already made bed for me to crash out in and enjoyed the rest of my weekend stay. As I was checking out, the staff, once again, friendly, inquired about my stay and invited me to stay once again. :-) This place is highly recommended on my end.

The woman that assisted us wasn't overly friendly & not a lot of smiles from day staff at all. In fact when questioning them about directions we weren't even offered a map! The evening staff appeared friendlier and would greet us as passing through the lobby. We got to the room and were pleasantly surprised. Whilst being small, it was very clean with a super comfortable bed. Unfortunately there was no in room safe but they do have deposit boxes at the front desk. There is a book with information on local restaurants but nothing on what services are available here such as laundry etc. Our room was on Vermont road side & hence quite noisy with a lot of traffic. I think a room on the courtyard side would have been better. This is why I rated it as a 3, and lack of size. Cleaning service is done everyday and without fault. Hopefully the cleaners are made aware of the great jobs they are doing. I rated service as 4 due to the cleaning staff only & not front desk. They do offer free wi fi which is super easy to connect to & fast. They also offer a complimentary breakfast which is totally adequate. Bagels, juice, cereal, toast, eggs, yoghurt & some fruit. Perfect way to kick off your day. Now as I mentioned earlier the neighborhood is less desirable. However, it's only minutes away from Hollywood Blvd, Walk of Fame etc. All you do is just jump on the subway a block down for $1.50 or buy a day pass for $5.00. There doesn't appear to be many great choices for dining out however we did find a cute 50s diner a few blocks down. Plus there was a pharmacist/mini mart just around the corner. However just due to our safety feeling compromised I rated it as a 3. A little bit of extra goes a long way. Plus I want to be able to walk out the front door, amble down the street & find places to eat.

The reviews on line for Hollwood Hotel were great but once we arrived we were all incredibly disappointed with the experience we had there. Our company faxed over credit card info the day we landed. The hotel manager emailed our office production/manger confirmation showing payment the same day However when we checked in 9PM that night the front desk receptionist Devon said there was no payment on file there. Our office/production manager back in NY tried to speak with Devon through my cell phone (1AM NY time) but Devon said it was against company policy to talk on a customers cell. She then called him direct. He said there was nothing he could do. The manager was out. I offered to put down my credit card just to get the talent checked in since they were beyond exhausted from thier 6AM flight from NYC. One of the crew offered to put the rest of the crew on his credit card and Devon didn't like his tone and accused him of being \"belligerent.\" I was there the whole time and while our crew member was exhausted he did not curse, call names or yell at Devon. He was impatient but that was it and Devon said he was uncomfortable and refused to check us in because the crew guy was \"belligerent.\" He called the manager and got him on the phone and said that we were accusing him of sabotaging our travel plans! THAT WAS NEVER SAID. Then because he was uncomfortable he asked permission by the manager to make us wait for another person to check in. I then offered to deal with Devon and he refused saying that he was \"done with us.\" The hotel manager NEVER called our office person back and one week later we are still trying to get in touch with him!!!!!!! Long story short Devon refused to check us in and the manager approved that. Rather than be subjected to more rude treatment, our office manager made reservations within minutes at the nearby Wilshire Hotel where we were well received. I was billed for the one hour our talent were in their rooms at the Hollywood Hotel which I am still contesting. I used to be in the hotel business and I understand that not everyone is going to be a happy customer. But regardless of any cranky customers, it is your job as a concierge or receptionist to give them great service regardless. We were treated horribly and denied service for OUR \"rude\" behavior. Glad to be rid of the place and give someone else our business. While I was surprised to receive bad service from the receptionist, I was more so dismayed to get it from the manager of this hotel. I would expect better treatment from someone doing business in an area with heavy production crew traffic.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malm\u00f6, Skane Lan, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, very friendly and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "Henrik L", "ReviewID": "UR119384442", "Content": "We stayed here 9 nights, and it was a pleasure.

The hotel is pretty nice inside with a private fenced parking lot that made me feel pretty secure leaving my car there although they do charge for parking you want to note (I believe $18 a night). The suite we stayed in was fairly large with a mini kitchen, desk, couch. Some of the items in the room are up to date (TV's, refrigerator, desks) but other things like the carpet and AC system seemed a bit outdated. I am not a very picky person when it comes to staying places so I was happy with my room, but if you\u2019re looking for something lavish and lush you might want to look around more. You also share a balcony with the room next to you. You get free Wifi which is nice and a free breakfast every morning with a variety of foods. Nothing special but enough to mix it up for a few days. My negative experience came with a situation where the night we checked in. Coming in off a redeye flight, my girlfriend and I were anxious to say the least to get to our room. Upon arrival we checked into our suite around 1:30 am. The sink was dripping pretty bad which made it hard to sleep. Looking further into the sink, water was dripping pretty bad all over the place. We needed to get buckets to save the wood from any damage. I called Mike who worked the desk (a extremely nice guy much like almost all the staff) who did as much as he could to help us. The issue could not be fixed until the morning due to no maintenance man. We were able to stop the drip almost fully but still had to empty a few buckets over the night. Like I stated before Im not too picky, but this was obv something I wished to be accommodated somehow for since I was saving the hotel from pretty bad water damage. To make a long story short the manager Roman (refraining from putting a side comment...) basically dodged me for a week of my stay after emails and messages sent. I contacted him 3 times until the day I left I had to just go to his office. When sitting down he said what can I do for you\u2026 I asked him if he got my email (which was very detailed) and he told me he did. I reiterated to Roman that I simply wished for the hotel to waive my parking for my stay and I would have been happy for my troubles. He told me he would waive 2 nights parking and rushed me out his office to tell me that\u2019s all he could do after talking to the GM. Roman was very unfriendly and didn\u2019t apologize once for anything. I decided to talk to the GM since ol Roman really wasn\u2019t doing his job. I spoke with Jeff Zarrinnam who was a very nice guy and did the job Roman was unable to do. He accommodated me in every way and resolved a sticky situation that shouldn\u2019t have even gotten to that point.

I usually book on my own but when I saw the number listed, thinking it was the hotel, I called. I was not told that I called Hotels.com, but as soon as they asked for a credit card payment, I knew I called the wrong people. Nevertheless I prepaid for the room. My husband had an emergency job in L.A. and we needed a room the very next day. I saw that there were no cancellation fees through Hotel.com but that the hotel would charge a one night penalty if I cancelled. The cancellation time was 4 P.M. on the day that I made the reservation, even though I made it 3 hours later. I was emailed this information after I booked. No big, I wasn't planning on canceling. We have been working in L.A. for quite some time now, traveling from the desert, but the other hotels we usually stay at were booked. It was \"Emmy\" weekend. We thought we'd try this one and if we liked it we might stay again the following week. After all, they offered a breakfast buffet. Upon arrival I pulled off of the busy street in front of the parking area just to get a glimpse of the hotel without slowing traffic.. I was quickly, and angrily I might add, directed by the parking attendant to the lobby area. I mouthed the word \"sorry\" to her and pulled up to the lobby as my kids, ages 15 and 16 stated \"geeze mom, you made her mad! And you didn't even do anything!\" I Received a call from my husband at that time and he stated that we needed one less day so go ahead and let the hotel know when you check in later. I told him we prepaid but hopefully there wouldn't be a problem getting that last night back. We still had a few hours before check-in so I told him I would ask them now since I was already there. I walked up to the front desk and kindly asked the gentleman there if it was at all possible to stay one less night. I had already booked and was not canceling, just checking to see if it was possible. He stated that it depended, did I book through them or online. I said online, but that it was through hotels.com and they didn't have a change or cancellation policy. I understood that the hotel had a one night cancellation policy but that I wasn't canceling, just changing. He stated that I could change but that that I would still have to pay for the night. There would be no refund. He also told me it was the online service's policy and not the hotel's. If I had a problem with that, it was, in his words: \"too bad, you should have booked through us and not online. Expedia is the problem\". I explained that it wasn't Expedia but hotels.com as previously stated. He said it didn't matter. \"take it up with them\". I called Hotels.com immediately and they stated that they would call the hotel. It was the hotel's policy to charge a one night cancellation fee but that a change fee was not mentioned. It was not their policy but the hotel's. She put me on hold, made the call, and then apologized but the manager said \"No. No refunds.\" Ok no big, it was my fault, I called the wrong # and went through with the reservation anyway. I couldn't believe they wouldn't help me but oh well. We would just stay another night and enjoy some more sights around the city with my husband this time, instead of on our own while he was working.. And we would not stay there again. Upon check-in I was informed that there was a $20 parking fee. I was upset that it was not mentioned when I called but Ok I would pay it. I told them that I had requested a queen size rollaway as the person I booked with said there were not any queen beds left but that if I got a king room the hotel would provide a queen rollaway. I asked him if there was a charge, he said \"no Ma'am\". I said, \"Oh because there are no queen beds left\"? He said he wasn't sure why but that there was no charge. Great! So I asked the woman at the front desk if the rollaway was requested and still available. She said yes. So I said, \"No charge, correct?\" She said \"$30 a night\". I said I was told there was no charge over the phone with Hotels.com. She stated that I \"should have read the agreement better, Expedia clearly states it on their website.\" I stated, yet again, that it was Hotels.com and I called them, I didn't book online. They said no charge. She told me they were wrong. And that I needed to calm down. She acted like I was being irate..:0 it felt like I was in an Adam Sandler movie. I asked to please see a manager. The manager came out and immediately smirked at me. I am a tall white female, decent looking, decent clothes, decent car outside, clearly native Californian. There was not one person in sight who did not have an accent. Was this the reason? Was I being discriminated against for being white? I couldn't find another reason as I was clearly not a rude person. And I was not unkind to the woman employee but merely asked to speak with a manager to talk about this.. The manager had a Russian or Ukranian accent. I dismissed his smirk as though I hadn't seen it, smiled, and, very nicely and calmly, told him exactly what had happened from the start, about the penalty I was unaware of and now these hidden fees..I said it \"just wasn't fair what was happening and I was starting to feel like there were going to be a lot more hidden fees. Is there something that can be done? I mean, I asked the online web service twice if there were any other charges and they said no. It is just starting to get very uncomfortable and I hadn't even checked in yet before your staff started being rude to me, starting with your employee, Nelson, this morning, telling me that I shouldn't have used an online service anyway. I thought you liked the business from these companies.\" He started very condescendingly with asking what my last name is, smirking again, typing on the computer and then stating \"excuse me, (I swear, like I was a dumb blonde) I see you have 4 guests staying in your room but you thought it would be Ok to book a king room? ...Really?\" NOW I started getting upset. \"So you are insulting my intelligence now, after I just explained to you what was stated to me over the phone, expecting a little understanding, now I'm stupid I should have known better.\" His response, \"I didn't say you were stupid, just making an observation.\" I told him, \"I cannot believe this. I have stayed in hotels all over the world. All different kinds. I have never in my life been treated so rude. Is this how all of your customers are treated?\" I told him to forget it, I wasn't staying here. It was obviously only going to get worse. I couldn't believe it. He immediately said he would cancel for me and to \"have a nice day\". Ugh I just want anyone who is thinking of booking at this hotel to know how they are. I would have liked to read a situation like this for myself, then I would have shopped around a little better. If you are planning on staying at this hotel, book directly with them, and ask about fees. And be warned, the hotel may seem decent, if you don't look at the stains on the couch in the lobby or water stains all over the ceiling, but the staff are very rude. At least at the front desk. And in the parking area.. The location is not actually right in Hollywood but closer to Los Feliz area and not the nice part.. The area is not the greatest although the outside of the hotel is well maintained and clean. And if you plan on spending time in Hollywood, you will have to drive a little. It is not within walking distance. Unless you are OK with walking a few miles. The eateries around there seem cute, there is a 50's diner and some other family places but I wouldn't advise being out walking at night. At least not around there.

Interested to find the HQ of the Church of Scientology just around the corner. This hotel was really good value for money and I would certainly stay there again. Only downside was that our keycard kept failing and we had to keep going to reception to get it recharged. This would have been very irritating had we been staying longer. Also- watch out for the taxi drivers- they try to steal each others custom-we paid the deposit at the hotel for one taxi firm and another turned up pretending to be them-when we got to the airport they claimed we hadn't paid the deposit at the hotel-so we ended up paying twice.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlothian, Virginia", "Title": "\u201ci loved it and well be back\u201d", "Author": "KID1686", "ReviewID": "UR116121748", "Content": "gisel heinandez at the front dest was amazing. i cant any more about than she was so help nice", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silicon Valley, CA", "Title": "\u201cWell appointed in convenient location\u201d", "Author": "20_times_ATW", "ReviewID": "UR116111439", "Content": "This hotel is a well appointed hotel that seems out of place in its surroundings.

One thing we have noticed is that the staff has very little turnover from year to year...always a good sign for any business. The breakfast in the dining room downstairs is consistently good--about the same thing every day, but enough choices to satisfy any reasonable person. The eggs look a little strange(they look more like pancakes..we checked the ingredients..looked okay to us) but are tasty' They have added fresh fruit since the first year we stayed there and this is a welcomed addition. The pool is very pleasant (if a bit cool some days) and appears to be very well kept and the pool area is private and attractive. The rooms vary quite a bit in size, shape and details, but all have been fine. Those with larger bathrooms that include a tub/shower combination are the best in our opinion. Those with only a shower are a little small if you are staying very long, or have a lot of bathroom \"stuff\" to put out on the counter. The beds are wonderful and we sleep better than on our own beds at home. The most important part of the bed is that the coverings are all washable...and seem exceptionally clean...which is a high priority with us.There are lots of good pillows in varying sizes and degrees of firmness. The television service is not exceptional, but who wants to watch a lot of TV in LA, and the heating/cooling system (at least in our room) was quite noisy. This serves as good \"white noise\" at night, so not such a bad thing, but the hotel has always been quiet and peaceful with no noisy groups in our experience. It seems to be popular with families and particularly Europeans, we have noticed. It is almost a rarity to hear English spoken in the dining room, where we encounter the most people. The hotel is located near two Metro stops, so it's possible to navigate much of the city without a car. There is an assortment of restaurants within walking distance and a good drugstore just down the street. Two major medical centers are very close in case there is an illness or other emergency.

The Hollywood hotel had reasonable reviews and we stayed there recently for 6 nights on our round the world trip. We were given a ground floor room at the end of a corridor which was very noisey, the hard marble floor and main street outlook did not lend them selves to a peaceful sleep. We had recently stayed in a hotel in Union Square in San Francisco so the mix of homelss and night people was not a surprise. Around the middle of our stay we returned to our room at approx 10pm to find that the ground floor sliding doors had been left open. We had not opened them at all during our stay. We telephoned reception immediately to report the situation. The guy on reception could not have cared less.His response \"What would you like me to do about it?\" I calmly explained the situation. He repeated what he had said before and did not ask anything about the room or if anything was missing. He would however email the hotel management to let them know. I was gobsmacked at his attitude and lack of empathy. WE COULD HAVE LOST EVERYTHING. The next morning we asked reception for an update, the receptionist said that she would contact the director of housekeeping but we could not change our room to an upper floor till later that afternoon. We wanted to leave. We were not very happy and requested no more room service. Reluctantly as we had an early start we deceided to remain and lock our luggage to the furniture as we had an early start to Disneyland. We returned to find out that room service had visited despite our request not to. The Hotel management have not even got back to us, they don't listen or seem to care. We have travelled all around the world (Cairo, Luxor, Morocco, Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, Ho Ghi Minh City, Brisbane, Auckland, San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York, London) staying in rooms no bigger than a double bed in Hong Kong to the Wynn in Las Vegas and in all of them big or small cheap or expensive you expect a level of service and security.

The Pro's: 1) Breakfast buffet. Scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, cereal (cheerios, rice crispy & corn flakes) Milk, Lemonade, Orange Juice. Toast (very varieties of bread) Coffee (Only powdered creamer & milk) sugar & sweetener plus fruits. The times from 6:30 to 10:30 is perfect. 2) I loved my double queen room. The one slight change I would make would be to move the sofa away from the microwave and refrigerator. The coffee pot they have in the room holds a single cup. You cannot see the TV from there. The bathroom is spacious to me. Be very careful of walking into as you turn the water on. The hot water takes about 4 to 5 minutes to heat up. I was impressed that they use low flow toilets. I didn't have a single problem with it. The sink and counter is laid out perfectly but in room 312 (that I was in) the faucet would make a loud noise when you turned it on full blast. I did have a balcony with room for me to chill out there but twice there was a couple of smokers outside smoking even though there are a lot of signs that say there is no smoking inside the hotel. 3) I loved having a daily LA Times at the Concierge Desk. Cons: 1) The pool is nice but it is not heated. I suggested that they would make it heated because that water was frigid when it was 80 degrees outside. I would suggest a jacuzzi. 2) A double edge sword would be that the hotel is very close to two buses & the red line but at night, I would not walk back to the hotel by yourself and I have a black belt in karate. A few things about your public transportation available to you. The Red Line will get you to Downtown LA & up to North Hollywood. The 704 will take you to Santa Monica but it will take you about one hour to get there. http://www.metro.net/riding_metro/bus_overview/images/704.pdf I would definitely recommend getting a rental car if possible. I had one for a full day & was able to go to Santa Monica, Venice and Malibu w/o having to take forever to get there. The public transportation is getting better. Self parking costs $18 a day at the hotel. Street parking is free from 8pm to 8am. You are about 1 & 1/2 blocks away from Sunset Strip. Bring walking shoes, as well. LA is flat but if you want to make sure you are in comfortable shoes if you are walking (I used my sketchers, which was fine). If you go to the beaches remember to bring a light jacket because it does get breezy in those areas. I would recommend that you park on the side of the roads if you go to the beach. There is several paid parking available but the free parking is just across the street. There is a bank of america near but I couldn't find it.

Hopefully, they have a great breakfast, with a pretty dinning room, the microwave and the fridge in the bedroom, it was awesome to have them! And the the situation of the hotel was great too, really close to the red line station, but the neighbourhood does not let you feel secure... If you're looking for an hotel who has a great location, that's this one but don't have any big expectations... I still recommend it, but just for the location...", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Henley in Arden, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "Sarah2809", "ReviewID": "UR105857479", "Content": "My family and I stayed here for 3 nights over Easter.

The children loved the breakfast as freshly made waffles were on the menu everyday as was sausages, eggs, cereal, cold meats and much more. The chap in the gift shop looked a bit miserable but in fact was totally the opposite he was very funny and extremely knowledgeable about the area. There are plenty of trips on offer in reception if you have forgot to book any like Disneyland. The restaurant isn't open on Mondays or Tuesdays and when we called to order food in, most restaurants don't deliver after 9.30 except Domino's pizza, which the kids were fine with. There is a small shop opposite the hotel where you can get Wine, Beer and snacks from if after a long day you need a long cold drink.

A five minute walk from the hotel takes you to the Metro Red Line and a number of bus stops \u2013 meaning Universal Studios, the Walk of Fame, Downtown LA and set-off points for Beverly Hills tours are all less than 30 minutes away. The hotel staff won\u2019t tell you this \u2013 but they will sell you expensive, time-constrained tours to your desired destinations. The Hollywood Hotel (formally a Ramada) boasts that its \u2018an ultramodern Hollywood Hotel is 21st century living at its finest. Decorated with luxuriant European designs and laden with cutting edge technology.\u2019 This might have been true five years ago, but is now sadly not the case. The hotel is clean and spacious, offers wireless internet (a must for planning your trips out) and has everything you need for a week\u2019s stay. But, it\u2019s approaching its \u2018best before\u2019 date. Our standard room, whilst very clean, showed signs of ageing paintwork, walls, and carpets whilst the bathroom showed the first stages of mould on the tiles. The bed was very comfortable with lovely pillows \u2013 although the annoying heavy bedspreads slid off at night. They were cleaning the hall carpets during our stay, but continued to use the noisy machinery into the evening. The room had a very large chest of drawers with an old, huge TV in top. A hanging rail is supplied in place of a wardrobe, but with very few hangars. Tea and coffee are provided \u2013 one decaf and one normal per day \u2013 not enough if there are two of you in the room. And, as there is no room service or cafe at the hotel, you\u2019ll need to ask for more if you like your own hot drinks. Vending machines are on all floors for cold drinks and snacks. A low-noise fridge was great for keeping drinks cold. Our balcony was very pleasant, although there are no chairs to sit on outside. The pool area (just across the hotel car park) was a surprise. Nice pool, pleasant gardens and clean towels. For some reason the lift (elevator) is very, very, very slow. Be prepared to wait! A continental Breakfast is served from 6.30 in the morning \u2013 great if you have a full day planned. And there\u2019s something for everyone. The hot selection has sausages, eggs (bizarre omelette/pancake-like creations) and freshly-made waffles. There\u2019s a good selection of cereals and breads. The coffee is good for hotel coffee. Fruit (get it before the cut apples and bananas go brown); cheese, spam (yes spam!), yoghurt all made an appearance in the week \u2013 although not all were there all the time. They are catering for large numbers \u2013 so it may be a case of the early bird catches the selection. It\u2019s obvious that this hotel is very popular \u2013 it was fully booked whilst we were there. And with a focus on volume, it\u2019s easy to understand why the staff may be indifferent to you. Michael G checked us in \u2013 he was helpful, polite and genuinely looked pleased to see us. But it was all downhill from this point \u2013 as his other colleagues were much less enthusiastic. The chamber maid was delightful and always seemed happy at her work \u2013 although she started early. On a number of occasions we returned to our room after breakfast to find it being cleaned. Very annoying if you plan your ablutions, etc before leaving for your day out \u2013 as you have to wait for her to finish. This is a great hotel for those who plan to spend their time out as its one of a small number of hotels near to the Metro. So for this reason alone, its location may make it worthy of top marks.

Now for the brighter side of things. It's only a block away from Metro train and some great rapid lines to West hollywood area. The red line is great, it intersects with lots most of the lines. 1-2 block away you will find great take out, Mexican take out, Chinese was good ( I'm Chinese). Subway if you want something familiar. Being from Vancouver, our taste buds are very picky because Vancouver is food Heaven..

I was pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail in the decor--more tasteful than some hotels at a much higher rate.

It didn't have any of that slight \"ick\" feeling you can get from some hotel rooms. The bathroom was nice and they even included a luffa pad. With the lush plants around the exterior it, all in all, made for a cheerful place to come home to and wake up in for 4 nights. The pool seemed nice though I didn't have time to use it.

I never felt unsafe and it was always a pleasant vibe and I found a great deli across from the Wendy's (same side of the street as Wendy's, across a little driveway) which had really fresh and good humous and salads and soups--took stuff to go a couple of times.

This former Ramada Hotel (left the franchise to save costs) has some of the rooms of a higher quality indeed (not the ones you get half-price though) and then other rooms which have not seen refurbishment yet and are a bit dated, yet spacious, with terrace and sofa in the room, microwave, coffee/tea facilities. To be honest, unless you are prepared to pay 4 star quality at over 100 dollars/night, there isn't much choice in Hollywood. Hollywood is a contrast of poverty and wealth and the affordable hotels happen to be near tube stations, in areas to be questioned. if you want a fantastic hotel in the middle of the action then choose the Hollywood Highland (Rennaissance) at double the price. At the Hollywood Hotel I found the service great, the cleaning done well, a small size pool (15 m/5 m max) a gym the size of a room, with no windows and poor airing, but looked after. Their staff make the best of what they have got. The hotel is well connected by bus/tube and the tube ticket for the day is 6 dollars (works on buses and tube). Breakfast, ok this is REAL POOR - no choice whatsoever of teas and coffees (one of each), only two waffle machines and you will get to queue for them, eggs looks ill and there is only one type of sausage, no other meat. The choice is really poor and I would not call anything they offer \"healthy eating\", but it is eatable. Careful with the tube: although you never seem to see any control whatsoever, and 9 times out of 10 you can travel without paying, there is occasional control especially in the centre of LA at some of the exits. And so you need to know this: in Hollywood ONE SINGLE TICKET PAYS for ONE tube line journey ONLY, so if you need to change tube lines (move from red to blue for example) in order to reach your destination, you need to buy another ticket.... VERY STUPID and certainly not good for tourism, but tourism is very poor here anyway. BUT I saw people being caught unaware and had to pay fines, so best is to get the 6 dollars travelcard. CAREFUL with your wallets and belongings - the city is FULL of prostitution (especially on the Hollywood Boulevard) and really dodgy people, so watch out for your stuff. Carry an ID with you at all times as some of the bars/restaurants will ask for proof of over 21 and even if you look 45 they will STILL ask you for ID. On Hollywood Blvd I would recommend Dillans Irish Pub for food as it is affordable and well looked after, gorgeous waitresses and good quality food. There isn't much of affordable healthy choice on this boulevard, but at the opposite end there is Hooters for ex and then the Hollywood Highland shopping centre which has a couple of pricey but very good restaurants. Shopping wise - strongly recommend he Glendale Shopping Centre - you can reach this centre by bus from Hollywood blvd (30 mins journey) - great food, proper mall. Careful with Compton and Crenshaw and Inglewood - STAY AWAY! at least 2 shootings/day in these areas so if you can avoid them like plague DO SO!!!!! The projects are just the same as the ones you see in movies - stick with North, North east, west hollywood and beverly hills.

The area was ok. I would not walk around there at night, as there were some groups of teens hanging out and some stores with bars on windows.

It was supposed to be a 3 Star Hotel. The room i was given (323) was the smallest room i have ever stayed in. I could touch the bed and every wall simultaneously. I didnt need the remote as I could change channels etc w/o leaving the bed. The TV itself was definitely 19\" or smaller- I think it was 15\". The inroom coffee was a 'one cupper'. There was a small micro and fridge in the room, usually a sign of a \"resident hotel\" for the locals but i considered it a plus where there were very few. The door to my room was maybe 4 feet from the bed and had a big gap between door and floor so for sound purposes, i might have just as well been trying to sleep in the hall. The bed itself was a double-not a queen (90% sure) and hard-very firm which worked out better than expected. At 6AM, some rude people started talking somewhere. It sounded like they were very close but I dont know if they were in the next room, the courtyard, the room below or what. I went into the hall but no one was there. I wanted to shush someone and i did but it had no effect wherever they were The talkin continued on and off til i reluctantly got out of bed at 8. Earlier that day, some Hip Hop artist was on the phone in the hallway, obviously trying to be polite to his roomie, but annoying the heck out of me. The thermostat looked brand new but had NO way to be set that i could find. When i called the front desk they couldnt help me and advised they would send a maintenance guy up when he got in after 6PM! The AC blew directly on my head as i attempted to sleep. I got a chair and a pen and climbed up in an attempt to redirect the louvers away from my head. They were painted stiff in the present direction. No adjustment was possible. Ugh! The breakfast was not bad but you were not allowed to bring coffee back to your room unless you paid $1/cup. Parking was $16.50/day. Some travelers i spoke to had parked on the street to avoid the charge and relied on a wake-up call so they could move it in the morning. You guessed it. No wake up call and a big $$ ticket awaited them in the morning. I did not enjoy my stay at all and checked out after day one though i had prepaid 4 days and it was not refundable.

No. It was quite obvious that considerable effort has gone into the property to renovate the facilities and there wasn't much to fault, I am plead to say. The rates are very reasonable, which explained why the place was quite busy, and could not accomodate me for additional nights. While I would not call the place elegant , it was much better than I expected in appearance and comfort. Breakfast was also more than acceptable.

I'll first say that this area is a bit questionable in some parts, but near the hotel it was fine and we had no problem. We picked this hotel based on its location as its very close to the Kaiser Permanente Hospital on Sunset where my father in law was having surgery. So for us it was perfect. The hotel is located on a busy city street. So the driveway is small and cramped and very steep. A friend picked us up and dropped us off which was good as another car had also pulled up and had we needed to stop there for very long, it would have been a problem. There is a gated parking lot with an attendant that I believe is around $17 a day. We didn't need that and I am happy to say we didn't have to pay that fee. Sadly I have stayed at hotels without a car and still had to pay some \"resort\" fee which is generally all about parking. So I was happy about that. The lot never looked all the way full. We were greeted by a very nice front desk employee who got us checked in very quickly. Our requests of a top floor room near another family member were both met. The room was on the backside of the building, it had a walkway we could have accessed via a sliding door but we never did go out there as there were no chairs and nothing really to look at. Our room was tiny! But for two of us it was fine and very comfortable. We had a queen sized bed, desk, two nightstands, and a chair. The closet was a free standing piece of furniture that also housed the t.v. It was small but ample since our trip was short. Inside it also had an iron and ironing board and a couple of drawers. The bed was very firm, bedding was fine, not worn a bit and we had four nice pillows plus another decorative pillow in a sham. The carpet was a bit worn but not dirty. They had free wifi which was great for my husband and he always got a good connection with no problems. It was unfortunate that the connection was on the nightstand. The cord didn't really appear long enough to reach over to the desk but he didn't try too hard as the nightstand was fine if a little awkward. The bathroom was really the weakest part of the whole stay/experience. The sink counter top was newer but the rest of the bathroom looked old. The sink and floor were very clean, but the shower did have some mold. The shower curtain was one of those kind that slopes out which was good since it had some mold too. The shower head was so low that even at 5'5\" I had to sort of stoop down to rinse my hair. But the water pressure was fine, they provided plenty of towels and toiletries and other than that mold (and I have seen worse at other hotels) it was fine. It was an older bathroom and large in size but the counter was small. But it worked fine and the lighting was good and it had a hair dryer plus two outlets. The room was so quiet! The ac is very loud and that helped but also I think it was just built well. Across from us two of our nights were the nosiest people. Whenever I opened our door or came up the hallway I could hear them since their kids were always yelling, crying or running up the halls. But inside my room, I didn't ever hear them. I found the room carpet fine, but the hallway carpet was a bit worn and in the hallways and in the breakfast room there were lots of areas with bunched up carpet I was really worried my aunt might trip but thankfully she didn't. But that carpet in all common areas needs to be stretched. I would totally stay here again. For the area it was fine. We had no problems with anyone scary near the hotel. My husband and I walked down to the little Mexican place two doors down and it was fine. I only saw one homeless person near our hotel the whole time. The other guests were all nice (even our noisy neighbors) and it seemed a mix of tourists and some business people. The free breakfast was very good. They had the same thing each morning so if you have lots of days, be prepared for that! But they had waffles (an employee made those for you fresh), scrambled eggs (these weird patties of eggs but they tasted like little plain omlettes), three kinds of cereal, sausage, croissants, toast, bagles with cream cheese, canned fruit, orange juice, milk, lemonade, coffee, tea and ice water. The people that worked there were very nice and the eating area was very large and clean. They had staff to bus the tables and they kept it clean even on the busy days. I know some people have had some issues with this place, we didn't. We got a very good rate, the staff were all nice, it felt secure, the area was not bad, and our room was comfortable and clean. The maids did a very good job each day on our room. I would totally stay here again and recommend it to anyone who needed that area. And believe me, compared to the Travel Lodge down the street, this place is much better! I saw it from the outside, it looked sort of nasty and my father in law had toured it before our visit (since it and the Ramada were the closest) and they wouldn't even let him see a room.

Huge stains on the ceiling and hall carpeting. On entering the room, we very disappointed at how shabby and worn it was. The carpet was soiled, and rippling. The furnishings \"well used\". The bed coverings were lumpy, bedding thin and well used. At first we thought the beds hadn't been changed. After checking to make sure the beds were fresh, my daughter was going to shower and go to bed. First thing, walking thru the bathroom door we saw a big chunk out of the bathroom countertop. We tried to call the lobby about this and the fact that there was no soap, shampoo etc. After 3 efforts we did get a desk clerk. None of the personel was aware of the damaged countertop or seemed to even care. We didn't have small children with us. If we had that broken edge would have been a hazard. It doesnt end there tho. At any other time, we would have asked for another room, but our daughter was quite ill. After she was in bed, I went into take my shower (with soap I brought) and discovered ants all over the floor. Second floor room, how do you get ants? I looked around. The door jamb is metal it was rusting at the base and top, paint long gone. This is where they were coming from. As I stood back up, I realized that the lowered section of ceiling on the shower entry was separating and molded. The shower ceiling was also molded. Too late to go elsewhere, we stayed. The neighborhood was not one I would chose if I knew the area. We are not familiar with L.A. or Hollywood. Its not an area I would wander around in and sightsee if there was anything to see. We did go down for the continental breakfast. Usual fare, cold cereal, canned fruit, toast and juice. They have 5 toasters 2 l/2 of the toasters worked. Afterwards, my daughter made a powder stop at the guest bathroom in the LOBBY. It was disgusting. One toilet was broken and \"filled\". One sink was broken, there was dirty papertowels, q tips all over the floor and sink top. This bathroom can't be more than 20' feet from the registration desk. I plan to complain about all of this to my travel service and I am backing it up with pictures. I am also going to ask if they feel I should call the L.A. Health Dept. that mold situation is not something you want to spend time sleeping or relaxing near.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, VA", "Title": "\u201cI want to warn you!\u201d", "Author": "DCObserer", "ReviewID": "UR43106146", "Content": "I want to warn you about this hotel: Stay Away! I am not disparaging the Ramada chain -- I've stayed at Ramadas around the world, and they are generally more than adequate. But this Ramada is in a class by itself -- it's HORRIBLE. In fact, the defects of this hotel are so deeply-ingrained and pervasive that I don't think anything can be done to fix it, apart from firing the entire staff and getting new ownership and managers. Clear the decks!! First of all, this Ramada is on the eastern OUTSKIRTS of Hollywood -- VERY inconvenient if you want to be in the midst of the Hollwyood action. It's on the edge of Hollywood in a DANGEROUS, extremely sketchy neighborhood and you're literally taking your life into your hands if you walk around these streets at night. Secondly, the front desk staff is the pits. I have never in my life seen a hotel front desk staff so apathetic and resentful of their jobs. They did not even treat me like a human being. They all seem to have huge chips on their shoulders about one thing or another. They are the epitome of people in dead-end jobs who know it and hate it, AND who intend to take that out on any convenient target -- meaning YOU. Absolutely rotten, pathetic attitudes, to a person. There was not one person that I dealt with -- and I dealt with a lot of them -- not ONE of these people was in the least bit friendly. On the first day, I had to make a trip back to LAX to pick up my cousin who was arriving from Italy. I asked for a taxi to LAX. They got me not a taxi, but a LIMO. I asked how much. They told me it would be $55 one way -- which was $15 more than it cost me to arrive att the hotel from LAX, by regular taxi, a few hours earlier. I told them that I DID NOT ASK FOR A LIMO. I ASKED FOR A TAXI. The ENTIRE front desk staff consisting of three people were nasty and dismissive of me, all of them insisting that because the limo had already arrived, I had to use it! Also, the Limo driver came into the reception area and insisted I ride his limo, even though it was $15 more than the taxi. The front desk staff told me that the hotel has a deal with that Limo service, and that since the limo had already come, I had to take it, I had no choice, I had already \"committed\" to using the limo. I told them that I hadn't asked for a limo. NOT ONE OF THEM would admit their mistake or attempt to remedy it. All of them -- the 3 front desk people and the limo driver made me feel guitly, pressured me into taking the limo, telling me I \"had\" to. AND FROM THERE, THINGS WENT DOWNHILL ALL THE WAY....

I built Hollywood up so much and It truly was as crazy and as fun as i imagined. firstly, we didnt want to spend loadsa money on flight and accomadation, we found a good package on Expedia: Ramada Inn on Vermont with Air New Zealand. Air New Zealand was great. Ramada was also good, however there were a few issues, but nothing major. 1) the Location is fine if you hire a car, I couldn't as i am only 24 and you have to be 25. So we spent a lot in cab fares, which was annoying. Ramada is close to universal studios, which is great. It is also about a 10-15 minute drive to both Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset Strip in west Hollywood. If however, you are able to spend more money on your hotel, than you cant beat the renaissance hotel. It looked amazing. Anyway, back to the Ramada. The Hotel staff in general were quite moody people, but they were helpful enough. We found that we were always greeting them rather than the other way round, but who gives a crap, they did their jobs and thats all that matters- although a smile couldn't hurt hey. The pool was great, the gift shop keeper was very helpful and sweet. We didn't have enough time to check out the gym and sauna, but they were there.... The Bar was never open- it looked small and boring anyway. the Breakfast was repetitive, but it was good enough, you got the usual cereal, toast, fruit, tea and coffee and then the sausage, eggs and waffles, it was nice actually. the rooms where a bit small but 3 girls with loadsa luggage managed it. There wasnt enough storage, that was the main issue. The beds were very comfortable. Oh and the maid service was great, the room was immaculate, really impressive service. Overall, our stay at Ramada was good enough considering what we paid. It would of been nice if it was a touch closer to the Hollywood Blvd mainly. West Hollywood is a bit pretentious, but I still wouldn't say no. Oh yes sorry I forgot, the street that Ramada is on is a bit vile, quite a few hobos around, but in the day it was fine, we walked to the supermarket and the subway and it was fine. It is a bit seedy but we are from London so we are used to these sorts of areas I guess. Its surprising how many homeless people there are in LA overall actually. Ok so, the subway and buses are easily accessible. The staff were quite helpful with where to go, which buses to take etc....... Go to Santa Monica for the day its beautiful-or stay there if you can. Venice beach is crazy too, there is some man that sings, \"jingle bells jingle bells help me get drunk\" hahaha, so give him a few dollars if you see him!! : ) Loads of nice restaurants- Katsuya is great! Les Deux bar and nightclub is great! Saw a few celebs about like Fat joe, Kim Kardasian.... oh and go to Madame Tussauds, that was fun too. Ramada offer all the excursions with travel included so that was good too. I think thats pretty much it, the best thing I can say about Hollywood is that you have to see it for yourself to make a judgment, no one can tell you what to expect I guess. But Overall I loved it and the Ramada wasnt that bad compared to some reviews.

We stayed a week so we were crossing our fingers that it was decent enough to see us through. We were definitely satisfied with our choice. Many of the reviews on here are unrealistic - to people wanting 5 star accommodation, BOOK A 5 STAR HOTEL! We had a fantastic room singled off from the others with a generous sized living room, TV area, separate bathroom and plenty of space. We had 6 bags and they were able to be stored without interfering with our living space. The included breakfast made a huge difference in our budget. It's the same every morning but it's GREAT VALUE. The beds were large and comfortable and the room was EXTREMELY CLEAN and made over every day before we returned. The fridge and microwave in the room saved our lives. For those on a budget or those who just appreciate having somewhere to store a cold drink and sandwich, then this will make your stay fantastic. We spent $25 on food the entire week because we could store it. It was also nice to not have to go out for every meal, especially at the end of a long day. The staff were pleasant enough and helpful when asked. The pool area is great, towels were provided and it was relatively quiet. Being young and our first solo trip, all of these things made a huge difference, granted we were out every single day we were there. For the younger crowd and those wanting to travel on a budget, I could not recommend this place enough. It is literally a block from the train station - which we used every day. A walk in the other direction took us to Los Feliz Village - an up and coming trendy area with several cafes, vintage stores and things to look at. This hotel is also a pickup and drop off destination for Star Line tours if you're looking at doing anything around the area. Excellent value for money. I would stay here again as opposed to paying double for a better zip code. I've also stayed at the Ramada Plaza and think it's way overpriced and further out of the way as far as public transport is concerned. A great middle of the road hotel so please disregard the reviews that nit pick every detail. Some people want everything for nothing. You don't stay here for luxury, you stay for value and comfort. I was pleasantly surprised. As a side note, the area is also not too bad. We went out a few times and caught the train back late at night.

We got a good, large, quiet room so I'm unclear as to why a previous review said they reserve rubbish rooms for Expedia customers, as this clearly wasn't the case for us.

Yes they had the same items everyday but they had enough variety that you could have something different each day: cereal, scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles made to order for you, toast, fruit, milk, juice and pastries. USA Today newspapers are provided free each day. Our in room wi-fi connection for our laptop computer worked fine and was NOT slow. We did hear the band play on Friday night but it did not keep us awake. They had a free comic show in the bar on Monday night but the comics were not funny so we left early. The pool looked very nice but it was too cold outside to swim. This hotel is rated three diamonds by AAA and I would agree with that rating.

I think it's worth mentioning that as I am British my expectations will be different to those from other countries, so whilst this review isn't aimed solely at Brits, it definitely has that perspective. The first room I was put into was 103 - remembering that in the US the ground floor is called the first floor. I moved from this room as soon as I could because although it was a good room and easy to get out of without using the lifts, the receptionist told me that they have event nights in the bar downstairs and one of the nights it was a club. I could definitely hear music etc before I moved rooms to the 3rd floor. Both rooms were great. The shower was hot and strong and the bed was good quality with decent bedlinen. I couldn't fault the room at all. Breakfast was continental European, and there was lots of it, much better than I have had in other hotels in the same range. The reception was clean and tidy and the receptionists were generally helpful. Only one of the younger girls had some kind of attitude and made me feel stupid for asking about the car park, the rest were all very helpful. Although the car park was a little expensive it was safe and had lots of spaces. The hotel was well placed for me, only with trips down to Santa Monica did I feel the distance, even then at the right time of day, it's not so bad. I don't know why they say it's near Universal, because it's not. In real terms it's a twenty minute drive at least. I looked at lots of hotels in this price range and as I drove around LA checked a few of them out - they were really grotty and I was very pleased I hadn't stayed in them. Whilst the area the hotel is in isn't great, it isn't that bad either and reasonably safe enough to walk around in at night. It has to be remembered that walking ANYWHERE in LA at night isn't such a great idea, unless you're in one of the shopping districts. I felt perfectly safe and when I come again with my family I would stay in the hotel quite happily. There are some restraunts nearby, I drove five minutes up to the House of pies one night - great nosh, reasonably priced and further up in Los Feliz there are some trendy bars and cafes. I tried the swimming pool one day and despite the hot weather it was BITTERLY cold. You don't need to take a towel though, as they provide them by the pool.

The room was very spacious with a sofa and coffee table, desk and dining area, kitchen with microwave, coffee maker and fridge, walk in wardrobe and a large double bed which was very comfortable. The room was very clean with plenty of towels, complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. Housekeeping were excellent and when the do not disturb sign was used we were not bothered. They would always come back later in the day. We took our laptop as the room had free wifi but the connection was intermittent at best. There were times you couldn't log on for hours which was irritating, but we weren't there to spend all day on the computer so it wasn't too much of a problem. The buffet breakfast (which is included in the room rate) was excellent. There were sausages, eggs, fresh waffles, cereals, toast, bagels, juice etc and you could eat as much as you wanted. Many people have complained about the lift being slow but I didn't think it was that bad. I was on holiday so I wasn't in a hurry anyway. The gift shop on the first floor was very handy as it sold drinks and snacks which were much cheaper than the vending machines. There was also an ATM but it charged $5 per transaction so we never used it. There is one over the road at a liquor store which only charged $1.50. The location of the hotel isn't great but I think that's reflected in the rate. I simply couldn't afford to stay at a decent place in a good location and a nice hotel in a not so nice location was a fair compromise for me. I don't think the area around the hotel was particularly dodgy, there's just not much there for tourists and there's nothing nearby that's within walking distance. However, there is a bus stop right outside the hotel and the subway is less than 5 minutes walk away. The public transport in LA is excellent and I had no problem getting around.

Great location for metro and buses. Don't even think about driving in LA - it took us an hour to go 5 miles! Metro is clean and safe and only $5 for a day pass. 2. Great room facilities - A/C, fridge, microwave, coffee in china mugs and the most fantastic bed I've ever slept in - great night's sleep! 3. FREE breakfast - yes, FREE! A rarity in USA and very nice it was too. Hot eggs, sausage, waffles, pastries, toast, breads, cereals, juice, milk, tea and coffee.

Hotel facilities - ice machine was great, didn't use the swimming pool but wandered around to it and it looked lovely. 5. Staff - very friendly and helpful Bad points 1. Lift was slow 2.

I found the location convenient for business and pleasure and used public transit for the duration of my stay. This hotel is ideal for business travelers and tourists who do not want to rent a car. Locational advantages notwithstanding, I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. During my stay, the hotel itself was sorely lacking on many fronts: -The elevators are very, very slow, and the stairs are roped off as emergency exits only. -My room (one queen) was smaller than average. -The television set did not work well, and the cable went in and out every night. -The floor in my room was stained, and the comforter was severely worn. -The bathtub was elevated far above floor level, resulting in unsafe entry/exit and a lack of headroom. I am able-bodied and nearly fell getting out of the tub EVERY night. And at 6'1\" my head was uncomfortably close to the ceiling. -My room was remade despite hanging up the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. I inquired at the front desk and was informed that I should stop by every morning and request that my room not be remade. For the record, I did that the next three days and they did not enter my room. -Each room facing the courtyard has a patio, but the patios have no chairs. And because the courtyard is so small, there is no privacy. -Access to the swimming pool is through the parking lot, and it closes early (8 PM). Also, there is no hot tub. -Breakfast is served in the basement, which requires a painfully slow elevator trip. I was in a hurry every morning and was disappointed at the lack of \"portable\" pastries and fruit that could be consumed on my way to the subway station. The Ramada is located near L.A. City College \"somewhere\" between Hollywood, Little Armenia, and Silverlake but not actually in any of the three. The neighborhood is walkable but a bit worn in, and I suggest that women be careful walking around by themselves at night. There are several nearby restaurants of varying quality, but the best are a healthy trek away. I walked to them, but most people would be better off driving. There is a Rite Aid at the corner of Santa Monica, but the nearest grocery store is located north at Hollywood (not too far from the restaurants at Prospect). At $105/night (20% discount for staying >3 nights), the Ramada is not a bargain. Parking is $15/night, which didn't matter for me, but is a bit steep for this part of L.A.! I feel ripped off. Well, I feel like my company got ripped off! Really, the only redeeming feature of the Ramada itself was my ability to print out my Southwest boarding pass before heading to the airport. If the subway station weren't a block away, this hotel would probably devolve into some cheap motel of last resort. Overall, I suggest you look elsewhere.

Also the continental breakfast was acceptable. While the lobby and the lower levels were attractive, there were several problems with my stay. The elevator service was terrible. The elevator closest to my room rarely worked. The doors to the stairs were marked emergency exits, and indicated that alarms would go off, so I was stuck using the elevators. My room was a bit dingy. Gum was stuck to the carpeting and the furniture looked very worn and stained. The bathroom was not clean. Hair and soap were stuck to the walls. The bathtub was clogged and the TV and remote did not work properly. The TV was a plasma screen and looked nice, including a keyboard that was supposedly available for Internet access. So I signed up for the service and found that the TV and keyboard did not work properly. I was charged for the internet anyway. I had a technician come up and unclogged the bathtub but he could not fix the internet and TV problems. I had to make sure I put \"Do Not Disturb\" on my door because housekeeping sometimes came early in the morning. I found my door did not lock when I closed it sometimes. The internet terminal in the lobby seemed to only accept credit cards and charged minimum $5.00 for each log on. The first day I was there there was water dripping above the terminal. Then It did not work for several days of my stay and didn't come up again for the last day of my stay. The ATM charged a $5.00 service fee and did not work sometimes. The vending machines did not often work as well. Rite Aid had an ATM that only charged $2.00. The hotel charged $15.00 a day for parking, which is not bad considering what you pay elsewhere. However the attendants always asked for something different on the way out. Some asked for the entrance ticket while others asked me to pull off the rear view ticket the hotel issued. I did not use my car as much because of the availability of the Metro. The neighborhood was immigrant lower middle class. There were some homeless people wandering around. I found people were generally approachable in the neighborhood and I also liked the dollar store a few steps away from the hotel. I'm not sure I would choose this hotel again.

Also an internet cafe across the street for only $3 an hour. I woudnt say the area is dangerous, always felt safe walking around at night, infact it was alwys pretty empty, even at the weekend. Breakfast in the morning was fine for a complimentary breakfast and offered cereal, toast, bagels, eggs, sausages, waffles, fruit and drinks. Swimming pool area was nicely decorated and clean, also liked how it was quite hidden away so you didnt have people looking over you all the time.

For three of those weeks, my coworker and I booked rooms at this hotel. They have excellent promotional prices and it was close to work. On the exterior, the hotel appears quite nice. They are doing heavy renovations (converting the hotel to The Hollywood Hotel), at this time, so if you're not in the mood for construction noise, stay away- and they work until 7:00pm at night. The interior is quite old fashioned and looks quite tired. The rooms themself are a collection of a bunch of old hotel furniture thrown together. The first week, I stayed in a dingy, smelly room, but figured I'd deal with it, while my coworker's room looked a couple of notches better than mine. The next couple of weeks, my room was a bit nicer, but still not really up to snuff. They claim free wireless internet for all rooms, and although they have wireless routers all over the building, the connections are very weak and the connection is only 2Mbps. They claim hard data connections (10Mbps), but we found that the connections were hidden behind the bedside tables, far from the desk, and they only provide very short cables, so you're teathered to that nightstand. In all the years of staying in hotels, never has the housecleaning staff forgotten to clean my room, until now. I walked into the room, turned on the lights only to find that my bed hadn't even been made. I returned late at night, so it wasn't possible to get it done. My coworker's Internet didn't work at all- his cable connection is down and he can't get a consistent wireless signal. One night, he returned to his room to find that the housecleaning staff had removed his shower curtain, but neglected to replace it. His room for the last two weeks had water problems, like it would be black water when he turned it on, so he would have to let it run for a couple of minutes, before using it. On the upside, the parking is secure, albiet you'll pay $15 per night, and a hot breakfast is included with your stay every morning.

If we went out at night we drove, teh whole state is scary at night! lol...During the day we were totally fine- Parking is $15 a day, with in and out privilages, so it really worked out. WE ususally took th elocal bus, for $5 you get an all day ride pass, which was GREAT! its takes you pretty much everywhere!

To my relief when we got there and checked in we were all fine, yes the neighborhood could be improved upon, well i didnt like walking at night but we were fine nothing happend. The hotel is being refurbished as we speak, there doing alot of work to it and its looking really nice, the lobby has some couches and a little internet service nook and is tastefully decorated, check in went smoothly, but i can see how some of the reviewers would say that the ppl at the front desk were incompitent, it really all depends on who your dealing with, so if you want to know something try and speak to diffrent ppl on different days, the 2 ladies that were there when my husband asked about the bus to Dodger Stadium they said there were none, when i told them i had done research before getting here and know for a fact that the # 4 will take them she replied \"there are so many buses around here, i dont know where they go\". I spoke to a guy THAT NIGHT that gave us step by step instructions on how to get there via bus, he also sat with me and tried to find us a place to go at night, sorry i didnt get his name 4 u guys. Ok now the rooms, very comfy, yes some were small (8 ppl in our group, 6 rooms), but ours had a flat screen tv, a micro wave, mini fridge, ironing board, coffee maker, tile floor with area rug, really nice bed spread, lots of outlets for charging electronics, closet/hangers, desk, bureau with 6 drawers, lots of room for clothing, bathroom has somewhat of a weak fan some of the silver accents were rusted but who cares, the bathroom was NOT mildew infested, seamed very clean, massaging showerhead (positioned very low, btw) you also get free paper in the lobby, and free breakfast every morning, yes it was somewhat monotnis but if you were wise with your choices you could break it up and still have a decent experience, i hate to be repetative but i will list the stuff that was available: First there were 3 kinds of cereal ( raisin bran, rice crispies & I cant remember the 3rd) next was the milk and OJ, then some eggs and sausage linx, then was the waffles made to order station, they were pretty good BTW, then was some canned fruit and a tray of Crossants and other breads including whole wheat toast and all the trimmings, butter, jelly, cream cheese and then the coffee station, so ya see? you can totally have cereal one day, eggs, sausage and toast another day, a waffle another day.....u see where im going here? we had the balcony overlooking the courtyard, which 2 foreigners and a bunch of teenagers who failed to realize that there voices were echoing thru the courtyard, but thats not the hotels fault, but if your really into your sleep i would request a room where the balcony dosnt face the courtyard. As far as the pool, i didnt look for it cuz it was way too cold and i didnt visit the gym either so i have nothing to report on that. The elevators unfortunately are very slow so just make sure u alot yourself enuff time to meet in the lobby or down for breakfast. Parking was $12 a day plus tax wich was fine, at least we knew we had our van in a safe place. If you have a vehicle your basically a 1/2 hr from everything u wanna see. Well thats about it, no its not the Ritz but if your looking for something under $100 bux a night, so u can shower and sleep, there is nothing wrong with this hotel!! OH very imprtant, make sure you look at your bill upon check out, they tried to charge one of our party for movies he never rented, when front desk and manager were confronted there response was \"im sorry but we have to charge you\" WTF?

It has the slightest incline but don't worry if your bags have wheels. The Internet TV is poor but the hotel offers free wireless access. Great if you brought your laptop but if you didn't - use the Internet Cafe across the street $3 per hour. The room was clean, comfortable and the hotel also has a car hire facility.

The hotel service directory needs and update and although the hotel has comedy nights I frequently found the posters advertising this were displayed after I left the hotel that morning and the event was over by the time I got back. I would highly recommend this hotel for its proximity to Universal Studios and the Kodak Theater. Use the Metro if you can. Universal City is the stop for the Studios only 7 stops away (15 minutes) and the Kodak Theater & Chinese Theater are just a few steps away from one another, again on the RED Route. Check out http://socaltransport.org/tm_pub_start.php for more details on getting around. The Metro is very clean. However, if you want to take the bus to the Chinese Theatre, use route 217 which you can pick up 200 yards up the street which will take you straight to it.

If only there were a solution to this problem! Then the janitor set about to mop the entire tile floor along the only path leading into or out of the breakfast area - during breakfast!

I'll cut right to the chase - you get what you pay for. In LA tourist hotels, mostly in taxes, so make sure you know what taxes you should be getting charged for.

If you want light...oddly enough my girlfriend and I didn't think the rooms and hallways were lit well enough. Trust me...I'm really not too picky about my hotel stays, but you'll understand when you get there. They use lots of 60W CFL bulbs. I was expecting that the photo of the room was likely taken from the doorway entrance to make it appear that the room is larger. It really is just the wall to the end of the bed. I'm 6'1\" and had to crouch in my shower. We had a decent balcony overlooking not much of the block of Vermont Ave. Vermont does change dramtically only one or two blocks northwards. Some very nice lounges and restaurants only 3 blocks up the street (e.g. Dresden's as seen in the movie Swingers) Staff were quiet and friendly and very helpful to our questions about postage, internet and room fees. It's a bit of a grubby neighborhood, but pretty safe. There's an affordable friendly Mom & Pop convenience store a half block down, a drug/variety/liquor store in the mall 3/4 blocks down and even a large office franchise store in that mall if you need copies, paperwork, etc. All amenities available... Only huge down note was the bar downstairs. Way overpriced and poor timing for the entertainment (they leave the TVs on at the back bar with a comedy show in the lounge). On the big plus side: Wireless internet was free. We loved this for researching tour packages on my laptop. Don't take the tour from the hotel...way overpriced. Tons of coupons out there to take anywhere from $4-$10 off per person. The continental breakfast was really good. It was not a simple continental breakfast as many other states. Fresh-cooked waffles with syrup, mini-bagels (can't toast them though), toast, juices, coffee, tea, jelly buns, sausage..The eggs need tons of pepper and ketchup (you'll see - lol).Overall you could fill up and tour all day until suppertime. But you have to eat it in the restaurant level. There are signs plastered all over about it. Not complaining about not eating in my room - it's actually a very nice setup in the restaurant. The Red Metro station is 1 block down. If you don't want to rent a car, buy a $5 pass at the station and take the subways and buses all you want (there are small $1-2 surcharges to travel to Knott's Berry Farm, Six Flags or Disneyland). Car rentals are cheap, but parking can be expensive in Hollywood if you're on a budget. Pretty easy system to figure out and it's nice and close to the hotel.

When the houseman came to our room he told us that they didn't have enough extra linen to give us ( I was literally stunned, I work in housekeeping at a hotel so the mere thought of them not having enough linen for us was ridiculous) He then brought us a rollaway instead and told us not to tell because we would be charged for it. He also informed us to keep our safety bar on our sliding door secure because other guests could come to our porch and potentially get in our room.

You hear it again and again, but this time it's truer than ever.

Believe it. I don't see it changing in the near future. This means that in the evening you'll see sketchy individuals wandering around. The sidewalks are not glamorourized - infact, they're dirty in typical city-style. I stayed with a friend and I did not feel very safe with us two being girls. Walk around with someone else if you can. 2) There isn't much to eat around here except for a fastfood Wendys across the street a block away, and the hotel breakfast itself. The hotel breakfast is average and repetitive - the standard eggs, bacon, toast, juice. 3) The metro/subway is a short walk away. About 5 minutes of brisk walking. This takes you everywhere. I love the all-day transit rate also! $5 if I recall. 4) I found the rooms of the hotel interesting, tolerable, and fun. If you're expecting glamour and glitz, you'll be disappointed. This serves its purpose as a room. There's an unassuming microwave in most rooms - we had one in ours that proved quite useful. The carpets are not spotless but this is a hotel, for crying out loud. Not your mother's kitchen. 5) Bring conditioner for your hair, girls. The water in LA is VERY hard. Those are the handful of points I can remember. Our stay was in May 2005 for 10 days. We had an excellent time in LA doing all the things in hollywood and making our rounds to disneyland and the other parks. We were out of the hotel at 9am and then back at 9pm.

The room itself was massive, clean and smart, not the biggest bathroom but it had everything you need in it. The rooms had a shared balcony overlooking a pleasant courtyard area. The window locks looked a bit flimsy but didn't overly worry us. Beds were big, comfy and well presented and room well equipped with tv, fridge, microwave, ironing board.

Take a Metro bus for $3 a day, I wish we did. There are some nice little restaurants about 10 mins walk up the road particularly Palermo's. Breakfast in the hotel isn't bad for a freebie with a selection of cereals, fruits, croissants, egg and sausages, there is a bar downstairs which has a 'comedy' act on most evenings. The house comedian should be sacked immediately, he isn't funny at all and ruins all the other acts by trying to join in. Drinks at the bar are a little expensive, $5 for a bottle of Bud and thats the cheapest they have but its not a bad placde to unwind. The only downside to the hotel which we actually found quite amusing is that I had to assist the security guard to throw out a gay druggie who'd wandered in off the street convinced someone was trying to kill him!

However it is NOT in the \"glam\" end of it. I wouldn't call the neighborhood \"scary\" at all. It's just a hispanic neighborhood, but we had no problems and ventured out often. The metro line and busses are about 1 block away.The hotel is pretty close to a lot of touristy spots, and there are city tours daily from the hotel. I would advise buying a map before heading out. 2) The building: Although the outside of the hotel isn't attractive-at all. The interior isn't too bad, I found the place pretty clean and some of it looked a lil more \"modernized\". The room we shared wasn't a bad size, we had a balcony, fridge and small sofa. The bathroom was a decent size and the shower was huge. The hotel has an outdoor pool, it is in-ground, it's not the biggest pool, but it was refreshing, and has lots of loungers and plants around it. 3) Continental breakfast: Every morning there was a free breakfast. We all found it decent, they serve cereals, fruit (like fruit cocktails), toast, bagels, croissants, eggs (meh) sausages (yummy!) and waffles (also good). The eating area is pretty nice and it's well maintaned and clean. 4) Customer service: This is the only issue, I had with this hotel. We did have one bad expirence. On Monday nights, the hotel bar has a \"comedy show\" Well I did find the show a little amatureish, but for the most part it was great...That is until they had one comic come on. He was the most vulgar, rude performer I have ever seen. He not only made disgusting jokes about incest, rape and drug use. But he \"picked\" out people in the audience and made extremelely rude comments and jokes at their expense, and on top of all that, all he did was yell. We did end up walking out. When we brought this issue up to the front desk, they simply stated \"That's how comedy is here\" And to this I replied \"You guys find incest, rape and drug use funny?\" The older gentlemen at the counter didn't take us very seriously and shrugged us off. Also, when it comes to calling cabs, make sure to tell the front desk to call you a 'Yellow cab' the \"Hotel cab\" they use there charges you more than double than all other cab companies. We also, found the front desk staff rude and always quick to get rid of you. They don't seem to know a lot of basic questions/directions. When we asked them where malls, grocery stores, good bars in the area were...they look confused and just sorta mumble an answer. This is a very honest review. If you are looking for a basic hotel in a pretty central area, with moderate prices, than definatley book here. It's great for the price!!! And served all our needs, I would definatley stay here again.", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alameda", "Title": "\u201cWarning!

Hotel itself is in good shape and surpisingly clean from what we had read in past reviews. Our room was descent in size, stocked accordingly and the fridge within the room was greatly useful! Area is not great but coming from Halifax,NS, a small province in Canada, we were in no way scared to be there, I just wouldnt go walking around by myself, at night. It is close to both the subway and bus stops (for future tourists....subway fares are based on the honour system as we later found out so we started paying then stopped since noone was there...on our second last day, we realized how it worked and you can be fined if pass is not on your person....but like I said previously, from what I saw, noone paid...its weird for a large city!) Staff were not overly friendly, and getting any information from them was like pulling teeth and seemed un-interested in helping whatsoever....my one big issue to warn future tourists about with this hotel is to NOT use their \"called taxis\" as they have their \"own\" rates and its ridiculous....we decided to cab it to dennys one morning for a change of scenery from the free bfst(which isnt bad), we got in and asked since the \"cab' had NO signage, no driver ID's, meter for fares or anything! A little awkward and the driver told us it would about $20+ !!!....We said no way, got out, called a regular cab(since we thought thats what the hotel was sending) and it was $6.40 !!! BIG BIG difference, we complained to the hotel saying it is unfair to rip off tourists who dont know the fare differences and they had no reply....Just keep an eye out and be careful of your funds. We went to the club 1160 bar(within the hotel) one night before we went out that night for the comedy club. Wasnt bad!....at first....last, head show was by a guy named \"lucky louie\" who apparently has a HBO show coming out soon-----A PIG!!!! He yelled from the start, cursed, talked about molestation of children COUNTLESS times, his gay lifestyle and how it felt and how he didnt like it, cursed at everyone, talked about my breasts, my friends, asked if a newcomer girl who walked in shaved it, harassed her until she left then harassed the remaining gentlemen who had been with the girl for a good 20min. He asked him to stop and that further egged him on--the guy was humiliated.....we finally left, it was shocking!!!! When mentioned the activities to the front desk and how the \"comedian\" said \"who --- cares, there's no --- management here to tell me what to do\", they laughed it off and said nothing. If many hotel guests are leaving due to the nonsense of a show, the comdian should be asked to leave, its inappropriate.... All in all, I would probably return to the hotel...its close to transportation, and as long as you keep to yourself, you'll be fine with the staff and surroundings. As for the hotel bar, we had a bad experience, I think it just depends on the activity that is going on. If you want a spotless hotel with fantastic, helpful staff, this isnt for you. If you're okay with a clean hotel, good bfst, and close to transportation and okay with fending for yourself as we were, I think you'll be okay! Good luck and enjoy LA! I highly recommend Universal Studios!! As a side note and for help, their shuttle to Universal is $30! If you walk just over one block to the subway, hop on, take it to \"universal city\", it takes like 10minutes and your're at the front of the pasrk where there is a universal shuttle(free) waiting at the bottom, just across the street from the subway!

The room was clean, very comfortable bed with fridge and microwave and good shower. 3 star is about right for this hotel, although we've stayed in many 4 stars in england that are about of this standard and the 4 star in san diego we stayed in was worse than this. The hotel breakfast was good, with plenty of choice. The receptionists well helpful and friendly also. We ventured out at night on the metro to Hollywood Boulevard to see the sights, only 3 or 4 stops away and it was fine, a few homeless people about but I'd say the area around the hotel is more of a poor area than a rough one, and people seemed to keep themselves to themselves. The metro doesn't stretch to West Hollywood/Beverley Hills or Santa Monica and the coast so for the next 4 nights caught the number 4 bus or the 304 bus ($2.25 all day pass for all of LA metro AND bus) which runs along Santa Monica boulevard and to West Hollywood where we found a great restaurant called the Spanish Kitchen and many great gay bars. The bus, like the metro, seemed scary at first but it was fine. The locals do tend to look you up and down a bit but I only think its because they don't get a lot of nice looking well dressed ladies on the bus after dark! We also caught the bus to Santa Monica although with the awful traffic jams it did take over an hour. You don't NEED a car in LA, we managed quite well with the bus and train, managing to get to Universal Studios in 10 minutes by metro, Hollywood Boulevard in less than 10 minutes and West Hollywood bars and restaurants in 25-30 minutes. We even caught the Amtrak train to San Diego from Union Station for $25 each and it took about 2 and a half hours.

It has a breakfast that you should really skip - little squares of powdered eggs with toast is not breakfast. The coffee tasted like it was filtered through nicotine. But maybe thats because the stench of nicotine covered me in my \"non-smoking\" room. The sheets and pillows were saturated with cigarette smell. Perhaps the most delightful feature was the flickering blue flourescent light found outside your barred window at night that was reminiscent of a flophouse. It was horrid.

The only problem we had with the room was when the TV stopped working, but after calling reception a porter arrived within 5 minutes and had fixed the problem. The fitness room was an added extra that we hadn't expected, and although basic it was perfectly adequate for a vacation workout. The pool area was a real bonus, despite being next to the car park, it was very peaceful and well laid out, and well serviced by hotel staff. There was also a small store, laundry and sauna that we didn't make use of. The only real problem with the ammenities was that they have only one internet terminal that was very popular and slightly expensive to use. All of the staff were very friendly and happy to help with making bookings and giving directions. Being near to two Metro stations was the real reason we selected the hotel as we had no car and it proved to be a real success. The area is not wonderful but neither is it worryingly rough. There tended to be homeless people near the large hospital up the street but we experienced no problems walking by, even at nght. This hotel is standard, nothing special, but perfectly clean, friendly and well equipped.

We found the staff to be very helpful, even sometimes going out of there way to help. Just before our trip to Six Flags, a woman behind reception spent the best part of 30 minutes trying to find ways to save us money on the admission fee, and she did. She went onto Six Flags' website and found out about an offer Burger King were running which saved us around $30 on the entrance fee. The hotel is in a great location, near to Universal Studios, Hollywood Boulevard and the Staples Center. As I mentioned before there is a Wendy's restaurent a five minute walk away and also a Rite Aid for picking up snacks and drinks for your room.
