Our room was in one of the annexes, Hotel 73. Top floor of a converted house. Supposedly a double room, our room was so very very small. No wardrobe just a hanging rail over the bed, the bed filled most of the room and we had a space of about 6' by 3' to move around in although a chest of drawers was placed in this space and once our overnight bags were put there we had a space of about the size of a dining room table to get ready in, so small in fact that my partner had to sit on the bed while I got ready and then we swapped - challenging when you are trying to look glam!!! The bathroom was modern and an ok size but fittings had fallen off the wall and when I turned the shower on the shower head fell on top of me!! also no shelves in the bathroom so all washing gear had to go on the floor or on top of the toilet seat - being top floor and so small it was uncomfortably hot in the room and it was good to get out in the snow later on!! Breakfast was an experience, a very rude and bossy manager barking at the guests who were waiting to be seated and basic food of cold toast and cereal as a reward for this experience!

The receptionist gave me directions but then took me down there himself when I looked confused, which was nice of him. The room was off a side entrance to the building which may be a little intimidating for the single female traveller, so worth bearing in mind. Once in the room I was pleasantly surprised. It looked like it had been recently redecorated and everything was fresh and spotlessly clean. There was a double bed even in the single room, with enough room to walk all around the bed, though not too much more to swing the proverbial cat. Plenty enough, though. There was a flat-screen TV with all the usual Freeview channels, some kind of desk, side table and open wardrobe. The bathroom (well, shower room) was equally well presented and actually a good size. The shower was hot and had decent pressure. Even though the hotel is located on a very busy street, the building I was in was set back enough that I couldn't hear a thing (and I live in the countryside so am sensitive to noise). There was the occasional creak from adjoining rooms, but nothing I've not experienced in any other hotel. I can't comment on the breakfast as I had to get out very early. Even at 06:00, though, there was someone on reception to take my room card when I checked out.

We came there with a group of youth who had earned and saved money, planned and looked forward to the London trip for two years.

And a demand for 300 pounds deposit. The hotel had been booked on the background of their internet- presentation, and their information to the agency. Onthis bakcground we had booked and prepaid the hotel stay for the whole group. Of course, the information did not tell about the unfirendliness, the insects and unclealiness, or the hotel rules. Neither did it tell that the hotel staff will treat you as an outcast if you ask a question (Can we have breakfast at 08.30 tomorrow instead of your suggested 07.30?), or make a complaint (There are spiders in our room). Let me also tell that the youth behaved very well, and gave the hotel director no reason to fine them. They all felt unwanted by hotel staff, and insecure, and that the athmosphere very unpleasant. I have travelled a lot, to countries all over the world, with groups, and with friends and family. Stayed in everything from 1 star to 5 star hotels.

Although every year i complain about the accomodation at Hotel 65 it gets me no where with my employers. Let me stay with my most recent trip in 2010. Where do i start? The rooms are very cramped, very small. I stayed in a room for three people and this was definately too small. The bathroom provided are so small that it is possible to go to the toilet, wash your hands in the sink and wash your feet in the shower at the same time. Hardly adequate for anyone, let alone a group of very active sports people such as my team. The staff are horrible, as we have stayed there 2 previous years, the staff knew us, and warned us that we are not allowed to enjoy alcholic beverages in our room. To me this is a disgrace, if after a hard days work we wish to enjoy some alchol it should be alright to do so, furthur more the staff had the cheek to accuse us of taking and dealing in prohibited substances, which was simply untrue. The thing that takes the biscuit is the vermon that live in the hotel. A member of our team has servere skin issues and we discovered that the beds were riddled with bed bugs as they came out in large red blotches that were tested and caused by sleeping in the bed. A member of our team spotted a rat scurry along a hallway whilst on her phone to her boyfriend, and furthur evidence of a rat was presented when a member of our team wanted to get a shower. He went to get his show gel from his bag, when he lifted a bag of chocolate rasins out to discover a small hole in the bottom of the bag as the sweets fell out. On furthur inspection we noticed the bag was bitten open by vermon. The same team member then lifted out a t shirt he had to discover rat urine and poo all over the t shirt. This was an utter disgrace and forced our team and i out of the hotel. When we confronted the rude staff member who convenently couldnt speak english until we mentioned ringing the police blamed us for the infestation and that we were using illegal substances. We therefore invited him to ring the police to search us for such substances. Our team is a sports teams where substance use is totally out of line. Therefore it is proposterous to suggest that we would use such things. We took alot of pictures of the hotel and found rat bait boxes under beds and other evidence of rats. With this we informed environmental services who confirmed that there was a serious infestation within hotel 45 which is operated by hotel 65 and other properties where to be investigated. I would seriously tell anyone who would consider staying in this Hotel to just forget it unless they want to come away sick and insulted.

On the first day, I couldn't get any; on the second, I complained to reception who told me the guest in the room next to mine had used up all the hot water, which I didn't really believe. The receptionist came with me to the room, and it turned out you have to leave the water running for about 10 minutes to get it hot. However, in general the room was clean and adequate, if not a three-star standard (no phone, TV working on only a few channels, no desk and only one chair). I was surprised to learn the hotel charges an extra 5 GBP for an \"English breakfast\" (and a very skimpy one by my standards), even though my reservation included a full English breakfast.
