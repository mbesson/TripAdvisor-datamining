The Holiday Inn down town was A LOT nicer and cheaper. This place charged us an extra 100$ because apparently their maids could not put some bottles in a garbage bag. There was 4 of us in the room, it is not like we had a party or anything. We just had a couple drinks before we went out. So when I say SOME bottles, I mean like 10 beer bottles. The bedding was dirty, the shower/tub was disgusting, and the shower head was no good. You hear air planes flying over you in the middle of the night. The service was terrible, If you just want to stay at a place for a night while your waiting for your flight, I suggest you sleep at the airport. If you are staying in Montreal for the weekend, I recommend the Holiday Inn down town. Whatever you do, do not stay here.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Labrador City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cStay Away\u201d", "Author": "M S", "ReviewID": "UR126726720", "Content": "This would be the last hotel I would choose if I ever return to Montreal to stay overnight.

That is what you will be greeted by once you enter this establishment. The shuttle to the Inn was on time and ok, however the Inn really needs to get its stuff together. The lobby is small, cramped style, un-kept, not vacuumed, tobacco smokey and drab to say the least. The hallway smell big time of cigarette smoke, and the room was NASTY !!!!!! I requested a non smoking room the nights before, however....guess what, yes a smoking room. And when I brought a smoking hotel front desk clerk to the room to see the broken sliding door to the parking lot on the other side of the room, she thought the smell was horrible!! That speaks volumes. The continental breakfast is average, however again the smoke smell is every where. Over all, sure the price may be low, but you get less that you pay for here. The bedding is really uncomfortable, and the hotel is on a busy route. Just do your homework, there must be better options near by. Good luck on your search, especially if you do not smoke.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cReally noisy - definitely not a 4*\u201d", "Author": "paddling_kiki", "ReviewID": "UR113095943", "Content": "We won the hotel by purchasing on Priceline - and Priceline indicated that it was a 4* hotel. I definitely would not consider a 4* (probably not even a 3*). A group of us booked, and we were told when we called that it would be no problem to have rooms with two queens. Sure enough, we ended up not having enough beds for all the people to sleep in, and some of the girls had to get cots. Our room was on the first floor and quite close to the reception desk. The hotel is located right by the airport, and right by the highway. Needless to say, between the uncomfortable beds, highway noise, airport noise and constant activity at the check in desk - I got about 2 hours sleep (and I'm not someone who has problems sleeping at hotels). For 169$ a night, I would go elsewhere", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTerrible hotel, good location to Mtl airport.\u201d", "Author": "Soulia", "ReviewID": "UR95795616", "Content": "We decided to take advantage of the stay/park package. It ends up being a good rate but not enough to stay there again. The check in/check out was terrible. Our non-smoking room smelled like an old tavern. The bed was comfortable, clean sheets.

The drive almost hit 2 cars on the way out of the parking lot and didn't seem to care really. Short distance from airport, right off the highway.
