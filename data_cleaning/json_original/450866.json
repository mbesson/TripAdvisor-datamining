But I would definitely not recommend staying in one of the rooms (as opposed to the villas). The building the rooms are in was just recently put up - it is not very attractive. The worst thing: the rooms are smelly. I complained at the reception and got another room - it was only marginally better. Also, the rooms look a little cheap. The villas may be alright but other than that, you can do a lot better in the same price range.", "Date": "Aug 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR964511134", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "butseriously"}, {"Content": "Great Stay       Hotel Pool", "Date": "Jun 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR984835988", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Lilem02"}, {"Content": "Great Outdoor Bath We booked a deluxe bungalow villa for 2 Adults and 2 Children after reading good reviews in TripAdvisor.com. The first impression was great. We reached the hotel at about 10pm and the room was all ready for us. It has nice little touches such as flowers on the bed, flowers in the outdoor bathtub, a nice little room for the kids and nice scent from the fresh flower in the vase. Very romantic. The villa was rather big and a good value for money. It was however not near to any shopping malls and good restaurants. It was a good thing we had pre-arranged for a balinese driver to pick us up and bring us around bali. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was quite good and has a good variety of food. The children enjoyed the fresh omelette that was prepared right before them after they chose the ingredients for the omelette. The pool was big with nice landscape surrounding it. It is a pure joy to relax at the pool as the ambience was great. Overall the hotel was exotic and offers a good balinese touch which may be lacking in the bigger hotels. I strongly recommend it for couples and families who want a quiet getaway.", "Date": "May 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR921635792", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "SingaporeMatchgirl"}, {"Content": "I loved this hotel I have just returned from my 2 week stay at Vila Lumbung and felt compelled to write a review as the hotel far exceeded my expectations. Having read the previous reviews about rats, i very nearly cancelled my reservation and try to change to another hotel in Seminyak. I am so glad i didnt! The layout of the hotel, grounds and pool is lovely. Its like a little oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. It isnt a 5 star hotel, there is some decor that is a bit rough around the edges but overall I was more than pleased with the place. The staff are incredibly friendly, although that does seem to be a Balinese trait in general. The food was also very good. The massage ladies that you book through hotel reception will come to the pool - and were fantastic! I loved this place and would happily stay there again.", "Date": "May 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR949344165", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mupp007London"}, {"Content": "Beautiful and peaceful property! We booked online one week prior to travel. I have to say I was really suprised with the quality of this place. There were NO SIGNS OF RATS!!! The rooms were huge for the prices - easily sleep more people. Everything was working and in pristine condition (compared to the other places we stayed the week before). The grounds were immaculate. The staff very helpful. Very close to all attractions yet far enough away that there was peace! There was some renovations going on - when we complained about the noise we were immediatley offered a delux family villa - no questions asked. The food served via room service and at the restraunt was EXCELLENT! I have been to Bali many times and would without hesitation book this property again.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR552020838", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "trudiDarwin"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel! No rats! I read the review from last spring about rats and immediately tried to switch my reservation to Le Meridien. Good thing I couldn't! This charming little hotel is in the middle of the Seminyak/Legian/Kuda area and half the cost of the posh, yet isolated Le Meridien resort. We had the top room of a Villa which was clean and comfortable. We saw a few mosquitoes at night but were not bothered by them and our crib had netting. Bali does not have Malaria anyway. We were able to rent a bottom room for a half a day waiting for our flight. The bottom room had an outside, yet very private bathroom surrounded by a high wall, which was interesting. The pool was great for families and the whole complex was very cozy. The restaurant was definitely the high point of this hotel. Room service is the same low price as eating in the restaurant and very very good. But the real advantage of this hotel is the location. A two dollar cab ride will get you to some fantastic seaside restaurants such as The Breeze, La Cucciolla, Ku-de-ta, and Gado Gado. All were fantastic and cater to a wide variety of tastes - from the young and hip, to the romantic, to the families. The beaches, small shops and craftsmen were also close by. The hotel has a band of friendly drivers that will drive you anywhere for 50,000 RP per hour, which is the standard rate and very reasonable. The only problem area was the door connecting the two rooms was glass and easy to hear the other occupants. We weren't bothered, but I hope our baby didn't bother anyone downstairs in the middle of the night (sorry!). I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to explore the touristy beach areas of Bali on a budget. I would stay here again.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR572535925", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "GG_Boogie"}, {"Content": "Good value but beware of the rats Its great value, the rooms are fine and so is the pool but after we'd had a rat running around our room on two separate nights we had to leave.

This wasn't an issue and was happy to forego the extra space to get the high ceiling and the resident gecko.The rooms are tasteful but a bit on the rundown side, though after a day in Bali we'd started to accept that times are tough, and the room wasn't an issue whatsoever.Not a lot of hot water at times though again this wasn't an issue for us as with the heat we were taking cool showers anyway.Breakfast was included and we had no issue with it - American breakfast was say fresh papaya juice, toast, croissant, bacon  egg, and coffee. All the fresh fruit we had was top notch.Had dinner in the restaurant one night and lunch by the pool. No problems there and the restaurant has a nice ambience though is pretty quiet given the lull in Bali post bombings.Compared to other parts of Bali we found that mosquitos were pretty much under control at Vila Lumbung. Our room was sprayed at night by the hotel and even when sitting outside a quick spray of insect reppellent was adequate.DVD shop  laundry outside front gate, and the beach resorts of The Legian etc are about 800m awayKuta was only a 30k RPH transpor transpor ride away which was fine with us as we picked Vila Lumbung because it's away from a lot of the downsides of a bali holidayDined at La Lucciola twice. Superb though prices more in line with Aussie than Bali. Also had buffet at gay friendly restaurant near hotel though name slips me. Was absolutely superb and the transvestite host adds a bit of flamboyance.All in all we loved our time at Vila Lumbung and it'd be our first choice for a place to stay in Bali. The people are having a really tough time of it - best thing we can all do is spend some time and money there.", "Date": "Feb 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR404323746", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "hardsell"}, {"Content": "Lovely hideaway 'hotel' We spent 6 days here, after moving from another Seminyak property and were rapt. There was nothing wrong with the other place, but for an extra $10 a night we had a family villa which included a separate kitchen and second bedroom. The bathroom was gorgeous and the (ground floor) verandah large. We were at the back of the property which was really quiet. We've actually stayed here before, but in a normal room and whilst they are lovely the extra space when you are travelling with two young children is heaven - especially as the weather was a bit dodgy this Christmas.The breakfast buffet was nice enough, still not enough to lure me away from a Ku De Ta feast, but everyone else in the family enjoyed it. My only (small) problem with this property is that there isn't a lot of area around the pool for lounging/umbrellas. It's also a little further away from the action, but closer to the best value spa at Villa Ayu so that makes up for some. This property is not 5 star, but if you don't want to spend that sort of money or not go for a private villa, I would say this was one of the better alternatives in the Seminyak area.", "Date": "Jan 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR438575801", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "essdee"}, {"Content": "nice pool lovely rooms We arrived at the Vila Lumbung having previously encountered problems with the AC at Melia Bali (dampness) and were delighted that upon entering the lovely spacious 1st floor room 14a; that the room was cool and NOT damp!!However, we went out to relax by the pool only to return to the room later to be horrified that the AC seemed to have been turned off, presumably by the maid who returned to our room to clean the floor which was filthy on our arrival!!Within a few minutes a young overalled man arrived at the room and just flicked a switch inside the wardrobe and hey presto...we had cool air again. However, my husband discovered that the AC must have tripped out and the guy had just switched the fuse box on again!! This wouldnt have been so bad but this happened again the following day and the day after! We were fed up by that time and complained to the hotel manager on duty who offered us a change of room. By this time we had also discovered that there was no hot water after a certain time! They moved us to a ground floor room so we lost our lovely spacious airy 1st floor room but gained an outside bathroom which was beautiful. lashings of hot water, and best of all an AC system which actually worked.Apart from that the place is gorgeous, but they could make service around the pool a feature as no one seems to use the pool bar, mainly due to the fact that it is in fact in the lower pool areawhich is not used as much. They do not market the spa very well and the prices were cheap! Under better management the place would be amazing.However, our stay was enjoyable nontheless and there are some great restaurants in Seminyak, a cheap taxi drive away. Cabs can be picked up at the hotel gate or along the road. It is very safe in Seminyak and other parts of Bali to walk out at night.
