I am not sure why it has so many great reviews, but here is what I experienced: 1. There seemed to be only two people working here who spoke any English, but not well! There was rarely an English speaking person around when I needed one (morning, evening) as the English speaking staff was only around during the day I guess. When they were around they did not understand anything I was saying. 2. LOUD. There is construction going on outside the hotel now. Not just during the day or in the morning. ALL NIGHT. The first two nights they were jack-hammering from 1am-4am directly outside my window. Any other time of day you can hear every pin drop from the rooms next to you and even whispered conversations going on outside. The entrance to the hotel is also torn up so you have to go through a side entrance. 3. The room was ok, on the small side even for Europe. You can tell its an old building and things have been done to make it look good on the surface, but there was some deterioration. If the service had been good, this would not have been an issue for me, but after the other negatives it was just too much. 4. The service was not so good. No one seemed willing to help or give any advice aside from trying to force you to eat at the restaurant on the top floor. When it was time for me to get a cab to the airport, the manager simply pointed down the street. I also booked a tour with them which was a complete disaster as I was picked up an hour late, and then taken on the wrong tour. I realized this immediately so was able to tell the guy before he left, but then he put me in a cab and took me to what he said was the correct tour. This ended up being the wrong one as well, but I didnt realize it until we were on the road and it was too late. What a waste of a day! It could be the fault of the tour company, but either way, do not let the hotel book anything for you!!! 5. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It is situated just about a block from the entrance of the Topkapi Palace and behind the Hagia Sophia. There are a ton of other hotels in this area too. If this one had not been so cheap at the last minute I would have been much more upset and given it only one or two stars.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rimini, Italy", "Title": "\u201cLa mia vacanza magica!\u201d", "Author": "nadia b", "ReviewID": "UR127208174", "Content": "The entire staying in Hotel Megara Palace Istanbul was like a dream.

The hotel is close to the main sights in the Sultanahmet District including the Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and Aya Sofya Museum. We found both the bedroom and bathroom in room 306 small, but for the price, we understood that we were not booking a suite. The bed was comfortable and staff obliging when we requested two additional pillows. Furnishings were traditional with charm. The room was cleaned immaculately every day. The staff were pleasant and helpful. One exception was when I asked for a plug for the sink. I was informed that plugs were not used in Turkey and none was forthcoming. To think, thousands of years of civilization and the Turks haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discovered the utility of the sink plug! Breakfast included a wide choice, though for our nine nights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stay it was repetitive. Some variation in the offering would be better, but we understand that most guests would probably stay for a shorter period. Thanks, Shahin, for your smiling face every morning. There was quite a lot of tourist bus traffic past the hotel during the day but never any disturbance at night. The 6am call to prayer from the small historic mosque across the road was to be expected in a Muslim country and was very short. Be aware that no one who has difficulty climbing stairs would be able to access the breakfast restaurant on the 5th floor roof terrace. There are some ground-floor rooms but no lift. Our cases were carried up and down the curved staircase for us, thankfully. It is only a short walk to the Sultanahmet tram stop for trips further afield. I certainly recommend purchasing an Istanbulkart that makes using the trams, metro, ferries and funicular easy. Topping up is easy at one of the machines at many boarding points.

I recommend it as offering acceptable value for the price. The hotel is clean and secure with a small lobby/reception area. The staff are a major selling point of the hotel. They were always professional, nice & helpfull (and don't forget the parrot). If you don't expect the Four Seasons, you won't be disappointed. In most hotels, single rooms are small, and not the most attractive rooms & Megara was no different. The single rooms are tiny, but they kindly moved me to a higher floor which was less dungeon-like but still no view. The decor was dark but the room clean. The bathroom seemed larger than the room itself, there was an odor in the bathroom at first, but they worked on getting rid of it. Also there was a problem with the TV and it was replaced. I peeked into vacant double rooms and they were small but brighter etc. Breakfast is very basic but you won't starve and the terrace was nice with a view. there is no elevator and the stairs are quirky but the staff will carry luggage etc. Location is good, opposite to Topkapi Palace and short walk to Hagia Sophia & Blue Mosque. The Four Seasons Hotel is around the corner and there are loads of restaurants nearby. The tram was only a short walk away. The hotel's easier to reach on foot as there are lots of little, one way streets and the two taxis I took had great trouble finding the hotel. Once I was familiar with the area I thought it a fine location. I would stay again for the price, but would ask that the hotel consider upgrading the single rooms. I'd recommend to someone looking for just above basic accommodations. I loved Istanbul but didn't get to see enough. Aside from the highspots, I'd recommend 1) the sightseeing bus tour as it gives a good overall view; 2) a boat trip, even the shorter ones are worth it; 3) Just sitting, having tea and watching the world pass by was enjoyable and an education.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cnice tucked away hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sheila567", "ReviewID": "UR61342362", "Content": "this hotel was alright.. i was expecting more but it was fine. i arrived here and was given my room, the bed was comfortable. but the rooms are incredibly small, but the bathroom was really nice! the shower was strong and the toilet was nice. i woke up nicely, and there was no traffic noise. i headed up stairs in the morning for breakfast, and it really does have a panoramic view, the view, you could just stare at forever, you could see the ocean, and i took loads of pictures. it was really warm sitting outside eating breakfast, and this annoying ginger car kept walking past us. the waiter was helpful. the food was rubbish. it was really basic. it had pieces of baguette chopped up, and all fruit, and im not a fruit person, so , but they had nice pieces of chocolate. and the tea was nice. the hotel was in the best possible location, it was right outside the topkapi palace, and walking distance to the blue mosque. sitting outside there at night was really nice, and relaxing though you get a lot of beggars and cats following you. just threaten them by saying police and they run off- both of them. the reception staff were really nice, they helped us , and told us where to visit and the best times of day to go, they gave us a map, the rooms were really clean but were small. i wouldnt come back to this hotel since the rooms are really small and i dont like that. another bad thing is that the stairs are really small and dangerous, they twist as you go up, and they dont have elevators, so thats one bad thing.

We are a young American couple who was in Istanbul to do a lot of sightseeing. Since we were on a budget, we were also looking for a Sultanahmet-area hotel for less than 100 USD. We booked Megara Palace through Expedia for roughly 70 USD per night and got a good sized double (bath ensuite) with a nice view. The room was clean and comfortable, and we had no complaints with the room itself. The hotel itself has a kind of dark, medieval look to it---with a stone staircase and very dark paneling in the hallways. The owners keep a neat pet bird in the lobby; it can say basic things in a variety of different languages (\"Hello!\", \"Bonjour!\", \"Meow!\"). One of the main perks of the hotel is the location. It's about a two minute walk up to the entrance of the Topkapi Palace, and about an extra three minutes to the Blue Mosque. Another huge perk is the nice breakfast on the rooftop with great views of the Bosphorous. On a sunny cool morning, it's the best way to start a day of sightseeing. The breakfast server is also nice and charming. The breakfast and view were our favorite parts of the hotel. Oh, and we also appreciated the free WiFi access from our room! On the flip side, the downside of the hotel is that it's a bit smelly. The room itself smelled fine, but the rest of the hotel smelled unmistakably like animal urine. We suspected the bird in the lobby, but it might also have been the feral cats that we occasionally saw lurking about. It wasn't a huge deal, but it does color your impression of the hotel when you walk in. Overall, though, we'd likely stay again or recommend the hotel to our budget-minded friends.

We arrived early morning, about 07.00 h., after a long tiring coach journey and though check-in time is towards mid-day, we were very pleasantly surprised and tremendously thankful to be allowed into our allocated room so early. That made the difference to us, between a hotel with 'strictly business' and a hotel with 'personal touch'. We did not have to wait for hours, either sitting in a cafe or out on the streets, waiting for the hour of check-in. Excellent service from the staff, polite and obliging and you even get greeted by the papagalos. The Hotel is practically outside the entrance to the Topkapi and at the side of Ayia Sofia. What a great pleasure to finish your walks in the extensive Topkapi complex and then, 50 metres away, you have a nice hot shower to go under. Bliss. And then start again fresh. No long walks, or taxi rides, to Sultanahmet square, the hub of the razzle-dazzle of the district.. Yes, the rooms are rather basic, not enough hungers in the wardrobe, just 3 and no chairs either to sit on or put your clothes on at night (Not all rooms are so, Ali said). Ask Ali for those items when you are there, he will oblige. The bed and beddings were good and clean and the bathroom larger than necessary, at the expense of the bedroom. There is a working air-condition unit in the room, just switch on. The nights were a bit chilly, but Ali turned the CH on for us at the asking. It gets a bit noisy from early morning, with all the taxis lined up outside and cars going up the slight hill, but bearable. And if you want restaurants gallore, just walk 30 metres down and you are in the midst of the road with the 10's of all types of restaurants with their tables lining the street.
