This was a superior room and worth paying the little bit extra to have a lot of space, a sitting area with chaise longue and large bed under the eaves. The bathroom had a great shower but the extractor fan was quite noisy. Breakfast was not included in the room rate and the hotel offers different options. We had the buffet one day and this had a good selection with very nice breads, fresh fruit, yoghurts, eggs, bacon, cheeses, etc. For the other days we tried several of the bakeries, cafes and bagel shop in the surrounding area and all were great. The hotel staff were friendly and efficient, handling check-in and check-out quickly, making restaurant reservations and giving advice.

Okay, a hairdryer maybe, a small bureau, television, a mini-bar? And yes, also those items were also there. Breakfast was excellent. We had a last minute spring-deal, so it was included. Otherwise we would have gone to the Gasthaus Krombach, not more then a two minutes walk from the hotel, where they serve great breakfasts from about 3,90 euro's. The Meineke Strasse itself had a few options for lunch/dinner. Two excellent traditional German places - the Krombach and 'hotelneighbour' Meineke X restaurant, with a big terrace - and the German/French orientated Diekmann, also just a couple of metres away. On the other site of the road is a good Italian (no pizza's), an 'imbiss' and - on the corner - the Hard Rock Cafe. And in the parallel Fasanenstrasse (an absolutely beautiful street) you can enjoy a great breakfast, lunch or just a glass of wine or coffee in the wonderful garden of the Literaturhaus. If the weather allows it. After a day of sightseeing you don't have to go far for your (culinair) entertainment. And who wants to experience the little restaurants and bars on and around the famous Savignyplatz: it's no more then a ten, short 15 minutes walk. We didn't try the hotelrestaurant but heard that it was also quite good. The U-bahn is closeby, so you can go in any direction of Berlin without a problem.

They taught me a lot about the city I would not have otherwise learned, including good restaurant recommendations, museum advice, and accurate instructions on how to use the train. (The U bahn stop is not far away and once I made my initial ride I spent several days hopping all around Berlin.) They also answered my questions about the history of Berlin. In short, their dialogue made me feel more like I was visiting friends rather than staying in a commercial hotel. My room was indeed small, but not cramped. The structure is beautiful with 14 foot ceilings in my room. Bathroom was indeed \"gleaming\" as another visitor said. Nice courtyard, which is common on this street. There were two breakfast options, and I only tried the full buffet once, and it provided a good range of options even if it was a bit pricey. The single room was a great price at around 80 euros. The internet service was free, though it was structured to charge 12 euros a night (I don't know if they once did charge for it and changed their minds).I went to the fitness center and it was plenty clean; I did not go in to the spa, as the other reviewer noted, but there were three gentlemen in there already who seemed to be having a fine time.

It has old world charm to it -- not some cookie-cutter business hotel. It has a beautiful restaurant and lobby area -- very 19th century. The rooms are also quaint, although a little small. The area was quiet and off the main drags (even though the Hard Rock Cafe is right across the street!). The staff here were all wonderful and very helpful -- spoke great English and were always willing to help out. They gave me a good map of the city to use. Free newspapers in the lobby -- although none were in English. There was a good events newspaper that I used heavily (in English). The hotel is very close to no less than 4 different S-bahn or U-bahn (subway/train) stops. Very easy to base from here and then go any number of directions in the city. It's also very central to many attractions -- such as Charlottenburg, Ka De We, the Zoo, Kurfurstendam, Europe Center. It's not near the new city center though -- but easy access via subways. It was also very easy to get to Tegel airport from here. I walked over to the Zoologischer Garten S-bahn station and caught a 20 minute bus to Tegel for 2.10 Euros -- much cheaper than a taxi (bus runs every 10-15 minutes). It was also easy to get here from the Hauptbahnhof using the S-bahn (straight shot -- no connections). There was one computer with free internet in an office room near the lobby. The room was always open and available. (Nice room too, with a large table and office paper and pens laid out) The bathrooms were fine -- good shower. I didn't have the typical twin bed as a single. I think it was 2 twins put together, but that was better than just one! There were big pillows too! There was no air conditioning, but it wasn't very hot while I was there. Some negatives: 1.) Breakfast was extra and cost 14 Euros. I thought that was a bit pricey for breakfast (especially since that equates to about $19. (It sounds like it was a big breakfast, but I didn't ever go, because of the cost.) 2.) There was no safe in the room, although the staff was very willing to lock up things at the reception 3.) Minibar items were too expensive 4.) Halls can sometimes be a little noisy, because of the old doors closing, etc. 5.) Hotel restaurant looked good, but it was pricey and limited selection (with high-end choices). You weren't going to get a basic Jaegerschnitzel here. The dining room had a beautiful ambience, though. 6.) No coffee/tea making facilities and I didn't see available any in the lobby either. All in all, I liked the hotel, enjoyed my stay there, and would consider staying there again. Like I said, the staff was terrific and did their best to make sure I had a pleasant stay. The room ran me about 70 Euros a night (without breakfast). I guess that isn't too bad a deal in Berlin, but I wouldn't say it was a great deal either.

Had a typical German meal in a restaurant just along the street, it too was excellent, but can't rememer what it was called! Loads of things to do. Did the City Tour bus but couldn't really hear all the info from the tour guide due to traffic, would therefore recommend a tour where you get earphones provided. All in all, great hotel in a great location in a great City. You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "September 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redditch UK", "Title": "\u201cComfort and efficiency in central Berlin\u201d", "Author": "Spiral2", "ReviewID": "UR5729883", "Content": "Our family of four, (parents and teenagers) stayed at the Golden Tulip Residenz Berlin for three nights at the end of August 2006. From the moment we arrived until we left we found this hotel to be excellent. The staff all spoke excellent English and they were very helpful and efficient in dealing with all our requests. The position of the hotel is excellent on a quiet street off Kurfurstendamn yet within a few minutes walk of the Zoo and of Wittenbergplatz. There are plenty of clothes and shoe stores here and also many restaurants. The U-Bahn is easily accessible although at present there is a lot of disruption on the line into the Mitte area. All three of the rooms we had in the hotel were very plain in d\u00e9cor but had every thing we needed and in addition two had small balconies over the courtyard which always pleases me. Bathrooms were fine with excellent power showers \u2013 although the curtains were inclined to block the water outlets. The beds were a little on the firm side for my taste but were clean as was the rest of the hotel. However the best point about the hotel (other than the staff) was the really excellent breakfast. This was extensive, with bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs available in addition to a large variety of cereals, fresh fruit and dried fruit. Also there was a large selection of rolls, toast and smoked and cold meats and cheese including smoked salmon. This is normally, I believe, about 13 Euros each but we got it as a bed and breakfast deal - an excellent bargain. If we visit Berlin again we will certainly use this hotel and recomend it to our friends.", "Date": "August 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4519321", "Content": "We've just returned from our first visit to Berlin which is a phenomenal city, and I'm delighted we chose to stay at the Residenz.

You're about 500m from the U-Bahn, and the Ku'damm is a great shopping area. There are also some lovely restaurants nearby. The room was decent enough, high ceilings and doors, and all very clean. My one beef was that the double bed was two beds pushed together and the pillows were fairly uncomfortable. The staff were incredibly pleasant and helpful, and our child was spoilt rotten by them at breakfast! Incidentally, the breakfast was excellent too!

It is a v short walk to the u-bahn, and there must be 10 bus routes which stop on the corner.

The hotel is located near Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. However, this aeria isn't the city's hot spot anymore. Our room facing the courtyard was very quiet but very cramped and dark, too. The furniture was really old-fashioned and the fixed carped hiding a parquet floor was long 20 or 30 years old and disgusting. The bath curtain was so unluckily fixed that the small bath room was overwhelmed every morning. The \"fitness room\" consists of 3 cardio-equipment and nothing more and they aren't able to support you with goggles for the solarium. Our room rate didn't include breakfast and 13,- extra pP per day seemed really inadequate so that we decided to have our breakfast outside the hotel. The staff at the reception was shortspoken, if not to say unfriendly. The Residenz Berlin is definitely no four-star and not worth the price postet in our room ( 153,-). We payed 80,- for the room due to online reservation over wotif website and in our opinion it's the upper limit you should spend for it!", "Date": "December 12, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Residenz Berlin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d228329-Reviews-Hotel_Residenz_Berlin-Berlin.html", "Price": "$81 - $188*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Meinekestrasse 9</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10719</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228329", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/bd/af/bdafe83de8d32b256abd83f7dc87f3771large.jpg"}}
