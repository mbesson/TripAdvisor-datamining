We had a room on 6th floor with nice view on school's playground. The room was very small what is rather normal in HongKong but it's OK if you don't plan to spend whole day inside. If you want to spend more than few days it becomes claustrophobic a bit. Room was cleaned each day. Generally the hotel was clean except one dead cockroach we found on corridor one day. Also we had a small gecko in our room but it's nothing bad. There's free Wifi Internet access in the lobby and ADSL in the rooms. You can order cheap continental breakfast in the hotel's restaurant. I would recommend staying there for budget travellers - and I will stay there on my next trip to HKG.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bridal Tea House Hotel (AnChor Street)", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1213969-Reviews-Bridal_Tea_House_Hotel_AnChor_Street-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$79 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.8 Anchor Street, Tak Kok Tsui, Kowloon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1213969", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/65/da/0f/anchor-st-branch.jpg"}}
