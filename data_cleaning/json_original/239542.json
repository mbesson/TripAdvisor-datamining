My better half and I stayed at Cram over Christmas 2011 and were very pleased with the hotel. It is very boutique with a nice design feeling to it. Though a little cramped in terms of space in general, it was of little concern. We had a standard room that was very clean and nice. Upon asking at the front desk we were provided with the complementary wifi password and bathrobes. The staff was very nice and helpful. The location is good; close to many restaurants and city attractions. The rooftop is very nice. However, the swimming pool is more of a decoration. Also, good room service. The only reservation we had was the bathroom door. It was made of glass and didn\u2019t close tight.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cDecent location, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "marcodimero", "ReviewID": "UR126827175", "Content": "Just back from the Hotel Cram and thought it was an excellent hotel. No problems at all from me and particularly enjoyed the decor. Located not far from the centre in L'Eixample, everything is in walking distance but if you can't be bothered there's a metro nearby. I thought the room was excellent with a wide-screen TV and very modern bathroom with walk-in shower and lighting system. The roof-top terrace has excellent views out across the city and up to the mountains and the bar downstairs is very trendy and not too expensive. I did avoid the Gaig Restaurant however which is situated in the hotel as 60 euros for a main isn't what I want to pay as much as I like fine-dining and it does have a michelin star. Unfortunately Barcelona is a dangerous city and I was attacked in the main square after leaving a club and refusing to hand over my wallet. I was found unconscious at the bottom of a flight of stairs leading to the metro in Placa Catalunya and was out cold for five hours. Apparently the only reason I'm alive is cos I fell sideways and not backwards. The police were very concerned and were a big help and very re-assuring but there are gangs waiting to rob you at night all throughout the centre. My advice is don't under any circumstances get separated from whoever you are travelling with as my friend also was mugged hours before I was but had the sense not to resist. The hotel staff when they found out were very concerned and apologetic but at the end of the day it's no ones fault except those guys who did it. Overall I'd advise anyone travelling to Barcelona to stay at this hotel but don't go out at night alone, don't hang around Placa Catalunya and the Barri Gotic if you don't need to and leave any valuables in the safety deposit box and only take out the money you'd need that day/night which is what I did so they didn't get anything.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cIf it's free it is ok!\u201d", "Author": "agasstuff", "ReviewID": "UR126731351", "Content": "Hotel Cram has great location, you can move from there to the center without problems.

The regular prices were a bit more than we might have wanted to pay, but since it was rather quiet time of the year we got a nice \"pay 2 stay 3\" deal and it was actually quite reasonable, especially in comparison with other similar hotels in the area. The staff is friendly and as already mentioned here, english speaking. The hotel is very clean and the room confortable, although rather small. However since we mainly wanted a room for sleeping and resting a bit during the day, it was well enough. Comfortable bed, nice bathroom. Free wi-fi. The breakfast was included in our offer, which made the price even better - the breakfast buffet was very good. The location is also very handy.

I've chosen this hotel because of the previous reviews and location. But the location was the only satisfying thing. When we arrived we saw a nicely designed hotel, but the longer we stayed, the more angry I became. Good: - Design. The hotel really looks like every detail was created with purpose and everything is designed in style - Location. In the middle of Eixample. We didn't used any transportation at all. Almost all tourist places are reachable by walking. Bad: - Bathroom. I was surprised to find out that the bath tube, which is mentioned on hotel's site, exists only on some rooms. My room had only shower, which doesn't make it 4 stars hotel. - Internet. By all standards it is NOT high speed WiFi. The signal was unstable and some times didn't work at all. I complained at least several times and the and the answer varied from \"we will check, in can't be possible\" to \"yes, we know there is a problem, but technician will be here only tomorrow morning\" - Working area. They have a nicely designed working area with the table you open in the cabinet , but ... no one thought about chair. You could only sit on the bed to work with your laptop, which is very uneasy. - Tourist amenities. It's very strange, but they don't have any tourist information available. - Service. Practically non existent. Starting from that every time I tried to complain about something, I didn't get any proper answer and ending with the fact, that twice during my conversation with the front desk, manager interrupted it in order to reply his phone, making me wait. Also, they had a pipe leak and switched off the water supply for the entire hotel every day of our 4 days stay. We didn't receive any apologies for it as well as every time I asked when they solve the problem, no one could provide an answer.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon 2 nights ago and had the absolute worst experience. First to give you some background on our knowledge for Barcelona and hotels in Barcelona. We both lived in Barcelona for a yr, have studied in Barcelona and visited our favorite city many times in the past so I know what I am talking about when ranking this hotel. I had researched this hotel and read all of the reviews before booking it and now wonder where all these people stayed at because this hotel did not live up to any of the expectations. First upon arrival they changed our room from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor which I later found our was due to the fact that the 3rd floor had a water pipe leak and they had moved other customers into our room. Second due to the 3rd floor water pipe issue, our room on the second floor didn't have ANY hot or cold water for our entire stay. The hotel did nothing to fix this even after our many complaints. The manager told me he would call our room which he never did, once the problem was fixed. We asked to be moved, which the people at the front desk said was not possible and offered a 25% discount on our room. On top of not being able to shower for two days, not being moved into another room and only being offered a 25% discount, our air conditioner also did not work at all. Once we found this out I asked for a full refund and explained that I would rather stay in a hostel with running water and air conditioner. Upon hearing this the incompetent assistant manager was only able to offer a 50% discount as he did not have the power to make a full discount to us until his manager was there the next morning. On top of this the hotel's WIFI doesn't work at all and the hotel staff was unable to provide a solution. This was the absolute worst hotel experience I have ever had, and I have stayed in boutique 4-5 star hotels all over Europe. This hotel should not be ranked as a 4 star hotel. Literally the only thing nice about the hotel was the central location. However, there are many other options with comparable location and price in Barcelona. This hotel ruined the end of our Honeymoon and I will never recommend this hotel to anyone I know or stay there again. The staff is completely awful and did absolutely nothing to attempt to fix the situation let alone give us a refund and help us move to place with AC, internet and running water hot or cold.

The bathroom (room 307) was super clean and the shower had an overhead rainfall shower, as well as a handheld piece. Loved it! Great toiletries that are restocked every day. Very soft white towels. Cool roof area with a great \"lap pool.\" Very small but very hip. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bedding was VERY clean-- and I am extremely picky about that. There was 1 channel in English, so that was a relief. The buttons on the nightstand for lighting were confusing- and I'm 26 and tech-savvy. But easy enough to figure out if you push all of them enough. The lounge near the reception desk was really cool- lots of magazines, super comfy chairs, a bar. Great wine selection! The restaurant is Michelin-starred and we went one night for dinner. It's almost too quiet in there, but the food is awesome. And they give you plenty of little complimentary treats before and after your meal. Incredibly nice staff. I left my camera there when I checked out and they saved it for me and mailed it back to me in Austin. How great is that?! If you go here, avoid Las Ramblas. The hotel is walking distance to La Boqueria though, which is SO cool! I definitely advise people to check out the little area of town where Santa Maria del Mar is. That was my favorite part of Barcelona. L'Olive is near the hotel and a great restaurant. The only cons were that the a/c wasn't amazing (but hey, it's Europe) and that the bathroom floods a little if you take too long of a shower.

My only compliant is a minor one... the shower looked cool, but the way it was configured, it was impossible to not drench the bathroom floor. And, the breakfast was way overpriced (so, I guess that's two). But those are minor in the grand scheme. Actually I think the hotel was our favorite part of Barcelona; yeah, the city is pretty, but we live in NYC, so it was a bit boring. And, on Sunday, it's like a ghost-town. As a side note- we took the train (the station is very close to Cram) to Sitges, and had a blast. That's a great little beach town- highly recommended.

The hotel is merely four or five blocks away from Passeig de Gracia and its major sites: La Pedrera, Casa Batllo, as well as the Metro stop linking you to most of the city. Very close to the University as well. The staff was very friendly, helping us with directions, restaurant recommendations, calling taxis and more. We did not choose to have breakfast included with our room rate, saving us about 20 euros per night. It was probably a wise choice because there are plenty of cafes within walking distance of the cafe where one can get coffee and pastry before starting the day.

On the roof is a small swimming pool (about 16 foot by 6 foot) but it is enough to cool yourself off in and sun loungers after a hard day sightseeing. There is a bar there as well but it wasn't open late when we were there. We didn't eat breakfast but it is served on the roof and looked nice. There is also a very reasonably priced Michelin starred restaurant on the ground floor. The staff are friendly and the place is spotless.

We got a fantastic rate through www.tablethotels.com, which may have influenced our positive attitude towards the hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They provided good advice on everything we asked and couldn't have been more helpful. The decor was modern, well designed (I am a designer myself) and spotlessly clean - if a little frayed here and there. The rooftop pool is small, but as large or larger than any other rooftop pools in Barcelona that I encountered. It has 8 sun beds and plenty of tables and chairs. Also an outdoor shower. It is a fantastic facility and we appreciated being able to cool down and relax after a morning's sightseeing. The rooms are certainly as large as any standard rooms in a 4 star in Ireland. There was plenty of storage and the free movies, games, information and internet access (via the TV and wireless keyboard) was a bonus for siesta time and for browsing information on Barcelona. The location was perfect - within walking distance of many attractions (including Casa Bastillo, MCCB, etc), very close to the Universitat Metro and lots of bars and restaurants. We tried 'Flaut' (mentioned below) and loved it for the great tapas and food. Also recommend 'Origins', which is nearby for fantastic tapas and Spanish produced ingredients. 'Teller Tapas' is another fantastic restaurant in the locality. For good food further afield, try 'Shoko', Paseo Maritimo de la Barcelonetta - fantastic Asian cuisine in a great restaurant in the trendy beach area. Have a fantastic outdoor lounge area for after dinner drinks overlooking the ocean. Another favourite was 'Cuines Santa Caterina', Av. Francesc Cambo in El Born - bustling, great food and fantastic atmosphere and choice. Make the effort to visit Sitges - a small coastal town about 30 minutes by train from central Barcelona. Bustling, great beaches, places to eat and people watch. Well worth the effort and a nice break from city life. Is a very gay friendly area. If you're visiting Sagrada Familia or Museo de Picasso get there early as the queues are extraordinary and difficult in the heat. I would highly recommend this hotel - it provided everything we needed and the rooms were much larger than we were expecting due to earlier reviews. I'm not sure if I would have been giving such a glowing report had we paid the full rack rate - but if you look around, you'll always get a better price.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "FreqTravelsing", "ReviewID": "UR18158061", "Content": "Good location in Eixample, clean rooms but very small even by European standards.

When we got there we were delighted - The glass entrance leads into the lobby where every surface seems to be shiny and brilliant.

Ok, they aren't huge, but we found our room more than adquate for our needs. The bathroom was excellent, the shower ran the full length of the wall and there were plenty of lighting options meaning optimum make-up appliance.

We found it quite funny but I don't think I'd feel the same if my boyfriend had been there and not my best friend!

The large, wall mounted LCD screen provides internet, on demand movies (including adult), and regular TV all included in the room rate.

Then the flashing blue light on the mini-pc behind the monitor, but reflected in the mirror was driving me crazy and I had to figure out how to power off the PC. There were also problems with picture freezing when changing TV channels that required a reboot. Bathroom was very modern. Excellent water pressure from both a ceiling mounted showerhead and handheld one. Bathroom door is only frosted glass with an unfrosted strip, so anyone that needs to feel privacy from their roommate may not like this. They provide some nice extras like mini toothbrushes and paste, strawberry glycerin soap (I wasn't crazy about it) and lotion. The lounge area looked cozy and inviting, the music was good but there was no one there everytime I passed. It was mid-December, perhaps a very slow time.

When you finally get to go up to your room, you arrive into an incredible heat in the corridors. It is like the subway in Paris. The room surprisingly small, although we had reserved a superior room with balcony and view over the city. Upon inquiry, the receptionst coldly explained that they took the liberty to downgrade our reservation, for we opted for a double room. And they do not have double superior rooms, or so he says. The room itself was not to tidy, cracks on the walls, dirt stains, etc. The thing advertised as swimming pool on the roof is hardlw one. It is rather a bath for birds. The expensive breakfast has nothing to do with the quality expected from a 4 star establishment, very boring, but at least the staff here is very friendly. The pros: the location: not in the immediate center, so it is rather calm. The coffee on the roof was rather nice. Also, the multimedia plasma screen with internet acces in the room is a good idea.

And the risk paid off - it's about 8 min walk to La Ramblas and Placa de Catalunya (which, by the way, this is where you can grab a tourist bus to see the city sights in one go for 18 euro per adult) - so it was no big deal at all. We took the Aerobus from Airport and hopped off at Barcelona Universtat (a couple of stops before final stop) - you literally cross the road head towards the university and walk up street called Aribau - 3 blocks and the hotel is on your right. My first impression of the hotel was \"mm looks cool\" - very mod and kinda funky. The staff were very friendly and made no fuss about our early check in. First impression of the room was that it was small but it was very clean, very modern and had everything you would need. The bed was very comfortable and yes I agree with previous reviewer the pillows were so comfy. The bathroom was great - loved the rain style shower and the heated mirrors. I agree with previous reviewer re frosted bathroom door - could be a little embarrassing for people who aren't totally comfortable with each other!! Not much privacy. All in all - I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and tell them to ask for a bedroom at the front - better view - noisy but windows drown out traffic at night. Good air con system. A word of warning.... you'll do lots of walking in barcelona... so be prepared for sore calves!! I'd recommend doing a bus tour (Red Line) to visit to Parc Guell, and Gaudi's unfinished Catherdral Sagrada Familia - worth seeing. Shopping is great - Zara Mango H&M, System - very good value.

After reading various reviews, my wife seemed set on the Cram although were disappointed to find many online booking companies said the hotel was full. She contacted the hotel directly on the off-chance and to our delight they confirmed they did indeed have a room free and charged roughly the same rate as was being suggested through third-party companies...this might be worth remembering. We took the AeroBus from the airport to Placa Catalunya, firstly based on cost (4 Euros each) and also that our hotel seemed close to this area on the map. We obviously got our map-reading wrong as it was a good 15 minute walk (mostly uphill it seemed!) to the Cram from the bus drop-off point and it seemed worse in 25 degrees heat carrying bags and suitcases. In hindsight, we would now have got a cab. But, albeit a little sweaty, we made it to the Cram and were delighted with the cheerful welcome and helpful staff. The hotel looks and feels very high quality as soon as you step inside. The rooms have recently been upgraded technology wise and now feature a PC-based communication and entertainment system that is clearly impressive. Via the 32\" wall mounted LCD TV, you have movies on-demand, full internet access via a wireless keyboard, about 30 Spanish tv-channels (plus CNN/BBC), Barcelona guides and history all on-screen and even some music choices to set the scene for you. Better still, all of this was included in our room rate with no additional charges for any aspect, even the movies. However, a warning. The system is new and is experiencing teething problems presently. In room 209, the wireless keyboard didn't work (no internet), the TV kept freezing up and when it did work, half the screen was fuzzy. We pointed this out and the staff were so helpful, finding us another room to move to where everything worked adequately, but we still experienced a few issues. Also, there are several hard-core XXX movies available in the movie-list to watch and although we eventually saw a parental lock-out facility, it wasn't apparent initially and could easily be overlooked....if you take children, be very careful. We're not prudes, but couldn't resist a quick look at these movies and even we were mildly shocked!! :-) Despite the teething problems, this is clearly a superb facility and I personally found it a godsend to keep up to date with my UK football news! The rooms are adequately sized and beautifully decorated, very modernistic and high-tec. The air conditioning worked flawlessly and the moody lighting pre-sets were very useful! The bed is huge and as someone else said, the pillows were so comfy. The bathroom is nice too, although perhaps suffering from some minor design flaws. You seemingly cannot avoid flooding the floor after a shower as the slide doors do not seal. I slipped on exit on the soaked floor and almost had a nasty accident. The glass door to the bathroom is frosted glass, but also has a strip about 4 cm wide down the edges with clear glass.....you can see right in. My wife and I weren't fazed by this, but some people might be. There really is no bathroom privacy whatsoever and there may as well be no door there at all. The swimming pool....oh how we chuckled! Again, through lack of proper research, we were of the belief that (perhaps like some UK hotels we are used to) there was a nice big pool on the roof to swim in and laze about by after a hard days walking. Erm...it's tiny, about three times the length of your average bath. Also, if you do use it, you have to walk through the bar/eating area lobby from the lift and back again, possibly dripping wet. Not ideal and from our perpsective, a bit awkward. Despite this disappointment, we saw the funny side of it, it was our own fault for not picking up on this. The breakfast was included in our rate and was (to us) very continental and not to our taste. That's us being picky and fussy though, as all we could stomach was croissants and coffee and as a result, the cost was not worth it. There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby that can provide a wide variety of food for less then half the cost. There is also a full room-service facility, which we decided to utilise due to there being no coffee making facilities in the room. Two coffees duly arrived about 20 minutes after ordering......TEN EUROS - OUCH! The hotel's adjoining restuarant was highly recommended by many to us, but as we were on a budget, we didn't try it out. I can confirm it looked and smelled good though! On one long walk back from Placa Reial to the Cram at about 2am we were confronted by a sinister looking chap who tried to accost my wife. The streets were empty and dark due to the Cram's location and therefore another warning....late at night, get a cab back, don't walk it, it feels very unsafe indeed. Our view is that it really is a couples hotel, perhaps geared at the high-tec modernistic younger couples as well. We loved it despite the negative comments above, mainly because of how well we were treated by the staff and the facilities (except the pool!) that were available.

My first impression of the room was that it was small. Having said that after the first day I didn't notice anymore and it was well designed. The modern theme was continued into the room which I also loved (flat screen TV, choice of lighting schemes at the touch of a button, etc.). The bed was big and comfortable and the pillows were amazing. The bathroom was surprisingly big and well designed with a couple of nice touches like a rain style shower and heated mirrors. The shower was easily big enough for two. A word of warning though, the bathroom door is frosted glass so don't share a room with someone you might feel self conscious around. I was with my husband so all was fine but for a parent and teenager or maybe even a couple on their first overnight stay somewhere it would be a disaster, no privacy! The few negatives about the room were that although the fixtures looked lovely they were a bit shoddy. The toilet roll holder, the fridge door and the nightlight were all loose. The only other problem was the 'view'. We faced the back of the hotel and looked into the balconies of the apartments and houses behind. It was ugly but we kept the curtains drawn. On hindsigt we should have changed rooms but I just didn't think about it at the time as it wasn't a big deal. Ask for a room over looking the street and I saw some of the superior rooms had terraces which would be worth it. The roof terrace was nice to relax on and towels were supplied. Yes the pool is tiny but perfect for a quick plunge to refresh yourself after a day sightseeing. It is cold though! A nice touch was the chair lift into it for wheelchair users. I'd never seen that in a hotel before and it seemed very thougtful. I liked sitting there in the evening, cocktail in hand, looking at the castle lit up on the mountain and setting the world to rights! We walked everywhere but be warned your legs will get a work out so if you have any difficulty in mobility be prepared to call taxis. The Rambla de Catalyuna is only a couple of blocks and La Rambla itself is about 15min walk. The port is about 30min walk. A local place to eat that I'd recommed in Cerveseria Cataluyna but eat outside and expect to wait for a table (worth it). Don't have breakfast in the hotel. \u20ac18 a head is ridiculous and you eat so late at night that you'll still be full in the morning. Stroll down to Rambla 31 on Rambla de Catalunya for a croissant/something else sweet and coffee for only \u20ac3 a head. Fresh and delicious. I would recommend this hotel as a very good 4*.
