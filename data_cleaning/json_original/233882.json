Personally I do not like this hotel and will not be my choice when I return to Berlin. But there's nothing wrong with it it just wouldn't suit into my preferences. The hotel is rather far away from the city but you can catch a train (about 1km-1.5km, i walk for 20mins) from the hotel on the main road. Its not a very well lighted road from the train station to the hotel so ladies be careful. The deco in the room is very old fashion and almost everything is old fashion in the room. There have 3 lifts and one is slightly bigger than the other 2 which is always a relief for people with big luggages or waiting to go into the lift when there's a big tour group. There is a restaurant and bar and breakfast is very good(good variety for a tour group) The shower is very tiny and the drainage is rather bad as the water doesn't seem to go down the drain quick enough, so after one shower, you have to wait for 10mins before the next one can jump in. the only good thing to me about this hotel is there is actually 3 supermarkets right across the hotel (one is about 5mins walk away). I've got very good service from the lady in the bar when I asked for hot water but the ladies at reception were grumpy.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cBasic but good\u201d", "Author": "ace28", "ReviewID": "UR127349506", "Content": "The hotel is a short walk from the metro stop, which you have to rid to get into the centre of the city.

The service staff were ok, but nothing special & were quite rude at times when retrieving things from their safety deposit box. They made a point of putting signs and notices everywhere to put everything in the safety deposit box as they except no responsibility for any theft, yet find it an annoyance to actually put your items in there. Breakfast was quite good. The major issue wiht the hotel for me was the bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned, and the access to the room was awful. The room was on floor 7 which only has 1 working lift that the porter used most of the time I needed to access it. There are only 2 lifts so you wait several times to actually be able to fit in one. Also, there was a massive school group staying on 90% of the rooms of level 7 when I was there, so they were running up and down the halls all evening, making it very noisy.
