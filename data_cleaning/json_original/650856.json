But if you want a friendly, quiet base to come home to after hours of walking around Rome, this is a great place. It's about 15 minutes' walk from Termini Station in a quiet back street two blocks north of the finance ministry, with coffee shops and restaurants nearby if needed. The area felt very safe both by day and night. The staff were friendly and welcoming and the breakfast of rolls and coffee (which was included in the price) set you up for the day. Our room was away from the street, and very quiet. The boys had a room facing the street, which was a bit more noisy, but the double glazed windows shut the noise out very effectively (although not sure how that would be in the summer as there is no air con). Bathrooms were clean, although like a lot of the decor, looked a bit tired, and there are a few DIY jobs that need doing, but the showers were lovely and hot and we got clean towels every day. It's a short walk to the Borghese gardens, Spanish Steps and the Barberini, a bit further to the Pantheon and Colosseum, but it can be done. We actually walked to the Vatican (2.7 miles - it took us 68 minutes and there is a lot of interesting stuff on the way) but taxis and buses are available from the Via XX Settembre a short walk away if you prefer. It's definitely no frills but for a family on a budget like us, it was just the job.", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Albergo Tizi", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d650856-Reviews-Albergo_Tizi-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$40 - $119*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Collina, 48</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "650856", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5d/fc/5dfce8f02f6fe72208607ccd5e23a4521large.jpg"}}
