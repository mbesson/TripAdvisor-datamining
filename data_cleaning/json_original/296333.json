Needed a 5* hotel, and Istanbul being considerably expensive for 5* accomodation this seemed a fair price and standard. Indeed it was. the staff were pleasant particularly the manager, who even joined us one night for a drink in our room and a chat. The room was Perfect, great view of the bospherous bridge. I am an explorer - so i did enjoyably walk from hotel through taksim square over the bridge and in to the old city and blue mosque bazaar region. this takes 30-40 mins. so a taxi might be better for most. This hotel is on the new city side. if i stayed again, i would shoose an old city side hotel, near blue mosque OR in taksim square, new city, its only 10-15 mins apart, over the bridge. All in all - of all the places i have EVER visited ISTANBUL ranks as high as either number 1 or 2, with Phuket being the other. Istanbul is amazing, so much culture and history in the old city, with all the modern cafes and resteaurants in the new city. The bazaar is amazing, the museum, the mosques and their architecture. Everything about Istanbul was great, thouroughly recommended destination. Hotel is perfect for business travellers. if you can - Visit a hotel called THE BEYTI restearuant, totally out the way, in a residential area, locals/taxi drivers may know it, the person we met on business took us there. ITS SPECIAL - they have a helipad, as all the hollywood stars, past and present kings/queens primeinsters, presidents, have all dined there, with photos throughout the reception - the WHOS WHO truly......FOOD amazing SERVICE unbelievable, they had like 3 waiters to our table of 3, a lighter out for my cigarette before the cigarette is even fully out the packet.

It's a fair walk from the nearest metro-bus stop, and a very long walk from the nearest metro station. That makes it difficult to access tourist-land unless you're prepared to pay taxi fares every journey. Service was faultless, from the doormen who whisked our luggage away from us, to the receptionists who had us checked-in in less than a minute, to the housekeeping staff who left the lift so we could use it. Hotel was clean, well maintained, comfortable, well-lit and really welcoming. Our room was very nicely presented, clean & tidy with working air conditioning, and an opening window. Only 1 extra pillow provided, but another was brought up to us within minutes of ringing reception. Breakfast at the weekend was served in the ballroom. Tables were very formal, not enough chairs to go round the tables (so we had to go in search of one), buffet display disorganised and scruffy, food looked like it had been dumped on plates, had to ask for coffee 3 times - very disappointed. Monday's breakfast, served in the gorgeous Turquaz Restaurant was completely different - clean, smooth, efficient, organised, calm - and an absolute pleasure to sit through. The rooftop bar is fantastic - great views over Istanbul, especially at night. Very pleasant atmosphere with gentlle jazz singer in the background. Drinks were very watered down though - another disappointment. The hotel is in a great location, with a great range of restaurants (and prices) in the area. The one night we ordered room service, we paid a ridiculous amount of money for the Dedeman special burger, which was very thin, very tasteless and very dry, and came on a huge plate - looking lonely all on its own (no accompaniments at all!). Great range of facilities within the hotel: the business centre was free to use, and we were given the password for the internet. Wireless internet is also freely available in rooms, once you've set up an account. Didn't use the pool & sauna, but they looked clean and well maintained. Hairdresser, dry cleaning, chocolate shop & wedding planners all on site; even socks available to buy in bedrooms! Check-out was fast and efficient. Bags taken off us as we left the lifts, and packed into a taxi while we were paying the bill. Slightly disappointed that we were charged for breakfast even though our rate was B&B, and we had to argue before they checked our booking. Sorted quite quickly, though no apology for the mistake. Really pleasant doormen waved us off, which ended our trip nicely. Overall, we'd stay again because the hotel is on the right side of Istanbul for us, and because the things that are good are very, very good. Might reconsider if we couldn't get a good rate though - not sure it's worth the 200 euros that they advertise. Certainly wouldn't use it as a tourist destination: there are better hotels that are better placed for accessing tourist Istanbul.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cFirst time in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Ando Vai C", "ReviewID": "UR124635368", "Content": "Hotel is well located for both business and touristic activities.

The breakfast buffet, both during the conference and the regular buffet (I stayed an extra night, after the conference was over) was equally good, with a wide variety of food well presented and prepared. The staff were very accommodating and friendly, doing their best to meet any requests. It seems that the hotel does a lot of conference business and has a series of smaller workshop rooms as well as a large conference hall. I was told by other conference delegates that the swimming pool was very good but didn't have time for a swim myself, unfortunately. Getting to the hotel was a bit challenging. I took the airport bus to Taksim Square and then a taxi from Taksim Square, which seemed to take a roundabout route there. The hotel staff were very helpful in aiding the taxi driver in calculating the fare in Euros, as I didn't have any local currency on arrival, and also in giving the taxi driver my destination when I was leaving.

The downstairs restaurant was pleasant and the breakfast buffet was extensive and enjoyable. There are several simple restaurants close to the hotel, but we did treat ourselves to a meal at the top floor Sky Bar which was very nice, with good service and a city view - expensive by Turkish standards but OK aginst British datums - and Service charge was not automatically added which meant that we were were able to tip personally, not just have it charged to the room. I would not describe this hotel as 5 star, probably a medium 4 star. I note that Trafalgar is using a different hotel next year. The hotel is close to the main highway from the airport, but when we arrived on a saturday late afternoon, this road was gridlocked and it took about 90 mins for the transfer.

Had a room on the 10th floor which was good as the Executive breakfast room was on the same floor and had a good choice and friendly staff. Reception staff were a bit useless. At check in the girl answered a phone call so it took her longer to check me in than her colleague who checked 2 people in whilst I was waiting. Didn't need this at 11.30 at night! Check out was worse, the guy barely spoke to me, didn't ask me to check the bill before I signed or anything. Good things were location as the office was a 10 minute walk away and the wake up calls were spot on every morning - though why they ring you twice when you picked up the first time is a puzzle. Good location if you need to be in the area, otherwise go for something nearer the main attractions.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel, definitely not 5 star\u201d", "Author": "CPTtravel", "ReviewID": "UR33219591", "Content": "Decent hotel with helpful staff. The rooms are basic and many weren't refurbished yet, especially on higher floors so the hotel doesn't have a 5 star feel to it.

The location is good for business definitely not great for anything else, it's on a busy street and public transport is a good 20 - 30 minute's walk from the hotel.

I had a double room on the 7th floor. Starting off, the lobby staff were generally friendly. All guests need to walk through a metal detector, but they generally let you pass whether or not you set off the alarm. The room was pretty basic: bed, desk, mini-bar, bathroom, basic television, no alarm clock, etc. The beds reminded me of a smaller version of what you would find in a US roadside motel (e.g. thin mattresses, comforter covers that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to touch with your bare skin). The curtains were pretty shabby and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even cover the entire window. Also, the walls were pretty thin; I heard a few muffled voices from other rooms. That said, the bathroom was probably the best part (although the quality of toiletries was also poor). The other hotel facilities were fine. Meeting rooms were adequate, restaurant staff were attentive, hotel bar was only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remarkably overpriced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd instead of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unbelievably overpriced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There was a fair amount of construction, so the rooftop bar was closed, and the building was covered with\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 some sort of unsightly construction-related paneling. The location of the hotel was excellent for those who plan on staying in the hotel and using the facilities. For those who would like to leave the hotel and see some of the sights, restaurants, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then the location is decidedly inconvenient (and it is off of most maps of Istanbul).", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNot bad but not 5 star\u201d", "Author": "Erins_travels", "ReviewID": "UR15523205", "Content": "I do not have a basis for comparison with other hotels in Istanbul but based on numerous stays at four and five star hotels for business in other cities I do not consider this hotel five star.

The room is adequately clean. It has a boutique hotel feel -- small lobby, no gift store. The second hand smoke everywhere is a big drag. The room was a little stuffy and when I tried to put on the aircon I was told that since it was only April and not yet hot outside it was not turned on yet so the room was warm and slightly uncomfortable. I believe the rate was around 230 USD a night.
