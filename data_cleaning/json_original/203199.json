We had a two bedroom/two bath which was much more roomy than anticipated. The beds and pillows were like bricks. Our room overlooked a picturesque alley way, however, there is an Irish pub that was right across from our room and it stayed noisy ALL night long till 3 a.m. or so. The customers of the pub were loud and obnoxious - talking, singing, smoking, ect. Our room was hot and stuffy in the evenings and the air conditioner was spitting out stale, mild air. The night air was crisp and wonderful, however, we couldn't open our windows at night because the smell of smoke from people standing on the outside of the pub. When the windows were closed it helped a tad bit but not enough to make a huge difference because the walls were really thin. We used our \"white noise\" and you could still hear the people talking. I would love to give this hotel a \"very good\" score, but I have to give them average due to the hard beds and sleepless nights due to the noise outside our window.

Our bedroom was small but clean, the same with the bathroom but we were in Rome to explore so for us it was a base to sleep & to change. My best tip is to catch the glass lifts to the top of the Vittoriano which is a 5-10min walk away. It had by far the best view of Rome and at only 7 Euro it was reasonable, it was empty when we went up and stayed there over an hour, we stumbled across this quite by chance as I hadn't read in any guide book that you could go to the top.

The main positive of the hotel is the location, right in the middle of the Forum and five mins from The Coliseum. Be sure to spend the extra to get a room with a forum view, ideally a corner room. The view is absolutely stunning, one of a kind. The hotel is clean, friendly staff and a pleasant place to stay. There are however a number of things they need to improve on. If you are a business traveller and need to do your emails then this might not be the best choice. The wifi signal does not properly reach every room and you might need to go into the hallway or down to the lobby to get a useable signal. Awkward if you want to do your emails in the comfort of your own room. Admittedly, they did not charge because of the bad signal but all said, it was a big inconvenience to me as I needed to be online every day. For the high fee of 10 Euros a day they should not only have this together but also have a LAN connection available along with a useable table that one could place the laptop on, not an uneven old wooden cabinet without any power points anywhere nearby. For the cost of the hotel room this should really be free to guests anyway. Also, the wifi is only for \u2018one device\u2019. Again awkward because I ideally needed a signal on my iPhone and my computer. They also need to put new safes in the rooms. Our one was very old and did not work. However, they had a safe in their office as a back up. This had its own individual key. The other gripe is the breakfast. Apart from the fantastic coffee, there was little else besides cakes or cereal along with a very small offering of cheese and ham. The bread and croissants were made with a sweetened mixture and not anything like one would expect. This however seems normal for Rome bakeries and cafes. I would say though that as an \u2018International\u2019 hotel one needs to serve an \u2018International\u2019 breakfast which would include breads for all tastes. Also, bearing in mind the cost of the hotel it would be more civilised to not have all the hot food items with an additional surcharge. The rooms are expensive enough anyway. Air con was just about adequate but if you like super cold, then you will not get the temparature down enough. All that said, I would stay there again definitely. Stunning location and views.

I am completely in love with the place .. and it has always occurred to me that forgiveness is an essential element of love. It saddens me that the starched linen bedside mats do not appear any more with the turndown service. It saddens me that the barman from the American Bar has finally retired (he wasn't THAT old, perhaps he'll be back next year). I notice that it gets more expensive at a pace well ahead of general prices, and the terms become tighter (100% up-front payment on booking for this May) and there is no longer fresh orange juice at breakfast. That's all a pity, and I see what other reviewers mean when they describe it as a location being milked by its owners. But you still eat breakfast looking down on the spot where Caesar was assassinated. You can throw a stone into Trajan's Markets. There is still nothing to compare with cocktails on the roof (even with a change of barman), looking past the tower of the neighbouring church to the floodlit Victor Emmanuel monument. Include a Sunday in your stay and you will breakfast to the peace of a traffic-free Via Dei Fori Imperiale. And the cool of the lobby, wifi at an antique writing desk, concierge in tails, it's all wonderful to return to after seeing the sights. I've more-or-less written the recent chapters of my own life story in terms of this hotel. I can't remember for sure, but I probably took my new wife to meet the Forum before I took her home to see my parents. We celebrated my first son's 18th here, and we will probably be back for his brother's in time. I brought my mother here when my Father died.

The first two hotels we stayed at were amazing, but the Hotel Forum was just an amazing let down. For the prices it charges and a 4 star rating we were expecting a certain minimum standard, but I fail to see how this hotel can still have a 4 star and falls below 3 star hotels I've stayed at. When we first arrived we were shown to a dark room at the back of the hotel which was awkward to get to. The porter noticed us looking at the two single beds and made a phone call to reception, which insisted it was us that had booked a twin room. My booking confirmation clearly stated double. Whilst we were waiting for a maid to push the beds together, we noticed the rest of the room. There was a large patch of black mould over a foot wide and 5 inches high on the wall by our bed. The rest of the walls were damaged with marks and the rugs in the room were covered in stains. The air conditioning unit was a separate unit below the window which barely did anything. We rang the company we had booked through to complain which seemed more concerned with defending the hotels rating then listening to what we were saying. They did say they would speak to the manager of the hotel and call us back. We were then informed that there was nothing that could be done as the hotel was full, but if we were still unhappy in the morning they would see about changing our rooms then. After telling them quite clearly we were not staying in a mouldy room, we were given two options, pay a cancellation charge of an unknown amount or look at other rooms which had magically become available. We decided to look at other rooms. We didn\u2019t receive any apology and were sent the non-english speaking porter to show us the rooms. Eventually chose the only one with a double bed. Whilst at least clean it was still nowhere near a 4 star. The walls were still marked, the bed cover had black marks on it, the floor edging was missing in places, the bedside lights were hung like pictures with bear wiring in the back (only one worked) and the light switch by the bed could be pulled 1cm away from the wall. The room as with the rest of the hotel was lit with a very low wattage energy saving bulb which gave the room (as with the hotel) a very dinghy feel. The air conditioning unit was better, but had only an on or off mode. After deciding to try and make the most of our stay and just accept that we wouldn\u2019t want to be in the hotel much, we began to change. At which point the porter walked back through the door with other guests showing them the room. Again we weren\u2019t offered any apology for this. This left us feeling quite uncomfortable whenever we were there and led to us putting a chair in front of the door every time we were in there. Whilst there is no turn down service, this does not bother me in a hotel. The first full day of being in the hotel though, no one cleaned our room. We certainly saw the maids about, but I can only assume because we took an hour nap in the room at 2pm, this didn\u2019t fit in with their own schedule and so didn\u2019t bother coming back. The rest of the hotel is equally as worn and dinghy with no natural sunlight. The stairs are lined with a white fabric every day that by lunchtime are brown with dirt. I can assure you that the term \u201ccharming\u201d used by some is just a polite way of saying tired and old. The restaurant does have a good view, which I can\u2019t deny. The breakfast was okay, but simple and with no hot items. The staff are polite although it seemed to depend on what reception staff were on as to whether they would acknowledge you when you walked through the door.

This was in fact the second time we have been to this hotel - the first time was in 2007. We found the hotel to be an ideal place to stay when visiting Rome.

The breakfast room was just great - on the roof with fab views of the city. The choice of food was good and there were loads of croissants and cakes to pick from. We did not eat in the restaurant so I can't comment on that. I think the best thing about this place is the location. It really is close to everything and easily within walking distance to all the main sights. The furthest thing was the Vatican - we got a taxi there but wallked back, so it is still not so far that you can't walk there. The only areas for improvement are the televisions - very small. We had two in our twin rooms - one was quite old fashioned, wall mounted and small. The other was modern but still small. It wasn't a big issue though - as we were not there to watch TV. We didn't use the internet so I can't comment on that service. The shower was tiny - if you were bigger than size zero then you would have struggled to manouevre. The nozzle was mounted above the bath - sideways instead of longways - so the water went right up against the shower curtain and left really no room to move.

We picked the hotel based on it's location and the reviews op TripAdvisor. To summarize our experience: perfect location, but poor hotel.

Hey that was all we needed, since we spent all our time sightseeing. But why a tv set with a screen smaller them my iPad? Just remove it all together . One thing that bugged me was the following: when we made the reservation we asked for a quiet room. During the checking, the man at the reception said: : You wanted a quiet room, right? I have one for you!\". But I wonder what he means with quiet? We had room 413, right beneath the restaurant. There were many loud noises (tables, chairs moving, piano playing, etc. till late). That's not what I call a quiet room. We didn't have dinner in the restaurant, so I can't comment on that. I did look at the menu however, and the prices were so incredibly high we didn't even think about eating there. Same is true for the roof bar (\"American Bar\").: 6 euros for a soda???? Imagine beer, rum, wine, etc... The view from the bar and the restaurant is amazing tough! You can see the colloseum, the forum romanum, etc. These sights are across the street. Breakfast was very limited and certainly not what I expected from this 4* hotel. Quality ok, choice not. The hotel is old and it shows. So are the concierge and the men at the reception. The thing is: they are very friendly, but the are really no help. I asked several times for directions. And every time the same thing: \".that's difficult to explain, but why don't you take a taxi, is easy and cheap\". Or they give simply incorrect information. But what bugged me most was this: the day before we checked out I asked if we could have a late checkout, or use a room for 15 minutes to change clothes and take a quick shower (our flight was at 8pm, and after walking around the entire day it is nice to freshen up. The response: \"Of course, no problem. Just ask me again tomorrow when you check out, so I can keep a room, because we are very busy.\" But the next morning the story was: \"yes we have a room for you, let me see.....hmmm... will be hard to have it cleaned...hmmm... oh sorry we're fully booked, but just drop by when you pick up your luggage, and we'll be able to help you\". But when we got back we found our luggage just hanging around the lobby and there was no room, etc. It all added to our opinion that the friendliness is all fake. Which leaves me with a major plus for the hotel: Location, location, location! The hotel is next to the colloseum, the Forum Romanum, Piazza Venezzia is 3 minutes walk. Pantheon and Trevi fountain is abouy 15-20 minutes walk, etc. There are many buses and a metro stop within a few hundred yards that take you everywhere else in town. The location can't be beat!

Our Suite overlooked the Forum; my second most favorite place in the world. I was in heaven here. Loved it! My husband liked the food, but no American breakfast. The shopping directly around the hotel is very touristie. You can take the Metropolitana Linea B - Laurentina, to the third stop from Roma Termini, (1. Termini, 2, Cavour, 3. Coloseo) and get off at Coloseo. Turn right out of the uscita (exit) and walk down Via Imperiale until you get to Cavour, about three blocks or so. You'll know your're at Cavour when you get to the stop lights and the ticket booth to enter the Forum is right there too; it will be across the street on your left. Cross over Cavour and walk up Cavour...this is the weird and challenging part...Ok, there is a very narrow side street right at the beginning of Cavour probably 100 meters after the stops lights on the left. There are two pizzarias beside the side street. Turn left on the side street, you are now staring at the Hotel Forum in front of you. Walk on the side walk on the right, NOT ON THE STREET ITSELF because the cars are insane coming up that street. Literally, the hotel is right there in front of you. You cannot miss it. You are literally going to run straight into it. Its like a yellowish/orangish color building. I could see the very, very top of the coloseo from our room. Loved it.

The hotel may be fine for leisure travel, but not suitable for working, or staying long periods in the room. The check-in process was fine, and staff seemed pretty friendly. I was given a voucher for a welcome drink. However, I was told that I arrived too late at night (8 pm) to actually use the voucher. The room itself is very small, and the decor is pretty old fashioned, though some may consider it rustic Italian charm. I would personally leave this type of historic building with character for sightseeing only, and be able to retire to a calm oasis with modern amenities. Cleanliness seemed decent, but be on the look out for insects that may fly into your room from the window. The window was open when I first got in. The bathroom is also small - I am a slim female, and had issues with my elbows knocking on the shower knob while shampooing.. unintentionally giving myself a cold shower. I don't know how an average sized guy would be able to manage it. The location is probably the best thing about this hotel. It's a close walk to the Colosseum and lots of shopping. Also, being right across from the Forum, it presents pretty views from the breakfast room. Breakfast itself was an unimpressive spread, but the croissants were definitely delicious. You can order hot items for an extra fee, but the normal items include cereals and pastries, and 1 variety of cheese and cold meat. The #1 reason why I decided to switch hotels was due to the poor internet connection. The primary reason for my trip was business, requiring a constantly reliable internet connection. Although the staff gave me the unexpected perk of 48 hours access to the wifi for free (they normally charge for it), it was almost unusable, and I'd have been even more upset if I had to pay for it.

In the two hours I had to spare before leaving for the airport I was able to see many of the sights on a walking tour. If you only have half an hour to spare you would be able to walk out and see the Coliseum and a few other suitably old things to give you a flavour of the place. The room itself was small, and rather old-fashioned. The TV was tiny with poor reception, and the lighting in the room was rather cold and un-atmospheric. Fortunately I didn't need to do any work - it would have been impossible because there was no suitable desk for working. The breakfast was OK, but nothing special. I was happy because there was some cereal and nice fresh-fruit salad, but I could imagine those with more extravagant breakfast tastes would be disappointed.

We decided that this would be our \"splurge\" hotel and paid about $200/night for a double room (not much of a splurge but we paid about $120/night for our rooms in Paris and Venice). The location was indeed fantastic (literally across the street from the Forum and other ruins, a <5-minute walk to the Colosseum (and the Coloseo Metro stop, which was convenient), and a nice central location for many other sights. The view from the rooftop bar/restaurant was lovely, and we enjoyed breakfast there every morning. The room was spacious and the mini-bar was really well stocked with alcohol, beer, Coke/Diet Coke/Sprite, chocolates, nuts, and other fun things that made for good late night snacks. Loved the windows here - they were completely sound and light-proof, so when they were fully closed we were completely cocooned. At one point we took a midday nap and when we woke up at 2 PM we thought we had slept until 2 AM because it was so quiet and dark!! However, the rest of the experience was pretty bad. Our room (404) smelled AWFUL!!! It smelled like sewage or rotting meat. We had to keep the window open when we left to try to air it out, but it didn't help much. We should have complained and switched rooms but we were exhausted when we arrived so we just dealt with it. The bed was probably the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in. It was two twin mattresses pushed together, and they seemed to be very old, worn out mattresses. The springs were lumpy and poked up in odd places, and the outside of each mattress was firm, meaning that the middle of the bed was rock hard so we basically had to cram onto one of the twin mattresses. We each got one hard, lumpy pillow. Altogether it was probably the worst sleeping experience I've ever had in a hotel. Luckily we were so exhausted at the end of each day that we slept fine, but we woke up with lots of back and shoulder aches due to the bad bed. The TV was tiny and didn't work very well, which was annoying but not that big of a deal. The internet was completely useless - it was very slow and went down about every five minutes, even though the router was right outside of our room. In all of our European travels, this was the only hotel where we had to pay extra for internet, and it was also the only hotel where the internet was completely unusable. Very frustrating, since my fiance and I both have jobs where we have to have internet access even when on vacation. The decor was dated and spartan, far from impressive. We don't care that much about what our rooms look like, but based on the nice lobby and the outrageous prices at the restaurant we expected more from our rooms. The toilet was crammed into a corner so there was little leg room, and it didn't flush very well. The thermostat did absolutely nothing - we had it on the coldest setting and our room was a sauna when the window was closed. The included breakfast was good but not great. No hot items like eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. Basically just pastries, cereal, and fruit. I do have to admit that the coffee we had there was the closest thing we got to regular old black American coffee in all of Europe, which was nice. The staff was polite and nice but seemed mostly uninterested in us. They spent most of the time crowded around the big-screen TV in the lobby watching soccer/football. We might have had a better experience if we had complained to the management and switched rooms. However, our parents who were there with us switched rooms, and they said both of their rooms were about as bad as ours. All in all, I would avoid this hotel. There are plenty of other hotels in the area that will serve you much better. If you do stay here (or nearby), check out the La Taverna dei Fori Imperiali which is right next door. Best restaurant in Rome! We ate there twice, which we NEVER do when traveling abroad. The matriciana there is FABULOUS as is the chocolate souffle, and the house wine is really really good.

The hotel has great charm and is well attended by the reception area - they are only too happy to attend to your needs. The rooms are great, and I would recommend that you pay that bit extra for the Deluxe room which overlooks the Roman Forum. There is a rooftop restaurant which is expensive but for that special treat well worth the money - try the apricot flambee! The hotel is mid-way between the Colosseum and the Victor Emmanuel Monument and looks directly over the Roman Forum. All the sights are with easy reach mostly 5 - 25 minutes walk max (the only exception is the Vatican - although you could probably walk it in 40-45 minutes - taxi or Metro). The streets at the back of the hotel have restaurants and there is one square nearby with six restaurants (turn left out of the entrance and walk up the narrow street when you come to a church by a main street, turn left and its there on the right with a fountain) - when its too hot the Romans come out to cool off at night. Musicians travel the square playing to the people in the restaurants. All the while the area is lit up and seeing these monuments at night is great. During the day we used to lunch on pizza or proscuitto and melon washed down by Prosecco!! If you are there for a week take the train to the coast - Stella Polaris - and pay to go into one of the beach areas - it was great to relax and cool off in the clear waters of the Med. We also went up into the hills by train to Tivoli to see the Gardens and it is then a short bus ride to Villa Adriana - well worth it, not many people visit! Take the trains on these trips rather than pay for a guided tour its much cheaper! We saw much more of Rome on foot and a guide book - you have to visit Trajans Forum - you can see it from the road but it is much more spectacular inside! We loved all the sights and everywhere people were very friendly.

All furniture was old and worn and, what was awful, was a terrible smell, probably coming out of the bathroom. The room had no view at all, the old window looked out on a side of the building closed around (completely dark in morning also) and permeating all noises from there -- the worst being noise of water coming down from tubes, which kept me awake most of the night.

The closets which have sliding doors are so small that once you hang a jacket or a shirt the sliding door cannot be closed unless with the other hand you ensure that the jacket is turned at an angle.

Beware of the BUFF\u00c9, the headwaiter wanted to charge us by the plate because he saw the buff\u00e9 as a starter to the rest of the dinner, we didn't!!! The consierge and the front desk, gives you the kind of service they have to but with no enthusiasm or heart at all. We had a room with a pretty view, but that was it. Hotels in Rome is a tricky thing but since they have all the tourists all the time they don't really care about your treatment, there will always come a new guest the following day.

A triple room consisted of separate bedrooms (small by American standards but ample by European stds) and a fairly large luxury bathroom. We had a mini refrigerator packed with expensive treats - we moved them aside and moved in our water bottles; and they were great to return to at the end of a day sight-seeing. Our room was on the 2nd floor (3rd floor actually) and in the back. In mid-August the hotel was only half full and quiet, but fully staffed - very nice! We loved starting the day with the excellent buffet breakfast on the beautiful rooftop restaurant. Behind and above that is a rooftop bar which is wonderful on summer nights. Staff was professional in that European way - we liked them. They were all eager to please if you took time to notice.

After reading some of the recent middling reviews and knowing hotels in Rome in general, I was prepared for some possible disappointment. However, the Hotel Forum was exactly what I had hoped for. For someone with an interest in antiquities, the location could not be better. You are literally on top of one of the Roman forums, and a short walk from the Forum, the Colosseum, the Palatine, etc. Being near the Colosseum, the hotel is also just a few blocks from its associated metro stop. The building is centuries old and part of a church (the bells ring each morning), so there's no fancy stuff like a purpose-built hotel. That is, no recreation facilities, pool, etc. I didn't expect them, so I didn't miss them. Yes, the room was small, and in America for this price would have been a multi-room suite with hot tub. Here, we got a clean room, with a queen-sized bed, a wooden floor, rugs, period furniture, venetian glass lights, and a (small) well-updated bathroom done in marble with a tub and shower, all in excellent condition. The room had decent closet space, a phone (never used), and a wall safe. In fact, the entire hotel was well-appointed and in excellent condition. There is a (really small, think phone booth) elevator, although we generally used the stairs. The rooftop restaurant was terrific for morning breakfast before hiking through the ruins. Oh, and the rooms are air-conditioned. We used the restaurant once for dinner. The multi-course meals were quite good, but I will agree that it was overpriced for what could have been had elsewhere in town. Some people have complained about the lack of eating places nearby. Technically that is true - the forum area has few restaurants beyond some not terrific cafe type places next door. However, a 15-minute walk over to the vicinity of the Trevi Fountain/Pantheon area will take you to about a million little restaurants all of which are pretty tourist friendly. And in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, particularly during the day, there are loads of cart vendors and such selling pizza, gelato, etc. which are really quite good for a lunch in front of the Colosseum. Our room was near the back of the hotel. Our balcony window looked out over a small alley, but had a clear view of the forum to the right. Most of the rooms are like this. The hotel itself is rectangular, with the narrow side directly facing the forum, and the long side overlooking the alley. From looking at the floor plan, it looked as though there are a handful of rooms with potentially no view. Yes, the rooms are noisy, mostly from traffic noise, but it is Rome. Bring earplugs. The balcony doors look like they have been recently updated with airtight doors, so if you seal them at night they cut down on the noise a lot.
