Good towels and crisp bed linen. 3 mins walk from the tram stop and a few mins from the Blue Mosque, Cisterns, Palace etc. The room we were allocated was not in the main hotel building but having read reviews we were aware this might be the case before we booked. Our room was clean and comfortable and the staff extremely friendly. Coffee and tea facilities were available in the room and air con. if required. Our room was located 2 floors up which was not a problem to us but may not suit everyone as there is no lift - not sure if main building offers a lift. A very good breakfast selection (hot and cold) was served in a large room with a fabulous terrace offering views of the Blue Mosque and surrounding area. Breakfast is served in another hotel which is a short stroll away (50-100 yards at most) down the road - it might not sound ideal but it really is not a problem and your reward is certainly worth the stroll. Overall we thought that this hotel was very good value for money and in an excellent location for our needs. Tip. Next door to our building was a travel agency that offered a service to the airport for 5.00 Euros each - really good value. On our arrival we caught the Light Railway which connects with the tram it only cost about 4 Euros (Probably not ideal if you have loads of luggage). A lovely spot to have a sundowner and dinner is under the Galata Bridge where you will find a really good selection of restaurants and places to sit and watch the world go by....fabulous. We did not use the river tours but caught local ferries which only charge about 2 Euros to visit the Asian side of Istanbul.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague", "Title": "\u201cNice small hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "via14", "ReviewID": "UR127789681", "Content": "Central location but nice and quiet place close Hagia Sophia.

The other staff were equally as helpful, and always willing to try and overcome any language barrier. The room itself was lovely. With the price paid I wasn't expecting a lot, but the room was furnished with authentic local decoration, and was well maintained and clean (as was all of the hotel). From our room's balcony we could see the magnificent Blue Mosque, and we had a view out over the sea of Marmora. Whilst I appreciate not everyone will have this, all the rooms we saw seemed spacious and well cared for. The hotel is spread over two sites along the same street, with breakfast and meals provided from another hotel further along. We had breakfast included, which was well worth it. Running from 0730 to 1030, the timings are perfect for sightseers wanting an early start, or for those wanting a more relaxed morning. The food is standard fare, and it keeps you going until lunch. It is worth noting again the excellent location of the hotel. A five minute walk to the nearest tram stop and the Blue Mosque. The Aya Sofia, Topkapi Palace and the Basilica Cistern are all within ten minutes walking distance, and once you are on the tram, you have access to the whole of the city. My least favourite part of the hotel was the lack of a lift to the top floor where we were located... it would have been much treasured after a day's sightseeing!

The room was basic, with the decor and linens seeming a little older. BUt let's be realistic you will probably only spend time at the hotel to sleep. There is so much to do and explore in Instabul. Lots of great little shops around. The A/C was decent, also older and it tool some time to cool the room. I was there in september and wonder what it would have been like if I went during the really warm season. Sulthmet is a very busy and touristy area. All though the hotel was close to major attractions I was wishing to stay in another area. I wondered if staying at a different location and spending slightly more would have been worth it.

Also unlike other hotels in the area breakfast is included and was really first class. You need to walk 50yds to the sister hotel for the breakfast but its well worth it. The restaurant is on the roof with fantastic views of the Bosphorous and the blue mosque. The selection of food was as good as you will ever get in anything other than a 5 star hote and in many cases better than that. 4 or 5 hot items plus at least 6 cheeses 6 cold meats 6 pastries and breads as well as the usual cereals fruits ect, one very nice touch was 4 homemade jams and natural honey comb with the honey running out. This restaurunt also proved to be a good place to eat at night with very competitive prices for a place with such a great view. There are a few things to watch out for and avoid. We were put into the annex which is on the other side of the road from the main hotel, no lift or lounge here and we asked to be moved , they said this was no problem after the first night as all were booked on that night, we agreed but decide to stay with our first room as it was so clean and quiet. Rooms on the upper floors are a MUST, they are airier,quiter and some offer good views. Rooms do have a minimal mini bar but those in the annex do not have safe deposit boxes although the hotel dose advertise these (main building only perhaps). Staff were friendly and helpful and even the annex had free wireless internet connection. For the price(which was low) its hard to fault this hotel and I would stay there again. 5 star for its situation in town (even the Grand Bazzar was only 15 mins walk and there was a large taxi rank close by) 5 star for the included brekfast 4 star for the room (it could have been bigger and the bathroom a little more modern) 4+ for value for money", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cologne", "Title": "\u201cVery friendly, unbeatable location\u201d", "Author": "lexi0214", "ReviewID": "UR42216940", "Content": "The staff is without exception extremely friendly and goes out of their way to help.

The hotel is excellently located, easy walking distance from the Blue Mosque, Arasta Bazaar, Aya Sophia and Topkapi Palace, all of which we explored on foot the following morning. Our only problem was that pick-up from the airport was included in the booking and , although I had e-mailed Omer numerous times to ensure we would be met, and despite his assurances that someone would be waiting for us, when we arrived at the airport, no-one was there to meet us. We waited 1/2 hour then phoned the hotel, and the gentleman on duty (not Omer) said he would send his son. After another half hour of waiting we phoned again and he said someone was on the way. Finally a young man came after we had been waiting more than an hour. Not a great introduction to Istanbul! After that however, things were fine. The hotel is in a narrow cobblestoned street just behind the Blue Mosque. It was Ramadan and when we arrived in the evening there was music and dancing, and food stalls and fairy lights in the area around the Blue Mosque and we quickly fell under Istanbul's spell. As we walked out of the hotel and up the road we came across the Whirling Dervish at the Cafe Mescale and traditional music.( it was around 8.30 pm) We enjoyed local food and sweets at the food stalls. We had a family room which had a double bed, and a separate room with 2 single beds for our children. Bathroom was OK though the sink had a large crack in it. Breakfast was served the next morning at their sister hotel across the road on the rooftop terrace. Lovely food and wonderful view across the Bosphorous. Following breakfast we explored the sights - Topkapi Palace, Aya Sophia, Basilica Cistern etc. We made brief use of the free internet terminal at reception prior to check out.

Not the hotels fault, the snoring. Otherwise no complaints, location great, daily cleaning and ample toilet paper! Double bed way comfortable, single beds a bit on the hard side. Didn't mind the short walk for the buffet breakfast , worth it for the view. Good value for money. Would stay there again anytime. Travel tips: Beware of the taxi man who made off with not only twice the going rate but also an extra 100YTL. We learned the public transport system pretty quickly after that and found it very easy for getting around. Also the cute cherry juice seller,all dressed up in his costume . No sooner has he the children at his side and urging u to take photo while proffering minute amount of juice in our cups when he lands u with the bill. My husband hates to look at the photo.
