Even though there was no room available to us when we arrived early the morning our luggage was kept safely. Our Superior room was just excellent - huge for a European hotel. We felt like royalty in our room. The hotel is really a 2 minute walk to the Metro and we used the metro extensively - it's the only way to see Paris. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was pleasant enough. LOVED this hotel and the location. Highly Recommended. To get to the hotel from CDG: buy a Paris Visite card - you won't regret it and will use it often. Take RER B (regional line which you'll see if you follow the train signs). Get off at Gare du Nord. Walk to Magenta station on RER E. Take RER E in the direction of Haussmann Saint-Lazare and get off at this station. Walk to Line 3 and take the train towards Becon. Get off at Porte de Champerret. Walk up the stairs. When you get outside go left and cross a street to continue down Berthier Boulevard.

Looking at the lobby already gives you the understanding that it's a different place. A piano in the center.. Nice seating area with very nice lights. Speaking of lights.. The room numbers are shown on the floor at the entrance to your room, with special light effects. Great add on! I stayed on the second floor, in Room 24. There is an elevator in the hotel. Free WiFi in the room and in the rest of the hotel as well. The room was kind of petit, but is very clean and well organized. LCD TV on the wall, Safe in the closet, fridge and a nice working table. Nice surprise was a complimentary Avian bottle of water welcoming you in your room. It could have been nice if was given daily however. My room hade the bathroom separated from the toilet. It is nice, but kind of weird as it was on both sides of the room, when the toilet was next to the window, across the bed.. Breakfast: Wow, it was great! Many options to choose from, including hot dishes, such as scrambled eggs and sausages. Fresh juice, pastry, fruit salad, yogurt, cut your cheese plate and much more. Location: Metro (Line # 3) is 3 minutes from the hotel. Turn right from hotel exit and just walk 3 minutes straight to the metro station (Porte de Champerret). The hotel is located 15 minutes walk to the Etoile (Arc De Triomphe) and Avenue Due Champs Elysees. My meetings were at Levallois Perret business area, and I managed to walk from the hotel (15 minutes) and explore nice areas of Paris that I didn't see before. Many nice places to eat all around the hotel, and on the way to the Etoile.

I had to question this and it was soon rectified and i hope not something that was done on purpose. The cleaners and staff around the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. - The room. We stayed in a superior suite at around 170 euros per night and it was definitely worth the money. We had a huge free standing bath and large bed of two twins pushed together. It was a lovely room and very uniquely decorated making it feel more like your own home and not a souless hotel room. - Helpful hints. Get a book of 10 tube tickets from the station for around 12 euro's it works out much cheaper than buying single tickets. Don't go for the hotel breakfast at 20 euro's per person (outrageously expensive) when there are lovely patisserie's around the hotel where you can get a tastey croissant and coffee from 3 euros. If you're staying on the Tuesday night be aware they have a live music night (music wasn't to my taste) and even on the third floor kept us awake until past midnight. Splash out on a couple of nights in a good quality restaurant, and save where you can by having picnic's under the eiffel tower and buying wine from the supermarket, otherwise the 8 euro beers and 20-30 euro main courses really start to drain your budget!

The room was very large (Theodore de Banville Room) and was very comfortable. It was well decorated for the price and we loved that it had 2 sinks and good Air Conditioning. A/C did go out for a short period and reception kept us updated and it was fixed promptly. They also provided a fan which was sufficient. We very much liked the location - its not in the crazy area of Paris - its about a 15 min walk to the Champs, or a 2 min walk to the Metro. It was very nice to come back to a quiet neighborhood in the evening. There is also great restaurants within walking distance. I sometimes stay in MontMartre if we want more action - but really love the peace and quiet in the neighborhood around Hotel de Banville. The staff was very friendly, especially the breakfast server, who always had a smile and always knew what I wanted! - and the breakfast is always fresh, a good selection, and incredible breads! A great value. My only complaint is the hotel taxi. I used taxis daily and this was the only time I felt ripped off. He agreed to take one of us to CDG airport for 50E and to drop me off at Le Bourget airport on the return. Said he would still make it back for his next pick up..OK...but at Le Bourget he wanted another 48E as said he might miss his next fare. We made great time he wasn't missing anything....so congrats - you ripped me off, I hope the hotel takes note and stops using you!

The beds at the Hotel de Banville are some of the hardest I have ever come in contact with. My friend and I slept on the floor rather then toss and turn all night on our double beds. While relaxing on the lawn in front of the Louvre my friend shared with me that the lawn was most certainly softer then her bed. I once stayed in a convent in New Mexico and the nuns there have softer beds. We inspected our mattress at night and I believe there was a wooden board under the case but I can't be sure. That bed just didn't give. The linens were somehow ironed to the bed and I believe one was expected to sleep over the comforter. If it sounds weird it's because it was. I would not recommend any kind of intimacy in that bed for safety purposes. Men booking their honeymoon should be advised. The hotel advertises being, \"10 Minutes from the Arc de Triomphe\" That's not helpful as the Arc de Triomphe is a long walk to many other attractions. Service was unfriendly. I had trouble connecting to the wifi and the mean man who watches the place at night got snippy on the phone. This is a very loud hotel and in the early morning it sounds as if someone is emptying the china closet by playing frisbee. One woman at reception kept giving us the wrong directions. Over time we discovered she had left and right confused. They suggested we ride the metro to Versailles which is not good advice when their is a high speed train available. While it was a relatively clean room we found a pair of someone else's shoes behind a chair.

When I arrived, the attendant at the front desk was counting out money and completely ignored me despite the fact that I was blatantly standing in front of him for a good 2 minutes (keep in mind it was almost midnight and I was exhausted). 2. I asked if someone could help me with me bags - the attendant's response was \"no, but I can push the elavator button for you.\" 3. I got to my room (delux), which was reasonably sizeable for a room in Paris (albeit a little kitchy, you wouldn't want to be an epileptic looking at the wallpaper), however was disappointed by the fact that the shower was not attached to the wall - it was one of those old fashioned ones attached to the bath. Also, there was no vanity mirror and lighting in the bathroom was poor. There was also no plug near a mirror (for anyone who wants to blow-dry their hair). 4. I realised (annoyingly) as I was getting into bed that the two bed-side lights wouldn't turn off - so I had to re-dress and call down to reception. The attendant sounded annoyed I was bothering him, and said he would be right up; 20 minutes later (at this stage it was almost 1 am), I called down again and asked when he was planning on making an appearance as I would like to get some sleep if possible - he sighed, said \"yeah, yeah, yeah I'm on my way\" and hung up. He did come up a few minutes later and messed around with the lights until he figured it out (basically the switch is this weird dimmer circle which you apparently have to press 15 times to get it to (either) turn off OR go super bright - basically, they are glitchy and need to be replaced. 5. I was woken every 20 minutes the entire night by what sounded like a passing train (it must be near a railway because the mirrors shook each time one went by). I stay in Paris frequently and can say that this is not a 4 star hotel in terms of service, maybe if you are not in a rush/have a strong desire sleep when you stay at a hotel it might be better for you - I can only speak for myself. I would much sooner recommend Le Meridien Etoile, the prices are comparable, the rooms are far better equipped and the service runs smoothly.

We have stayed at this hotel for over a decade, but this trip was exceptionally wonderful! The Hotel De Banville has gone through a lot of renovation over the past few years, and their latest is simply magical! When we stay at the Hotel we reside in their Apartment de Marie, which is on the top floor. Since our last visit in October 2009, this space has been completely renovated, as well as a new 'lift' installed. The Apartment de Marie has always been a delight to stay in, particularly because of the view of the Eiffel Tower and the Arch de Triumph that can be seen from the apartment. However, since its renovation, it feels like being on top of the world in a white castle with great attention paid to the colors and furnishings!! The living room now has an entire wall of windows opening up a vista view of Paris. It felt like pure fantasy during our stay. You can luxuriate in the six foot plus bathtub while enjoying the incredible skyline of Paris. Especially in the evening when the Eiffel Tower has twinkling lights all around that seem to reach to the sky. On top of that, is the Tuesday Evening Piano Bar experience, which now includes additional musicians and singers. And, as if all of that weren't enough, the service at this hotel seems to grow ever better with their physical improvements. I have recommended this Hotel to several of my friends, and they all return to the States with huge gratitude for the accomodations and se rvice provided by the Hotel staff. Yes, we all had to suffer a bit during the renovations, but that is done now, and it is simply a 'slice of heaven' on earth.

In addition, (a British thing) but there were no coffee / tea making facilities ...but a pricey mini bar was available as an alternative if you required a drink. Sadly, the room did not reflect the quality of the rest of the hotel which generally was exceptionally clean and well laid out. Have since noted comments by the manager about rooms being decorated in December ...but can advise that this has clearly not happened. The bedroom window looked out into a courtyard and was surrounded by other similar high rise appartments. The bathroom was very acceptable although dark with average lighting. On a plus side for the hotel, I must mention the free glass of Champagne provided by the hotel management ( thank you Emmanuel) in celebration of our wedding anniversary ...and recovery from a nightmare Eurostar journey due to the snow. It was most appreciated and we enjoyed the drink curled up against the lovely fire ! I cannot agree about the negative attitude of the staff as mentioned in other posts as we found them all to be very accomodating and helpful throughout our stay.

However, I must say the transportation systems were excellent value for getting around. There are several cafe / bistro's in the area for breakfast and have to agree with other travellers that the 20 Euros charged by the hotel was excessively high. The hotel is certainly not 4 Star and would recommend anyone looking for accomodation to stay nearer the centre of town where I am sure you will find a better quality hotel for the same amount of money. .....and before the manager puts his comments on the site ...there were no FREE upgrades available if you were unhappy with the room !!

I was most excited about our romantic white winterland leg of the trip in Paris. We got recommendations from friends on everything - attractions to visit, places to eat, and most importantly, a reasonable, but ozzingly romantic place to stay. A childhood friend of my boyfriends recommended Hotel De Banville. His family had been staying there for 15+ years. He had stayed there on his first and only visit to Paris and fell in love with it as his family had and overwhelming convinced us that it would be the perfect romantic boutique hotel experience for us in Paris. Qualities that the Paris hotel had to have for us was: a smaller boutique feel with wonderful decor, romantic rooms, area of town that we could navigate to the attractions easily, breakfast included, and all for under $250 (US) a night. Hotel de Banville had all of that and beyond! They even had a lift, fluffy robes, hair dryers, big closets, tremendous service, and a wonderful breakfast that we could enjoy in bed. You can tell by the pictures I'm posting that it truly was enchanting. The service was impeccable, the breakfast in the morning was heavenly, the accommodations were above and beyond comfy - especially for European standards. We were sad that we missed the owners playing live jazz and will definitely arrange our schedule next time so we can see them perform during our next stay at Hotel de Banville.

Small bathroom but nicely decorated and nice little extras such as shampoo, shower gel , cotton buds etc. I had asked for a bottle of champagne to be in our room on arrival(as it was my boyfriends birthday) and they kindly obliged, even adding a few bowls of nice niblies! The hotel itself is a little away from the main centre of paris, but right next to a metro which can take you anywhere you want to go. We had breakfast included during our stay and it was spot on. Selection of cereals, breads, eggs, fruit, teas coffees. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to experience paris in fun, luxurious and clean environment.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Paris find!\u201d", "Author": "Wild_Panther", "ReviewID": "UR15386493", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for 3 night in hotel de Banville as part of our honeymoon in France.

We had used Trip Advisor to choose this hotel and booked via AirMiles. I should say straight away that we are fussy. I hate dirt, unkemptness etc and was apprehensive about going. I really needn't have been as this hotel is absolutely marvellous. I can't recommend this strongly enough. We stayed in the Prelude room for a supplement per night. The room and the hotel is clean, romantic and has a certain elegance which brings a special air to any special occasion. The main foyer/bar area is lovely and has a real touch of class. Unfortunately, my husband fell as we walked around Paris on our first day. This gave us lots of opportunity to use all the hotel's facilities as I nursed him before travelling home on the 4th day. Room service (breakfast, lunch and dinner) was great, dry cleaning is prompt and done well, there is access to the internet in the main lobby, the rooms are clean, well decorated and appointed with everything one could need, but the real praise must go to the owner of this family run business and her handpicked staff. Each member of staff no matter what their job (both daytime and night-time staff) treated us like members of the family and did all they could to help us and offer us a special stay. This really did feel like a home from home and with my husband so poorly, this was really welcome. We had a taxi (arranged by the hotel before arrival from CDG to the hotel). The driver is lovely and helped us greatly. If you are looking for a hotel with style, class, elegance and romance, where every personal touch and attention to detail is given to your stay, then this is the one. The metro and local buses are within close walking distance and the area is lovely and exactly what I expected from a holiday in Paris. Would we return?

Arrived at the hotel to find that the booking had not been received! Luckily they had rooms available and the staff were very helpful in sorting this out. We were allocated a room on the back of the hotel, which initially looked small and a little dark. However, on further inspection the furnishings were of very high quality and everything was immaculately clean. The bathroom was again small, but well furnished, with a lovely powerful shower. A quick look into other rooms while they were being cleaned showed they are all differently decorated and furnished, but of a similar size. The staff were all very helpful and friendly, and you could take breakfast in your room at no extra cost - lovely! The hotel is out of the main tourist areas, being about 15 mins walk to the Arc de Triumphe and Trocadero. However, it was peaceful and quiet, with a Metro and RER stop very close by.

The hotel lobby is lovely, our charming room (Theodore Banville) was designed to perfection, and the welcoming proprietor of this personal, boutique hotel was delightful and friendly. Our room had a beautiful custom-built vanity that divided the bed area from the bath area. Custom wood-paneling, wallpaper that matched the bedding, wrought iron balcony -- the whole ensemble made us very happy. The corner bathtub was really unusual and beautiful, positioned under a frosted picture window, transparent at the top so you could see the top of the Eiffel Tower in the distance. The bed and bedding were comfortable and overall, although small, the room conveyed a sense of old-world opulence and comfort. We chose to stay at the Banville because of the beautiful room, pictures of which we had seen on the web page, but also because the proprietress/owner, Marianne, sings jazz and French standards in her piano bar in the lobby on Tuesday nights. Both surpassed our expectations. Marianne \u2013 who speaks English impeccably and is very friendly and nice \u2013 sings to the accompaniment of an accomplished pianist. We sipped our cocktails from our cushy seats, enjoying the unique blend of modern and traditional d\u00e9cor and every beautiful detail from the calla lilies in the baby grand, to the fabulous custom lighting that appears throughout the hotel. We called out some requests and got up and danced a little swing and foxtrot around the piano, which led to flash bulbs flashing and delightful applause by the \"regulars\" at the bar and people who worked there. Later that night, upon returning from dinner (Bistro du 17eme, very nice prix fixe including a bottle of wine for two), we found blown-up prints of us dancing left by the hotel for us on our pillow. Breakfast in the lobby was a full assortment of pastries, fruit, cereals, cold cuts, cheese, and of course hot and cold beverages. We were more than satisfied. The staff continued to be so friendly, recalling the dancing from the evening before. We were invited to come back the next Tuesday evening, which we did \u2013 this time with some relatives who live in Paris. Everyone had a good time. We would definitely stay again at the Banville (and we\u2019d love to try L\u2019appartement de Marie on the top floor!). Another reviewer says it was very expensive, but actually we were able to get a very reasonable rate (even considering the exchange rate) through our travel agent.
