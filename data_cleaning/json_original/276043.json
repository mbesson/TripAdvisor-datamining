This was the best hotel we stayed at! The price was a little bit more but it's a Marriott so you know what standard of service to expect. The man at the front desk was very welcoming and friendly when we checked in even though it was after midnight. The concierge spoke excellent English and helped us find a place to buy our underground passes. The location was great within walking distance of the Brandenburg Gate and next to Potsdamer Platz, even though the Ritz Carlton was having a high profile political meeting during our stay, it was relatively easy to get to the hotel even with the 40 policemen surrounding the square. The temperature and cleanliness were perfect, and the staff respected our 'do not disturb' sign even though they wanted to service our room. (I prefer not to have staff come into a room while I'm staying there, just for security). The restaurant in the hotel was the BEST MEAL in Europe that we had (and not the most expensive). We got room service the morning of check out and it was on time and the food was great. They also have an amazing sauna, work out room and pool that's quiet. In any other city in Europe this hotel and their restaurant would have been twice as expensive.

I must say I was not disappointed. This hotel really is worth every penny. The room was beautiful, the staff very helpful, and the location right by the Potsdamer Platz ideal to get around the city. Best feature: the Marriott member lounge at the top floor. What a great place to retreat after touring the city all day and enjoy some snacks and a drink or two while taking in the fabulous view across the roofs of Berlin. I also liked the daily afternoon snack surprises that were hand-delivered to the room - a wonderful and unexpected treat. To round up our trip, we chose to have dinner at the in-house Midtown Grill. This restaurant can compete with any American steakhouse. It truly was a wonderful experience: fabulous food and great service & atmosphere. Try the liver Berliner Art and enjoy the unique way it's presented.

It has a great central location, a 10 minute walk from the Brandenberg Gate and plenty of transportation links at the S-Bahn and U-Bahn station nearby. On check in, I was asked if I wanted breakfast, I said no. I was asked if I wanted Wi-Fi Internet for 20 euros extra per day. I said no. I was asked if I would like to upgrade to a better room on a higher floor with a view with Wi-Fi included for 20 extra euros. I said yes. The room was nice and the bed was supercomfortable. Great pillows and lots of them. After about 24 hours, the Wi-Fi stopped working. Very frustrating when you need to do emails and don't want to start paying data roaming charges on your iPhone. I called the front desk and was referred to the service provider, iBahn. After 15 minutes on the phone with them, I was told it should be fixed in a few hours. When we returned later that evening, it still did not work. I was told by iBahn they were escalating the case and a technician would be on site to fix it. The next morning it still didn't work. I registered a complaint with the front desk and was told it would be addressed at check out. When we checked out on Sunday, I again mentioned my frustration with the Wi-Fi. The woman at the desk told me she was aware of my unhappiness. She then ran my credit card and charged me 60 euros for the room upgrade (that was supposed to include Wi-Fi). I said :Wait a minute, I paid for a service you promised me and you didn't provide it. I don't think I should pay for it.\" She said, \"You had an upgraded room. If you were unhappy, you could have moved back to a lesser room. Wasn't that offered to you when you complained?\" No, it wasn't offered. Then she said, \"I can give you back 10 euros per day. Do you want that?\" I thought it was a strange question. Who doesn't want 30 euros, especially after going through so much frustration, not to mention the unsympathetic treatment at checkout?

Friendly, polite, English speaking staff checked us in without any fuss, giving us a room on a high floor as requested. The superior room on the 8th floor was stunning - two walls of floor to ceiling windows with great views of the Fernseeturm and Potsdamer Platz. Complimentary bottled water and wifi (once confirmed the price tags didn't apply!) were a great bonus. The huge walk in shower was spectacular and the complimentary toiletries were especially useful having traveled with just hand luggage. Breakfast at the weekends is until 3pm and even later in the day still fresh and tasty. Got caught out on the Monday morning, thinking it was served til 11 but actually 10.30 so was a bit rushed but still good. Lobby bar is nice although not somewhere you'd spend that long as more business lounge like; shame they closed their old bar as that did some delicious cocktails and was one of the reasons I'd chosen to go back and take my friend. Still a good selection however. Swimming pool, sauna and gym added that nice luxury relaxation to the trip; somewhere nice to go and unwind in after walking around the city, for which this hotel is conveniently located.

Personally I don't see how you could top the Hotel Adlon down at the Brandenburger Tor, but this isn't drastically further away and imho vies only with the Hilton in the serene Gendarmenmarkt for second place. So, location. In a tiny square behind the Ritz-Carlton, just off Potsdamer Platz. Easily accessible to taxis; \u20ac20 from Tegel, \u20ac17 to Tegel thanks to lighter traffic. That'll change from early June when the new airport opens, of course. Turn left out of the front door and you're literally a minute or so from Potsdamer Platz with its U and S-Bahn stations, shopping and cinemas. Turn right out of the front door and the trees ahead of you are the edge of Tiergarten, Berlin's huge public park. Turn right at the Tiergarten, follow the edge of it round a few hundred metres and ahead of you are the memorial to Europe's murdered Jews, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag and the start of Unter den Linden. Tiergarten itself is a very nice place to start your morning with a jog, bike ride or just a gentle stroll. As for the hotel, I was more than happy with it, but there were niggles. Very clean; very personable English-speaking staff and good, albeit expensive food. Permanent uniformed security at the door and you have to use your room card to make the elevators work. Sound practice for an international hotel in an embassy district, not cause for paranoia. The centre of Berlin is as safe as any city I've ever visited. Rooms are a decent size for Europe. Lots of storage for all but the most fanatical shopper or overloaded businessman; in-room safe; plenty of power outlets. Bathroom had shower/bath and was a fine size. Ice machine on every floor. Can't speak for the views because I was on the inside, looking across at another wing. 24-hour room service. I ordered a steak at eleven one night, which arrived in 25 minutes, and my in-room breakfast the next morning was there bang-on the appointed time. If your television's important you'll be disappointed; it's a big old box, not an LED or plasma, but it has CNN/BBC/Bloomberg and the other usual suspects. The health club in the sub-basement is quite small and has fewer machines than I'd expected, but was never that busy while I was there. You reach it via a dedicated elevator at the rear of each floor; follow the signs posted at the main elevators from the lobby. The lobby is a nice place to while away an hour if it's quiet and the restaurant is worth at least one visit. I enjoyed my steak but never felt tempted to go for the wagyu beef because unless I'm entertaining a desperately important client, if I charge my company for a steak that cost \u20ac390 a kilo I get thrown out of a window. Downsides : well, it's a Marriott so they haven't heard of free wifi yet; remove anything from the minibar for longer than 15 seconds and it's charged to your bill, and the prices for the minibar are silly, to put it mildly. Yes, those are the prices most hotels of this standard charge in most capital cities, and if you work for Goldman Sachs you don't care, but unless I'm totally desperate I refuse to pay \u20ac3.50 for a small bottle of water or a small can of Coke, so I recommend a trip across to the Kaiser's or Lidl supermarkets in the shopping centre on Potsdamer Platz and make liberal use of the ice machine.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cFun visit in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "French S", "ReviewID": "UR125374824", "Content": "We had a great time in Berlin.

The hotel has a unique character all of its own. Our room was really spacious with a king bed, the bathroom was lovely with nice toiletries. The only thing that let the hotel down was that my husband requested a feather free room as I have an allergy to feathers, when we arrived he checked with the girl who was checking us in and she said the room was feather free, however when we went to the room and we checked the pillows were goose feather and the quilt duck down! We notified them at 15:30 in the afternoon and we were off out for several hours so the girl on reception we reported it to said she would get it sorted, however when we came back 4.5 hours later it still hadn't been done, so I phoned housekeeping and requested the bedding be changed and another hour went by and still nothing got done so in the end I had to go down to reception to ask them to sort it out as we'd been up since 4:30 am and wanted to go to bed and by this time it was turned 10pm anyway after reception phoned housekeeping, within 10 mins of me getting back to the room the chap knocked the door and gave us pillows but no duvet, so we asked about the duvet being changed too and he said he didn't know if they had a non allergenic one, so he went to check and came back a few mins later with one, but he just gave it to us he didn't change the bed for us! The location was fantastic, if you are room only, there is a starbucks on the corner where you can get nice coffee and a bacon and egg ciabatta its also 700m to the Brandanburg Gate you are also in walking distance of many other places including the site of hitlers bunker, the berlin wall and the Topography of Terror musuem which is free. The Station is near by and the tube and also tour buses go from just up the road. We did the CityCircle tour as it takes you to more places than any of the others, we got a 2 day pass for 20 euro's which was fantastic value as you could hop on and off at any of the stops. Also the commentry is recorded in many languages so you just select your language and they give you headphones to listen to it. We visited for the Christmas markets which were lovely there was even a small one just up the road from the hotel. The sony centre is nice and there are some lovely restaurants inside. Also you can do the panorama where you go to the top of the building that looks a bit like the flat iron building in New York but its only 24 floors and it has the fastest lift which takes you to the top in 2.5 seconds!

Berlin is a great city to visit - especially with Christmas markets on now - but its 20th century history is just so important you should not miss the Topography of Terror on the history of the Nazis and the Checkpoint Charlie Haus detailing the escapees over the Berlin Wall.

We managed a full meal off its evening nibbles service one night, and often enjoyed coming back in for a coffee and cake to rest our chilly bones during the day's sightseeing. We had a huge corner room with great views up the city streets and a massive warm bathroom with great big shower cubicle. it's adjacent to the Ritz Carlton but half the price with very little difference to show for it in our opinion Best of all though was the Midtown Grill restaurant. WOW. It served fabulous soft steaks, rich glasses of wine, lovely bread and dips as a pre starter and gave us marshmallows to toast with our bill!

We were there from a Tuesday until Sunday. The executive club was used by many families with many many children from 1--15 years old. That is also pleasant but not when they are crawling and playing in the area of where the food is and being served. I will not recommend this hotel to my friends who want to do business in Berlin and are used to other Exec. Clubs in Marriott Hotels. By the way, the food and the soups and the drinks in the executive club in the morning and evening and the servers deserve 10 stars.

First time in Berlin for an extended weekend break, by car, from Denmark. Before deciding I had looked at a lot of different options including different apartments but due to prices going up between 2- and 300 euros pr night i decided to call a few 5 star hotels (with a pool for the kids) to compare. The marriot had a nice offer of an executive room on the 10th floor with lounge at a cost of about 270 euro pr night. This included an extended continental breakfast also served in the lounge. Arrival was easy, parking is 24 euros pr night and is in the hotel basement, as we mostly used the U-bahn we left the car there for most of the stay (parking can be hard to find and our GPS was dated and often wrong!). Check in was uneventful, if perhaps a little devoid of charm. The room was nice, 2 double beds, one for the kids and one for the adults and a nice view over the old east berlin with the TV tower. Hotel is right on/next to Potsdammer platz and a 2 min walk from the holocaust memorial, Richstag and Brandenburger Tor. The area is not the most charming but a good central base to explore from, within easy reach of all the areas of berlin. A bit more detail on the executive lounge is needed. It was 2 doors from our room and a great addition for us (room 1052). After breakfast there is a continious serving throughout the day and in the afternoon/evening you can get small dishes, more than enough for an evening meal. The result for us was that we would have a very good breakfast, explore till late afternoon and then return to the hotel. We would then go to the lounge for coffee and hot chocolade, perhaps a beer. The kids would use the pool and the adults the gym in the room next to the pool. We would be back up in the room around 20.00 and the kids would be tired and NOT interested in going out to a restaurent. THAT was when the lounge was spot on. For more than 3 evenings (no more than 2 really) it is not recommended as you tire from the food choices but for 3 days in Berlin is a very good choice if you travel with young kids and are not looking for a night on the town. There is a cocktail bar on site, but, we did not try it.

We mainly chose to use the U-bahn, which was a 3 minute walk from the hotel as this seemed to be more reliable and required no line changes. Check in was smooth and we were given an 8th floor room which was large and next to the lifts. A bit disappointed with our large CRT TV which only had very limited English channels, and in a way expected a little more from a 5* hotel chain. The only gripe I had with this hotel was the internet ----> there is no free internet access anywhere in this hotel and they wanted \u20ac5 (I think) for 1 hours access and \u20ac20 for 24 hours.

The Sony Center is right there if you just want a nice place to eat or watch a movie. Also, the Brandenburg Gate is only a five to ten minute walk from there. Taxis are always right next to the hotel as well, if you don't want to walk real far or take the train.

The beds are nice and soft, and we slept very soundly, no matter what time of day it is!

Location: My friends and I had been to Berlin 2 years prior to this visit and only booked this hotel because my friend used points. It was the last night of a 2 week trip and we just needed a place to sleep before our flight. The area is very touristy and not very \u201cauthentic\u201d Berlin at all. It\u2019s like staying in Times Square when you come to NYC. Sorry, I don\u2019t want to see a Starbucks when I walk out of the hotel. However, some people like that about this location and that\u2019s fine too. This is just my personal opinion. Last time we were in Berlin we booked the Adina Hotel (also using Marriott points) and I liked that so much better- more neighborhoody location and smaller boutique hotel with a w/d in the room. Rooms: Large, clean and Marriott. We had a city view looking out but as stated before, I could have been anywhere. We had access to the executive lounge and that was a plus- as there was food and drinks and computers to use (no free wireless in the room but it was avail here). There were several Americans we met in the lounge and that were in Berlin on extended business stays. This hotel would be ideal for business travel. Overall: there was nothing wrong with this hotel I just didn\u2019t like it for a stay over one night.

You may want to avoid the Cancun Bar opposite the Marriott Hotel on Potsdamer Plaz as it was an expensive place for what it is and the atmosphere lacked any personal touch and seemed to be just about money. The Marriott needs to step up to the plate; new revolving doors had just been fitted to the front, but no heater had been installed to reduce the cold air drifting in (it was about -14c at night) so the Bar/Lobby was cold and not very enjoyable. The rooms did not appear to be hovered on a daily basis and we did have to suffer from some building maintenance work and the annoying sound of a hammer drill.

The room was clean an comfortable, with all of the expected standard amenities. The breakfast buffet was excellent, but we stayed there for nine days and the only thing that changed was the flavor of the daily fruit smoothie--otherwise it became very predictable. Most of the time we came back to the room in the afternoon to find that it had not been made up and we had to contact the housekeeping staff to get it done. The front office staff was cordial and professional, but nobody went out of their way to be particularly friendly or helpful (with the exception of the concierge one evening when we were asking about local tourist sites). However, service at the restaurant was excellent. Again, I have nothing really negative to say about this hotel, and the location alone would make it worthwhile if you can get a bargain rate. However, don't expect a five-star experience.

The bed linens were to have been changed every 3 days but they were not changed during the 5 nights we stayed in the hotel. The breakfast room was pleasant and there was a good selection. The breakfast wait staff were very good, pleasant and efficient, even under hectic conditions. One other small annoyance was that our room key (which was also needed for the lift) was cancelled three days in a row, entailing stops at the front desk to have the cards re-activated.

Oh what a difference a year makes. If I had to capture the property's essence, I would have to say that they were in a word: indifferent. First I am Marriott Gold. Meaning I spend a lot of my nights in a Marriott just to give you some context. I booked this hotel using points and my status \"earns\" me access to the \"Executive Lounge.\" We arrived in at the hotel by taxi from the airport in the pouring rain. Nobody came out to help us with our luggage. There was a security guard who watched us but offered no assistance. He simply pointed toward the lobby. We wheeled our bags inside ourselves all the way to the front desk without being intercepted by or encountering a bellman. Now normally I don't care all that much, but in this case I was in the final stages of recovering from a broken leg and depended on a cane, so a little help would have been welcomed. I let my displeasure be known and they explained that the security guard is a contract employee who cannot help with the bags and desk clerk had no idea where the bellman was. Unlike their sister property the Ritz-Carlton, the Marriott does not have someone stationed outside to assure a positive guest experience upon arrival. Five stars, huh? It was about 3:15 PM and our room was not ready even though it was past the check-in time. They provided us interim access to the lounge. They did not inquire about our bags, we had to ask to check them. A bellman finally came and heaved them on to a baggage cart, one on top of the other. My partner actually went over and re-positioned the bags in a manner more respectful of our property. Not sure if this was indifference or disdain. We got up to the lounge on the tenth floor and the keys didn't work, so back down we went. The lounge was a welcome respite, quiet, well stocked with free wireless internet. However, more about this later. The room became available about an hour later. They brought the keys up to the lounge and took our bags to the room without us asking. Clearly this was more akin to the service level I remembered. The rooms are spacious with comfortable bedding. You aren't going to say \"WOW\", but they are tastefully decorated and appointed. It is the standard American style Marriott room down to the garish gem tones. From my experience it is a 3.5 - 4.0 standard. Our king room had two terry-cloth bathrobes and two bath towels as part of the standard set-up. We had to ask each day for extra towels, rather than them noting the request for the entirety of our stay. There are no balconies, but the center floor to ceiling window opens like a door. The views of Berlin are quiet nice. Oh yeah, their was a barking dog in the room next door. Luckily he only barked when his owners weren't there. We asked the front desk to let them know, and they looked mortified by the request. Not sure if they ever did, since we didn't really get an \"of course.\" Now, about the \"Executive Lounge\". Let me just be clear. I don't have a problem with children. Well, that is not entirely true. My views about children and travel are simple. I have raised mine: I don't care to raise or interact with yours especially when I am on vacation. To be honest the kids were behaving as children do. The real problem was inconsiderate parents who don't understand that bringing their children into a hotel EXECUTIVE Lounge is a privilege. For all you parents out there, here is a clue. If your on a family vacation but don't want to sit at the same table as your kids, ask yourself why? It was only my partners pleading eyes that kept me from telling the mother jumping out from behind the curtain yelling boo at her three year old, that this was not a playground. The lounge staff takes NO steps to try and assure that the overall guest experience is not denigrated even after being prompted. Five stars? Not hardly. Also, do not depend on the front desk staff or the concierge for advice about activities or restaurants. They are all relatively young and new to the hotel. Your best bets are the internet and sites like trip advisor. My tips. The Fat Tire Bike Tour is a must do. The Pergamon is not closed on Mondays contrary to what you might be told.

That is the station closest to the hotel, make sure you don't get off at Ostbahnhof station, which is the end of the line for the Eurorail trains. The hotel is fairly central for most of the sightseeing attractions, you will have to walk about 10 minutes or more, to get to most of them but as Berlin is fairly spread out this would happen no matter which hotel you stayed at.

I went back and forth between this Marriott and the Courtyard Marriott, but ultimately am happy with the decision. Check in: The hotel has an impressive lobby, so first impressions are positive. Unfortunately for us, even though I requested early arrival (and was told this request was entered), they did not have our room ready for us. We had been up for 36 hours at this point, so while they offered to watch our bags so we could explore the city, we weren't in the mindset or condition to do so. We opted to wait, and they told us they would get a room ready as soon as they could. Two hours later, and watching no less than 20 individuals after us check in and get a room, (we had been sitting in the lobby during this time), I approached the desk and asked if they knew how much longer it would be. They told me that it could be another 3 hours before a room was ready, they simply did not know an exact time. This was extremely frustrating considering they are a 5 star hotel and I was assured before leaving that we had early arrival! We waited an additional 35 minutes and they came over with our room key. *Note: besides the individual who gave us our room key saying, \"I apologize for your wait,\" nothing else was done for us. Room: The room was nice for European standards and space. The bed was exceptionally comfortable - great comforter, pillows, and mattress! My husband and I slept well every night, this was arguably the best part of the hotel. There was a nice table and chairs with another side chair to lounge in, and the bathroom met our expectations. The mini bar was expensive; stop in a small grocery store and you will get the same items for half price! There are robes and slippers to wear which was a nice touch, as well as a safe. It would have been great to have a coffee pot in the room, but thankfully there is a Starbucks right around the corner from the hotel. The temperature in the room was comfortable and it was very quiet. Pool/sauna - we did not use these but did stop in to look at them. Very tranquil and romantic - if this was for business it would have been a nice break in the day, or if we had more time in the city it would have been something on our list to do! Location - This was very close to Potsdamer Platz metro station, and in walking distance of the Jewish Memorial, Brandenberg Gate, Reichstag, Unter den Linden, Sony Center, and Tiergarten. There is not much night life right outside the hotel area, but with the convenient transportation through the city this is a non-issue... the S bahn line where Potsdamer Platz is on is connected to a lot of night time \"hot spots!\" All in all, the location is excellent and a great central spot to navigate the city!

Right after checking in, we decided to book a private tour for that afternoon. I want to point out that the main purpose for the visit was to attend the European Dermatology Meeting that was being held in Berlin, however,u pon our arrival, we decided to take a tour of the city. The bellman taking care of us offered to book said tour, and once it was confirmed, we headed to our room to refresh and be ready. When we entered the elevator, a gentleman dressed as an employee, with a clipboard and pen in hand greeted us. We exited the elevator on the 8th floor and so did he. Since we were not familiar with the hotel, we hesitated as what direction to take; the gentleman asked our room number and clearly pointed out its location. Once in the room, and immediately after our luggage was delivered (by the same bellman), we heard a knock on our door. I was in the bathroom changing and my colleague looked thru the dooor chain. It was the same man we had met in the elevator requesting to enter our room to check the aircondition system. My colleague opened the door, the man checked the thermostat, and asked to please use our phone to report downstairs. Once he left the room, I exit the bathroom, and went straight to the desk where I had left my diamond ring, and gold bangles in order to wash my face. I should point out that all our valuables had been placed in the security box, and the only valuables outside were the ones we were using. Immediately after said individual left, the same bellman knocked on our door with a tour receipt to be signed, something that I found extremely rare, since those receipts are normally signed at the registration or consierge desk. After a couple of minutes we realized that the so called Marriott employee that was checking our aircondition had taken my ring. I immediately called downstairs and requested security to come up to the room. It took a good 20 to 25 minutes and several calls, as well as a desperate plea to a room service waiter , for security to come up, and among other things the person in charge, Marco, did not speak english, and had to bring a lady that worked in the restaurant or kitchen to serve as a translator.(this is happening in an American Hotel Chain) I was assured that everything was going to be resolved. I volunteered to check the video recorder in order to identify the man, since I still remembered him clearly and probably will never forget his face and/or hair style. At that time, and while security was in the room, my colleague realized that he had taken her wrist watch and a pouch where I had 360 Euros. Immediately after security left, the bellman knocked on our door again, to let us know that our tour driver was waiting downstairs, Again, why didn't he call?? Later in the evening when we returned from the tour, I requested to call the police and have a formal report since my ring along was worth over $14,000.00. I was told that it was going to take a while, to what I responded that I had the entire night to wait, and was going to remain in the hotel lobby until the police arrival. The police did arrive that night and requested our passports and a picture of my ring since the watch was a Michelle round watch that was easy to recognize. Luckily, I had my ring appraised and not only had a picture of it, but also the actual appraisal. I called my office in Miami, and within an hour they had the information requested. In addition, I requested a meeting with the hotel general manager since so far I had only talked to the hotel staff. A meeting was set for the next day early in the morning. At that time I was informed that the general manager was running late, and that he was going to meet with me later in the day. That same night I met with the general manager who was very apologetic, but informed me that their insurance would not cover because the ring was not in the safe. Well, the ring was not in the safe, because I was wearing it, and took it off just to wash my face! I requested a formal hotel report, and I did receive it about 2 weeks later. During my meeting with the hotel general manager I found out that the hotel did not have any video cameras in the elevators or hallways, and the only cameras were located in the hotel lobby. Also, the lobby had no security personnel, \"to not scare hotel guests away\". The only security body, was \"outside the hotel\" \"to protect the hotel from a terrorist attack due to the fact that it is part of an american chain\". I must admit that the hotel personnel was not only apologetic but very compassionate; however 4 month later (Feb 2010) they still claim that they have not reached a decision on whether they will cover our lost, or not. I feel that althought the lost was significant, the fact that there was \"No security\" in the hotel,and \"no video cameras in the hallways or elevator\" was a lot more important. I am a Marriott Gold Member. and have been staying at Marriotts for the past 15 to 18 years. Being a female that travels extensively, I look for security and protection in the hotels that I stay, especially if they are outside the US. Needless to say that is one of the main reasons that I choose the Marriott Hotels over and over. However, I am still in shock to know the poor security in the Berlin Marriott, something that I had never experienced in any of the Marriotts that I have stayed, whether in the US or abroad. I highly discourage any female to stay at that hotel, unless they restructure their management with an emphasis in guest's secutiry. Needless to say, this experience left us scared and dissapointed for the rest of our European vacation, that by the way, was booked in its entirety at Marriotts or Reinassence hotels in Hamburg as well as Copenhagen.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Repentigny", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, great situation, but pricy\u201d", "Author": "PierreC1", "ReviewID": "UR56154294", "Content": "Of course this is what you have to expect from a Marriott in Potsdamer Platz right around everything.

It would be an adequate 3 or 3.5 star hotel, but it most certainly is not a 4 or 4+ star hotel. The good news - our room was spacious for a European hotel room. The bad news, everything else. For starters, there was no doorman, or were the employees we saw continually hiding behind the Trabi at the left of the door smoking cigarettes the doormen? There appeared to be no bellmen either. At least we were offered no help with our luggage. I stopped by the concierge desk five times during our stay. I had just simple questions, but only once was I actually able to speak to anyone. Twice the concierge was on the phone and he ignored me. Once the desk was unmanned (during midmorning). Once there was a line for the single concierge so I did not wait. Once I actually talked to someone and he had little to offer me other than a cheap tourist map. I cannot imagine what the response would have been to a real request for information, recommendations, or reservations. I do not think it would have been acceptable. The health club was simply closed. It appeared that no alternatives had been arranged. While some may not care, this is part of the reason some people pay for 4 star hotels. Considering the room, it was at best... Spartan. As I said above, it was large, but the furnishings were minimal. The TV was an ancient CRT model. Hotels in this price range should provide newer flat panel models. The minibar was one of those very tacky and unsophisticated models where you cannot use the refrigerator to chill anything else. Indeed, if one touches anything in it they are immediately charged. This is very low class. In the bathroom there were exactly two hand towels and two bath towels, both of, at best, intermediate quality. There were no robes and no slippers. Most importantly, the bed mattress was completely worn out. I've slept on better quality mattresses in 2 star hotels. Clearly, the room displayed a philosophy of providing the absolute minimum required. As to service, my reservation profile calls for extra foam pillows. this was the first Marriott ever that failed to provide them. It's not a big issue but it does display a lack of service. Also, I cannot remember the last time a Marriott hotel did not offer a daily newspaper. Finally, at checkout an attempt was made to charge me for the awful breakfasts served in the Midtown Grill. I had to prove, by showing my reservation printout, that they were included in the price. Incidentally, the same attempt was made of the person next to me at checkout. Further regarding the breakfasts, while the cold German buffet was adequate, nothing special but adequate, the hot food buffet should be shut down for health safety reasons. In the U.S. it most certainly would be. Hot food absolutely cannot be left unheated (to 140 degrees F) on a buffet line lest it become a breeding ground for bacteria. Yet the sausages, bacon, eggs and pancakes were all at room temperature all four days that we were there. It appeared that there was a conscious attempt at shaving every expense and quite frankly, I've stayed at plusher Courtyard Marriotts. I sent a letter similar to this to two different \"guest relations managers\".

Staff were very friendly and helpful they helped us with all the information inregards to sightseeing and the best form of transport to use.The breakfast was endless as we sat there they continued to freshen the food and as the time pasted different food was added depending on the time of morning, i've never seen that before.

Berlin was our 2nd stop. Here, we stayed at the Berlin Marriott Hotel. This hotel was amazing!!....especially its service and interior. It's actually a quite newly built hotel so it has very clean and tidy interior. I especially loved the lobby area of the hotel. The atmosphere in the lobby is always warm and soothing after a day of touring the city (which is quite cold indeed) u get back to your hotel and just lay back on the sofas there and the view of the interior of the entire hotel from the lobby inside is just amazing...ill upload a few pics so u get what i mean. Now, getting to the room itself. We took an executive level double bedroom. Bedroom was very clean and had the best amenities u can imagine. Id definitely recommend a executive level room in this hotel since theres the executive club where u can go in the evenings and relax and have a few light snacks along with some hot chocolate/tea/coffee and just lay back. Also has internet access free inside the executive club so business travellers may take up their laptops and gain wifi access. The club is open all day for drinks and snacks but in the evenings they prepare hot fresh snacks and serve. The atmosphere up there is also quite amazing.... Staff at this hotel were quite helpful...everyday we wennt to the concierge and requested for a full day's plan and he was quite friendly and courteous helping us to fill all of our days with something exciting and fun to do aroundn berlin city.

As other reviewers have stated, it's centrally located with the U & S bahn only a slight walk away. Upon checkin, they offered the upgrade(70 Euro) to the executive club right away, but since we arrived at 11 pm, we opted to wait until morning to think about it. There were 3 of us staying and we did not have any problems getting 2 double beds in our room. Myself, my DH and his mom were taken to our room and we promptly fell asleep. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom spacious. I booked this hotel via priceline for a very good rate of $100/night (that's us dollars!) Postdamerplatz is a little over rated, imo. We only stayed there b/c I wanted a 5 star hotel (although I consider the Marriott a 4 star hotel.) I also wanted to stay in an american hotel b/c I knew my MIL would stay with us sporadically throughout our stay in Berlin and wanted to option of getting 2 double beds instead of renting an entirely different room for her. The other days, she would stay with her Berliner relatives. The only sights that the Marriott is within walking distance is the Reichstag and Brandenburg gate as well as sony center. Every other sight, we took the U bahn to get to. After a good nights rest, Dh and I went to the lobby to inquire about the executive club upgrade. Turns out WiFi in your room would be 20 euros by itself, but with the upgrade, it was free. Thereby making the cost of 70E to really 50E as we really need the WiFi and would've ordered it regardless of the upgrade to EC. After discussing it, we were offered the upgrade for 60E/night and accepted it. Essentially, we were paying 40E for the 3 of us for unlimited breakfast, drinks and evening goodies. And for our situation, since my MIL isn't very mobile, I knew she would not go sightseeing with us and wanted the option of the clubroom for her to go to for snacks or drinks while we were out. Unfortunately, my MIL didn't stay with us for as many days as I thought she would. So in the end, I felt a little cheated b/c I didn't feel like 40 E was worth it for just Dh and myself. Since we are both young and mobile everyday she wasn't with us, we were roaming the streets and didn't get to use the clubroom much. Every evening around 5 pm, the clubroom had 2 hot appetizers as well as a few cold ones. There was also salad, cheese, breads and unlimited drinks of beer, wine, sodas or coffees and teas. There was one day where our relatives came to pick up my MIL and we had them wait for us in the clubroom to enjoy some coffee or tea w/o any problems. So that's an added perk which we enjoyed. Hopefully our situation will help you determine if you'd upgrade to the clubroom for your stay. The Marriott is a nice, clean, centrally located hotel with good amenities. I would stay here again if I got it on Priceline, but I doubt I would pay the rackrate for it. Actually, I know I would not.

I liked that the bell boy was a young German woman. Check in was a bit confusing as we didn't seem to be speaking the same English. We had booked a regular room b/b. When we checked in we asked for a nice room with a view, so she offered us a superior room or an executive room with free internet for 70 euros and breakfast in the executive lounge, as we here staying 2 nights we thought this was a good idea ,so we took this room. Only when I was signing did I realized that it was 70 euros per night. So my husband said no thank you. Then after a few minutes of us thinking we understood the reception lady we agreed to pay 100 euros extra for 2 nights. Only to have our key taken away and told that we would have to wait a few hours for our regular room! So we explained again that we did want the executive room. As a club member I was told that the card number was not written on the room reservation even though I had called the week before to check and I didn't like that the reception lady didn't try and help to find my number, luckily I found my card later. I must say she was polite all the time and I didn't like the feeling of that she must have thought that we did this deliberately to get a better price . Now for the good stuff, the room was great! On the 9th floor, room 976. The bath room was the size of most hotel rooms!! It came with a separate shower. The view was of eastern Germany ahead. Potsdam square to the right and Brandenburg gate to the left. Nice big TV and a big cupboard but the best was the bed!!!! King size with the Marriott special bedding, we just came from the Marriott Leipzig, so we knew how good the bed was but no one told me how much we would miss it when we got home!! I think we will have to buy one! The room has a floor to ceiling windows of which one can be opened. Which was very nice and made us realize how sound proof the room was, we could not hear a thing even though it's on a busy road. We did not use the pool and gym as we didn't have time but everything looked to Marriott standard. The executive lounge was clean, mostly quite and with nice nibbles in the evening as well as free alcohol at this time. I did notice that there were free soft drinks, beer, tea and coffee during the day. There is also a room with 3 computers for the internet and a room with a big LCD TV. I even found a quick read romance novel there! ( which I read and left there). First morning we had breakfast downstairs in the main breakfast room because we thought that we wanted more salad and fried eggs but the mess and the queue was not worth it ,so the next day we had breakfast in the executive club and felt it was much better. While staying at this hotel we didn't take any transport, we just walked around the area. There is so much to do in the area and even if you have shopping you can just pop back to the room, which is also a problem if you rest for a minute on that great bed!! You can easily take a quick nap. On the corner of Potsdam platz next to the Ritz Carlton is a good, cheapish Italian kind of fast food restaurant where get a \"credit card\" then go stand in line and order your meal e.g. ravioli with mushrooms or pizza that they make in front of your and then swipe the card, you can sit outside on the square or inside and pay at the end.

The main advantage is the fantastic location, hard to beat Right next door to Potzdamer Platz and its U-Banh/S-Bahn station. A few hundred meters north is the Reichstag and the Brandenburger Tor, and within walking distance of the fantastic shopping centre of the Ku'damm (about 3km in distance, although the U-Bahn will get your there quicker - just 6 stops on the U2 line). There are some great moderately priced restaurants nearby, and of course the Sony Centre is practically next door. The U2 U-Bahn line that ruins through Potsdamer Platz is very useful, and links the city's two \"centres\" along an axis from AlexanderPlatz, through south part of the historic centre, and on to the Ku'damm (station at Zoo Gardens). A day ticket is very cheap and well worth the money as it covers both U-Bahn and S-Bahn, which is a very efficient, safe and clean mode of transport in Berlin. For gay travellers, the gay area around Nollendorfplatz is less than 2km away from this hotel, and a nice walk (or if you're lazy , 4 stops on the U2 U-Bahn Line from Potsdamer Platz). The hotel rooms themselves were spacious (by European standards) and nicely decorated. Some great views from the rooms, especially from the top floor where the executive lunge is. Access to the executive lounge was part of a paid upgrade to our room, and is worth it if you intend to use the hotel as a regular stop off during your stay. Access to the lounge included internet access, breakfast and various drinks/snacks throughout the day. The restaurant attached to the hotel, called the \"Midtown Grill\", is superb . A little pricey by German standards, but the service and the food is excellent. The most impressive touch is a complementary flaming fondue of marshmallows with chocolate which arrives with your bill, which is not only fun, it made me wish I hadn't filled up on dessert before hand! On the down side, the pool in the leisure facilities is a little on small side... don't expect to be doing Olympic training here, its nothing morer than an oversized bath. In addition to the pool there are showers and a sauna, but that's about it. Not very impressive in all. Also, the total has a policy of doing something rather annoying with your credit card: they block large amounts of cash on your credit card BEFORE you check out. A receptionist told me this is standard policy in German Hotels, although I have never before seen this in any German hotel previously, and I was told it was to ensure payment of the room. Not a very trusting and welcoming approach to their customers. However, the amount they \"reserved\" on my credit card was way in excess of the total bill amount, to which couldn't get a straight answer from the hotel staff as to why this was the case, or any enthusiasm to remedy this situation. When I checked out, of course all that was taken out of the card was the agreed amount, but the massive amount reserved (over 3,500 Euro over a one week period!) almost made my credit card useless on the holiday. Be warned about this... make sure you have a big enough credit limit before using this hotel. On Berlin in general: (1) On a safety note, just don't find yourself wandering around the Eastern suburbs of Berlin, day or night... but then again, you should have no business to bring you there in the first place. (2) Don't forget to validate your ticket in the U-Bahn stations, look for the yellow box, its not always easy to find. (3) Germans are very law abiding, don't cross the road until the green man shows, even if your are the only person on the entire street. (4) If you have only time for one museum to visit, make it the Pergamon, if only for the Gates of Ishtar (with free entry on late night Thursdays) (4) DO try the \"curry worst\"... Its cheap, nasty and totally addictive!

We asked about tours, attractions, trains, shopping. We were told don't bother going to Pottsdam because there will be no English speaking tours. (we went and there were tours) They told us to just use a taxi if we needed to go somewhere. The Concierges desk is USELESS at this hotel.The only thing they know is the hop on/hop off bus tour. There are several of these and they push the most expensive. Also they try to hide the smoke (not a smoke free hotel) with fragence pumped into the lobby. This fragence can be more offensive than the smoke. It's strong! The hairdryer is weak and becareful with the mini-bar. If you lift a can or bottle, that might appear on your checkout bill. On our own we did find some really good restuarants. Mommseneck- house of 100 bears is a typical Berlin casual pub/restaurant. Its in the Potsdamer Platz. Great sausage and potatoes and every type of beer you desire. Also Cafe Einstein near the American Embassy and Brandenberg Gate was a nice Austrian cafe. The creamiest hot chocolate and best desserts we ate in Berlin. The dollar hit a new low versus the Euro. So we found every meal to be expensive. I would skip the Reichstag, I was not impressed and the line was long. We also expected to see a more state of the art museum at Check point Charlie. This museum was interesting but needs to be updated. Go to Pottsdam-its probably better in the Spring and Summer. The Berlin subway system isn't the most tourist friendly. It's not color coded as London's underground. But it is useable and clean and safe. It seems after you buy your ticket you have to validate them and then you have 120 minutes and the ticket become invalid. The fare for this standard ticket in zones A & B was 2.10 euros.

The location could not be better if you are there to visit the city as a tourist. Walking in one direction from the hotel, ten minutes will bring you past the Jewish Memorial, then on to the Brandenburg Gate which is right at the top of Unter den Linden. Another three minutes walk and you are at the Reichstag and of course the Tiergarten. Hitler\u2019s bunker is about three minutes walk from the hotel. One of the hotel managers gave us directions to the bunker as you won\u2019t find it marked on maps. It is in the small car park area of a very nondescript apartment building. There is a small recently erected notice board there which gives some information. About a 15 minute walk in the other direction from the hotel brings you to Checkpoint Charlie which is just not to be missed while in Berlin. The Marriott is in Potdamer Platz and you would need days to get around to see it all (Sony Centre, Legoland) but to walk around the wonderful modern architecture is awe inspiring. If you are a shopper the Arcaden Centre is almost directly across the street from the hotel and will not disappoint. Saturn - an electronics shop is just amazing and coming from Ireland we found it very cheap. The hotel is a one minute walk from the train station which we used to get us to and from the Airport and indeed we used the train during our stay and found it easy and safe to use. On coming out of Arrivals at Schonefeld Airport there is small yellow stand with a tourist advisor who provides hotel directions. The bedrooms were all you would expect from a Marriott. The beds though were just divine. Beautiful luxurious white linen and duvets all added to the comfort. We would go back to the Marriott just for the comfortable beds. We paid a little extra and had access to the Executive Lounge. This was lovely; it was very relaxing to go for a drink in the evening before going out to dinner or to relax there with a coffee during the afternoon and look out at the view from the 10th floor. There was free Internet access.

We arrived approx. 8:00 am from our Continental overseas flight and took a fifteen-minute taxi ride (cost for 2 adults/one child with tip - E 20) to the hotel. We received good service at check-in since we had requested a smoking/2 double bed room which was available for early check-in. The only thing we didn't receive as requested was the better east view which oversees East Berlin and most of the old buildings (note: the west and north sides face office buildings and the south view would be over the Park). We also upgraded to the Executive Floor status (located on the 10th floor - our room was on the 9th Floor) which we recommend without question. For a cost of E 80/day, we received breakfast, unlimited drinks, snacks, evening buffet and evening desserts. It was so nice to come in after a long day of tourist jaunts and have a glass of champagne and nibble on whatever was available. Well worth the cost and we made the effort to tip every night to the staff since we had such great service. As to the hotel, there was no complaints since service, cleaning, and any requests were handled promptly. The location is, without question, convenient and safe. You have access to unlimited taxis, subways, buses and trains within two blocks of the hotel. Also, there are so many tourist sites located within walking distance of the hotel including Sony Center (Film Museum, Legoland), Brandenberg Gate, the Unter de Linden, the Reichstag, Jewish Memorial Site, Teddy Bear Park, etc. You can take the No. 100/200 buses to all of the other tourist locations while enjoying the view. You can also visit Potsdam via the U-2 subway to the Zoo and then transfer to the S-Bahn 7 (highly recommended but you need at least two days to do Potsdam justice). Also, the hotel is around the corner from the pick-up locations for several tourist buses that give you the running commentary as you travel about. We also recommend picking up the Berlin Welcome Card and enjoy the free transport as well as the discounts to numerous tourist activities.

The executive floor is well worth the money. You receive a breakfast that is beyond anything in North America on an executive floor - it opens early of course for the business people to eat and during the weekday breakfast ends at 10am.

They have a pool which suited our son just fine and the 24 hour gym is connecting, has modern equipment and is bigger than most hotels - it is also secured with your room key and has a separate elevator.

What a great place to stay! We were advised to upgrade on arrival to the Executive Lounge Package \u2013 at a cost of \u00a320 per day each it was a bargain! It meant we could go into the Lounge for Breakfast and whilst mainly cold there was a fantastic selection (smoked salmon and scrambled eggs yummy!), refreshments throughout the day and canap\u00e9s (very filling!) from 5.30 \u2013 7.30 pm with deserts from 7.30 \u2013 9.30 pm and of course a free bar (including spirits) until 9.30 and then wine and beer until midnight! There are also three computers in the lounge with free internet access for those of you who just can\u2019t switch off!! Oh yes and late check out on departure which was a real bonus! In fact after a really busy day out sightseeing it was a pleasure to come back, get showered and changed and just walk along the corridor to the Lounge and have a bite to eat and a few drinks. It was quite busy with it being Easter but the staff certainly worked hard but they were brilliant, the food was excellent and apart from running out of Vodka there was something for everyone to drink. We were just too exhausted to be bothered to go out and night but the company in the Lounge made it a lovely friendly evening and we met the most interesting people who had a real insight into Berlin and it\u2019s history, we probably learnt more from our American and German \u2018friends\u2019 than from any text book. The room was lovely and quiet despite being the first one just round from the lift, we hardly heard a peep, the beds were so comfortable it was an effort to get out of them in the morning. Alas I have to confess we never made it as far as the pool or the gym \u2013 but hey we were on holiday!!! We filled in the customer feedback questionnaire when we left and it was all favourable apart from a small comment about the showers running hot and cold (not worth reporting at the time). Once back in the UK I received a really nice e-mail from the Marriott thanking me for my feedback and informing me that the problem had been attended to and that my comments about the excellent staff in the Lounge had been reported to them. Now that\u2019s what I call customer service \u2013 I can think of a few companies out there who could take a leaf out of their book!! Berlin is a fascinating city and we completely ran out of time to explore everything we wanted to. It\u2019s a good idea to do the audio tour bus trip at least that way you can get your bearings and make a plan to revisit those places of interest to you. Most of the main sights are within walking distance of the Marriott. Alternatively if you want to go it alone it\u2019s worth buying the multiple travel ticket available for one day, three day or a week \u2013 you can get everywhere you want to go using the U \u2013Bahn, S-Bahn and the buses (not valid on the sightseeing buses though). Tickets can be purchased at the BVG office at Tegel airport (don\u2019t pre book as they wouldn\u2019t let us collect our ticket from there and we had to go to the main train station!). We had no problem getting around and used the bus to get to and from the airport to our hotel. The Checkpoint Charlie Museum is quite a sobering experience but well worth a visit, as is the 'Topographie des Terrors' an outdoor exhibition (get the audio guide as much of the narrative on one side is in German). The Brandenburg Gate is very impressive and please take the time to read the information boards around the area as this will give you a potted history of the area. If you have a full day to spare it\u2019s worth a day out to Schloss Charlottenburg and Museums \u2013 if you want to see all the museums on the site get there early and make a plan as it\u2019s easy to lose track of time. There was a massive queue at the main entrance and we waited an hour to get in only to discover another entrance through the other side of the gift shop \u2013 no queues!!! For the shopaholics amongst you a trip to the Ka De We is a must, it\u2019s the largest store in Europe \u2013 it\u2019s an experience in itself \u2013 especially having a nice cold glass of Moet in the food hall!! How decadent can you get! All in All a great weekend albeit too short!! So go stay at the Marriott and have a wonderful break!!", "Date": "May 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Marriot !!\u201d", "Author": "BigDontour", "ReviewID": "UR7430226", "Content": "Just returned from a weekend at the Marriot, Berlin.

In general the hotel has a cosy feel considering it's really designed for business. The only reason I've given this four stars and not five were two relatively minor complaints. The pool water is slightly on the cold side and the 40 channel televison only has four English speaking channels, three of them news channels plus Eurosport. The latter \"complaint\" should be easy to fix and may even encourage guests to use the hotel room service more.

This is one of the better Marriott hotels and I would recommend any one looking at this website to seriously consider this hotel. Access to the executive club lounge was actually very good. If you go on business or pleasure you can entertain guests there, and with family stock your daily needs (especially drink). The Marriott also has a pool which (although cold) was actually nice.

Scandinavian style selection of sliced salami, prosciutto, smoked salmon, pepper encrusted smoked fish. A whole section with three kinds of yogurt and fruits, nuts, muesli to put in it. The best was the boiled white sausage and handmade soft pretzels with homemade honey mustard. I know the chef made it because I asked where I could buy some. Good selection of newspapers in English and German. The wait staff was very efficient and attentive. The location was perfect. We walked to the Reichstag at night to climb the dome and the subway line goes directly to Potsdam where the Sans Souci castle \"complex\" is spectacular.

The only slight problem I has with the hotel was the rather obvious orders they had to maximise sales at all times. It seemed a bit false. I suppose this is because it is owned by a US company and this is a style of operation that some US companies have. I'm not anti US! I love the US but the commission culture produces this style of service. Example. I ordered room service and rather than saying \"is there anything else I can help/get you\" which would have sounded fine they said \"are you sure you wouldn't like a starter with that. How about the Soup\". This also happened in the restaurant when they \"recommended\" the most expensive dishes.

It's particularly a bargain if travelling with children. It included breakfast, afternoon appetizers and evening desserts. Guests also gain access to internet (3 computers in a separate room inside the concierge lounge) and beverage/beer from morning til midnight. My 2 kids drank a lot of juice/soda/bottled water during the stay which will cost 2.5 Euro+ from the minibar. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The beds were super. Swimming pool is a bit small but nice, fitness room is also nice. The fitness/swimming room is always stocked with bathrobe, slippers, towels and a full bowl of apples. Also, security is good, one would need a card key to operate the elevator. The only complaint I had was we are a family of four and we checked in as a family of four. First night I had to call housekeeping for one more set of towels and more shampoo/conditioner. But everytime they came to clean the room, they only re-stocked for three even though I requested four, which is a bit annoying, but it's minor.
