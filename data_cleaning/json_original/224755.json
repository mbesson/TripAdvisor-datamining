I paid less that \u00a360 per night, and you may be thinking, Travelodge... that cheap in london - where is the catch? Well being honest there isn't one. It has all that you need from a cheap place to stay. It has a car park, for \u00a35 for 24hrs - good price. There are 4 floors of rooms, and it has lifts, so no worries there. The foyer is simple, it has a choice of vending machines, as the hotel doesn't offer a restaurant (but there is a lovely Italian a few doors away). Reception was fine, and the hotel manager was lovely. She was very friendly and always asked if I needed anything extra, like tea or coffee. The rooms were standard Travelodge type, you know, a bed, open wardrobe, desk, tea/coffee/kettle, TV. The bathroom was fine, functional enough and well lit. One thing that I must comment on is cleanliness - as a woman who travels all over the place, I know what an awful hotel can be like - and this place was spotless. I was really impressed. No dust, no cobwebs, clean carpets, clean bathroom and it smelled clean too. If there was a negative it would be breakfast in a box, but hey - it isn't the Ritz! Would I recommend a friend to stay - yes, certainly, as long as they knew that it was a no frills, cheap hotel, that was an ideal base, but it was clean and friendly...

We booked in fine and stayed in room 214. I am a buildings project manager by trade, so always look at things in a bit more detail. The room had been recently decorated and furniture seemed new. Bed sheets were clean and crisp and matress looked brand new with no staining. The works that had taken place in the room i.e sockets, general updating had been done poorly, shodily and of low standard. Although the bathroom had some new vinyl anti-slip flooring, the rest of it was pretty vile - dank shower curtain (1980s), nasty germy tiles that needed ripping out (1970s), shower over bath covered in limescale, old metal bin that didn't open in a wet environment spells rust, artex ceiling above falling away with debris hanging on by it's finger nails. Not pleasant to look at. Shower extractor not working and therefore causing the room to be constantly wet and smelly. Bonus was that our shower thermostat worked fine and there was ample hot water in the evening and again in the morning. We only had one towel between us so we had to ask for another, and there was a little towel and unsure if this was a bath mat or hand towel? We went for bath mat option, as assumed the bathroom floor must not be particuarly clean either. I also did not fancy walking round the room barefoot for reasons below. The WORST issues were the cleanliness of the room: THE BOG....IT WAS VILE. Why cleaners aren't taught the basics to clean under the rim of bogs is unbelievable. Clearly visible just looking at it, under the toilet rim, was loads and loads of crusty, brown [--], probably years of excrement moulded on and left to fester. Seriously nasty and big germ alert. Under and around the bed, were lots of thick, curly, pubic hairs. Again, horific. Can't their cleaners get a decent hoover and give that carpet a good going over? Only visible in dim light, there was a large stain on the wall by the bed, god knows what THAT was. Inside the interior of the hotel, it looks worn and shabby. It needs a good redecoration and deep clean. Simple things like emergency exit signs, door numbers all need replacing and look knackered. The outside exterior reflects the interior and could do with a facelift. We did not have a good night's sleep. Although the room was at the back of the hotel so we got no road noise, we got noise from the hotel's carpark, with guests leaving at all hours and tooting horns etc. Plus other guests coming back late and being noisy, although that's not the hotel's fault. We did not hear any planes either. Leaving in the morning was a god send and we had a local Mackers breakfast instead of the hotel's 'package'. (For your info, the local Mackers is at the large roundabout - turn right as you leave the hotel and you can see it on the corner there, get in left hand lane). Not great but better option than their ripoff offering. There was a strange smell of frying fish blasting out of nearby extractors in the hotel carpark, which made me feel sick, especially with a big hangover. Overall, and reading other comments here - it seems a bit like a lottery as to whether you get a bad/poor room or a terrible/vile one. One thing i would bring with you if you must stay here is the bleach and a cloth! oh and a hoover - Enjoy the pubes!", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poole - on the sunshine coast!", "Title": "\u201cAPPALLING\u201d", "Author": "Winco47", "ReviewID": "UR118313807", "Content": "This is a copy of my complaint to Travelodge. I think it says it all! \"My wife and I stayed for two nights at the London Battersea Travelodge on the 3rd and 4th September. We were allocated the twin room, as we had requested on booking back in July, room 301. On arrival at the hotel the receptionist wanted us to take a double room. She said that room 301was a family room, the hotel was full and we were only one couple. It was a little embarrassing to have to explain at the desk with others around that my wife and I like to sleep in separate beds, which is why we had booked a twin room i.e. a room with two beds. Is this not the usual reason why one asks for a twin-bedded room? Anyway we went up to 301 and dropped off our bags before going straight out for a scheduled meeting with relations, not returning until later that night to sleep. It was only the next morning that we saw properly the terrible state of our room. The previous night we had already noticed that the sofa bed was in a very poor state. It had not been made up properly when we got into the room. When we did make it up on our return, we saw that the mattress had no cover and was dirty and stained. The mattress itself was very thin, hard and uncomfortable and the pillows also were exceedingly thin and hard. The bolster cover was also torn, stained and dirty. In the morning we saw that the whole room was scruffy and dirty. The one and only chair in the room was filthy with torn upholstery and protruding stuffing. The room carpet was stained and had clearly not seen a vacuum cleaner that works efficiently in a long time. There were brown stains on the ceiling above the dressing table, probably beer stains because of the handy bottle opener screwed to the side of the dressing table. The room had only open shelves with a bent hanging rail and several missing hangars. We felt that we had woken up in a back-packers 'doss house'. The bathroom was just as bad. The small waste bin had a broken lid which lay along side on the floor. It was disgustingly stained and dirty. The shower thermostat did not work and after two minutes of warm water the temperature rapidly fell to stone cold. No amount of increasing the temperature would make it go hot. Forced to use the small bath I found it like trying to bathe in a shoe box (I am six foot two plus). There was no bath mat, unless the one single towel supplied was for this use? The bath tap mixer unit was missing its two indicator buttons so exposing the inside. Not only unhygienic but showing that there had been problems in the past. We had endured a night of very little sleep the first night due to the incredible noise, inside and outside. I am sure you must be fully aware of the traffic noise from York Road. This noise continued unabated throughout the Saturday night and was then accompanied by the first aircraft arrivals into Heathrow at 06:00. Being a warm period we had to get some air into the room, so we had to have the windows open otherwise we would have roasted. Although even with the windows open, it was terribly stuffy and warm. The following night the noise still kept us awake but this time there was additional noise at 04.00 from the arrival of guests in the next room and their friends further down the corridor. I realise however that you cannot be held responsible for other guest's noise, although some warning of the traffic noise would have been helpful. Now that we know about this, we definitely won't be staying here again. Why were we not warned? All in all this room was a disgrace and without doubt, this was the worst budget hotel that we have ever stayed in. It makes Premier Inns look 5 star! It was not as if I had paid \u00c2\u00a319 a night for this room, which in my opinion was the most it was worth. I paid \u00c2\u00a3131.80 for this dreadful experience. Room 301 falls far below the standard that any reasonable person would expect from a budget hotel. I feel that you have taken my money under false pretences and I require compensation.. On checking out I was surprised to be asked if everything had been alright! I asked the receptionist if she really did want to know. So when she said abruptly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that's why I asked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I told her. As it happened the maintenance man was passing the desk and on being told of the shower problem he really did not seem to be too surprised. The receptionist then said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do have better rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! I asked why then we were not given one as we had booked so far in advance? This was met with a blank look. At this point I felt it was better for us to leave. I look forward to your response\". The eventual response from Travelodge did not address my complaints at all! In fact it makes me wonder if anyone actually did read it. It just makes me feel that they hope that eventually you will give up and go away.

We needed a place to spend the night in London but because of the match between Manchester United and Barcelona in Wembley Stadium that weekend, every other hotel within our budget was fully-booked. The poor reviews of this hotel did put me off. But having stayed a night here, I must say that it was above my expectation. However, I would have to agree with some of the things pointed out by earlier reviewers. By the way, I shared a first-floor room with a friend whereas her brother and his friend shared a twin room on the third floor. Their room was evidently smaller. Room The good I checked in the day after the football match and was put on the first floor very close to the lift. There was a fire barrier door separating my room from the lift, so there was no noise from it. The double-bed room we got was very spacious and clean \u00e2\u20ac\u201d surprise, surprise! The bathroom was clean -- it had a tub, whereas the smaller rooms only had a shower. The bathroom floor, sync and tub were clean. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice any stains. The bad The shower curtain needs to be replaced as the foot was already yellowing. The water pressure for our toilet was not to my liking. After flushing, it takes more than a minute to fill the tank. Not good when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sharing it with other people who may need to go immediately after you. There is no air-conditioning, so for better ventilation, we left the windows open overnight. As the hotel is situated next to the main road and the route of London buses, it is very noisy almost at all times. In addition, some guests were out drinking in front of the hotel -- they were possibly drunk -- and talking really loudly. Light sleepers will definitely find this bothersome. There is no telephone in the room. Environment/location The good The Battersea train station is a 10-minute (or less) leisurely-walk away. Many London buses pass by the hotel. Bad The hotel is located within a residential area \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lots of flats. No offence to those who live there but the area seems a bit dodgy. I would think twice about walking alone around this area, especially at night as there are not many pedestrians around. But I have seen young women walk alone to the train station. But I would still advice you to walk with a friend. Some guests are neither cultured nor considerate. My friend was awoken by drunk guests drinking and talking loudly just below our window. The next morning, we saw a pair of panties and bra on the sidewalk, clearly thrown out of the window from one of the rooms. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t advice walking to the train station with a heavy suitcase as the walk is comfortable only if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re carrying something light. If you have things with you, best to take the taxi which costs between 6 pounds and 7 pounds. You can get cabs from in front of the station. Service The bad You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave your bags with the hotel as there is no luggage room and the hotel simply refuses to do so. Internet The bad No free wifi. Verdict I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not keen to stay here again as the environment feels a little too seedy. Besides, the room does not come with breakfast. There is no free wifi service at all.

But of course this is covered on their website in some babbling jargon about saving the customer money. The room isn't overly big, but this is central London after all. The bed was comfortable enough and our TV worked normally, albeit all the music channels had been muted at the source (presumably to avoid excessive noise) Our mirror was missing though, no doubt ripped off the wall and thrown out of the window by some rock star wannabee during a previous stay! The one thing that did strike me as particularly poor was the apparent lack of security. All the external door had locks fitted to accept room keycards, yet none of them were ever locked, even upon our arrival home at 4AM one morning, it was left a jar for anyone to just stroll in. The car park has secure fencing around it though the barrier gates appear to have been smashed off and destroyed at some point. There's a good chance your room will look over one of the car parks though so you can keep an eye on your vehicle.

I'm staying here as I am working at a trade show at Olympia this weekend. This hotel is deeply disappointing. You drive in around the back of dodgy, run down council estates.

It's their own car park and at \u00c2\u00a365 a night + \u00c2\u00a375 for a weekend stay I expect FREE parking. The interior of the hotel is grim. One lift was broken and the snack machine was broken. Hotel staff were perfunctory and seemed more interested in watching the tv in reception. When asked to explain why I had to pay for the car park they just shrugged. The room itself was large, but mostly empty. There was a fine view of an industrial car park (Sweeping views of the savannah weren't expected!). It was pouring with rain but I found no hair dryer in the room. I had to request one at reception but was told to be quick because other people might need it!. The TV had permanent interference on all channels. The remote control battery was dead so I had to fiddle around with the buttons at the back of the tv to get it to work. The room was freezing when I arrived so I had to switch heater to maximum to get any warmth. Early this morning, around 2:30 am it sounded like a herd of buffalos rampaging through the corridors. It was group of youths running up and down, laughing and swearing. This continued for about 20 minutes and was followed by frantic banging and thumping on doors with cries of '###ing let me in you b###ds' and similar comments. It quietened down, but then began again at 3am, and finally at 4:30am. I didnt look outside but there was no sign of hotel staff trying to control the situation. I suspect they remained oblivious. There is no phone to call reception in the room to complain. It's quiet now, so I am packing up and getting the hell out. They are currently running a TV ad campaign saying how much they value their customers getting a quiet nights sleep. Well sorry Travelodge, bang goes several million of your advertising budget!!!

The rooms are basic to say the least - no aircon and windows that only open about an inch. Not particularly comfortable beds and the flattest pillows I've ever seen. Only 1 toilet roll in the bathroom. And somehow the miracle of TV channels and freeview seems to have passed by Travelodge as the TV choice made me think we'd timewarped back to the 1980's. On a positive note, the room and hotel were reasonably clean, the bathroom functional (apart from loo roll) with working shower (no bath but that's fine for us), and the hotel and room were reasonably quiet.

We chose this travelodge for its location as my elderly parents and my husband & I needed a base to stay over Christmas whilst visiting our son. His house was a 4 mile drive away and took 10 - 15 minutes on the quiet Christmas roads. Basically, we used the Travelodge as a base for just sleeping. We knew there was no breakfast available but this did not worry us. I am a coeliac too so the 'breakfast bag' would not be any good to me anyway. We took some plastic bowls from home and a few spoons and my son had got us a box of rice krispies and each night we took some milk back to our room from his house so we could have a quick bowl of cereal in the morning before setting out for his house. We came up from Cornwall in the car - very good journey (my Mum & adult daughter (who stayed at her brothers) went on the train to Waterloo to make way for all the presents and food we were bringing up to our sons). We took a little time to find the Travelodge as I hadn't printed a map off but I knew basically where it was but the confusing part was when going along Chelsea embankment we couldn't take a right turn over the bridges but eventually because of a traffic jam we turned around in the middle of the road (as others were doing) and went over Albert bridge. It was then I lost my bearings as it was dark and I couldn't see the map - anyway after a bit of driving around we found ourselves right by the Travelodge and we parked in a side street whilst I went to check in at about 7 pm. We were in rooms 226 and 228 and both have been refurbished recently. You could smell the fresh paint as you walked through the corridors. For those that say the hotel needs refurbishing if they read the Travelodge website it does say they are refurbishing in December & January and there may be inconvenience. Obviously we stayed for 4 nights over Christmas and didn't see any sign of any workmen or noise. The rooms were situated towards the back of the hotel and there was little outside noise (apart from aeroplanes which we are not so used to). Both rooms were clean and warm. In fact we left the heater on a medium heat during the day so that it was warm when we got back late in the evening. In fact we turned it off in the night but the room was still very warm - I woke up a couple of times feeling very warm. The bed was a bit soft but you don't expect luxury. The hot water in the shower was good too, quite easily adjustable. We were told at reception that as it was Christmas Day the next day there would be no housekeeper but if we needed any more milk, coffee, tea, clean towels etc we were to go to reception and ask for them. With regard to the \u00c2\u00a35 parking fee when I rang the Travelodge when I booked up a few weeks before the person on the phone said that Disabled Blue Badge holders do not have to pay the fee. When I double checked this at Reception when we arrived the young man said he didn't really know if this was right and added that the helpline for the parking people would be closed for Christmas. The signs didn't mention anything about Disabled parking apart from the fact you would be fined if you parked in the disabled bay without displaying the blude badge. Anyway, we took a chance on it and didn't pay - there were others in the disabled bay but I didn't see any of them to ask whether they had paid and didn't notice their pay and display tickets (but presumably if you do it by phone you don't get a ticket anyway). We didn't come out any morning and find a fine so that was good. The one complaint my Mum has (and this is true of other places we have stayed) is that although the shower tray is studded and slightly non slip they could still do with a rubber shower mat as there is always the fear of slipping. Grab rails are there to help you in and out which is good. Overall the stay was very good value - the booking was made just over 3 weeks before on the saver rooms and each night was booked separately to keep the cost down. Our stay worked out to \u00c2\u00a322 per person per night or \u00c2\u00a344 for each room so I can't see anything to complain about here as it was warm, clean and only used as a base. In November we stayed for 2 nights on a weekend at the City Road Travelodge for my son's graduation and this cost us \u00c2\u00a333 each person per night but we booked online breakfast in this at \u00c2\u00a36 which was really great as there was a hot and cold buffet type breakfast and it was good. However, this lodge was much noisier than Battersea - indeed the nightclub down the road from our window was playing the boom boom bass until about 6 am in the morning on Sunday night/Monday morning. My parents were ok as they were situated centrally in the building and didn't hear it. This one was chosen for its proximity to the Barbican where the graduation ceremony was and we all travelled by train on that occasion so didn't need any parking.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales", "Title": "\u201cShould you stay at Battersea Travelodge?\u201d", "Author": "ReviewmanSouthWales", "ReviewID": "UR51675403", "Content": "Stayed here with my wife for two nights December 2009.

Hence, we selected the Battersea Travelodge for its location and price - I paid \u00c2\u00a319 for the room for the Saturday and \u00c2\u00a39 for the Sunday (amazing price considering the following Monday was a Bank Hol). The hotel is well located near to Clapham Junction and is on bus routes for the Battersea/Fulham/Clapham area. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and tidy and looked in reasonable repair - fairly newly decorated i think. However, the room was stiflingly hot (was a very hot weekend though). The only problem in our room was that the cold water pressure was virtually non-existant!! It trickled out of the tap whcih was ok - i'm not impatient, but the real problem was with the shower. The hot water pressure was good and therefore, it was impossible to strike a balance that would be tolerable to stand under, rendering the shower unusable. On the first evening i thought this might be due to everyone using the water at the same time so have a sponge wash and tried again the next morning. No change. We reported it to reception and it was clear they knew there was a problem in that room. They were very helpful and offered to move us but as we were only there 2 nights we made do with the sponge! Of our other friends, a couple had rooms that were fine and some had rooms that were very tatty but operational.
