Cons: Finding the hotel could be a bit tricky, however finding anything in Venice is tricky until you've been there before. Had to take the steps up to the first floor where the elevator begins, however staff helped us with our luggage. If you were disabled, Venice is full of stairs anyway, so the stairs to the elevator were not an issue.

Very central to San Marco's square. From the time we arrived, it was down hill. We paid the equivalent of $300 a night to stay here & it was a dump. The lobby seemed charming, but as soon as we went up the elevator to our floor, the first thing you see is a very strange & creepy S&M painting. We open to doors to our rooms which were supposed to be double rooms. Imagine how surprised I was when we see 2 twin sized mattresses pushed together. Lets not forget the wall to wall upholstery with holes in the wood work that looked like rats had been there. So after we got over the shock of this looking like a murder mystery hotel, we went out to dinner. They ask you to leave your only room key behind so they will know if you're in or not-I've never been asked to do this anywhere else so it made me feel very uncomfortable. The next day, we had to ask for a key to the safe in the room, which the safe was about the size of a child's shoe box. We could barely fit our 2 passports & 1 wallet in there much less anything else. So, we saw the chamber maid in the hall way & asked her for 2 clean towels & let her know that we did not need our room cleaned that day. We also put the sign on the door that say \"Please do not disturb\" so she wouldn't go in. We ventured out for a while & came back to find that the maid had been in our room after we'd asked her not to go in & put the sign on the door. Everything had been moved & when we went down to the front desk to ask why that would happen, not only did we speak to the 2 workers, but we also spoke with the manager. Not one of them ever apologize for this but they just couldn't understand why we would be upset when we specifically asked for our rooms not to be entered our privacy wasn't respected. The manager kept saying \"I will have to ask the maid when she comes in tomorrow, I don't know why she would have gone in. You just have to trust us.\" I said to her that it's hard to trust a place that you ask & put a sign up to not enter into our space & they clearly don't respect our wishes. That same morning at breakfast the waiter was very rude to us on more than one occasion. Venice was our last leg of our trip following Rome & Florence. The breakfast was the worst at La Fenice de Artistes & the customer service was atrocious! I would much rather have spent my $300 a night to stay in a nicer place somewhere else where they respect the customers. I've never had such poor customer service in the US anywhere I've ever stayed.

I would recommend venturing over to Santa Croce for some wonderful food though, and if you are looking for a bit of a lively night, there is a square which we stumbled upon on that side of Rialto bridge where the market is during the day which was buzzing with the italian students drinking in the various bars which appear later on in the evening.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cLa Fenice is a honey of a hotel !\u201d", "Author": "formerFA", "ReviewID": "UR8838239", "Content": "Family and I find the Fenice a honey of a hotel. My husband, daughter, son-in-law, and I settled in for five sweet nights last April in two charming, comfortable, clean rooms. Kids' room had view of Santo Stefano belltower and rio de la Verona. Our room #356 had four windows, one to courtyard with lush cascading wisteria; one to garden below with exotic palm tree; the others out on to adjacent La Fenice Opera House and the small Campo de la Fenice---just around the corner from Campo San Fantin with its land entrance to the Opera House. We had two cozy double beds pushed together; plenty of clothes-hanging space in the large armoire; immaculate, modern bathroom; excellent breakfast each morning in the hotel's historic \"La Taverna\" restaurant, including the best cappucchino-molto-caldo in Venice. The amiable staff helped us with water taxi reservations, \"La Zucca\" dinner reservations (concierge Ileanna); another gave us a bonus tour of the hotel's rooftop apartment where Marcello Mastroianni (yes!) used to stay. (Alberto) One reason we booked here is that in the book \"Italian Days\" author Barbara Grizzuti Harrison describes it as her favorite in Venice because of its old-time character. We agree.

The feel of the building is one of tiredness in sore need of a radical makeover. The rooms were always small but the dingy paint makes them look tiny. The women looking after the rooms are fine and efficient. The breakfast is nothing to write home about and hardly in line with modern, northern European, notions of healthy eating. Anything more than the basic costs extra. The woman on breakfast duty was always charming and friendly. The dining restaurant in the evening is very expensive.

We later recognised this location from the film The Comfort of Strangers starring Helen Mirren and Christopher Walken. However, the bed was incredibly uncomfortable. It was 2 beds pushed together and my husband would wake up in the night down the gap between the two. We complained and were told there are no double beds in the hotel at all. We slept very badly the whole time we were there, and even though it was December there were stil mozzies around- husband bitten in the room. The bathroom had a hand held shower- impossible to wash your hair without sitting in the bath! Worse still was the breakfast. Terrible stale bread, tired mortadella and sweaty cheese.

The hotel has an old feel to it, but with lots of charm, updated bathrooms, and great artwork everywhere. The San Marco location is the best, and we had a great time. The common areas are great with their fluffy red couches that make it really nice to become tranced in a good book after your feet are tired from wandering, uh getting lost in venice! We enjoyed the breakfast, although there were only a few options, the hot chocolate was soothing, the apricot croissants yummy, and we splurged & had one of the best cheese omlettes (5 Euro, well worth it!), had to get another one the next morning as well !! We would defintely stay here again, we liked the casualness of the place, great location, and the nice atmosphere. (The Hotel's resteraunt is VERY fancy & expensive) Defintely check out the Rialto bridge and the fresh fruit market and fish market during the morning/afternoons. The quality is outstanding, and we had the best tangerines & pears, and salads! On the rialto bridge one of the stores to look at, especially if you have kids, or need a child present, is ZORTOLUCCI, they make handmade & hand painted wooden clocks, music boxes, etc, it's like a gepetto store. The prices are very affordable for everything, because if you were to get these things in the states they would be at least ($40-$50), where most of the items are below 20 euros. Defintely visit the Palazzo Ducale twice. Once during the day (with the various vendors, and TONS of pigeons. People love the pigeons, and buy food and pose with them crawling all over them. Pigeons are pretty gross to me, but it's pretty amusing to see other people, all for a crazy photo!!) A night time visit is awesome when all the local artists come out, and you can grab an espresso or caldo chocolate (hot chocolate) de porta via (to go, in italian) and walk around. We met a local ventian artist who had the most amazing oils and watercolors. He doesn't show up til about 9:30pm, and in the winter wears a huge black down jacket, his name was Teriano so if you go there look for him, and see his beautiful work.", "Date": "November 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHany for the opera\u201d", "Author": "Freischutz", "ReviewID": "UR6174270", "Content": "Our visit to Venice was primarily to attend a performance at the rebuilt opera house.

La Fenice et des Artistes is virtually next door and so could not be better located for our purpose. Hardly cheap (but what do you expect for Venice), but good when measured against the quality of similarly classed hotels in the town (we cannot compare it with the Danieli or Cipriani, having never stayed at that end of the market!). The buffet breakfast was a particularly good 'Eurobrek'. Not the hotel itself, but be wary of the restaurant just as you emerge into Piazza San Fantin from the hotel.

Calm: Relatively sheltered from street and canal noise (at least room 252, which has a garden view was). Female reception staff were helpful - very happy to reserve tickets for events, e.g. opera, and to recommend restaurants. Clean. Apart from mosquito 'splats' on the walls. Decor.Though not to everyone's taste, the rooms are quite fancy - think sillky, patterned wallpaper. Very baroque, old school and seems to attempt to keep with Venice's 'rennaisance' image. CONS Mosquitos are a definite problem and the hotel will not deal with them. Even in October, mozzies bit my partner and I about 25 times between us. Male reception staff: Particularly the chap who does the evening shift from 5pm onwards. He was unhelful, dishonest, unwilling to offer good service (see following comment) and quite agressive. Rooms - no soundproofing, air conditioning and quite small. Aircon isn't a problem in October - even in an above-average 20C - but I would advise against taking a room here in hot months, unless you're a sauna lover. There aren't fans either. In our room, you could here the conversation in the room 251 quite clearly and the television in 253. Not a problem for heavy sleepers or if you stay awake chatting from 12am - 2am too like our neighbours. However, both rooms were happy to reduce their noise upon request. Price: It's relative to the location, which is fairly expensive. We paid \u00c2\u00a3400 for 3 nights. It's dependent on taste, but I'd recommend a cheaper district. Moving out from San Marco a little and you'll find better rooms and feel less like you're in a pure tourist zone and in more \"real\" Venice (despite there being a fairly tiny resident population). It won't take you long to swing down to the attractions of San Marco or anywhere else for that matter - it's a small city. Breakfast: If you have to leave before breakfast (pre-7.30am), the hotel will not arrange even for a bowl of cereal. A male receptionist actually lied by saying that breakfast was \"complimentary\" and not \"factored into the room price\" - so insisted that then hotel did not have to provide any breakfast for us at 6.30am or offer any financial compensation. Breakfast does not offer a wide selection but otherwise, if the times suit you, you won't starve.

There were four of us, we occupied two double rooms. Both rooms were large and comfortable. Our bathroom was large, and newly fitted out, very nicely done. We never heard any noise from any other room. The air conditioning in both rooms worked well, given a few hours start, because of the large size of the rooms. Staff were OK. The breakfast was adequate but not exciting eg the fruit was tinned fruit salad. Plenty of reasonable restaurants around, but suggest you avoid eating at Hosteria Galileo in the corner of Campo San Anzolo a hundred yards away, the verbal \"special of the day\" fish dishes (similar to those on the menu at 14 euros) were charged on our bill at 35 euros each! - similarly their starters and the wine the waiter recommended - check the price of everything not on the menu very carefully if you eat there.
