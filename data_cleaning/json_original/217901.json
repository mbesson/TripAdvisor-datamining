Our room was huge for the price we paid, and the shower was wonderful. There is an S-bahn station down the street within walking distance. The walls were very thin, which made a restful quiet night very difficult. I understand that on New Year's Eve, I have no right to complain but the other nights it was loud. I could even hear cell phones ringing in the rooms next, under or above us. We were even next to the elevator and stairwell, which did not offer any escape from the noise. Should also mention that there is only one elevator for the entire hotel. As I said, you get what you pay for. We paid for our room, so that is what we got. Parking is 5 EUR a day. Internet was provided by The Cloud service which is very expensive, that we opted out. Breakfast was 10 EUR per person per day, which we did not pay. As for the parking lot. There were plenty of spots with all different size cars. Advice I have is to watch where you step. The local apartment complex residents like to walk their dogs in the grassy area near the lot and not pick up after them. My husband was unfortunate enough to be a victim twice. We might stay here again, due to the proximity to my in-laws, if the prices stay the same.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBusiness Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Oldbloke_TH", "ReviewID": "UR120189749", "Content": "Had an urgent business trip to make (1 day max) and needed a hotel near Schonefeld Airport.

We took a taxi from the airport to this hotel (the RUDEST taxi driver I've ever come across. A grumpy Turkish old man who insulted and mocked us all the way to the hotel). Anyway, the hotel is very simple, we didn't get the same feeling you get when visiting their website. The furniture is quite old, the staff cold (although we didn't have issues with them) and the grub very basic. The hotel is squeezed between two blocks of ugly apartment blocks, so don't expect any lovely views. Also, there is nothing to do or see in the neighbourhood (which looked a bit rough to me). On the good side, our room was very spacious and very, very clean. The sheets spotless and the carpet smelling good. The double was 50 euros. In conclusion, the hotel is ideal if you are on a budget and are forced to stay close to the airport.

It is best to buy a day ticket for the train (approx 7 euros) and to get into the centre requires one train change, although it is not to difficult to manage.

That was the main reason, but the fare and the shuffle service also influenced my choice. I think the fare (45 euros) could include breakfast, which it doesn't. If you want to eat, then you should pay 10 more euros. The shuffle service wasn't available the day I arrived because the driver had called in sick, so I had to take a cab, which cost me 8 euros (3 more than the shuffle, I believe). I could have got there by S-Bahn too (the hotel is only one station after the airport), but as I had seen on google maps the hotel was a little far away from the station - I wouldn't feel comfortable walking there by myself. On my reservation I had asked for the service and I think the staff should have confirmed the shuffle or say that it wouldn't be available for me by simply calling me. The other thing I had asked for was a non'smoking room. They didn't pay attention to that either and, had I not asked whether my room was a non-smoking one before taking the lift I would have had to go back to the reception and ask for it to be changed. Luckily, I remembered to confirm and when the receptionist said that my room was actually a smoking one, the manager arranged for me to stay at another one (a double!). My room was big (since it was a double) and clean. The towels had a strange smell though I believe they were indeed clean. The next day I checked out and the morning staff was also very nice to me.
