Next door is a Vapiano Restaurant were you can get great Italian food in a very relaxed setting. Next door is also a subway station. About 2 minutes away is a stop for the airport bus. If you walk about 5 minutes you reach Bahnhof Zoo (Zoo station) which is one of the main stations in Berlin. From there you get quickly anywhere. It is also where you can catch the express bus to the airport. Service (10/10): Nothing particular. Fast, friendly and \u2013 well \u2013 I got an upgrade ;-) Gym (?/10): There is a gym but I haven\u2019t been there. I went for a run which I prefer in a city like Berlin. A good recommendation is to run to Bahnhof Zoo (Zoo station) and from there you can run around the zoo. No need to enter the zoo. A nice run without any cars. Breakfast (?/10): No idea how that is. I had breakfast at a bakery at Kurfuerstendamm. Easy because the hotel is so central. Coffee (10/10): I like good coffee and was very pleased to find a Nespresso machine with some capsules in the room. Free of charge, very nice. Don\u2019t know whether every room has a Nespresso machine or just the suite. Internet Connection (10/10): Free Wifi \u2013 what else do you want Room (10/10): Again, since I was upgraded to a suite I have no idea how regular rooms are.

Firstly, the background of the booking was that I originally made it for August but couldn't go in the end and totally forgot to cancel it. The hotel were very accommodating as they allowed me to book another time to visit as they had already taken my money. They could have been difficult about this and they weren't which impressed me. The positives of the hotel were: Clean and modern Good location Nice massage Good equipment in the gym Privilege rooms come with access to the Privilege lounge where you can get free tea, coffee, drinks and nibbles. The negatives were: The bed, as previous reviewers have stated, was too hard The pillows weren't great and even though they put a pillow menu by the bed, when we asked for something different they didn't have them (so what is the point of advertising something that you don't have??!) The shower was a complete nightmare - great Grohe rain head shower, but when you have a shower that powerful you aren't going to keep it from going all over the bathroom floor without a door or a platform that is more raised. I had a great massage there, but the massage room is right next to the gym and three people walked in while I was having my massage. It also means that when someone is pounding away on the treadmill it's not as relaxing and quiet as a massage should be. The Privilege Lounge didn't serve and alcoholic drinks apart from beer.

Especially in order to avoid getting the car damaged by rogue fireworks. I felt they need to improve on some details still though, just to mention those here: - Internet passwords are only valid for one device for up to 24 hours. New passwords need to be obtained from the reception. One would think that for that price per night, they could put together a more convenient system. - Minibar charges are as ridiculously expensive as other hotels of the class, so just buy your drinks outside.

The breakfast was excellent. If there is 8 different kind of cereals and mueslies you can say it is versatile! Me like! Spa. Well. Quite an experience. On the Saturday evening there was about 3-4 couples in the sauna area. There is the steam sauna and the normal sauna. Everyone in the sauna-are has towel along but they didn't mind to cover themselves with them. I mean, there it was kind of unisex sauna for the very open minded people...

The maid has found it and the hotel very politely offered me to send them to me. I was happy unless they told me that they will charge me 40euros for the shipping fee... A little bit robbery I think for the shipping which actually will costs a couple of euros... :( But IF we travel Berlin next time we will probably try another hotel.

At times it seemed like an elephant was upstairs as well as an Irish dancer. The pipes run down through our room from above and you can here the water trickling down which is so annoying the third fourth and fifth days into the stay. Also the sliding cupboards from the room above vibrated down to our room And you could hear its every movement. The loudest noise came from doors slamming shut from along the corridor and above.

No desk, no tray to place a suitcase, no radio clock, while the \"mini bar\" consisted of several sweets displayed on the night stand WITHOUT any price tag (I come to that later). The shower cabin was \"missing\" a door, soaking the entire bathroom during taking a shower. In short, the room was in need of a makeover.

If you have more than two suitcases then it will be cramped. Bed was very good, A/C worked well except for the first night. What they have to be careful about is maintenance. Even though the hotel is brand new, the materials used require constant maintenance, otherwise in a short time they'll have problems... But overall I recommend this hotel because of price, location and above all being a brand new hotel.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cChic and crisp decor, excellent and helpful staff, amazing price for such a quality hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Couls", "ReviewID": "UR115520421", "Content": "This place is chic boutique.

The breakfast is perfectt-everyone is catered for. There was some noise from the nightclub opposite the hotel but if you shut the window you don't notice it. We tried the sauna, solarium and tread mills in the gym which were very nice after walking all day around Berlin! Berlin is an amazing city and we came back home feeling as though there was lots more to see. My Son particulary liked the Berlin Philharmonic building. The concerts start again in September and he is keen to go back and see the Orchestra. If you want to see the RIchstag make sure you book online. We were disappointed we couldn't go into see the dome. The transport system is very good and the hotel is not far from the main train station at Zoological Garden The train from the airport takes you straight there.

First, the hotel is pretty. European chic. Modern looking, a little stark, not cozy. It is very clean though. All of the staff is pleasant except for the bartender who had a major issue understanding English and was rude. I found this a problem considering that this hotel will be catering to an international crowd. I would assume mostly business travelers. The location of the hotel is good for seeing sites and is near the metro lines for transportation. The downsides...How does a hotel not have clocks in the rooms? This is a city hotel where business travelers will be staying. Business people need to know time. This hotel is not on a deserted beach. The bedding is awful. No top sheet. Two half comforters are on top of the bed and no matter which way you turn them only part of your body is covered. Nice trendy idea, but it does NOT work well. The dinner menu for room service is very limited.

The hotel is brand new and you can easily tell by looking at the rooms. Everything seems to be nice and tidy but it doesn't strike me as luxurious. Practical yes, luxurious not really. The reason I decided to stay at this hotel was the great stay I had at H10 Marina Barcelona. This has not come close to the same standard offered in Barcelona. Price range is just about right plus the added value of free Internet which is always expected and nice to have. A lot of people complain about WiFi prices in Berlin, I don't have that issue when staying at most hotels because of my membership status. So for those who don't hold status but want free Internet, this is a good place for that. The building from outside isn't really all that appealing and worst of all are the entrance doors. They are not marked, not labelled, not glass or see through and have no indication of them being doors. If you didn't know that a door should be there instead of the great grey block, the door won't open and you wouldn't find your way in. I think that needs to be fixed. The bar area is nice and all but is way too open for anyone. Some privacy is normally nice to have. Just facing the hotel is one of the loudest teenager clubs in town, lots of youngsters making so much noises, drunk across the street all night long. Do NOT get a room facing the main street, ask for a room facing the backyard. Either the staff never wanted me to stay longer at the hotel or the reservation system on their website in addition to almost every single online agencies were going haywire that day. I had booked the hotel last minute before leaving to Berlin for 2 nights, didn't know how long I was going to stay. After arriving in Berlin I realised the need for staying an extra night and consulted the front desk who assured me they are fully booked and they have been like this for the entire week (which doesn't add up because I just made the booking for those 2 nights). After I told them to check it online they found rooms available and after checking with their manager the answer was that they are fully booked period. Not a big problem for me because I can always just jump across to any of the chains I am a member of and I know I will have a room available. Surely enough, Crowne Plaza honoured me with a great room and great service after knowing of the incident. For fun, I decided to check the website for rooms and they still had rooms available, along with a bunch of other online travel agencies that I normally use for hotel bookings without glitches whatsoever. Bottom line, is it a nice hotel? Yes. Value for money? I get better service and nicer rooms for the same and lesser prices (memberships, corporate deals we have, etc..) Would I consider it a gem? No. Will I recommend it to other people and friends? Yes if they are sure of their dates (but then again, there's no guarantee their booking will be honoured since I could've just reserved it online and still get told there are no rooms and be told to leave and find somewhere else to stay). So, No! Will I ever return there? To H10 hotels elsewhere, yes. H10 in Berlin, most likely not.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel in a fantastic location!\u201d", "Author": "sugar_heart", "ReviewID": "UR105757337", "Content": "We stayed for 5 days last week.

Our room was very nice my only complaints are that the wooden floor wasn't cleaned the whole 5 days we were there so there was a lot of dust, Room windows didn't open which was very annoying especially when it was 23 degrees outside and also we were disappointed that we didn't have any tea/coffee facilities for the amount we had paid for the room.
