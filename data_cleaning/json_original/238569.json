The perfect accomm for our weekend away.\u201d", "Author": "DanAndLiz L", "ReviewID": "UR127618653", "Content": "Situated less than 5 minutes walk away from Amsterdam Centraal Train Station, this hotel was perfect my boyfriend and I's short weekend away. Hotel staff on reception were extremely friendly and helpful, offering recommendations for the best coffee houses and restaurants in town. The fact that the reception is open 24/7 is also a plus. Breakfast was downstairs in a little kitchenette, where they offered a help-yourself selection of toast, jams, marmalade and a coffee machine. This was explained on the website and was exactly as expected so nothing to complain of from our end! Some couples brought cheese and ham along with them as well to the breakfast, but toast + jam suited us just fine. The coffee machine was available all day which was great for a quick pick-me-up latte as you're walking past to your room! Our room was the attic room, which was so lovely and surpassed our expectations. A good size, extremely clean and it provided the basics for what we needed for our short weekend away. The shower in the en-suite was my highlight; a huge walk-in shower occupied half the bathroom! I would say the only downside, (and the reason why we are giving it a 4/5 instead of 5*s is the \"double\" bed, where being typically European they have pushed two beds together, which rolled away from each other quite easily during the night meaning you have to utterly jump ship if you want a cuddle! For me, it was the little touches in the hotel such as the cutesy soap packet message (see picture), the decor of the sofas downstairs and the random shoe buffering machine which added a quirky humour and quaintness to the hotel on Herengracht Street. For me, I thought it more than catered to our needs and surpassed our expectations and was perfect for our weekend away. As for those who reviewed it more negatively I can only imagine they stayed for longer than a couple of days and could understand that the not-so-extensive breakfast would become a little tiring. I would recommend this hotel for couples who are on a budget, want to have great location close to restaurants/coffee shops/canal/train station, and aren't staying longer than a couple of days (ideally).", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGoog hotel, walking distance to everywhere!\u201d", "Author": "MelbCHick81", "ReviewID": "UR127445177", "Content": "Nice clean and as the name says basic hotel, no frills but it's got all you need.

He told me about its great location and that he would recommend it to me. I read the reviews and saw commenters that fell into two distinct categories: *Those who felt the product was over promising (perhaps that was the Chic in the title that did that?) *Those who felt the location was superb even if the rooms are quite small. My one night stay in December right before Christmas was very pleasant. The rate was very fair as I suspected occupancy was low. The quick take is that I was very pleased and I would definitely stay there again. For starts the hotel is a very short walk from the Central Station. I would say 8-10 minutes depending on how much luggage one is toting and how bike traffic is encountered. The next observation was the serenity of the Herengracht canal which the hotel faces. The canal and surroundings make for lovely ambience. The lobby visually has the sleek and basic signature of a hotel trying to be a boutique. The furnishings are IKEA-like, basic, but uncluttered. THe check-in was very quick. Luckily, I was traveling light because there are lots of stairs to negotiate to get to the rooms. Be prepared to make a few trips if you're toting lots of luggage as there is no elevator. My room was perfect. It was small but cozy (sorry I can't recall the room number). The room was ideal for someone seeking day sleep after a long flight because there were no windows, only a skylight that had it's own drapery to effective block out the sun. The single bed was comfortable. There was a small desk and \"enough\" space left over bearing in mind I was a solo traveler and I didn't have that much luggage to start with. The bathroom facilities were great and since I'm a stickler for shower water pressure, it was a relief to see there was plenty of that too. I'm still using the great smelling body wash that is provided under their own Cheap and Basic label. Where can I order more? My comings and goings from the hotel were always met with upbeat staff at the front desk. I walked all over Amsterdam until 0100 and never did I have any safety concerns as Herengracht is clearly a very upscale area and the hotel entrance is well lit. The hotel's location is really a big selling point to me. Everything downtown and as far as Leidesplein are within easy walking distance. The neighborhood felt very quiet and yet very close to the action. My only complaint echoes those of others in that the breakfast offerings are pretty meager. Sure, the continental breakfast is free but I merely gave it a side glance on my way out. The slim offerings of bread, a toaster, and some jam hardly seemed worth the while. The hotel shines in location and it's understated but chic lobby feel. This hotel in my view is then a basic but unpretentious boutique-esque property. The lobby and check-in area is not substantial in size, so if it's a W Hotel abuzz with hipsters and mood lighting you seek, this hotel by design doesn't have those trappings. However, for an active traveler who appreciates a degree of value, quick access to downtown, the train station, and rooms that have character I would strongly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basel", "Title": "\u201cBest possible hotel for our stay!\u201d", "Author": "Franziska J Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR124614060", "Content": "A short walk from the train station led us to this great hotel along the historical Herengracht.

not ideal for anyone with mobility problems, think you might have a problem too if suffering from vertigo, so would be worth actually phoning the hotel when booking a room to get one nearer the ground floor if you cant manage alot of stairs. i would also think that if you have been eating the dear old space cake at the coffee shops, your head would be spinning a bit by the time you would get to the top of the house! the hotel is chic and basic, with white paintwork throughout, which really could do with a freshen up ( well... white paintwork only stays like that for a short time after painting before scuff marks start to appear) so i would call it more shabby chic, but the marks etc did not put me off the overall appeal of the hotel. the twin room we had, was big enough for what it was needed for, looked out the back of the hotel, the beds were really comfortable,sheets all nice and clean the bathroom was compact but had a brilliant shower( i want to replace my home shower for the hotels!), fresh towels, soap and shower gel was a nice wee touch. wee flat screen tv which had english channels( any soap addicts will still be able to watch their fav soaps in the evening!), the staff were very helpful , the communal area past reception was nice and airy, and there was a pc that could be used to access the internet/e-mails, which was free. another corner of the communal area was used in the mornings for breakfast, bread ,butter ,toaster and small selection of jams available( the butter was foul... more like a greasy lard type margarine ( stick to just jam on the toast!) also use of the coffee machine which did filter coffee right through to cafe lattes, also a great selection of teas, and this you could access 24/7. the hotel is also handy as a base for walking around the city. in a nutshell, i would definitely use this hotel again and hope to return to amsterdam again in the future. notes about the city :- very accessable on foot to see everything, the canal trips are pricey and if youre on a budget, save yourself the expence and use your feet instead!, watch out for bicycles, theyre everywhere so watch out when crossing roads etc, the cafe culture is fab, though typical of anywhere in europe, its not cheap 5 euro for a glass of wine, 2.50 euro for wee bottles of coke/water/ juice. i would reccomend getting a bottle and when finished drinking, keep and refill with water from the water dispenser in the hotel as on a hot day and walking around everywhere, you get thirsty. if you like cocktails, go to the house of bols, 11 euro in, learn a bit of the history of the distillery and then finish up in the bar where you get a free cocktail and 2 free shots( you can also buy more cocktails for 5 euro each) this is just down the road a bit (5 mins walk)from the Rijksmuseum ( a nice wee hour looking at vemeer and rembrants amongst other pieces of art) ann franks house is also close enough to walk to and very interesting( whilst in the short queue for it , was interested to overhear a canadian ask another person in the queue'' so this ann frank, is she quite famous?'' anyway well worth the hour or so learning all about this young girl and what her experiences were during WW2. the main square is also nice to walk to, the royal palace is an impressive building and there is a great atmosphere. of course you have all the tacky shops selling souvenirs, sex shops, cheese shops( yummy trying out different cheeses on offer) but there is plenty of clothes shops ( H&M flagship store near the square) and in the posh shopping area you have all the big designer labels if you have the money to blow there! the red light district is worth a walk through in the evening, if only to shake your head and think the girls should consider their career options! if you decide that amsterdam is a place to visit , you wont be disapointed, and if you want a hotel that is close to everything then chic and basic is the one you want.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dundee, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDoes what is say's on the tin.\u201d", "Author": "SuperDuff", "ReviewID": "UR117904196", "Content": "We stayed here as a couple December 2010/January 2011 over New Year.

Staff are very friendly and helpful and I appreciated being able to check in on arrival (around 11 am) rather than waiting until the 3pm advertised check-in (which is too late - hotels are pushing this time further and further out). Room and bathroom were spotless, bathroom in fact seemed newish, but the layout of the room was most peculiar - no windows, only a massive skylight that took up half the bedroom ceiling and which allowed at least 3 sets of windows from other sections of the hotel to look down into my room. A curtain could be pulled across the middle of the room, dividing the bed area from the table, tiny wardrobe and TV area, and that allowed the only privacy possible so one had to duck behind the curtain to change clothing in the narrow strip of floorspace by the bed. This curtain was also the only way to darken the room for sleeping. To cross into the bathroom at the opposite side one had to be fully clothed... a most peculiar set-up and the cute painted monkeys on the walls didn't make up for the inconvenience of this, nor justify the hotel's claim to be chic! I was tempted to ask for a room change but I was only there 3 days to catch up with friends so spent little time in the room and frankly I have never found hotels in Amsterdam to be up to much. I had booked a double room despite travelling alone & am very glad I did as the one I got was small enough (there would never have been enough wardrobe space for 2 people to hang even one change of clothes each) and I hate to think what a single would have been like. The bed was firm enough for a decent sleep but the foam pillows and foam-type duvet filling were not very pleasant but seemed clean. Some reviewers from a while back have mentioned breakfast but a note handed into my room after check-in advised that there is no longer a buffet breakfast available - all one gets is supermarket sliced bread, a toaster, butter pats and 3 types of jam. The DIY coffee machine makes excellent coffee however. The location is the best part - far enough away from the really squalid parts of Amsterdam around Dam Square yet easy enough to walk to most attractions. Would I stay there again? No. But then I rather hope I won't have to travel too often to Amsterdam in the future. This time it was suffering from a garbage strike and the piles in the streets were getting higher and higher and beginning to smell - just as well the weather was cool.

The hotel is literally located 5 minutes walk from Central Station right next to the Herengracht Canal. Amsterdam can look spread out on the map, but from this hotel everywhere is walkable. Around the corner of the hotel starts off with a row of coffeeshops that takes you to an alley of shops, delis, and more coffeeshops. Dam Square is walkable from Herengracht and from there you an walk to RLD, then end it in Damrack. With the hotel being close to Central Station, not only can you take a train to any parts of Europe, but shuttles to other parts of Holland, and canal tour boats to the rest of Amsterdam. I would hightly reccomend getting the Medium Modern Hotel Room, although small, it was enough space for 2 people and 2 large luggages, good use of small furnishing, and comfortable/cozy stay in Amsterdam. Expedia has the best price for this hotel. Our room was in the top part of the hotel, the attic, since there was an extra set of stairs to get to the bedroom. The reception was great with a welcoming letter directed to the guest including a brown paper bag with soap, shampoo, and two types of water (sparkling and regular). The lobby is really comfortable and love the kitchen with the free coffee, espresso, cappucinno, tea, and water. The staff were so friendly, just like the rest of the people of Amsterdam. Now the negative, no elevator. Prior to my departure, this is what I reccomended when I filled out the review at check-out. If you look at the buildings of Amsterdam they are very narrow. Yes, the stairs were very narrow and after going up 3 floors to find another set, you gasp for more air. Hopefully one day they can build an elevator for guest to use to get to their floor. Chic & Basic was a second choice from the Bellevue and was very glad this hotel was the winning choice.

We'd booked based on various reviews but also due to what we saw on the hotel website. The rooms are sold as modern and comfortable. The fact is that not all of the rooms are like this. We had booked a medium room via easytobook.com When we arrived and checked in, we were taken to a first floor room. For those who have problems climbing stairs, please note that the stairs were extremely steep. The room didn't represent what the photos show on any of the websites (travel agents or the hotel site.) The hotel's own website makes no reference to the 1970's decorated rooms with murals of bunting and the Smurfs (!) on the walls. The room was dark, with brown carpets and it looked like a child had been drawing on the walls. We therefore disputed the booking and what we'd been promised and were given the response of \"sorry we're full, and you didn't request a Chic & Basic room.\" We did book Chic&Basic - that's why we were standing in the hotel and also why they had a record of our booking. After much debate and negotiation we were given a small modern room on the ground floor. This was accessed via a door leading to an outside corridor with puddles on the floor. It had a very small window and no natural light. It was extremely small and the bathroom (shower and toilet) was tiny. Despite this, it was very clean, had a flat screen tv and a welcome pack (bottled water, shower gel and soap.) There was noise from an extractor fan at all times which could be annoying for light sleepers. Breakfast is served until 10.30am and has an ok selection of breads, cheeses, meats and fruit. Tea, coffee and water are available all day and for free. The majority of the staff were very helpful and friendly. They allowed us to check in early and store our bags once we'd checked out. The location of the hotel is superb. It's quiet whilst only being minutes from Centraal Station. If you get a decent room with a canal view, then it would be good value for money.

The hotel was excellent, about 5-10min walk from the main train station and a similar distance to Dam Square. In a quiet street overlooking a beautiful canal. Our room was in the attic which was a bit of a pain as there are no elevators and quite a few narrow tight stairs. Some would have trouble negotiating these stairs and would no doubt be upset about it, but you take the good with the bad when travelling in europe. The room was quite spacious with a large double bed, large shower and toilet... both of which were clean. We also had a mini lounge area that consisted of 2 hard plastic funky chairs and an lcd monitor with free cable... lots of channels included, including the adult channel which was good for a laugh. The staff were excellent! very helpful and spoke excellent english. Breakfast was your standard euro breaky with meats cheese breads and cereals. The free wifi was also a nice touch for those travelling with iPhones or laptops.

I would think that this hotel is properly managed and thought of. We had a welcome package with 3 bottles of mineral water, 1 soap and 1 shampoo. It also comes with a welcome letter stating about the 'house rule' with the internet access code. - FREE WATER!! yes, it might be redicilous, but, hey...get all you want before you go away with the bike - FREE COFFEE all day long...nice cofee machine (not the cheap one). Check out my pictures - Location...Location..Location. It's true that it's very close from the train station. Euro 10 only to get from station to the hotel and vice versa. It's walkable distance from the hotel. However, beware that your luggage's wheel might go bad since the pathway is very uneven. I would rather take a Euro10 taxy to avoid my wheels being spoiled.It only takes 3 minutes by bike to the Daam and Royal palace (also where the madam tussaude is). - Warm and Family feeling in the hotel. Nice people serving you will answer all your questions and needs (thanks for scotch tape Cynthia.....thanks for the trip advise Ginny) - Whole day bike rental is only Euro 10. Bad: - Very small room - We actually needed to 'support' the big window with a couple of wooden brick in order to make it open. - NO AC (who needs one when it's winter anyway) - Seperate toilet and bathroom. - Steep stairs - We need to ask the reception to open our door manually (this happens to many people staying there..not only us) since they claim that they are fixing the lock system. hmm..it's OK..but it's a bit troublesome to keep asking the reception everytime we wanted to go into the room.

We booked both a single and a double-bedded room. My bias is to stay in small properties (less than 30 rooms) and Chic and Basic was more than a pleasant surprise. This is my third trip to Amsterdam and I have stayed in the Grand Tulip (200+) and in a canal house on previous trips. One of the gems of the hotel is its staff - more about that later. With the exception of housekeeping, everyone was fluent in English - my native language and some were fluent in spanish - the native language of my partner and my friend. Housekeeping had a perfectly good understanding of english - significantly better than my non-existent dutch! First the location. C&B is conveniently positioned facing the second canal - Herengracht - within a short walk to Cental Station and the major tram/bus routes in the city. The character of the neighborhood in which C&B is located is very quiet residential yet within two blocks are an excellent restaurant (just across the pedestrian bridge on Broeweurgraht (sp)) and a neighborhood coffee shop. Two more blocks and there is a secondary shopping area with an abundance of restaurants/retail locations (but not the cookie cutter stores seen in most major cities that cater primarily to tourists). And the location of the hotel is within a ten to twenty minute walk to any of the active night life, restuarants, museums and typical shopping fare. As indicated in other posts, the rooms are smallish. If you plan on staying in your room most of your stay in Amsterdam, then this is not the property for you. Neither of the two rooms we booked had an area separate from the bed for writing or reading - less of a problem when traveling alone but problematic if traveling with another person and on different sleep schedules. The ability to read in bed is futher limited by an absence of reading lights - the room is either fully lit or dark with no in between possibilities. A common area is available for guests to take advantage of flat writing spaces as well as providing complimentary wifi if you have your own computer. Adjacent to the common area is a computer with high-speed and complimentary internet connectivity. The rooms and bathrooms were spotlessly clean - kudos to the housekeeping team. And each of our rooms had excellent hot water heat, plenty of water pressure and large windows that opened easily. The windows included both sheer curtains for filtered light and a curtain to darken the room considerably when sleeping during the occassional afternoon nap. The only \"weathered\" look in the hotel was the carpet leading to the rooms. It appears the carpet has remnants of last winter's snow and boot traffic. The carpet appears to be in good shape but not as clean as it could be and certainly not as spotless as are the rooms. And while speaking of stairs - they are typically Amsterdam - a cross between stairs and a vertical ladder. The self-serve breakfast offers an ample selection of fresh fruits, cheese, juices, hard boiled eggs, cold cuts, etc. The bread an role variety was exceptional and an apple tart can only be described as \"european\" - excellent flavor, texture and not ruined with sugary sweetness. But for the three of us, the most important element of our stay was the staff in the hotel. They were extraordinarily helpful and friendly - it was as if we were staying with friends and not interacting with the typical stadoffish clerks in larger hotels. Indeed, one evening we were invited to go \"local\" with a member of the staff. We in turn have invited their staff to visit with us whenever they come to Costa Rica.

When we arrived on what we thought was the street where our hotel was located after approx. a 10 min. walk from the train station, we walked by Chic and Basic, wondering if that was our hotel. Well luckily one of the employees saw us walking back & forth looking confused & came out to see if we were looking for Hotel New Amsterdam. He then told us it had changed ownership & had a new name. At first walking in there I was slightly disappointed, I had loved how quaint & unique it had looked before when we reserved it. We had the mini-suite on the top floor and I must say in the end I was not disappointed. The rooms had all been re-done. Our room was very clean, smelled of fresh paint, sparseley finished but had everything we needed. The bed was sooo comfortable. The stairs as you keep reading in these reviews were a killer! We had 3 very steep flights to our door, then once we unlocked our door had another flight actually into our room. Climbing them was almost like climbing a ladder!! The view out our window was fantastic. Breakfast was simple but sufficient & the staff was happy to hold our bags on the day we checked out as our flight did not leave till 10pm that nite. The location was perfect, close to everything but far enough away to be nice & quiet in a nice residential neighborhood. So although this was not the hotel we expected when arriving in Amsterdam, it did not disappoint at all. The only thing I can say I did not like was the tacky red lips shaped seat outside in front of hotel. I avoided having that in my pictures b/c it looked so cheap.

Good location near central station but near enough away from the Red Light district for my liking. Good bars and restaurants nearby. On a quiet canal which is lovely for walking along, very romantic!

The hotel was in a flux period as they are renovating some of the rooms, but the staff remains the same and they are very good and friendly! Let me tell you my what I see as the potential upside/downside of this management change. First the style is changing from quaint contemporary Dutch to modern and austere. Immediate upsides -- they seem to be renovating many of the rooms and while they were OK they are starting to show their age; free computer access in the lobby with wifi in the rooms. My concern is that you will see the prices start to rise, but some small increase might be expected. Finally, the continued saving grace is the location and the staff.

The hotel is very centrally located just a 10 minute walk from the Central Station and next to a charming canal and although the rooms are on the small side(we had the mini-suite in the loft which had a tricky low ceiling! and generally traditional Amsterdam hotels are on the small side) they are beautifully decorated and very cosy with high quality furnishings.Just look out for the steep stairs if you have large suitcases it can be hard work! The breakfast was typically continental with cold meats,cereals and a lovely selection of bread ,fresh juice and good coffee etc.served in a smart little dining room with a tv showing BBC news. What set this place apart for me was the service from all the staff who went out of their way to help and make us feel special-we have used many hotels in the US and Europe and can honestly say this hotel is right at the top when it comes to service,nothing was too much trouble.

It's kind of funky because it's a couple of canal houses put together but the staff couldn't have been nicer. We went with my two kids and their friends so we had 3 rooms. My husband and I had the canal view which I loved and the kids had interior views that were basic walls. These all would have been great in normal circumstances but we were there in a heat wave so got a little toasty in the rooms but not their fault. A couple of fans might have helped but no one was prepared for the 96 degree weather. The location was fantastic, you could walk to the train station and all the main spots and you could catch the canal boats at the train station and get a day pass which gets you all over by boat. We had a car so they have a lot you can park at for a fee of I think about 20.00 per day. I would gladly recommend this hotel and would go back again.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sangio2006", "Title": "\u201cVery good experience here\u201d", "Author": "sangio2006", "ReviewID": "UR5616869", "Content": "We stayed at the New Amsterdam for 4 nights this past April. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was quite good. Absolutely great location at the corner of the Herengracht and Brouwersgracht canals. Easy walking distance to everything, but very quiet. We had the room on the first floor (second floor to the North Americans) facing the canal. It has a fantastic view, but we couldn't enjoy it much because the room is too small to sit and lounge. It's barely larger than the bed. But, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. And we spent most of our time away from the hotel in any event.
