It is located close to Rome's main railway station - Termini. We used the express train direct from airport - the Leonardo Express, 15 euros each but if there is more than one of you it might be easier to get a cab - around 40 euro's. Rooms are smallish but adequate, we stored our suitcases on top of wardrobe. Everywhere is spotlessly clean, public areas, bedroom, bathroom. Towels were a good size and replaced daily. Shower always had plenty of hot water and good pressure. Hair dryer is fixed to wall and not that easy to use if you want to blow dry hair with a brush, I had taken my own and used that. The hotel advertised room safes but ours didn't work however staff were quick to offer to store items in hotel safe. In the end we locked things in our suitcase - laptops etc. We were not able to connect to wifi (cost is 3.50 euros for one hour) but other people had no difficulty. Close by there is a laundromatte where they will do your laundry for 9 euro's a load and you can use their fast computers for about 1;50 euros per hour. Breakfast buffet has rolls, danish, cheese, cold cuts, cereal, fruit (tinned),yogurt, juice coffee and tea. Milena (staff member) sets out breakfast each day and insisted on finding a tray and carrying our breakfasts outside into the lemon tree court for us. This was a beautiful place to eat breakfast and plan the day's activities. One day we came back from touring to find Milena had put 2 apples in our room for us! We found the room fairly quiet although you could hear someone snoring in another room one night. The room has a/c but it is not particlarly strong and since our room was on ground floor and glass door doubled as window we could not leave it open at night. Beds are pretty hard, at one point my husband was convinced that there was no mattress only a box spring but there was in fact a mattress and better too hard than too soft. The people on the desk were very helpful in giving directions to places we wanted to visit and in explaining how to buy metro tickets etc. We had a great week. There are limited restaurants in the area, not expensive but not amazing food either.

We arrived around 7pm and it is a very short walk from Termini train station. Do NOT pay for a cab ride unless you have a lot of cumbersome luggage, it is literally only 3 short blocks and the cabbies will charge you upwards of 20 euro! The hotel itself is small, but very comfortable. There is not very much space in the room, but we were there for sleeping only. The closet area is big enough to store suitcases, there is also a desk, flat screen TV, and much to our surprise, a mini fridge stocked with soda, water, and alcohol. We moved the mini bar items out and purchased our own items at a convenience store 1 block away. The bed was VERY comfortable and very clean. The bathroom was EXTREMELY spacious for European standards and included a bidet. The older gentleman at the front desk provided us with a city map and circled all of the \"must-do\" sites for our first visit to Rome. He also included helpful hints about taking the metro (don't board at Termini, avoid the crowds at the station and use the Republica station instead). All of the staff we encountered spoke English very well and greeted us with a smile at all times of day. Very warm and family-like. We traveled with our 4 year old son and we never once felt like we weren't welcome. Breakfast in the morning is very typical for Europe. Rolls, cheese, meat, pastry, cereal, yogurt. There are automatic coffee and juice machines. The coffee machine made a great cup and you could have several different types of coffee at the push of a button. The breakfast area was cozy and VERY clean. There is also a powder room adjacent to the breakfast area. The garden area is very simple. We did not use it, but we often saw several guests enjoying adrink at the outdoor tables. There is an indoor lounge room with books, Italy guides, and a full bar. Again, we did not order at the bar, but it was nice to have the option! Overall, it was a very centrally located, comfortable, clean, and friendly place to stay.

Our room was clean and neat with a nice window overlooking the garden/patio below. Hotel Select Garden has an enclosed solarium so that you can enjoy your breakfast inside or out. (We stayed inside to avoid the smokers on the outdoor patio.) The hotel also has a bar, although we didn't take advantage of that on this trip. WiFi is pay-by-the-hour and runs about the same as other hotels, but at Select Garden -- unlike other places we've stayed -- you can log out and save your minutes for later, which we appreciated.

There were too many mosquitos to open the windows, so we just suffered in the heat and humidity. The hair dryer was like a vacuum hose and attachment that had no air pressure.

We stayed there for four nights at the end of a couple week trip around Europe. We found this hotel last minute on TripAdvisor (two days before we stayed there) while in Europe. The location was very convenient to all of Rome's public transportation as it was about three short blocks from Termini, Rome's main underground stop and train station (where you can catch an express train to Rome's airport 30min. away). The breakfast was included and was filling and quite decent though nothing special. It was served in a lovely courtyard. The staff was quite good overall and the concierges spoke very good English. The day concierge was wonderful, extremely helpful with answering both questions we asked and offering useful information we hadn't thought to ask about. The night concierge was nice enough but I wouldn't leave your key with the front desk like they want (we always kept ours with us) if you are planning to come back late as we came back one evening and the night concierge had stepped out to talk to someone or for a smoke and had left a line of keys out on the desk, I assume so people could get back into their rooms if they returned while he was out. Other than that I felt quite safe there and I'm pretty security conscious. The room was small, though I believe that for a budget hotel in the middle of a major city, it could have been far worse. The bathroom was tiny. I mean really tiny, however it was sufficient for needs. To us the bidet seemed an extra waste of space in a place that was already super cramped, however I realize some people won't choose to stay somewhere that doesn't have one. My main problem with the hotel was that along with the shower being incredibly cramped, it was also very mildewed which seems like a fairly simple problem to fix. Other than the mildew in the shower everything else seemed very clean and the maid was on top of replacing anything in the bathroom that was running low (soap, toilet paper). Again, my overall impression of the place was very good and without the mildew I wouldn't have any complaints considering the reasonable rates this place offers compared to many others in the area.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money paid, friendly, clean and well situated for sight seeing.\u201d", "Author": "Sunell", "ReviewID": "UR46287786", "Content": "The Hotel Select was close to main Roma Termini, tour buses also run from there and are well worth using.

But my biggest complaint is about my room, which unfortunately is what makes up 90% of a hotel experience. Traveling alone, I suppose I can't be greedy, but I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and you would think that would count for something. I was given a \"quiet room off the garden\". Well, first it isn't quiet when there are people sitting in the garden talking, which of course they do at breakfast and also sometimes late at night. Also, I am a non-smoker, and the garden is where people smoke, so I had to keep my one source of fresh air - the door to my room, closed whenever there were people there. My room was about the size of a walk-in closet, which was okay. The bathroom was also small. Had to back in to sit on the toilet. That was fine too. It was all very functional and adequate. But the safe did not work, my refrigerator was warm and mid-way during my trip my air-conditioner stopped working. It wasn't super hot when I was in Rome - late Sept./early Oct., but since I had to keep my door closed to keep out the noise, smoke and also mosquitoes, it got quite warm. I asked at the desk if they could fix it and supposedly they were going to do something, but it was not fixed. The location was great for me - very near Termini station which was the best place to get any bus or metro, and also since it was the terminus point, you didn't need to know the bus you needed to get home, just stand at a bus stop and look for a bus that said Statzione Termini and hop on. If my air-con, refrigerator and safe worked, I would have given this hotel 5 stars, but unfortunately, there are certain things that can make or break a hotel stay and for me these definitely affected the quality of my trip.

When the automatic coffee machine was non-operational, someone was making real espressos for us. No complaints whatsoever. The reception has a computer with internet in the cramped receptionist's space, and they allowed me access to get my email etc. They also allowed me to connect my netbook via ethernet cable when I needed VPN access.

Great location, so so close to the train station, and in the heart of Rome, within walking distance of everything. This hotel had the great charm of Italy, friendliness and comfort all in one. Loved it, and would go back for the price!!!", "Date": "November 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spalding, Lincs", "Title": "\u201cSmall but friendly\u201d", "Author": "Jaspat", "ReviewID": "UR7940414", "Content": "This is a budget hotel which offers value for money. The room was small, and the en suite had a very small shower and no bath. The room was very clean and towels etc changed daily. Breakfast was OK, nothing great but fairly typical for continental breakfast. Could take this indoors or outside in a pretty patio area. The best features are its location (Close to Termini), and the very friendly and helpful staff. Happy for luggage to be left there and collected later.", "Date": "June 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moorslede,Belgium", "Title": "\u201cSmall Rooms-OK for citytrip\u201d", "Author": "ferox", "ReviewID": "UR6009137", "Content": "Elementary comfort \u2013 Verry small room and bathroom (We had room 222) . friendly staff \u2013Good breakfast Advice: ask room in the back, it is more quite Hotel is 5 min walk from Termini", "Date": "October 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Sebastian (Spain)", "Title": "\u201cSmall rooms . very good value\u201d", "Author": "launz", "ReviewID": "UR4731443", "Content": "Almost totally renovated hotel in an old building with a court/garden .

We paid only $537 for the week in mid March. It is located in a very nice area and is close to restaurants and sightseeing. The best part was the breakfast where the buffet included a coffee maker where you could press a button and get any kind of specialty coffee and as much as you wanted! The array of sweet rolls, cereals, meats, cheeses, juices and yogurt was impressive. The bed room had a nice size window which you could open and look out onto the street. The bed was comfy and the sheets were ironed! The manager was very nice, even checking our train and hotel reservations in Florence for us. There is a private patio area in the back and a soon to be sun-room.
