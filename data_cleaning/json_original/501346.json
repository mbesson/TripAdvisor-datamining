Staff was friendly and spoke reasonable english, the room was clean, and food -- particularly the breakfast -- was excellent. I really appreciated the staircase! In most modern hotels you have to use the elevator, which I hate. The only trouble might be the location. Even though it is located right on a tram line, you may want to look for a more central hotel, if all you want to do is sight seeing. I attended a conference, so it did not matter.

On the day I arrived to the hotel I was told bythe receptionests (who were un freindly) that they have decided to move all expedia booking to another green park hotel in Pendik which is 1-2 hours away from green park hotel Merter. At the end I had to cancell my booking and book with another hotel (merbel hotel) which was very good and people there were very freindly. I foundf this not profesional by all standard. First they have never phone me to let me know that they are planing to move me to another hotel and second I choice that hotel because it was very close to where I was going to have my meeting.

The staff were friendly, and tried to be helpful, however not knowing basic english is ESSENTIAL in such a large city as Istanbul! We ordered a meal on the roof top terrace, great breeze, however the music was way too loud and cheesy. The meal took over an hour to arrvive and ALL courses came at once! My partner who speaks Turkish asked the waiter why he would do this, the waiter shrugged and walked away! Not at all a five star service! The air conditioning was not working, I asked on 2 seperate occassions to have this fixed; I was told they did fix it, only to discover that \"fixing the air conditioning meant opening the window!\" I returned to the room on many occassions after 2;00 to change for another meeting (humid and hot) only to discover that my room had still not been cleaned! Not at all impressed with this hotel! Especially paying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9,00 for a shot of Barcardi's rum! We couldn't believe this, and asked because we thought it must be an error! Absolutely ridiculous! Even when I've stayed at proper 5 star hotels they didn't charge this much for a drink! The bathroom was too small to step out of the shower without almost landing in the toilet! The pictures on the net are NOT what you get!

I didn't expect a 5 star hotel to chat to each other and not give you there full attention when booking in. Guy taking us up to the room was ok but the room was dingy and oldfashioned The pool in the afternoon was good to start with as there were plenty of beds and the pool was clean. However the bar staff were incompetent and whilst sunbathing a host of business men in suits were invited to the area which was slightly uncomfortable for holiday makers as they strolled past on their mobile phones. Do not visit the 'Beauty Salon' as the ladies there do not speak English - they gather around like hens chatting away to themselves, doing each other's nails and totally abandoning their customer - I walked out after half an hour, having been left with my feet in cold water The worst part of the stay was the room at night, as the air con was to say the least not very good and the only way to stay cool at night was to get up and have a cold shower. Food at the restaurant at night was ok as was the breakfast. The shuttle service from the hotel to the airport was excellent.
