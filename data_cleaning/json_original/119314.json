For several years, we enjoyed staying at the Homestead Suites on Dunlap, but our experience was so bad last year that we vowed never to stay there again.

The spa was broken and both the spa and the pool had sand in them; the pool chairs were grimy. So, we had just taken our bathing suits for a ride. Our suite smelled \u201coff,\u201d like a very sweaty person had stayed there. We found trash still in the kitchen trash bin, a used coffee packet was still in the coffee maker, and someone had left behind a pair of jeans in one of the drawers. The carpet was threadbare, and the bathroom vent had been removed and the wires were exposed in the ceiling. Even after taking a shower, we felt dirty, just because the room was such a downer. We kept our shoes on while we were in the room because we didn\u2019t want our bare feet to touch the carpet. This property is surrounded by three Marriott properties. We stopped at one of them to check it out for next year and it was so clean, well maintained and well lit, that we didn\u2019t want to leave.

There was not much dresser space, but we made it work; closet space was fine, shower worked great, bed was comfortable. The carpet was extremely dirty, but you'd only know it if you were walking barefoot in the room. Parking was fine, the pool is a nice size, with plenty of lounging chairs and space to lay out. There is continental breakfast - over by 9 a.m. during the week; it goes longer on the weekends (at least until 10 a.m.). The fitness center was tiny: only 1 eliptical, 1 treadmill, and 1 stationary bike. They don't automatically replenish the coffee packs in your room, and the decanters of coffee in the lobby were empty quite frequently (though they would offer to make more for you). My biggest complaint was the service. We stayed 10 nights. Upon checking in, you are made aware that full cleaning services for your room will be given on your 3rd and 5th day of the stay. We got one our 3rd day (but only because I asked) and we finally got one on our 9th day (after I told the manager the cleaning lady did not show up the previous day as promised - even after asking that day too). Both times it was half-assed (sorry, but there is no better way to describe it). At one cleaning, the lady told me she would bring clean towels to us later, as they were being washed - we never got them; we had to go for them ourselves. At the other cleaning, she forgot to empty out one of the trash cans (when you only get a cleaning 2x/wk, you need both cans emptied). There was also a problem with the satellite service so we only got about 12 channels. We arrived on a Saturday and the manager said someone would be coming during the week to fix it; it still had not been fixed by the time we checked out; the remote control was a problem as well - I had to get it exchanged 3 times before I got one that kind of worked; I overheard another guest having a similar problem with their remote. When we were getting ready to checkout @ 7:30 a.m., I tried to use the luggage cart so we wouldn't have to make several trips back and forth to our car, the clerk didn't know where it was. We were in a rush to meet other people so I didn't bother asking him to find it. The staff is nice, but there is definitely no sense of urgency on their part. Normally, this is not a problem with me, but there were just too many basic things that were not as they should be, and too much prompting from me to get things done, so the flip attitude was exhausting. It's unfortunate because the price is good for what you get in terms of accommodations, but the inadequate service frustrated me too much and really made my husband angry, which for him is saying a lot, as he is the most patient and tolerant person I know. He said, \"We will NOT be staying here again!\" Maybe it was just a bad week for them (the electricity went out of the hotel for a few hours as well one day, and the elevator was out for at least a day on another occasion), but I'm not willing to take another chance staying, even at the low prices.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ronald, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice room but overcharged by $602.56\u201d", "Author": "RoxMac", "ReviewID": "UR100661532", "Content": "Room was nice stayed 1 night.
