The property is non-smoking however, I was given a room that the previous guest obviously smoked in. I was moved to another room. I asked for extra firm pillows. It took more an hour to receive them. A security guard showed up with 2 pillows without pillow cases. When I asked about them he told me he wasn't told to bring pillow cases. I asked him why he would bring pillows with no cases? He finally said, this wasn't his job, he just asked to bring the pillows. I called the front desk, who apologized. An hour later a police officer came to my door with the pillow cases.

Also worth mentioning is the location, just two blocks up from Baltimore's Inner Harbor. I spent 5 nights there last week, while attending a conference at the Convention Center. Most of the 4000 attendees were staying at the hotels closest to the convention center, and paying over $200 per night for a smaller, average hotel room. I was sharing a suite, with two beds and separate living space for $161 per night! The living space includes a sink area with coffee maker, fridge and microwave, easy chair, small couch and desk space. In the bathroom area, the sink is separate, which is always convenient when two people are getting ready to go out at the same time. The beds are comfortable, but are not the really plush, deep-mattress beds that you see in luxury hotels, and the bedding is the kind I like for cleanliness, with sheets covering a comforter. The free breakfast was very good, with sufficient toasters for guests to easily get a turn at toasting bagels, English muffins or bread. There were a variety of choices for breakfast, hot and cold. The old bank details included letter boxes, beautiful art deco doors on the elevators and an old vault on the lower level, now used as meeting space. Since I flew into Baltimore, I did not have to worry about parking, so I cannot comment on that at all. The one issue that I found unpleasant, was the nightly 1:00 a.m. \"wake-up call\" from rowdy crowds in the streets. Other reviews have mentioned this, when the nightclubs close. Although I asked for a quiet room, and was given a 7th floor room, the noise level made it impossible to sleep through the commotion. Although I am not sure, I think that the \"Occupy Baltimore\" group also staged a very noisy protest in the middle of the night, one night.

I tried using the wireless in the room but it locked up, so I just used the hardwire connection instead. Having read previous reviews warning about the noise from the nightclub I asked for an upper level floor on the opposite side of the hotel away from the club, so that worked out nicely with us being placed on the 7th floor. We stayed in conjunction with a concert at the Hippodrome Theater, which was only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We also walked about 20 minutes to the Federal Hill neighborhood for dinner using Light Street into the Inner Harbor.

Upon our arrival we were greeted by valet, whom told us the outrageous rate. We decided to park there anyway, as to find a cheaper location was not worth it. When we got to our room we found it to be VERY large and roomy for 2 children and 2 adults. It was cleaned and well decorated. The price was a steal for what we received. We usually pay between $300-450 a night for a hotel and we did not get such a BIG suite like this! The hotel is literally 2 blocks from the Inner Harbor. We did not need our car for the entire stay! Now, for the disappointment; after returning from the Inner Harbor, we came back to our room to see the garbage not emptied, the bed not properly made (they just threw the comforter over the wrinkled disheveled sheets!) the air was turned down to 60 degrees; I guess she wanted to make sure she was comfortable doing a half job, because we were FREEZING! There were four people staying in this suite and she only left two towels and no washcloths or hand towels. When we arrived initally we only had three towels and had to ask the front desk for more. The breakfast was not worth getting up early for (served between 6-9am). the waffles was the only thing good, everything else needs a little work. The last night there we ask the front desk for information. She was busy on a personal call and gave us false information as a way to shoo us away. I expressed my concerns to the front desk and she offered a discount on one nights stay to compensate for the inconvenience. However, I still wanted to talk to manager who was not available until the next day. I did call Jason, hotel manager and left a voicemail and he PROMPTLY returned my call. He apologized and asked if there was anything he could do. I told him no we already received an adjustment for our stay, but thought it was very important that he knew about housekeeping, because it could make or break a hotel LITERALLY! He agreed and stated he was having a meeting with them at 11:30am that morning. One thing I notice about this manager is he takes the comments seriously and goes to lengths to try to correct the problem as I read from the many reviews.

This hotel was clean, well-maintained, well-staffed, and well-furnished. It's location is unparalleled to any other; it is about a five-minute walk to the shops (and excellent restaurants) on Baltimore's Inner Harbor. And, for those nightlife-seekers, it is about a block from a busy nightclub. With regards to this location, Springhill Suites is simply spectacular. The quality of their rooms was quite astounding. Our suite was divided into a bedroom area, a desk/sitting/kitchenette area, a vanity area, and a bathroom proper separated by a door. The sofa in the sitting area converted to a sofa bed (which, like most sofa beds, was somewhat uncomfortable). The sitting area and the bedroom area each had their own flat-screen televisions. Just off from the sitting area was a small kitchenette equipped with a sink, a microwave, a standard coffee set, and a mini-fridge. The room in general was thoroughly cleaned, and the bed (not the sofa-bed, mind you) was comfortable and made for great sleeping. Perhaps the only setback that we experienced was with the view from our room; the hotel is situated across the street from another hotel, and, on the lower floors at least, you can stare directly and wave into the window of another room across the screen (something I did frequently during my stay). The staff was personable and helpful; they always greeted us with a smile (even in the middle of the night) and a cheerful greet. During breakfasts (free; do-it-yourself waffle maker, eggs, biscuits & gravy, toast, coffee, juice, among others), the staff was always polite and ready to help out. On a final note, the hotel seems to be a remodeled early-twentieth-century bank.

This is a basic hotel with basic amenities aside from the suite layout of the rooms, i.e., separate sitting area and bedroom areas. The hotel is in a converted bank where the vault was turned into a conference room with the original vault door intact (quite impressive). There are also beautiful marble staircases that remain. However, much of original beauty was covered with bland paint or hidden behind ugly walls (e.g., the ornate cast iron and marble staircase that runs the height of the building). It's a shame that so much charm and character were covered up with bland neutrality. The Good: The shower heads are high enough for for someone 6'2\" to shower comfortably. Nice room layout. Nice staff. Clean. Within easy walking distance of the Inner Harbor - two blocks. The Not so Good: No room service. Thin doors - all hall conversation sounds like it's in your room. The free hot breakfast is all carbs except for the little containers of peanut butter. While they advertise eggs, none were available during my stay. Go elsewhere for a balanced breakfast. Tiny bar area - not a big deal as there are many nearby watering holes. If you like good coffee, ignore the in hotel \"coffee.\" The in room coffee makers are designed to make single cups using specially packaged coffee and cannot be used to brew your own. However, there is a Starbucks and Caribou in walking distance. The desks in the rooms cannot be comfortably used for extended periods because the desk chairs are far too low and cannot be adjusted. Using a laptop on the desk keeps one's arms and wrists at a very uncomfortable angle. The Bad: Parking is $32/day. There are cheaper local garages but they have no re-entry privileges. Consequently, if you plan to use your car during your stay, the hotel parking is cheaper. There is no signage concerning parking. Pull up to the small hotel entrance and wait for a valet to appear.

They were definitely in good condition and seemed relatively new, but they were much more firm than I have come to expect from a Marriott. I noticed that the sheets often popped off the corners of the bed and that the mattress cover sort of slid around on the mattress when I changed positions.

It was very centrally located, only a few blocks from the church and reception and the Inner Harbor. The room was huge! My husband and I shared a room with my parents and there was plenty of space for everyone. There was a sitting area with a desk, plus a kitchenette and a bedroom area. The sink was outside the shower and toilet, so that was helpful when everyone was getting ready. There was even a cute little nook thing that had nothing in it, but worked great as an extra changing space. The ceilings were so high it made the already large room seem huge. The closet was a little awkward, as the door was small but the closet was deep, so anything that went in the back was hard to get to. Also, the TV for the sitting area was hanging on a wall that faced another wall, and we all thought it had to swivel out, but it didn't so it was hard to see from the couches and the chair. It should either be moved or put on a swivel. The hotel was really cute, and we loved the old touches like the marble staircases and the old mail box. You could tell it was an old building, but it was restored very nicely. The valet guys were very nice, they helped my husband carry our luggage upstairs and they also gave us directions when we asked. Check in was quick. Breakfast was pretty good, but I've had better in other Springhill Suites. It was lacking hard boiled eggs and cottage cheese. There was pretty much no options for anyone not looking to load up on carbs. We walked to the Inner Harbor from the hotel and it was a quick couple of blocks.

But, the light switches were not connected with any of the lamps, and it took awhile to turn on the lights since many were not controlled by the wall switches. Our room had a bit of a smokey smell, but when we inquired at the front desk, they reassured us that the hotel was non-smoking. I'm not sure if the scent was from the cleaner, a bit musty, or the result of a previous guest that lit up despite the rules. While the front desk offered to change our room, we had unpacked and decided to live with the odor. The sleeping area was a very good size with very comfortable beds and linens. But the bathroom opened up to the bedroom and since there was no door to the vanity area, there was no privacy and very difficult to be quiet while others were sleeping. Maybe a pocket door would be a good solution. Otherwise - the bathroom fixtures and other appointments were very nice. Breakfast was ok - seems like the eggs could be upgraded to traditional scrambled eggs and that cut up fruit could be offered. Seating was adequate. Elevators were quick and we never had to wait.

No view to speak of but that didn't bother us. The Bathroom was unremarkable but fine. Room was very clean (except for fingerprints all over the fridge).

The suite was absolutely massive, with the bedroom being around the size of a normal hotel room, then a nice large living room added in. However, this room had one of the strangest floor plans I have ever seen, with a long hallway separating the two rooms and each half of the bathroom on either side of the hallway. The room where the shower and vanity were, was really large but had some weird rolling doors that we could never get to close all the way, and very large lovely windows which were, unfortunately, very good at sucking all the warm air out of the bathroom. The whole shower-room was just not insulated well, and while the shower itself was oversized and perfectly clean with good pressure, it made for an extremely cold shower. Brrrr! Also it's really annoying to use the bathroom then have to go across the hall to wash your hands. The room where the toilet is could use a little attention, too; while perfectly clean, it's completely undecorated, just a toilet and a door, and feels like the bathroom in a fast food restaurant (well, except it's very clean) The bed was comfortable and the bedding was crisp and clean. The overall furnishings are very generic and not my choice of color schemes; it's kind of a shame because with a little new upholstery, and a few decorating touches, this could be a stellar hotel room. That said, the room was very quiet even though we were steps from the elevator; we couldn't hear any hallway noise at all and that's pretty remarkable on new years eve. Breakfast was a little better than expected for Spring Hill Suites-- your basic pastries and juices plus a very small selection of hot items (bacon, egg patties to make sandwiches with, etc) and appeared to be well-stocked even for new years day when everyone's having breakfast at the same time. Valet parking is $26 which is average for this neighborhood. You can self-park about 2 blocks away and save $6 which wasn't worth it to us when we arrived on a cold rainy night but might have been a better idea when it took about 25 minutes for them to bring our car back the next morning.

I'm a pretty heavy sleeper at times so I wasn't bothered but the misses is an extra light sleeper. The hotel is right in the heart of downtown and sirens at night, yelling on the street, and some construction could be heard, even though we were 6 floors up.

Given the class of this hotel, there's no room service but the front desk is happy to give you menus to restaurants that DON'T charge a delivery charge, though some have minimum orders like $25. I ordered two nites from Mo's and it was pretty good. A colleague ordered pizza from another delivery place and found it to be pretty good as well. You're also in the heart of things so you can walk to nice restaurants in the area. The hotel does provide breakfast with a very large variety of options, from self-poured waffles to muffins, bagels, fruit and juices/coffee. There was noise outside but you can't blame a hotel for street noises in a large city like Baltimore. The rooms are pretty well insulated so I didn't hear anymore noise than I do in Toronto...NYC...DC...etc. I had NO complaints with this hotel.

I'm usually a heavy sleeper -- it takes a lot to wake me up. When I called the front desk around 2:00 AM to ask them to do something about the noise, they said this was a usual occurrence on weekend nights and they would have to call the police to get the crowd to go home. The noise outside is out of the hotel's control, but if this was a usual occurrence, I would expect the hotel staff to PROACTIVELY call the police instead of waiting for their guests to complain. The next morning, we decided to check out early. The person at the front desk commented that we were checking out early, but didn't bother to ask WHY, and looked like she could care less. At over $200 per night, I expect a hotel to offer good service to their guests.
