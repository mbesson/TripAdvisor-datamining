If they advertised what the rooms were really like I doubt that anyone would ever stay here. I am use to small rooms in Singapore but this room was more like a coffin. I opened the door and nearly fell over then bed. The room was just slightly wider than the single bed. There was nowhere to put your luggage. Also the toilet did not work properly. The hotel was generally run down. I booked for 3 nights and left after 1 night. Dont ever stay here unless you are desperate.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quezon City, Quezon City, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cnot too bad for a budget tour\u201d", "Author": "annie162", "ReviewID": "UR126740233", "Content": "me and my wife stay in zenobia for almost 3 days last march 14 to 17 this year.for me its not too expensive coz i tried to inquired from the other cheap hotel before i finally book at zenobia.its a good hotel for a budget stay. staff are friendly.facilities are clean, you can use there internet computer all the time at the lobby.they also have breakfast......what can you ask for??? then you just only pay cheaper...dont be hipocrete...if you want a perfect hotel then why dont you book at 5 star hotel.. i like zenobia!!!!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Visakhapatnam, India", "Title": "\u201cBasic hotel in a decent location\u201d", "Author": "Vinay_Shankar", "ReviewID": "UR124434361", "Content": "We stayed with family during September 2011. It is located in the Little India area and is close to the MRT station. Marina Bay area, Financial District are at a walkable distance from this hotel. The room is pretty small without any windows which I believe is common here. There was a TV, AC, wireless internet and also a computer at the reception area for general use. There was complimentary breakfast but water had to be bought. The bathroom may have been a bit better. There are plenty of restaurants and shops around the area. And the ambience is lively. Overall, this is a basic hotel which will serve the purpose if you wish to stay for a few days.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cInexpensive hotel in Little India\u201d", "Author": "karhuHelsinki", "ReviewID": "UR121919136", "Content": "This was a clean and basic hotel in a nice area.

Location - easy enough to find from the MRT station, Little India is a really cool and interesting place to stay. Apparently the weekends in Little India are very lively! Hotel staff - The guy behind the desk I'm not sure could care less if we stayed there or not to be honest, he wasn't at all helpful. The Room - the room had no windows, but this I think is fairly common - we weren't bothered by this but it can feel a little confined). The room was very damp and the ensuite was badly corroded and leaky. There was a shower rail, but not a curtain which would've helped (although I know the shower over toilet situation happens a lot in SE Asia). Internet - there is a free computer to use in the reception area which was very handy Breakfast - appalling. Go get your own, this was such a disappointment. Most hostels provided toast and jam which is fine but they couldn't seem to manage this well either. All in all, I can recommend this for location and having a place to crash but don't expect any extras.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cBad service, tiny room, horrible bathroom & noisy\u201d", "Author": "Rochenstein", "ReviewID": "UR88613592", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed 3 nights in Zenobia. It's very expensive for what you get and we didn't enjoy our stay here. First off, the room is tiny with no windows. There was a horrible musty smell in the place as a result of this. The bathroom was disgusting as well, had an even worse musty smell, mould all over the shower curtain and black mould all over the putty which sealed the sink to the wall. Really grim bathroom. The room was not cleaned once during our 3 night stay. The worst part was we asked the receptionist to book us a taxi at 8am. We got up at 7.45am, there was no-one at reception and no taxi ever showed up. We had to walk the streets with all our luggage to get a taxi. We have been travelling all over Asia for the past 3 months and this was the worst accommodation of any kind yet. Really expensive, bad staff and a really grotty room.
