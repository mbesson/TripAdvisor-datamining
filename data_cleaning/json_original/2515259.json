The rooms with the 04 are the biggest. sadly there is a huge building construction going on opposite the street. But the room was very cute and new. We had a nice pink room with a good shower. Sadly all rooms have carpet. We chose the breakfast but wouldnt do it again since you get basicly some bread etc jam, nutella, fruits, some not even average warm dishes.. around the corner is a bakery, some bistros( who offer breakfast) and a mcdonalds... the \"spa\" is more a good joke, i would not choose this hotel based on their spa. its tiny. but the service is friendly and tries to make you feel welcome. we would choose this hotel again, but only if we would get a really good rate because it is def. not worth 170 euro per night.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cJust wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "RosivdaB", "ReviewID": "UR126262533", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights as a birthday treat to a big Marilyn fan. The theme and design of the hotel couldn't be faulted, it is beautiful throughout. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was small but that's to be expected in any capital city hotel. Pillows weren't very comfortable and there were no alternatives in the room. I wasn't a fan of the glass door on the bathroom, but as we are a couple, it didn't bother us. Only one English channel on the tv - but who wants to sit in and watch tv when they're in Paris?! The shower was great. Breakfast was not very good and quite overpriced for what was on offer, but we found this to be the case in most cafes nearby too, so maybe the french just dont do breakfast like the irish! The breakfast room is lovely though. Found the location of the hotel very handy. Charles-Michel Metro station is just up the street so this made getting about really easy once we got to grips with the Metro. The Eiffel Tower is a lovely 15 minute walk away along the Seine. There were one or two very small issues with cleanliness but I won't go into detail as they in no way took away from our stay in this fabulous hotel.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lichfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat little find\u201d", "Author": "popdog35", "ReviewID": "UR125127509", "Content": "Booked this hotel largely due to location and reviews on Tripadvisor. As a first time traveller to Paris, I was optimistic with the thought of the hotel. And thankfully I wasn't disappointed. The rooms are small but stylish, and for the money the hotel is well worth it. Used the little spa which was basically private as I believe the hotel only has 35 rooms. Staff were friendly in both the morning and evening, and helped with any requests. Only negatives is that being small, the hotel lets noise travel from within. This is only an issue if a room nearby uses a hot-tub bath, then the noise is a little irritating. Plus the Ipod dock doesn't work........I was told it would be done within a few days, but it appears to have not worked for a few months now. These points are however minor elements and do not detract from the hotel. I didn't bother with breakfast so can't comment on that. The hotel itself is a useful base to explore Paris. The metro is 3 minute walk, and the tower is about 20 mins. If you walk to the Seine in the evening (takes about 3 mins) you get a great view of the river and the tower lit up in all it's glory. I would return to the Platine in a heartbeat. I certainly think that looking at the cost of hotels in the city, this offers one of the best value-for-money options going.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAdorable themed hotel in a prime location in Paris!\u201d", "Author": "Travlbug777", "ReviewID": "UR123684544", "Content": "For my first time in Paris I was a bit nervous at what this hotel would bring - but I was pleasantly surprised.

Dinner options in the few blocks around it are sparse but if you're with someone, chances are you'll be venturing out in Paris for dinner somewhere else anyway.
