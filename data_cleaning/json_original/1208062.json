It is some way out from central Berlin however five minutes walk to the U3 Metro station means that you can easily get into town but it takes time. The hotel is otherwise excellent - large comfortable beds in reasonable size room, spotlessly clean. I found the hotel nice and quiet but I suspect that that might be due to there not being many people staying there when I did. Immediately after check-in I did hear quite clearly a business women in the room next door ranting loudly on the telephone and so feared the worst. But I never heard her or anyone else since that one occasion. Maybe i was lucky and she checked out? All the staff were nice and very helpful, even when trying to solve problems that weren't anything to do with the hotel. So fully marks there! The complementary wifi worked ok but always times out after 10 minutes of inactivity requiring going to the router home page and reentering a username and password in order to continue using the internet - This during a business meeting was very tedious. Also the toilets are a long way from the bar, restaurant and meeting rooms.

I would describe the hotel as industrial chic - glass stairways, metal stairs, glass lifts, exposed lift shafts, glass facade etc. Rooms are functional although the decor is not like any typical hotel - they have obviously put some thoughts into it so it doesnt just look like another Holiday Inn or Mercure. It is sort of \"ikea\" but a bit more stylish. It is comfortably enough for business travel, but the bed is not quite as comfortable as most hotels I have stayed in the US. The wired internet didnt work (couldnt get connected and I must admit this sort of problem is getting rare these days in the hotels I have stayed recently) and couldnt managed to control the room temperature (turning it cooler seemed to make it warmer).

No extra fees for wireless internet access, what a nice difference to most other so called \"business hotels\". Breakfast was fine, good number of choices. In short walking distance the center of \"Dahlem\" are high quality community environment. You do not feel as staying in a countrie's capital with millions of inhabitants. Even public transport is nearby, the station with a shelf roof looks really pretty. Transfer from Tegel aiprot is 15-20 minif traffic is not too busy. prices are very reasonably considering what you get for them.

Internet access is provided complimentary. A safe is provided too. Finally, the hotel has simply the best breakfast buffet spread you can find for its price class.The only downside is that the windows doesn't have much of a view, but the unique structure of the building probably will compensate for this. Tips: There's a Bahn station (Dahlem Dorf) less than 5 minutes away walking distance from the hotel to connect you to the city. I like the shoplot in the station selling pastries and cakes. You can also find a Doner kebab stall in front of the station.

The hotel is about a 25 minute subway ride into Berlin center. This is not really bad as you can get used to the subway and transportation in Berlin easily without speaking German. It is worth staying a bit out of the way for a quiet atmosphere of safety and comfort. There are 3 nice restaurants within a very short walking distance from the hotel.
