The apartment is clean and has quite a nice and comfortable interior. I like the complete cooking facility and spaciousness of the apartment. However it is not easy to locate the place and we had to walk quite a distance from Canary Wharf station (with our heavy luggage ) to the hotel. A few people we asked on the way do not seem to know where this hotel is located. The staff is rather unfriendly and aloof and it can feel quite scary to walk back to the hotel along the dimly lit street late at night. At the end of our stay we were told that we would have to 150 pounds for losing the room key as they would need to change the lock! Although this rule was stated in the service agreement in fine print in view of the exorbitant charge, it should be clearly highlighted to us verbally when we check in or in the email booking confirmation. So make sure you don;t lose the key. Most moden hotels and service aparatments have the digital card key system but Marlin Apartments are still fitted with keys. The receptionist merely asked us to sign the form and said that a security deposit of 200 pounds would be deducted from our credit card to pay for any damages. They refused to waive the charges even though the key was misplaced whilst we were in the room and therefore there is no security risk. . We had also assumed wrongly that the service would be as fine and professional as that at Fraser's apartment Canary wharf (which is nearer to the train station and of much better quality in terms of service , furnishing and view).. We had stayed at Fraser's apartment before.

There were 4 of us and had enough space with 2 bathrooms. There was a 24 hour concierge but when we checked out there was no one there and advised to put the key back into a locker. There were few problems, when we checked into the room there were no extra beds that we had already paid for. This was not a problem as we were going out and just told them to make sure that they were there on our return. When we returned late in the evening and we asked the receptionist if the extra beds were in the room he stated \u2018\u2019he did not know as it was his first night at work\u2019\u2019, so we decided to go to the room and check and there had been put there. The other main problem was the shower, after 1 person had a shower the water went cold so the others had to use cold water. Also from the balcony door there seem to be a draft coming in. The heating etc is fine in the apartment and there is also a shop about 2 minute walk away that sell everything and closes at midnight. Shopping at Canary Wharf and DLR/Tube station I would say is around a ten minute walk. Overall a decent stay but may look elsewhere next time as it didn\u2019t come on the cheap.

The apartments are managed by Marlin. We made the booking through a company named Silver Door - this was another story. We would not use them again (they showed very nice photos of the apartments on their website, but the reality was far from those photos - so do not pay any attention to the photos!). These serviced apartments are also known as South Quay apartments. The reception is at no. 9 Byng Street, Canary Wharf. We stayed at 2 different apartments: one at 9 Byng St, and one at 11 Byng Street (the building next door). The location of the buildings is handy to Canary Wharf - about 10 to 15 minutes walk to CW tube and DLR, depending on the route. The receptionist told us to turn right where we would walk along the main roads to CW. However, we later discovered an alternate route, which was quieter, by turning left which took us through the foot bridge into CW (our preferred route). The room size was reasonable and had underfloor heating (positive). While the room was well furnished, the furniture and bedding were so dated and would need to be refurbished. The bathroom has the shower over the bath. The water pressures for the shower were very weak to have a normal shower. It was hard to control the mixed temperatures - water either cold or hot! We did not like the shower at all. The underfloor heating for the apt at 11 Byng St did not work in the bathroom, where we would need it most! The lounge / kitchen was well equipped like most serviced apartments - hot plates, oven, microwave, fridge / freezer, washer / dryer, dishwasher, plus kitchen utensils, crockery and cutlery. However, the lounge suite at 9 Byng St was very old and the vinyl was peeling off the sofa. The bedroom was reasonable size, with wardrobe, however, the bed at 9 Byng St was so horrible. It had to be the worst we had slept on. Truly, Marlin needs to put a new mattress in the room we stayed. We could feel every spring on that mattress. It was so thin and worn out. One of us had to sleep on the sofa. The apartment at 9 Byng St was on a higher floor, so it was bright. In contrast, the apartment at 11 Byng St was on a lower floor, so it was very dark - making us feeling very depressed, not seeing much sunshine! The apartment at 9 Byng St had wired internet connection, but the apartment at 11 Byng St had wifi. The internet connection in both buildings was slow, very intermittent and unreliable most days - which was very annoying for us. Overall, our stay at these apartments had not been very comfortable. We read that some reviewers had more positive experience than we did. It could be that they were allocated better rooms? However, we cannot recommend these apartments at all. We stayed there because they were probably among the cheapest? - other apartments in the area were above 150 pounds a night. It is the old saying, you never get more for what you pay and often it is less, much less! Although our stay had not been pleasant, we found the staff at the reception desk (located at 9 Byng St building) were generally polite and occasionally helpful.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCanary Wharf Marlin Apartments\u201d", "Author": "Kirsty B", "ReviewID": "UR120636367", "Content": "Amazing weekend.

I ended up staying two nights and have thankfully now been relocated (after much hassle) to a far superior dwelling. On arrival, around 11pm after a long day travelling with two large, heavy suitcases and a messenger bag, I was greeted by the night concierge who took ID and made me sign a check-in form. I was then handed the keys to my studio (Apartment 24 in 11 Byng Street) and was left to my own devices. No welcome pack was given to me and I was not offered any help with my bags. Incidentally, when I arrived, the apartments are directly across the road from a block of council flats. At the time I arrived 5 people were lined up, handcuffed next to a riot van ready to be taken to jail. The whole area looked very unsafe at night. Arriving in apartment 24, I was immediately disappointed. The balcony door had been left open so the apartment was FREEZING COLD. I went to close the door but found the door was broken and would not lock. Not only is this poor form but also incredibly dangerous when so close to street level in terms of security. Further investigation of the apartment revealed further problems. The Sky digital card had expired so had a constant error message on screen asking to replace the card or lose viewing. The trash can in the kitchen area was in pieces and broken. The kitchen surfaces were grubby along with grubby walls, floors and light fixtures. I did find my welcome pack in the kitchen though, a half drunk bottle of Malin Apartments mineral water. Nice! I went downstairs to the concierge, asking to be moved to another apartment. After checking I wasn't lying to him by coming up and checking my room he agreed to relocate me to apartment 13. Bare in mind it's late now, around 12:30am. He showed me round, it appeared to be far better than #24. Then he left, leaving me to lock the door. The door wouldn't lock properly from the inside! I called the concierge back, he fiddled with the lock so much that the next door neighbour came out and complained (it was now around 1:30am). It ended up with him locking me in my apartment and feeding the keys through the letter box announcing he'd see it was fixed the next day! Inspecting #24 before bed, I found power sockets on the walls were loose and actually coming off the wall. The walls and floors and kitchens were again sticky and grubby. The radiator in #24 bathroom was also coming off the wall so I dare not touch it in case it fell! On top of all that, the broadband internet in both apartments not only was NOT wireless but the ethernet cable in 13 did not work (lucky I had my own!) but the supposed 'high speed' was none existant. It was worse than a 33.6 baud modem connection! Now it gets interesting. The next morning I explained to work that I wanted out of such a dingy hole of a building. Work agreed to relocate me and found me a much better apartment elsewhere in London. HOWEVER, I had to check out yesterday before 2pm else I would be charged an extra days stay. I arrived at 1:45pm and rather than grabbing my bags immediately and THEN checking out, I explained to the lady on concierge that I was checking out immediately. She said all I need do is hand back my keys as I never made the booking. I grabbed my things and handed the keys in at 1:58pm. I know this to be true as I have email evidence showing I contacted work to inform them exactly the time I checked out, with timestamps. You'd think all would be well. Well no, no it is not. Malin Apartments notified my work stating that the concierge at Canary South TOLD MARLIN that I checked out at 3:30PM AND WOULD INCUR A FURTHER NIGHT STAY ON MY INVOICE! LIARS! BLATANT LIARS! I have CCTV footage as proof and a witness statement to back it up that I arrived at my place of work WELL BEFORE 3:30PM when they told Marlin that I checked out. Right now I am still wrestling for a refund and an apology. I would recommend NOBODY ever EVER book ANYTHING through Marlin. They are LIARS. The Canary South apartments are dirty, badly managed and VASTLY overpriced for what they are. They are also in a rather rough looking area and convey absolutely NONE of the image they conjour up on their website. STEER WELL CLEAR.

When I entered the room I noticed it was very warm and the only window in the entire apartment would only open about 5cm in a diagonal fashion, rather than opening fully outwards. As the evening progressed, the room became even hotter. The bathroom was also very stuffy and we discovered that this was as a result of the mirror being heated internally, perhaps to prevent condensation. However on a hot day, in a room with a window that only opens a crack, this is definitely not suitable. At roughly 11pm, the temperature in the room was no longer bearable, at which point I went down to the reception in 9 Byng Street to ask the person on duty if there was any way to open the window any further or if there was any help that could be provided. There was a gentleman at the desk, and I told him the room we were staying in and told him it was very hot and asked if there was anything that could be done. He responded by asking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would you like a fan?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and when I said yes, he responded almost immediately saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153actually sorry they are all given out to other guests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

I was amazed to hear this and found it shocking that if this issue has been previously brought to the attention of management, and it was a night that was known to be hot, why were we allocated that room? I went for a walk outside for a few minutes to cool down and get away from the heat of the room (after 11pm). During this walk I went to a store and bought some cold bottles of water, however when I returned to the room, we discovered that these could not be kept cold for very long as the refrigerator was broken. We tried to sleep but it was just too hot and we felt like we were in a sauna. At 1am we decided to try and go to another hotel but at that point we realised it would be tough to find another room nearby as it was so late. So we slept very little because of the heat and had an extremely uncomfortable night. The room was still very hot in the morning and the entire stay was very substandard. A fundamental point of any hotel stay is the quality of comfort and sleep your guests get, but we got hardly any sleep due to the conditions in the room. I am amazed at the fact that guests had previously complained about the heat issue in that room, however it was still allocated to us for that night, which was known to be very hot, and on top of that we were told at the time of booking that all rooms had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lovely large windows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! When i checked out, I told the duty manager about our experiences, and she herself recommended that I complain officially and ask for a refund. However when I wrote an e-mail about our experiences, I had to continually chase up a response from the manager called Ian. After repeated attempts to contact him he told me that they were unable to offer me a refund as there was nothing wrong with the room. He asked if i could remember the name of the staff member who had taken my reservation and told me the room would be cool. I wasnt aware that I needed to take staff names when making bookings?! As I couldnt remember the name, he told me that noone admitted saying this to me, and \"based on the evidence\", my claim for a refund given that Marlin had misrepresented their room quality was denied. Its not surprising that the staff service was so poor when the manager himself is so incompetent and basically calls his dissatisfied customers liars! I cant get my money back but i definitely wouldnt want anyone else to waste their money by staying here. Stay at the Radisson in the wharf instead, same price, much nicer and actually has AC and polite staff!", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swindon", "Title": "\u201cNoisy, unsafe and crowded - I would not recommend this accommodation.\u201d", "Author": "LouiseSwindon", "ReviewID": "UR30208465", "Content": "My friends and I stayed at Canary Wharf South apartments on Saturday 16/05/09 for one night only having paid \u00c2\u00a3185.00 through 'Last Minute'. When we arrived there was one bath towel and small hand towel despite the booking stating that it was for three adults. There was also no welcome and we had no understanding of how to 'book in' until we rang the main office line and was subsquently advised what to do. The towel situation was rectified however, on our arrival back to the apartments (we went to a concert at the O2 arena) we were greeted by a large number of youths who were 'hanging out' in the stair well. The security door to the apartments was faulty and was therefore accessible to anyone. The youths were aggressive to my friends and I and were clearly intoxicated as there were cans of beer and crisp packets strewn all over the staircase. At one point, a youth threatened my partner with physical violence after he had asked them to move out of the way in order to allow us to retreat to our room. Throughout the night, we were subjected to excessive noise (swearing and shouting) and doors banging. We attempted to contact the duty manager (by their extension) and main reception number several times throughout the night but received no answer. We did contemplate calling the police but as the large group of youths were outside our apartment door all night we were fearful of reprecussions. At 8am, we were disturbed again by a youth asking us whether we had a mop as he had been asked by a staff member to clean up the hallway. The staff member was in the hallway and we asked if we could see the manager as none of us had slept all night. The staff member promised to get the manager. Two and a half hours later, we had not seen the manager and tried to telephone again but without success. In addition to this, we had no hot water therefore, none of us could bathe/shower before we left. We left London very tired and unhappy with the whole experience. It felt very unsafe in the middle of the night and we had no one to contact although I appreciate we could have phoned the police.

The apartment was no better, with kitchen furniture broken, carpets and curtains stained, windows broken, even the hairdryer was broken. Customer service is non-existent.

I didn't feel comfortable walking home at night. There were often kids shouting and arguments going on just outside our window. The water heating was terrible. At first we couldn't get anything between freezing cold and boiling hot water in our shower. When we complained they \"fixed\" it so we couldn't get any hot water at all for the remainder of our stay! When we informed the management, they told us that there was nothing wrong with the water! The building is really hot and muggy, and except for the door in the living room, the windows barely open to let air in. We were given a fan but it hardly helped.

At all stages of my booking and stay i have to say, i found Marlin to be exceptional, i travel alot and rarely find a company like this, that really will go the extra mile to make your stay great.
