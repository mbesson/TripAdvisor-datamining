My parents were in a superior room on the 2nd floor, and I was in a quad (2 queen beds) on the 1st level (remember that 0 is ground level). The hotel is perfectly situated directly across the street from the Vatican museum. St Peter's square is about a 10-15 min walk along the Vatican wall...all sidewalk :) Breakfast (daily from 0730-1030) was included in our room rates and was quite generous. The hot dishes varied daily, and I believe you could ask the attendant for an espresso or cappuccino. There was plenty of coffee and even tea. Both our rooms faced the street, which can be a bit noisy...mostly cars. It didn't bother us as it was still cool outside, so we didn't have the windows open. Most of Europe's windows do not have screens, so you need to remember that the flying bugs will come in if the windows are open. The lobby is staffed 24/7, and there is a generously sized elevator that will take you to your floor. There are also steps, which you can access coming down, but not going up from the lobby(unless the lobby attendant buzzes the door). The rooms were immaculate and a good size. The superior room was a corner room and had a very large king size bed, double sink bathroom, minibar, safe, robes/slippers, hotpot for coffee/tea, and TV with Skye TV. The quad room only had one sink in the bathroom, but had robes/slippers, safe, minibar, and TV with Skye TV. My only complaint about this room was that it didn't come with a hotpot for coffee/tea. I was surprised, given the prices we paid. The rooms don't have any carpeting, so you can hear every chair being pulled across the floor as well as voices. The superior room also came with WiFi access codes. Although there wasn't any info about WiFi in my Quad room, I just used my parents' code, which worked fine down in my room. I know the hotel lobby has free WiFi. The hotel's attendants were extremely friendly, approachable and helpful! They gave us numerous directions and always had a map available for us:)) The hotel also has a shuttle service, which we didn't need to use, but I believe their price is reasonable. During our stay there were mostly families with well-behaved children. We opted to pay in cash for an 8% discount. If you decide on this option you need to pay in full at check-in. I highly recommend this hotel!!!", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cSuper breakfast buffet, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Ramikat", "ReviewID": "UR127034129", "Content": "We stayed at the Alimandi Vaticano 7 nights to be near the Vatican.

You can get the 23 or 492 bus into the city center down the hill from the hotel on via Leone IV. It is a little farther to walk to restaurants, about a 15 minute walk to Borgo Pio (many restaurants). There are also some local restaurants closer on via Leone IV. It is about 5 blocks north to the covered food market on Andrea Dorea and one can get a taxi across the street, which we did to visit Galleria Borghese.

One of our daughters is studying abroad in Rome, so we decided to visit and have our very own personal tour guide! We chose Hotel Alimandi because of the location ( not far from our daughters campus), reviews on Trip Advisor, and Rick Steves Rome book recommendation. ( Rick Steves book was our bible for the entire stay! Great tips, good history lessons, and great sense of humor!) We LOVED this hotel! Small-ish, family owned, good location, not over priced, spotless! It was so nice to have a lovely breakfast every morning and to be greeted by the chef. He was so nice! The staff at the front desk were soooo helpful. Always giving tips on good restaurants with in walking distance ( or farther away) We had room 305, which was perfect for our needs. The room was very large. Bigger than an standard Marriott or Westin. It had 2 queen beds, 3 bedside tables ( one on the outside of both beds and one in the middle), TV/ dresser/ mini bar unit, large desk with large mirror. The 2 closets were enourmous, plenty of hangers and lots of shelves, plus an additional shelf unit with safe. We chose this room because we needed the space for our daughter traveling with us, and our daughter in Rome spent a few nights with us. The bathroom was much larger than I expected, with shower, tub, toilet, bidet , and sink. There was a window in the bath that opened up to an interior courtyard. This room also had a door that went out to a terrace that overlooked the entrance to the Vatican Museum. The weather was beautiful and we had this door open quite a bit. Another window opened to the side of the building, offering plenty of light. The room was absolutely spotless! Clean white fluffy towels everyday. Have to say that the beds were a bit on the hard side, but we were so tired by the end of the day, that we didnt mind . There is a large roof top area, with table and chairs, overlooking the area. It is a nice place to meet friends or gather together for happy hour. Unfortunately, there were a couple large tour groups staying at the hotel and used this area as their late night meeting place. Chairs and table were pushed back and forth and scraped over the floor until all hours of the night. We brought this to the front desk's attention and it was taken care of right away. From then on the group had to be off the roof at 11 pm, which was appropriate. It was quiet for the rest of the time until the last night, when the same thing happened with another gathering. Fortunately, the rest of the familuy did not wake up at 3 am when the chairs were being pushed around. I think the hotel needs to take a look and make a general policy for the roof top to be closed at 11 pm. We found this hotel to be perfect for us. It is located in a great neighborhood. Grocery markets close by for snacks and wine, close to metro stops, close to shopping areas. We would definitely stay here again! We could hear the trafic somewhat, but with windows closed, the room was pretty quiet. Besides, we were so tired that the night traffic didnt bother us. p.s. When you need a taxi, have the front desk call for one and be picked up in front of hotel. Do not use the taxis across the street in front of Vatican! Also, try to learn some basic Italian phrases ( also in back of Rick Steves book) It just makes your stay that much better and clerks, hotel staff, waitstaff appreciate the effort.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ansonia, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cEasy access to the Vatican Museum entrance.\u201d", "Author": "MMB-9-46", "ReviewID": "UR125677950", "Content": "Hotel is across the street from the Vatican museum, but it is a busy street with lots of traffic and noise.

We chose this hotel due the value and to the proximity to the Vatican where we would be spending much time. Due to the duration of our stay, we were able to get a great feel for the hotel. The front desk staff of Irene, Nico and Fabiana are absolutely the best you will find anywhere. They are all extremely courteous, helpful and knowledgeable about most everything you would need to know for your stay in Rome. We miss them already! The hotel serves a very fine breakfast buffet of the highest quality. Again, the restaurant staff and food selection are both excellent. All 4 of our rooms were located on the 2nd floor. Three of our rooms faced either the side or rear of the hotel while one of our rooms was located on the Via Vaticano facing the Vatican Museum. While muted traffic noise was experienced in the other rooms, the room located on Via Vaticano was quite noisy with scooters buzzing up and down the street almost incessantly. We would recommend avoiding rooms facing the Vatican Museum unless you are not bothered by traffic noise or have an ample supply of Ambien. The trade-off with that room however, is that it was located closest to the router and therefore had the best Wi-Fi access. Wi-Fi in the other rooms was somewhat spotty. The rooms themselves were all clean and nicely furnished. Bathrooms are clean, contain blow dryers, towel warmers and 110v outlets. The beds have great, firm mattresses. The rooms also contain safes for storing valuables.

In passing, we told the hotel staff and they could not do enough to assist us. They arranged telephone calls, sent faxes and e-mails etc. However, way beyond the call of duty, the owner of the hotel used some connections with a local car hire company to help us overcome the problem of no license and persuaded them to give me a car using the temporary cover document I had been sent from the UKDVLA (may own petitioning of all the firms just got a plain 'no way').

The B & B shares AV's services including the front desk, internet and the very attractive restaurant next to the front lobby. We stayed in the B & B for the first 4 days, went to Venice for 3 days and then stayed in AV for 2 nights before going on a 17 day cruise leaving from Rome (Civitavecchia port). Before describing our hotel experience, let me tell you that, 3 days before leaving for Rome from our home in Thailand, my wife had a boil/cyst lanced (yes, you can guess where it was) which required daily cleansing, disinfecting and bandaging for at least 7 days; 4 of which would be in Rome. I contacted the Alimandi and described our situation to a lovely and extremely helpful young woman, Irene. Irene said we would have a great deal of difficulty getting help at any hospital in Rome and even a doctor might be difficult and certainly very expensive. Through her contacts, Irene sourced a highly recommended professional nurse who would come to the hotel each day as necessary. This turned out to be the perfect solution and we are extremely grateful to Irene. In fact, all people on the staff were very helpful with our questions and requests for information. Even one of the owners helped me when I had difficulty with the European type room key. The B & B was renovated and changed from an apartment to 3 hotel rooms which share a private common hallway. Two of the rooms have a private bathroom (with a lock and key) in this hallway. This is not my usual mode of travel but it was fine and, for 110 Euros per night, was among the lowest I've seen. Added to that, we did not run into our neighbors in our skivvies during the night. As I said, the last 2 nights were spent in Alimandi Vaticano and the room, while small, was lovely and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was especially nice and modern. According to the staff, AV was converted from a police station to this fine hotel in 2005 and that accounts for the immaculate conditions. Best of all was the included breakfast in the beautifully decorated lobby restaurant which looks out to the Vatican walls. The buffet style breakfast was superb with a wide variety of eggs, cheeses, meats, pastries, etc and some delicious fresh baked cakes and cookies. I'm sure this is comparable to the best breakfasts in Italy and decidedly better than our higher priced hotel in Venice which offered donuts, cold cereals and little else. There was a young woman (I apologize for not remembering her name) working in the restaurant, a Polish immigrant, who serviced the restaurant and the tables and was an extremely pleasant person. The other servicers when they were on duty were not half as efficient or as hard working as she. She is a credit to the Alimandi. The Alimandi has a great location next to the Vatican Museum and there are taxis always available at this location. We took the Metro for most of touring days except one day when the entire government went strike---apparently, a regular occurence but we were told this was a big one. The Metro is a pleasant 10-15 from the hotel. All-in-all, our experience was the best and we especially thank Irene who turned a potentially disastrous several days into a great tourist experience.

I'll start with the positives. It is, as others have noted, a conveniently located hotel across from the Vatican museum. The rooms are relatively clean. The breakfast is OK. They have a computer for guests' use, which is convenient. Rooms are a good size when compared to other hotels in historical buildings. Unfortunately the service was pretty poor, and we didn't have major requests or demands. Every other hotel (of 5) we stayed in in Italy had great service, so I know it is not standard for hotel employees to be rude. After an indifferent reception and no offer for anyone to take our bags (not a huge deal, but odd since this had been offered at all three of the other small inns/B&Bs/boutique hotels we stayed at) we had to ask the front desk four times over several hours to please shut off the heat to our room. The front desk guy insisted that there was \"nothing wrong\" with the temperature in our room but if he had actually once taken the time to come to the room (or asked someone else to) he would have realized he was wrong far before the fourth request, when he finally turned it off. (The room was still extremely hot and we didn't sleep very well). The woman in the breakfast room kept asking if we were done before we had finished our meal, and rolled her eyes at me when I politely asked for a second cappuccino. The girl at the front desk was equally rude when we asked (again, politely!) if we could have some extra time checking out of our room. It's OK to say \"I'm sorry our hotel is full\"; it is NOT ok to bark \"half hour. Maximum!\" The hotel is also on a busy street so it's very noisy, even in our room that was on the opposite side. We stayed at two other hotels also conviently located in Prati that were much quieter. We needed to stay one extra night in Rome because of the volcano issue. We would have loved to stay in the same place to see more of Rome rather than take the time to schlep our luggage to another hotel -- but we just couldn't bear being in this negative place one more minute.

The hotel was nice and it was certainly convenient for visiting the Vatican. However, we had several problems with the service. Well before our stay we had booked the complimentary airport shuttle. We received an email confirming our shuttle reservation and asking us to call their number when we arrived for instructions on how to find the shuttle. Well, we arrived and phoned and were told that there was no booking for us for the shuttle. So, we paid 30 Euros for the regular airport shuttle. When we arrived at the hotel and showed them the email, the attitude was \"too bad!\". I've noticed other reviews that said the shuttle service was fine, so our experience may have just been an anomaly. Also, when we booked the room, the Web price was 160 Euros. Our booking confirmation came back at 175 Euros. We wrote back and they sent a new confirmation for 160 Euros. The Alimandi is actually 3 hotels - a B&B, a 3 star and a 4 star. We had booked the 3 star (on Via Tunisi). When we arrived to check in, the 3 star was overbooked and they had moved us to the 4 star (on Viale Vaticano, just across the street). They said that they would honour our 3 star rate of 175 Euros. Out with the email and they agreed that it should be 160 Euros. When we checked out 3 days later, the rate was 175 Euros. Out with the email again, but they said \"It's the higher rate because you were upgraded\". Rather than argue, we paid the higher rate. My final problem was with the wi-fi in the rooms. I had my laptop and was given a password for the network. I fiddled around for quite a while and could not connect. The day staff were of no use in solving this problem, only stating that my laptop was at fault. The night guy was more helpful and told me that a number of guests were having problems connecting (ie. no one could connect). Why didn't they tell me that in the first place! Anyway, he lent me an ethernet cable and that worked just fine. On the plus side the rooms were very clean, the beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were very nice and the double glazed windows were amazing. Our room overlooked Viale Vaticano - a very busy street. With the windows open, the traffic noise was unbearable. However, with the windows closed, it was very quiet.

We also went for the Angelus and Papal blessing at noon. On Wednesday morning, we went for the Papal audience and we were right there. We could go back to our hotel midday to rest and cool ourselves since it was very hot (July). The ice machine beside the elevator is a brilliant idea and convenient for all the guests. There is a very popular gelato place on the way to St. Peter's Basilica. There were always long lines!

I had arranged (via e-mail) for a 10:00AM airport shuttle pick-up, based on my flight's scheduled arrival time from New York -- figured I'd have at least an hour's wait, but didn't want to book an earlier shuttle and then miss it. Turns out that my flight arrived almost an hour early -- I called the hotel as soon as I cleared Customs, and they told me that the driver was outside, already waiting for me. They'd been monitoring my flight and sent the shuttle out early -- a much-appreciated kindness, especially on a cold and rainy day. My room was large, even by US standards -- two queen beds with plenty of room leftover, plus two large armoires and a patio overlooking the entrance to the Vatican Museums. The bathroom was also above-average in size, with all new fixtures kept spotlessly clean. Breakfast included a huge array of baked goods, an ample selection of eggs and meats, plus cereal and yogurts, tended to by attentive but low-key staff in a large and cheery breakfast room fronting the Museum entrance.

There is not an insurmountable language barrier--but in fairness to all parties, it behooves the traveler to take some responsibility and double check to ensure that there are no misunderstandings, which is why we just double checked with a phone call to ensure that our reservations via the internet had indeed been made. This was our first trip to Italy and we were a bit apprehensive about not only booking on line but also what would await us when we arrived--as this was for a belated 25th wedding anniversary trip. To say that we were pleasantly surprised is an understatement. Blood is thicker than water---and it is obvious that this is a family run operation--which results in good quality control! I cannot emphasize how kind, considerate and thoughtful the staff at the front desk and in the kitchen (who served us breakfast each morning) were to us. The rooms were clean and housekeeping did an outstanding job in making sure things were neat as a pin when we returned from a day of sightseeing. We rec'd great recommendations for loal restaurants---when we got up the courage to be adventuresome and eat out some distance away, Germano not only called a cab for us to get to the restaurant but came out and gave the cab driver instructons on where to take us---this is truly outstanding service for which we were very grateful! Francesca in the restaurant always welcomed us with a big smile and was especially helpful to my wife who has some special dietary needs (as were the kitchen staff behind the scenes). Maria and Eilena at the front desk were more than gracious and helpful. The only downside--not the fault of the hotel--is that the front street is very busy and there is some noise if you have a room in the front of the hotel facing the wall of the Vatican---but one gets used to it. Just make sure that you cross streets in the cross walks to avoid being dive bombed by motor scooters (ie, no jay walking!!). I have no hesitation in recommending the Hotel Almondi Vaticano to friends and colleagues---and I will certainly want to book reservations there when I return to Rome again.

Central Rome is about a 30 minute stroll and the hop on hop off bus is only 10 minutes away and as the bus and metro are only a few steps away the location is perfect.

We decided to spend 3 days in Rome (8/1-3) before boarding and 2 days in Venice(8/16-17) after the cruise. I booked the Hotel Alimandi Vaticano based on the great reviews posted here. At the time I booked the reservation in January 08, it was ranked #1 on this site. Between the time of our booking and arrival (8 months), I noticed that because of a couple of sub-par reviews, it had lost its #1 ranking. I am a very experienced business traveler and we are very experienced vacationers, having traveled for business and pleasure all over the world. As far as we are concerned, Hotel Alimandi Vaticano will always be a #1 to us for the following reasons: 1) Hotel staff/service: It is still a family owned hotel with family members working as staff, and they take care of their guests like family members. They all speak English and are very friendly and knowledgeable about all aspects of what a tourist might want to know. In particular, they had great recommendations for restaurants. You always hear about how things in Italy never get done on time. This is not the case with the staff here. When they tell you they are going to take care of anything, it gets done on time and done properly, always with a smile. Prior to our arrival, I e-mailed them to re-confirm our reservations and heard back from them promptly. I also inquired about arranging for transportation to the port of Civitavecchia for us and heard back on that matter immediately with rates. 2) Location: As advertised, it is located directly across the street from the entrance to the Vatican museum. We took the express train in from the airport (very easy) and then tranferred to the Metro to exit within 6 blocks or so of the hotel (just be advised the subway station closest to the hotel does not have an escalator). With luggage, its a 15-20 minute walk from the Metro to the hotel max. Without luggage 5-10 minutes max. We used the Metro to get around to the Spanish Steps area, the Colosseum/Forum area with no problems. Other guests we ran into used the bus system which is also easily accessed from the hotel. If you need a cab, the hotel staff can get you one right away. Even though its not in the heart of Rome, its close enough so cab rides to areas like the Piazza Navona (great people watching at night) is around 10-12 Euros. The best part of the location is that its an area of the city which is only crowded with tourists during the day. At night, it reverts back to a regular neighborhood with nice local restaurants, town houses and apartments. 3) Room: We had a 3rd floor room looking right out at the Vatican Museum. With the windows closed there was almost no noise from the street during the day and as mentioned above, it gets very quiet at night once the Vatican shuts down. You hear about European rooms being cramped with no A/C all the time. It definately was not the case here. We had three twin beds for the three of us (me, my wife and 15 year old son). We all agreed that the beds were among the most comfortable we had ever slept on. There was a plasma screen TV with cable.The bathroom was huge even by american standards with new fixtures and a real shower stall (no bath-tub/shower combo). The A/C worked perfectly (We desperately needed it with 90F+ temps during the day and 80F+ temps in the evenings). An added bonus was a room safe where we could keep our passports and other valuables. There were also black out curtains which you appreciate when you have horrible jet lag (we traveled 18 hours straight from San Diego) 4) Hotel Facilities: Buffet breakfast (included with our room) as mentioned by other reviewers was really high quality with good variety. We never had a problem getting a seat and the wait staff was very prompt at seating you and getting coffee or tea for you. The lobby bar is small, but well stocked and the prices are very reasonable unlike most bars in American hotels. As mentioned by others, the roof top had tables and chairs and we finished each evening by picking up a glass of wine at the bar and heading up there to recap our day's travels. We had several nice conversations with other guests - English and American- up there. Everyone we spoke to had only good things to say about the hotel and staff. My son also found out he could get wi-fi access up on the roof (probably from one of the close by apartment buildings) for his I-touch. There is a pay-as-you-go internet terminal in the lobby, but I did not use it. 5) Special note for cruisers: You can take the train, a cab or a shuttle bus to get to the port of Civitavecchia which is about 1-1.5 hours north of Rome. I researched this as well and we decided to have the hotel arrange a shuttle for us, mostly to make it as hassle-free as possible. The shuttle picks you up at the hotel and drops you off right at your cruise ship. Here's the tip. For the 3 of us it was 150 Euros. The hotel shuttle is actually a mid-size Mercedes bus and can probably hold 20 people. The rate goes down the more people you have, so if you can I would see if there are others staying at the hotel who are also cruising and get them to join you. Also note, I researched the shuttle rates, and the rate on the hotel shuttle is competitive with other shuttle services. They are not trying to gouge you on this service. In all, staying at the Hotel Alimandi Vaticano was a great way to start our vacation.

Personally and because we went in the heat of August, I would have preferred staying somewhere more central where you can nip back to the hotel and go for a siesta so that you can continue to party at night or even just to freshen up before dinner.

Bus stop is just across the road for buses into the city, also metro station 10 mins walk then 10 mins direct to Spanish Steps. Always remember to establish price for taxis or that the meter will be running prior to taking a journey. 10 mins walk and a great cheap lunch dinner options is this place http://www.linsalataricca.it The hotel breakfast was superb, the room we stayed in fantastic, and so clean. As others have said, the roof terrace is a great place to relax after hussle and bussle of Rome and drinks prices at 3 euros a beer and 1 euro a soft drink are remarkable. If you want a 4 star slightly out of the hectic centre, but still in Rome and with all the benefits of public transport and the Vatican being next door, this is for you.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland Central, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel\u201d", "Author": "shazza_h", "ReviewID": "UR18753416", "Content": "Stayed at the Hotel Alimandi Vaticano for 4 nights during August.

As previously mentioned by other reviews, the location is fab if you want to visit the Vatican museaum (best time to go is at 2pm when there are no lines!). The area is quiet at night and seems to be less touristy than others. We took a cab into the central shopping area for only 10 euros. The hotel also provides a shuttle - 4 times a day to and from Fuimicino airport. It is very easy to find the location of the shuttle upon arrival. The rooms are spotlessly clean and well furnished. Breakfast is included and is well stocked with the usual breakfast items as well as some Italian favourites. Dont bother with the restaurants to the left of the hotel - overpriced catering to the tourist foot traffic which the Vatican Museaum attracts. The hotel gave us excellent recommendations for meals within a 5 minute walk. We hired a tour guide for one day - Stefano from Romecabs and it was most certainly good value for money. Stefano is very knowledgeable about the area and a great guide for the day. It was lovely to see the sites then get back into an airconditioned car!

Everything was perfect and the staff went out of their way to assist us in anything we wanted and in finding out information about what was open and on over the holidays. We were even given a card, small italian Christmas cake and bottle of Presecco as a present on Christmas Day and they organised Christmas Lunch for us at the last minute in a local restaurant which was fantastic. The breakfast each morning was a large and varied buffet that contained some strange additions (lasagne, mixed veg) but would satisfy the largest appitite or the most finiky of eater.

You can catch the Metro (3 minutes walk) or the number 81 bus (same distance) there if walking is not your thing. The hotel does not offer lunch or evening meals and I found their breakfast adequate. I could see why people have complaints about the hot food there as the food looked a little tepid but is is absolutely fine for cerials, cold meats. toast etc. The chocolate cake was unexpected and the fact that it was nearly all gone the next day was even more unexpected.

The hotel itself was very easy to find, it is opposite the Vatican Museum, we decided not to bother paying out for taxi's or transfers, we got straight on a coach to Termini Station cost us 6 euro's each, then we took the Metro for 1 euro, neither of us speak any Italian & we had no problems at all, off the metro, top of the steps, turn left & the hotel is right there, you may pass by it if you aren't looking. We had room 105, it overlooked the Vatican so we could see the queues start from as early as 7.30am, the hotel advised us to wait till after 1pm to avoid the huge queues & they were right. the room itself was beautiful, spotless, marble floors, huge bathroom, powerful double shower, toiletries provided, even slippers! the bed was a queen & so comfy plus we had an extra single, we stayed in a double room, i'm glad now we didn't pay extra for a superior, it wasn't necessary. The breakfasts were superb, the staff were friendly, the bar & mini bar prices were very reasonable. Rome itself this time of year is awful, it was hot, so very busy, the queue for the Vatican went all the way round to St Peters every morning, it was dirty, smelly, we saw rats, beggars are everywhere harrassing you in queues & as you walk around, you get harrassed by sellers on the street, the food on the whole is appauling, don't eat in the cafe/restaurant across from the vatican, they have all the food out cooked in a morning, then they just microwave it for the rest of the day. If you love cheese on your food Rome is great, cheese with cheese mmmmm my husband hates cheese so food was a problem I would advise the 24hour christian tour bus, starting just round the corner from St Peters, no where near as busy as the main tour operators but it goes the same routes, you hop on and off at stops, we found we could pretty much walk to Rome from our hotel but it is far & takes its time & does make you tired.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san clemente, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "westphillyboy", "ReviewID": "UR8104230", "Content": "Once again, the TA reviews were on-point.

The Gym is also in the other hotel if you are interested in working off some of the pasta!! The rooms were a little noisy because Rome doesn't seem to sleep. The locals stay out until 3 am, so you hear all the cars and scooters zipping by at all hours. I think you may have this problem anywhere you stay in Rome however. The hotel was super convienent to everything and the hotel was great about calling you taxi's whenever you needed it. The breakfast in the morning was full with plenty to choose from. Some stuff was a little strange (they had jalepeno poppers one morning) but for the most part, it was good. They have an omelet station but that was only open one day we were there.

Through them we got a fabulous discount on our Rome hotel (so much so that we were worried that there was a mistake and we'd be laughed out of the hotel on arrival!) but when it came to checking out of the hotel the ridiculously low RoomsAccomodation price was indeed the one we paid. You don't have to part with a single penny up front, and the cancellation terms are fabulous too. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again. So, what about the alimandi? it is hard to write a review that will do justice to it Comfort ? Tops; Beautiful old building in more than pristine order. Suites lovely with real individual identity. Location? Great; close to the vatican city inside the rione borgo. We love to walk but subway 80yds. Price? Whatever you pay for this is a bargain.

We barely had room for our suitcases (which we small). The bed linens were of average quality, at best. They had one of those fuzzy blankets that get little pills all over them and feel vaguely like cardboard. I wasn't at all confident that it was washed regularly. The sheets were not fine quality linen, but coarse cotton (maybe). Our room was uncomfortably warm, and since it was one floor above street level, it was impossible to leave the window open to cool the room.

Breakfast was nothing great, and service at breakfast was rushed and bordered on unpleasant. It was all our waitress could do to ask our room number and take a coffee order - not a particularly pleasant Italian send-off. The staff did recommend a nice, local restaurant for dinner.

Location is ok, service is not very good. However, very comfortable, nice amenities. Overall, I would imagine there are much better places to stay in Rome (p.s., Hotel Farnese is NOT one of them). Here are my thoughts: 1. Location: (B/B-) The location is not great. Close to the Vatican/St.Peter's - nothing else. For everything else (Coloseum, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navonna, etc.) you need to taxi/subway/bus it home. I'm a New Yorker and didn't even think about walking to any of these sights - way too far. And keep in mind, while there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel - its only one of many bus lines. The next closest bus stop is a 10 minute walk away (as is the closest subway stop). 2. Comfort: (A-/B+) Hotel is very comfortable. Beds and toiletries are first rate. Breakfast was also very good (hot dogs, bacon, coffee of choice, pastries). 3. Service: (C) Pretty bad, from checkin to checkout. Whenever my wife and I asked for directions, recommendations, misc. info - the staff seemed hesitant to help. Service with a frown - literally. On one night, I asked for restaurant recommendations in a certain area (near Spanish Steps) and the staffer just told me, \"I don't know any, good food everywhere in Rome just go somewhere where you see lot of people and pretty good.\" Wow, thanks.

The room we stayed in was exactly as described on the hotel's website. Elegant decor, nice cool marble floor, very big bed with a firm mattress, reasonably priced mini bar and working air conditioning. The bathroom wasn't huge but it was modern, well equipped and spotlessly clean. We were suprised by how quiet and peaceful the hotel was, considering it's right in the centre of Rome and on quite a busy street. But we didn't hear very much street noise or traffic at all from our room and it was very easy to sleep at night. Breakfast was served downstairs in the dining room. It's self service (buffet) apart from coffee, which is waitress service. The coffee wasn't the greatest - a bit weak and watery - but the food was nice enough, nothing fancy just simple but very well cooked basic things like eggs, sauted potatoes, sausages and grilled vegetables, etc. They also had fresh pastries and croissants, which were very nice too. The rooms don't have ironing facilities but you can use an iron and ironing board belonging to the hotel, if you go down to the basement with your things.

Also, originally I booked this hotel because it offered free airport transfers but was disappointed to learn that this does not apply to Ciampino. Another downside is that room service only provides drinks not food, we arrived late in the afternoon and all restaurants were shut but could get nothing to eat until they opened at 7.30pm.

We chose this hotel based on rave reviews on this site, but were disappointed. I had notified them that our plane would arrive at 9:35 and was told that our shuttle would be available at 10:00. Due to a delay getting baggage, we exited at 10:10 and called the hotel to find out where to meet the shuttle, but were told that the shuttle departed at 10:00 and the next one would not be available for two hours. Surely they had to guess that we would never have time to collect our luggage and trek to another terminal in time for the 10:00 shuttle, even under the best circumstances. We had to take a taxi for 40 euros. At the hotel, I very nicely suggested that it would be helpful to guests if they made it clear that their shuttle runs only at specified times and will not wait for guests, and that the meeting place is outside a different terminal, but it fell on deaf ears. The staff never apologized or expressed any sympathy for our inconvenience. We had to take a taxi to the airport upon check-out also to make sure we arrived on time. When I asked if it was possible for the shuttle to leave 30 minutes earlier if there were no other guests on it, the desk clerk simply suggested we take the earlier shuttle and spend 2 extra hours at the airport. Right. We stayed in Room 204 (210 euros/night) which was adequate but not as large as other reviews suggest. By looking at the fire escape plan on the hall wall, it appeared that only four rooms on each floor were large. There was considerable street noise and our toilet \"ran\" the entire time (which we mentioned to two different desk clerks but was never fixed). On the plus side, the beds and linens were very, very comfortable, the air conditioning worked well, and plenty of toiletries and nice robes were provided. Rome was very crowded during our stay and the lines to the Vatican Museums were long. When I asked the desk clerk when the best time was to go, she said the lines were always long and the only way to avoid them was to buy tickets for a guided tour from her for 40 euros each. We asked other people around town and everyone else seemed to know that that the lines died down by noon. Hm. Also, when we asked for a taxi to the airport upon departure, we had to pay the hotel 50 euros rather than pay the taxi driver directly (the clerk said they had a contract). Since we had paid 40 upon arrival and the taxi meter read 39 when we arrived at the airport, this \"contract\" seemed to be in the hotel's best interest instead of ours. I would not stay at the Hotel Alimandi again because of our experience. It wasn't bad, just disappointing. Future guests should be very aware of the shuttle schedule (not mentioned on the RomeBy website we booked through or in any email communication).

It was chosen purely on the strength of the reports and we were not disappointed. Rooms were a good size and spotless and the hotel throughout was of a very good standard. Staff could not have been more helpful from simple requests like the loan of an adaptor to good recommendations for local restaurants and information about public transport. The location adjacent to the Vatican Museum entrance is quiet and ideal for most of the city and the walk back through St Peter's Square at night is wonderful. All areas of the city are in walking distance but when you have a limited amount of time, a good tip would be to buy a 3 day pass for public transport and with a little research the bus services can be very convenient. We tried the Subway onces but it was very hot and like sardines in a tin so we tended to use buses. The highlight of our trip was our visit to the Vatican Museum and St Peter's but be warned, if you want to do it justice, take a guided tour to avoid the queues but also spend time looking around on your own. We spent the best part of a day looking round both. Take a walk/climb up the Dome of St Peter's because the views are worth the effort. Rome was a fabulous place to visit and we saw no evidence of the often reported problems with pickpockets. Even 4 nights is not enough to see it all and if we ever return, which we should because we threw coins in the Trevi Fountain, we would certainly use the Alimandi again and would not hesitate to recommend it to others. Our only niggle was that the free airport transfer was only for Fiumicino Airport and not Ciampino and it was therefore no benefit.

The hotel is right on the doorstep of the Vatican so location was great. We walked pretty much to every notable attraction Rome has to offer and never once felt threatened and the friendliness of the locals and cafe/resturant staff was great..they didnt seem to be able to do enough for you. A recommended place to eat is in the Novana square called La Dolce Vita.. Spaghetti Carbonara to die for! A great place for people watching, portrait painting and a meeting place for locals and tourists alike to just eat, drink and let the time slip by. Fantastic stay and we will definately be going back.", "Date": "April 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "marchtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR4743071", "Content": "The Alimandi on Viale Vaticano is a beautifully renovated and maintained hotel with friendly, helpful staff.

The staff is exceptional -- as nice as those at the 5-stars in service-oriented Hong Kong hotels. The breakfast was great and included in the price. The room was clean, all came with a balcony on our floor, quiet (a rare find in Rome supposedly) and nicely modern. I would stay here again. The location is not truly central as you must ride the subway for about 15 minutes to get near the Roman ruins or Spanish steps, but the price is good value. Aside from the Vatican, the neighborhood is more residential than tourist which made it fun. The only downside is that it's in Rome -- my least favorite European city so far due to the street crime, graffiti, lack of sufficient public transport and general unfriendliness of locals. We had a taxi driver and subway ticket seller try to overcharge us. We were mugged once. Rome needs New York's Mayor Rudy Giuliani to come in and conduct a thorough clean-up.
