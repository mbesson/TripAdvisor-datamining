Also, breakfast is served until 11.00 on weekdays, which worked nicely for us night birds. Plus the girl at the reception, who seemed to be permanently living there, was really friendly. But that's about it. We've stayed in several hotels in Barcelona in the past couple of years, and this one is definitely not on our list of places to go back to. Our room was tiny and poorly kept and, as other reviewers have mentioned, we could hear everything that went on in our neighbours' rooms. The bathroom was large but it had no heating - therefore, whenever we left the door closed during the night, it was freezing the next morning. The water pressure of the shower was poor, despite the very loud noise it made, which we feared would wake up all the neighbours. The worst thing about our stay, however, was the cleaning service. There were dust bunnies on corners, stains on the bed covers (which never seemed to be replaced) and the towels were a suspicious shade of grey that I wouldn't expect of a four-star hotel. We had booked the romantic package they list on their website, which included a bottle of cava that we couldn't drink down in one go, so the next morning it was removed from our room without as much as a word.

The rooms are rather small but in a cute and comfortable way. The bathrooms are in fact rather spacious. Generally, the hotel is very very clean which in Spain is certainly not a standard (trust me, I have been living in Spain and travelling around as much as a can). For those who hate the system of a sheet and a blanket usual in Southern countries I emphasize - here they have proper \"funda nordica\", no sheets and no weird blankets. And the bed covers are changed every day.Apart from minibar fridge, there is a kettle and some tea, coffee, sugar and cream and tea cups. Although the hotel windows isolate the traffic from outside very well, the isolation between the rooms really could be better. It is not that you would hear the guests nextdoor breathing, but you e.g. hear when the cleaning lady in the morning walks around and moves the beds to change the covers. Especially closing the other bedrooms doors is somehow too hearable, although the clients of the hotel are not of a society group that would seem suspiccious to you, be generally making noise, shouting loud at the corrdidors and bounce the doors. The opposite. But it is much much better than many hotels I have slept in in my life. It is no drama. It just one of the very little things to mention if finding some weak side of the hotel at all. Therefore think next time Hotasa group would be reconstructing a hotel, they could really invest yet a bit more into the isolations between the rooms, the quality is not always and only about the fashionable design. Otherwise, I loved the place, I loved the matrace although many people say it is too hard - it was a really nice quality matrace (and cushions) am wondering what their backbones say if they are used to sleep in soft beds? It is not healthy at all.. Regarding the district, it is not in the imminent center center, but do not regret it at all, Eixample derecha belongs among two cosiest parts of the city and is much more quiter than Rambla etc. It is 50 metres max from the metro which runs every 3 minutes or so, and mere 2 stops to get on Placa Catalunya/Rambla/Cathedral...(get out on Passeig de Gracia). And it is 5 minutes walking distance from Sagrada Familia. It is also a very convenient place if you came to see some concert in L,Auditori. I strongly recommend you to go have a Pilsner Urquell beer and meal to Czech bar, Pivobar which is bit further than Sagrada Familia, but not more than 10 minutes walk. The girls bake homemade bread, cook traiditional meals and always have such treats us Czechs usually have with beer in a pub, such as utopence, nakladany hermelin and even tlacenka. There also is a Polish shop close to S.F., offering all the best from our Slavonic groceries.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cQuick stopover in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "John M", "ReviewID": "UR120857018", "Content": "Hotel was fine, walls are a bit thin so I could hear people in the room next door.

So you have conveniences like bakeries, small shops and restaurants. The hotel is 8 stores and only has 6 rooms per floor. This make it a very quiet hotel, since there are less people. You also don't have to wait in line to pay, pick up your keys etc. You get that one to one service which is nice. The room was great. Nicely decorated though the bed was not the most comfortable.

The subway, as previously mentioned, is a few yards away as is the Sagrada Familia and a host of restaurants and cafes. There is only a short walk to the main shopping/dining/entertainment areas in Barcelona (e.g. Las Ramblas) so for the price this hotel seems ideal for a city break!

This area is a bit quieter than Las Ramblas, but with the Metro so close (on the same block), you can go just about anywhere you need to. The Metro is quick, clean, and cheap! The hotel is a boutique hotel with a small lobby that doubles as the breakfast area. (I did not try it out.) The desk staff were all friendly and a few spoke English. There was one computer station available--free WiFi in the rooms. There were about six rooms on each floor. The first three were quite close to the elevator which made those rooms a bit noisier. I requested a quiet room and was given one further from the elevator. However, the walls were so thin, the neighbors could easily be heard and their cigarette smoke filtered through. The floors are hardwood in the rooms so footsteps can be heard as well. This will interrupt your sleep. Even though there were busy streets outside, the windows filtered the noise well. The furnishings were fine. The beds were a bit hard and the pillows flat. The bathroom was clean and updated but the shower had trouble maintaining the same temperature.

It was one of the greatest places i have ever visited. Everyone seemed so friendly and there was so much to do. Would definitely visit the city again. I have to admit however, i was not massively impressed with the hotel. Upon arrival, we had to move rooms, as our room had a faulty shower and a terrible smell. We moved to the same type of room, but on a different floor. The caretaker who came to look at the room was quite rude. She said nothing as she entered the room and told reception there was no smell. Which was incorrect! The room was VERY small and seemed cluttered. The slightest noise in the corridor at night could be heard in the room. This and the ridiculous amount of traffic outside that went on for the whole night meant that i got very little sleep. The rooms were also incredibly hot and stuffy. Another gripe was that the bath had no plug. I had to wait half an hour for a plug to be delivered to my room. A small thing but quite an inconvenience. . The receptionist upon arrival was very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel was excellent. Right by the excellent Metro. For the money we spent on this hotel i would not come here again.

On one of the sinks the hot water would not turn on, and the other sink had a continuous drip which caused a yellow stain in the sink. The mirror was very old with a brown ring around the entire edge of the mirror. The bidet was missing the nozzle, which left a rusted screw sticking out of it, but the shower was the worse! The tile was very old and needed to be pressured washed or replaced. I felt like I needed shower shoes to touch the shower floor. The handheld shower head did not mount on the wall, so you could not stand under the water, only hold the nozzle. There were 6 round pressure nozzles in the shower that water came out of, but when you turn them on the water went everywhere.

Hotel staff are friendly (even the cleaners smile and say 'hola!'), helpful and efficient. The rooms are reasonably sized, well decorated and well maintained. We didn't have a bath in the ensuite, but the 7-nozzle shower made up for that! The rooms do face onto a pretty busy intersection, but are soundproof against most things (although not emergency vehicle sirens, as I discovered in the small hours - wasn't an issue at all but probably wouldn't recommend for light sleepers). Think it was an exceptional 3-star rather than a 4-star but the 'last-minute' deal was still worth it! Location wise it is a bit out of the centre - about five minutes from Sagrada Familia and literally 100 yards from Monumental Metro station (which is great for Passeig de Gracia for the airport train). It's not in a 'plush' area but we never felt anything other than comfortable even late in the evening. Not many places to eat in the immediate area, although quiet a few bars towards / past the Sagrada. Would stay here again, it was a solid 'good'. General Barcelona tips - if you're travelling by train from Barcelona Airport, get a T10 ticket - they're 7.70 for 10 trips in \"Zone 1\" (which includes all of Barcelona city out to the airport), any trip lasts 1h15 including whichever train, metro, tram or bus you get on in that time - AND they can be shared - so if there are 6 of you, just put it through the machines at the station barrier / behind the bus driver 6 times and that's 6 journeys off your card - really cheap compared to buying single tickets and easy too! For food, we found lots of nice tapas bars and restaurants (of varying price but all good quality) in El Born area - especially in the streets around the Santa Maria del Mar church - not near this hotel but worth knowing!", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Venice, Italy", "Title": "\u201cWe expected more.\u201d", "Author": "Pulcina", "ReviewID": "UR22774698", "Content": "My son and me was in EGH for two nights in December.

The downside is that it is at an intersection of two busy roads so you might have to bear with the noise of the buzzling traffic. The room was fairly modern, but the desks looked pretty dusty (might have something to do with the hotel being situated at the intersection of main roads), and water kept leaking from underneath the sink in our room whenever I turn on the tap. There is also no kettle in the room and it took ages for the hotel staff to bring us hot water. There was free wi-fi in the room but the connection was pretty unstable.

We took a taxi that had room for four and cruise luggage. The taxis charge by the piece and for a larger minivan. We paid about 30 Euros with tip. While checking in, a member of our party had two carryons stolen by thieves in the lobby at around 9am in the morning. The girl at the desk let two men in the lobby while we were checking in. These men were not guests of the hotel and casually walked in, hung around the area and casually walked out with the carryon luggage before our friend knew what happened. I was involved with checking in and providing passports along with my friend. His wife went to the bathroom and our other friends were looking at the lobby internet and reading maps so stay vigilant even in the small lobby of a small hotel. The rooms were clean and modern and we had a good view of the circle and the towers of Segrada Familia a few blocks away. There is shower gel, soap, but no shampoo. They have fancy showers but only half partition of glass so flooding is common. The drainage is very slow. The towels smell like vinegar. The flat screen worked but not too many offerings in English. There are no good places to eat around the hotel. We don't like the cafe bars. The food is horrible and expensive. The good restaurants are down toward the Port and La Ramblas. The restaurants and cafes are smoke filled so those allergic, don't go to Barcelona. It seems like most people smoke. We saw many young teenagers smoking like chimneys. We used a two day hop on hop off bus at $23 Euros per person and caught it at the Segrada Familia. The metro was really close by the hotel- Monument station was less than a block away, 1.5 Euros each way. The Segrada Familia station was near the tourist site about 4 blocks away. Food is expensive, look for menu of the day offerings for value. Our US dollars don't go far in Europe. We enjoyed the Gothic Quarter and Park Guell. We visited some of the other stops and shopped in local districts on the tour bus route. We noticed that the general population and the non-tourist trade shop keepers have different hours from Americans. We get the impression that they don't work many hours a day. There is plenty to see and it will take more than three days to see many of the main sites. We paid 40 Euros for a taxi to the airport for 4 with 8 pieces of luggage. Other than the robbery, our friends enjoyed the Egyptian museum and Picasso Museum.

Eurostars' Gaudi is 10 minutes walk from Sagrada. If you're lucky you'll view it's roof from the hotel's window. Sagrada is close, but this is not downtown nor the gothic quarter (which is a little bit dirty imo). This is not a central hotel, but it's a quiet neigborhood (for a city). If you want the best of this hotel, ask for one of the rooms with terrace (last floor). They should be much nicer than the rest and bigger (especially if you've seen their website). We stayed in the smallest room, the one near elevators. Those are smaller than the regular ones, but we were OK, it was just a weekend trip. However, if you stay longer, get away from the elevators. The doors are indeed paper sheet, you will be woke up by your neighbors, not by the clock or sun ;) Didn't hear much of the noise on the street, but heard every foot step on the hallway. The hotel is 1 min from the subway station. Very very handy. One issue I noticed is that you will have to switch trains at least once from here, no matter where you head to. Didn't bother me a lot, but worths mentioning. Hotel is clean, furniture was new. A little bit cheap, trying to imitate expensive furniture. It is not... Anyway, better to imitate nice furniture than to have expensive ugly furniture. Didn't have anything to ask to staff so I can't comment. TV stations are not working well, but who needs that in Barcelona? Breakfast is enjoyable here (would be nicer with a view, but the hotel is very small) and there are so many things to do out there.
