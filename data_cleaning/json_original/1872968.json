You are also only 1 minute for the U bahn station but we walked everywhere to experience the city, most of the famous things are about a 30 minutes walk but lots to see on the way. Food and drink: there are a few pubs with alot of out door seating just by the train station but we went to a pub area recommended by the receptionist at the hotel. It was 10/15 minutes walk or 1 stop I think on the S bahn, nice area with lots of pubs. The Kilkenny pub was good with friendly Irish staff and a good atmosphere for all ages it was also good for food, prices the same as Ireland (which is big enough) but that was the same all over. There is a nightclub across from the hotel we didnt go, we were there monday to friday so I dont know if there is any noise from it. The staff in the hotel were very nice and very helpful, we didnt need to go to a tourist office because the receptionist marked out everything worth seeing for us!! A walking tour of the city is worth doing, some of which are free. They have a free computer in the reception area and they printed out our boarding cards for free. The pictures on their website are exactly as it is, we booked a family room for the 3 of us just for the extra space - it cost nothing extra. The room was clean and quiet.

(Buying a Berlin Welcome card is a great idea, giving unlimited transport access and discounts for many attractions, tours and cafes throughout this fantastic city) You can also pick up the Berlin round city bus tour just around the corner in Alexanderstrasse A pleasant young man at reception was particularly helpful with tourist information and the breakfast at 5.50 euros is good value. My room was an ample size, clean and with a clean modern bathroom. Only drawback was the location of my room at the front of the hotel overlooking the road and tramtracks.

Next to the TV station they have Starbucks, but if you'll walk 3 more min to the city center you could have a GREAT cup of coffee in Balzac Coffee with a good banana bread cake (or any other cake :) ).
