I booked it, cos I knew where it was, and it's proximity to victoria. We are up again in June for a trip on the Orient Express and to see Dirty Dancing, so we booked it for ease (and the price). Our experience was that the staff were polite and friendly (we asked them questions re the tube as we're not regular London goers).

Well what can I say, this is hardly the place you will bump into the likes of the Beckhams but for travellers who prefer to spend more money on enjoyment and less on accommodation then look no further. We had a room in the basement where the dining room was also situated, there were 3 single beds with clean, crisp, white, cotton sheets and the room was lovely and warm as the heating was on permanently. Yes, the decor was dated and in need of a little TLC and the furniture basic but we were not paying Ritz prices. There was plenty of hot water in our en-suite and the shower ran boiling water in the morning. The joy about this room was the fact that it was very, very, quiet. We heard no traffic or any other guests or staff moving about. In the dining room in the morning there was plenty of toast, jam, tea and coffee alongside a very adequate cooked breakfast, which was served by a pleasant waitress. In fact the staff we came across all seemed to be extremely cheerful. London is a fantastic city, we didn't go there to spend our time in the hotel, this was cheap as chips and served our purpose.

None of the recent reviews were particularly positive, so booking the Stanley House was a gamble. The location was excellent, it was within 5 minutes walk of Victoria coach & train stations, and there was a convenient Sainsbury Express en route to the hotel. From the outside, the hotel looked smart and inviting. The reception staff were pleasant once we engaged them in conversation. There is a \u00a35 deposit for your room & front door key, but we weren't charged this. Our room was basic, but with everything we needed; the sheets were crisp and clean, there were spare blankets and pillows, and several spare loo rolls! There were plenty of drawers available, a wardrobe, a desk and a hairdryer. OK, the paintwork was tired and the hotel interior generally a bit grubby, but not where it mattered. The loo, washbasin & shower were clean, and the towels were replaced daily. The signs advising you of the breakfast times varied, but we sussed out it was available between 7.30 and 9.00. The breakfast room is in the basement, it was crowded but it encouraged us to talk to other residents sharing our table, so was quite sociable. Again, the staff were pleasant and polite, and worked hard to ensure everyone was served quickly. We had orange juice, sausages, bacon, beans and an egg, then plenty of toast, tea or coffee. Others there had cornflakes, I think this was instead of the fried breakfast. We walked to the Science Museum, took us about 45 minutes, and spent all day there before walking back. Probably further than a lot of people might fancy walking, but it gave us the chance to admire the wonderful architecture of the buildings in this area. There is a pub about 5 minutes walk from the hotel, where they serve a good meal, specialising in different flavoured sausages. Actually, we got Pork & Red Onion even when we asked for Venison, but hunger prevented us from pointing out the error! They were delicious, as was the fine selection of real ales. The pub was quiet at lunchtime, but really buzzing in the evening, quietened down again about 9pm. On the day of our departure, we had to vacate the room by 10am, but were allowed to leave our luggage (at our own risk) in the lounge until our coach went at 6pm.
