Unfortunately it rained for the entire duration but the hotel made up for the dreadful weather. The staff were so helpful and friendly and couldn't do enough to make our visit a pleasurable one. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the room we were upgraded to was spacious and comfortable. However, there wasn't any facilities to make tea or coffee and there wasn't an iron, but the reception staff immediately sent the friendly porter up with a full sized ironing board and iron on request. The location was very central with only a short walk to The Spanish Steps and the Trivi fountain. If you're expecting to experience good Italian food, then think again. We found it an impossible task to find anywhere with even mediocre food, it was incredibly bland and extortionately expensive. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was extensive and catered for all tastes. I would definitely recommend the Savoy.

That said, it is up a very steep hill and it was a challenge for my mother - just a heads up for older guests! The room was fine, the bathroom large, and the breakfast sufficient with a nice selection of hot food, cold food, and teas/coffee. We didn't spend much time in our room, other than to sleep, so it really was fine. The front desk staff was helpful - not above and beyond - but answered questions and made reservations. Got the job done! Cons: I do not think that all rooms in this hotel are created equal - for example, we had a lot of space, but we could hear the elevator all night - every night - and it made it a bit hard to sleep at times. That said, smaller rooms down the hall were quieter, but probably didn't have as much space and weren't as comfortable.

Location very good and easy to get around Rome. It was our Silver Wedding on the 19 Sept and we were so looking forward to our stay. How disappointed we were in our room. Small and very dark. It faced the front of the hotel on the 1st floor but was on the corner with no view. We were led to believe that the room would be much larger. The room safe did not work. When I mentioned all this to the hotel reception, regarding the size, all I got was a shrug of the shoulders and told that was what was allocated and nothing could be done. I was told the room safe would be attended to that day. There were plenty people around asking questions, checking in etc,so maybe the gentleman was having a bad day.Needless to say when we left a week later the safe had not been repaired. Considering this is part of what we paid for it could be argued that the hotel did not fulfil its obligation. No mention was made of our anniversary, in spite of email&cards delivered to our room, which I would have expected as part of customer service. I would have thought a 4 star hotel would have been more friendly but then again maybe the idea was to be efficient rather than friendly but it wasn't even that. What a difference when we moved on to Florence to the Alba. Smiling, friendly staff, welcoming and so helpful. A bottle of wine and local sweets, with an anniversay congratulations note, in our room on arrival. We'll go back there but not to the Savoy in Rome.

When we got to our room we were met by the unbearable smell from the bathroom. We spoke to the gentleman on the desk, explained about the bathroom and the fact that the safe was not open etc. He explained that it would be the next day before the safe could be accessed. Naturally we were not happy with this and persisted until we were changed to a different room. The new room was much smaller than the original and another bed had to be set up to accomodate us. As we had been delayed by the room change our itinerary on the first day was completely thrown and we asked for a refund. They pointed out that we had been \"accomodated\" and it was only when we persisted that they agreed to a meeting with the Manager. The room in general was quite tired and in need of a facelift but on the plus side there was no odour from the bathroom. There were no tea or coffee facilities available in the room so as we were now late we decided to go ahead and have lunch in the hotel. We were greeted by a most helpful young lady who offered us a \"welcome drink\". We ordered lunch which was flavourless and cost close to \u20ac100 (no drinks) for three, crazy money! The coffee is straight out of a machine and it does not get any better for breakfast... All the Manager was willing to do to compensate us was to offer sparkling wine on one evening and tour bus tickets for one day. We were given no other alternative but to accept this. As it happens when we tried to use our bus tickets we were told that they were the wrong ones... Breakfast was served in the basement, it is buffet style and not at all appealing.

I'm not sure what the cost was for the night's stay but it wasn't a cheap package so either the hotel or Cunard is making a nice profit on an otherwise unremarkable and average hotel room. The hotel must have deals with several tour companies as the hotel guests seemed to be comprised of large tour groups. With the name \"Savoy\" and a location near the Via Veneto, we expected a much nicer hotel than this. The hotel is conveniently located for walking to Borghese Park, Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. Our room was on the small side, older decor with dark carpeting and gold wallpaper. It was very stuffy in the room and the A/C didn't work. When we inquired at the front desk, they explained that the A/C was turned off for the whole hotel, as it was October (never mind that it was a warm day). They recommended opening the window but our room faced out onto a courtyard roof that would have given access into our room from the outside so that was not a good option. They did offer us another room higher up that was even shabbier than the one we had, so we kept our original room.

Breakfast buffet was included in our package and had good options available. Hotel is located in a pricey shopping district (ie: Versace just up the street) which means that resaurants on the main streets are VERY EXPENSIVE. *TIP: Get off the main roads and explore some side streets...resaurants are half the price, food is excellent. Pastry shops also sell great hot food at a more reasonable price. Main termini station is located a few blocks away but the best option is hop-on, hop-off open top double decker buses for getting around the city to the best attractions. We bought the 48 hour bus pass for 28.00 EURO per person and it was a fantastic way to get to the sights. The buses provide headphones (you keep) on your first trip on the bus and they provide an audio guide as you ride through the city. You can purchase the bus pass at hotel reception. Buses run approximately every half hour. All in all, a good hotel but area expensive for meals. ALSO NOTE: When we went to check out, someone had eaten at the hotel rooftop restaurant and charged their 180.00 EURO meal to our room.

The staff in the hotel were extremely helpful and so warm and welcoming to my sister and her new husband upon arrival as they knew they were in Rome to get married. The hotel has an amazing rooftop bar & restaurant which we drank in every night the staff were so attentive and prompt and also they give delicious little snacks with the drinks. I have to give special mention to restaurant manager Aldo, he literally could not have been more helpful and went to great lenghts to ensure the wedding day meal was a deliciously spectacular affair. The food in the restaurant is out of this world especially the little warm chocolate fondant type dessert...magic!!! Also the views from the rooftop are breathtaking it is so well located and feels very safe even late at night as a mother of two i thoroughly recomend Hotel Savoy, Rome for families. We had a lovely time in Rome,each day was filled with life long happy memories and it was lovely to return to such a relaxing and luxurious hotel each evening to unwind and of course a few cosmopoloitans on the rooftop bar!! Hotel Savoy is on the pricier side of life, but for a special occasion like a weddin or romantic trip it's well worth it and thte staff all had very good english and were very good giving us directions for day trips, taxis, etc. I would be more than happy to return to Savoy Hotel again....in fact i'd go again in the morning if i got a chance!!

I figured Savoy was near Spanish Steps and my car rental so I took a chance and I booked the hotel for 3 nights (2 nights too many) at $330 per night. The booking process was simple and quite good. The hotel was located just off the Via Veneto and lobby looked nice. We were informed that we were getting 1/2 an hour complimentary internet and breakfast. We went to our room and our excitement ball dropped. The room was dark, depressing, narrow window facing the outside of the other wall and of course to keep the spirit up I said \"at least we will get a good night sleep, since we have no street noise.\" I was wrong again. Our a/c started to make strange clicking sounds, we called the front desk and bell man came to tell us that this noise is a normal thing. The beds were very uncomfortable, the blanket reminded me of military brown blankets one uses while camping out, very harsh, irritating my skin, and looking old, also the comforters looked dingy. The pillow was about 5 kg - heavy, felt like someone stuffed them with pieces of fabric, dark navy blue carpets. This room looked dirty and the only thing that made us happy was to leave the room. Even the safe was inside the refrigerator which someone could pick up and walk out with it. The walls were thin, at 2 am we were awaken by some guys running trough the hallways screaming. By then we were up and heard every conversation people had outside the hallway. Breakfast was in the basement and it was nothing special. Again, did not feel clean, the room had no natural light. Going from one depressing room to another. We grabbed a roll and never went back to breakfast again in 3 night stay. On our second day my husband went to get his 1/2 free internet and the front desk said that \"our room did not come with this perk\" and he called the girl who checked us in and she said that she never offered us the 1/2 hour. So I went down stairs and caused some commotion, ready to check out that minute, the receptionist gave me 24 hours free. I do not understand their mentality, really. The next day (Sunday) we asked the front desk which seemed to be concierge also where to go for a good lunch not touristy near this hotel. Same girl who checked us in with the 1/2 internet offer sent us to Pomodoro Pizzeria. Well, this restaurant was closed on Sundays, we found this out from the Marriott Hotel concierge across the street who recommended another pizzeria ( we were seeking a room, but they were fully booked) . Two hours later we told her that she send us to a closed restaurant and we asked for a nearest Supermarket, she send us again to an underground Supermarket which was closed also. This was very frustrating. Don't you think the hotel stuff should know the hours of operation. Also, every time I was at the front desk there was a hotel guest complaining about something or having issues. We were so miserable at this hotel that when we left and said to my family \"oh shoot, I forgot to take the picture of the room to post on the Tripadvisor\" my 8 year said \"Mom, why would you want to take a photo of that terrible place, it is best not to remember.\" I guess she was right. Grand Hotel Continental in Siena cured our wounds. I would not go back to Savoy ever again, the lobby is deceiving and the location is not important when you get nothing for your bucks.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot 4 star standard\u201d", "Author": "juliagould", "ReviewID": "UR115236692", "Content": "We were very dissapointed with \"The Savoy\", rooms were tiny, (not like the pictures) and breakfast was awful, and downstairs with no windows it felt like you were in a crypt, definately not 4 star at all.However it is extremely well situated and the roof top terrace is lovely, if you upgraded to a decent size room and didn't do breakfast it is o.k.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nassau, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but not a great hotel\u201d", "Author": "Franart", "ReviewID": "UR115164628", "Content": "After 10 days in Italy at some really nice hotels, I was disappointed with the Savoy.

So we get to reception and demanded to change the room for lower floors; the staff was helpful and they changed our room without further conversation. The std room that we stayed on the first floor is better then the other. Let me remind you that this is an old hotel that needs renovation and with small rooms, but this is Italy and Rome every hotel is like that! Next morning the breakfast was 7 out of 10 for us, since as Turkish couple we seek olives, tomato etc, in it. The coffee was good and you have a variety of options for a light breakfast. The room is cleaned every day, and amenities are freshened.

Got a rate of \u00a395/ night on Travel republic to include breakfast. I think it is important to get breakfast included in your deal as the spread each morning, although good, was not worth the 26 euro per person that the hotel would charge to room only guests. The location of the Savoy is excellent, enjoying all the benefits of the Via Veneto without the extortionate price tag of it\u2019s near neighbour The Excelsior. Having stayed in both properties I would definitely favour the Savoy, as both hotels are of equal distance to the nearby Spanish Steps, Villa Borghese etc but the excelsior amenities do not justify the extra price. . The nearest metro stop is Barberini and is less than 10 minutes\u2019 walk away, linking you to, well not much really. The metro stops are not helpful for tourists looking to access the main sights of Rome, however there is a stop at the Collesseum, but other than that you would probably be better off on foot. The Savoy does not have a pool or gym, but the roof top bar area is an ideal spot for a drink at sunset. The rooms themselves are nothing special, we stayed in a plus room and although a little worn, it was perfectly comfortable and acceptable. One area in which the hotel fell down was on wi fi connection. 8 euro per hour or 18 Euro for 24 hours was a bit of a rip off considering many hotels offer it free, at least in communal areas. In conclusion the location of this hotel is excellent, the staff were always friendly and the rooms were comfortable and warm.

After staying in small, \"no frills\" hotels, The Hotel Savoy offered some of the luxurious comforts of home we had missed - namely a generous sized (by European standards) bathroom, large bed and a spacious (by European standards) room. The room was clean and maid service was dependable during our three-day stay. This reminded me of an American chain hotel with multiple floors and hundreds of rooms, a stark contrast to the boutique hotel experience during the rest of our trip. The Hotel Savoy's location was great with a Taxi stand located nearby for those who want to catch a cab and was a short (10 - 15 minute) walk to the Spanish Steps. The hotel's location is near a variety of large chain hotels (Intercontinental, Westin, etc.) and seemed to be a bit of a tourist haven, but it was not difficult at all to get off the beaten path for a more authentic experience, and still enjoy centrally-located lodging. The staff was consistently attentive, friendly and all spoke impeccable English. The staff provided very helpful guidance in what can be a very confusing city. The breakfast was nicely appointed and offered a variety of items. It was convenient, but if you are searching for a truly delicious Italian breakfast, I would skip the hotel breakfast and venture out into the city to enjoy local cuisine. The breakfast food wasn't particularly special, just convenient and not quite satisfying for the price. Internet was available in a small business center (3 computers) but we were too busy sightseeing to ever take advantage of it. The room was suprisingly quiet, and had windows that effectively drowned out the street noise. I can't there are any quiet hotels in Rome, but this one fit the bill.

They truly made us feel as though we were members of their family who they were personally responsible for. My husband and I were with a group of people and each person felt the same about the hotel. The rooms were spotless, the breakfast was really good and the location....I'll repeat that the location was absolutely wonderful for Rome with the potential to walk to many major sites and great access to restaurants and the metro.

When we got back to the hotel and rested a little bit, I fell down because of my blood presure and called for help from the reception.

He was more panic then us, which was not helping the situation at all. This is no way to behave in a situation like this, especially if you are some one in charge who should take some kind of resposibility. The ambulance came and and they did the first aid while I was lying on the bad. They decided to take me to a hospital. They put me on a stretcher and took me into the ambulance from the room, and this is the sadest part of the whole thing is; noone from Savoy Hotel was around, some housekeepers just looked at me and walked away while the ambulance man was trying to get me in to the elevator. The receptionist was dissappered, and noone was helping us. I can not understand how any of the Savoy staff could be insensitive, careless, disinterested to what was going on, and why there was no Savoy authority like hotel manager dealing with the situation. As soon as I was relased from the hospital, we decided to leave Rome and go back home, because I was not feeling well. When we were leving the hotel, the hotel staff just look at us and said \u201cARRIVEDERCI\u201d.

We were really excited about staying here as it was a good location and looked very promising on the website. Firstly, we were put in a twin room when we had specifically asked for a double. No problem, we thought, we'll ask nicely to be moved room. So the guy at front desk explained they were very sorry but they were fully booked that evening, however if we returned with our luggage the next morning we would be moved right away. (Bearing in mind we were only staying 3 nights) We agreed this would be ok. So the next day we did just that, only for him to accuse us of lying and that he did not tell us he would change our room! He said he had infact, told us they would push the two beds together and the maid would make the sheets into a double bed. If he had said that the night before we really wouldn't have kicked up any fuss, but anyone dare accuse us of lying and it's a different story! He obviously realised he couldn't move us so changed his story. To be honest, it was too short a trip to start complaining to management etc... i didn't want it to ruin our weekend, but it did make us very angry. I understand that's an isolated case, so here's what else is wrong with the hotel; VERY noisy- we were woken every night by the bin men in the street and other hotel guets. In fact one evening we could hear the lady in the next room's entire phone conversation! The walls are really thin. Breakfast was awful. We thought we got a good deal with it included, but we never went back after the first morning. We waited 10 minutes for a table, and the food consisted of mainly bagels, croissants and breads. Not much choice at all. The safe in our room was broken, so we had to leave our valuables in a safe at reception, a bit of an inconvenience when you want to have access to them frequently and you're room is on the 3rd floor! Beware of the bars and restaurants at the end of the road- they are extremely expensive and we paid 30 euros(!!!) for 2 vodka and lemonades on our first night! Everywhere is expensive but that was just a rip-off! I'd recommend Gusto or the Recafe to have dinner- a 10/15 minute walk from the Savoy.

My husband and I looked at each other when the doorman closed the door and I was like...we need an upgrade. My husband called the lobby, very nicely asked for a free upgrade, and we got it.

Room overlooked bins in side street, opposite building was being renovated with workmen on scaffolding so had to keep curtains closed, but there wasn't any view anyway. New double glazed windows and shutters were very efficient in keeping out noise and light but as the air conditioning had a mind of its own we needed the window open at night ,only to be interrupted at 07.45 by the bin lorry and at 01.30 on another night by a rich kid blatting his Ferrari down the side streets for a few circuits. Breakfast served in a gloomy basement manned by surly staff more interested in checking your name off on list rather than clearing tables or providing service. God forbid that anyone would get away with not paying for 2 Euros worth of food! Watery fruit juices and staff play a good game of trying to avoid serving you proper coffee from behind the counter and refer you to the machine in order for them not to do any work. Breakfast finishes at 10.00 but after bacon ran out at 09.25 they were reluctant to replenish. A rather miserable guy with a moustache grudgingly complied with some fatty new bacon at 09.50. Nice roof terrace with a view and a restaurant without a view! We were offered a discount offer of 15% off food but with set meals at 50 or 60 Euros per head we did better elsewhere. Very few public rooms at the hotel which has a mixture of diplomats, air crew, business and leisure travellers. Yet again the pictures in the brochure of the rooms bear no relation to the room you are actually given. A few general observation on Rome. The traffic! It is such a shame that every walk down a tiny side street with no pavement is interrupted several times by cars and motorbikes hell bent in getting to work or home a few mnutes earlier. It really is a joke and unless action is taken the whole city will become one big memorial to the car/motorbike and tourists will stay away. There really are no pedestrianised areas. Dont be afraid to use the metro/trams. We had a great afternoon by going to Frascati (to get away from the cars). Catch the train from Termini and for 1.90 Euros each you end up in a lovely hill town in half an hour. Buy a set picnic lunch for 5.90 each from the main square consisting of bread, pork, salami, cheese, proscuuiti and olives and with bottle of the Frascati for 6 Euros dine in a local park. Dont forget to validate ticket before getting on the train or risk a 100 Euro fine. Colliseum - audio guide for 4 Euros rubbish and a waste of money with confusing site numbers and with dry narrative. Roman Forum impressive but no signs or diagrams as they are trying to extract more money from you. Go to the Borghese Park near the hotel at the top of the Via Venoto and hire a bike for 4 Euros for an hour and enjoy the lovely gardens. Cafes in the park only open at the weekends in November. The prices - drinks out were very expensive. up to 14 Euros for a large beer and 12 Euros for two cappucinos! Spanish steps ruined at the moment with a faux Berlin wall to commemorate 20 years fall.

I had opted for half board so we ate at the hotel every evening and the food was lovely. The waiters could not do enough for us. My husband was given champagne in his room on his birthday which was a lovely surprise and gratefully received. Breakfast as really nice and plenty of choice. All in all, really pleased with the Savoy. Only problem we did have was room was not ready on our arrival (we were early though). Front desk staff could be friendlier - my only gripe - can't be bad!!!", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wirral, UK", "Title": "\u201cSavoy Rome\u201d", "Author": "JohnoWirral", "ReviewID": "UR12150123", "Content": "We stayed at the Savoy for 4 nights at Xmas 07. The hotel is simple but very well equipped by Italian Standards. Buffet breakfast is simple but more than adaquate, beside you dont go to Italy to enjoy the breakfast so ignore the negative reviews on this aspect. Location is excellent, only 5 minutes walk to the metro which is perfect for getting to the Vatican / coleseum, good tip is to buy a 1 Euro train ticket and get the train one way and then walk back and take in the pantheon, trevi fountain and spanish steps on the way back to the hotel. Good restraunts in the local area and if you get bored of Pasta there is the Hard rock cafe just around the corner. In summary, this is a good hotel by Italian standards and is in an excellent location. Other tip is to buy a bus ticket at the airport (8 Euro per person) and take a coach direct to Rome Termini and then get a taxi to the hotel (7 Euro). This will save you 30 Euro if two of you are travelling.", "Date": "December 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cGood location, decent value\u201d", "Author": "newhorizonsny", "ReviewID": "UR11652694", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Savoy for 4 nights in the middle of November. Our overall experience was positive, but this hotel seems to cater more exclusively to business travelers than tourists. The staff is not overly accommodating but overall they were helpful enough. The room itself was a good size by European standards but this hotel needs some up keeping. The furniture is extremely old and run down looking and the decor is very dated. Also, if you are a light sleeper I would recommend some earplugs - this hotel is on a narrow street and there are windows facing the street on most sides. In terms of value, it depends on the rates - my american express travel agent was able to secure a rate $100 US dollars less per night than what all of the major travel websites were advertising. The location of this hotel is excellent. It is around the corner from Via Veneto - it is within walking distance of some attractions (the Spanish steps, Trevi fountain) and it is very close to other forms of transportation. The metro stop is only a few blocks, there is a taxi stand on the corner and one of the hop on hop off tourist buses (ciao roma) actually stops right across the street from the hotel (this was not a bad way to first acclimate yourself with the city). The complimentary buffet breakfast was good, they actually had a nice variety of food but I would definitely recommend getting there on the early side.

Also, the location of the hotel puts it near busy streets, and well, Italians do love to honk their horns. So you'll want to bring ear plugs. If you want to work out, you'll have to go to a nearby gym. While the hotel's site ([--]) indicates that it has a fitness center, that is not the case. They'll give you a voucher to go elsewhere.

We had a wonderful time in Rome as part of this. We had been to Rome before but stayed in a villa in a different part of the city. This hotel is just off of the Via Veneto, full of nice hotels and restaurants, and easy walking distance to the Spanish Steps (although the walk up every day can be slightly wearing). The placing of it is great for a walking tour and the main sights are not too far away, one of the bus tours also stops very close to the hotel if you prefer not walking. As an aside here the hotel is very close to the Villa Borghese a brilliant green space full of museums and art galleries which I only discovered this trip. The hotel was very nice, clean and well presented. The rooms were of average size for a 4 star. Breakfast was good with a mixture of continental and cooked choices served in the cellar area. The hotel restaurant/bar is a must do in this hotel and we were dissapointed that we only discoved it on the second to last night. I sits ontop of the hotel and was always quiet. Service was excellent with the staff very professoinal but also friendly, they also seemed very glad to see us. When we dined there we were one of only 4-5 tables occupied. The food was ex cellent and some of the best we had in Rome. The views from the bar are amazing and you can see many of the sights of Rome from up there. We spent a hugely romantic and restful last night up there drinking a bottle of champagne (this was suprising cheap, by the way) and watching the sun go down over Rome.

We walked to the hotel from the central station (about 25 mins), and returned by taxi (10 mins). [There's a train that runs between central station and the airport every 30 mins - it costs 11\u20ac each way. Be warned though, luggage has to be lifted about 4 feet from the ground up onto the train.] The hotel is in a relatively quiet street and one of the city's hop-on/hop-off open-top buses stops right outside. I love an open-top tour; it's the quickest way to see a city and decide where to focus the rest of the break. Our room over-looked the street but there was very little traffic noise. The nearest underground/subway station is a 10 min walk away. We'd never used the Rome system before but it's easy - on some of the automatic ticket machines you can even select which language you want the instructions to be displayed in - and for 1\u20ac a trip it's possible to get anywhere quickly and cheaply. Having said that, we walked a lot and had a great time admiring the contrast between great architecture and, well, not-so-great buildings. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. As part of the standard process we were given a map of the city, a brochure offering some tours, and a voucher for a discount in the roof-top restaurant. The double-room was a \u201csuperior\u201d room. There was a complimentary basket of fruit in the room, and the mini-bar was free! They told me this when we checked in, but when I saw premium brand wines, spirits, and soft drinks in the fridge I phoned reception to double-check! What's more, the mini-bar was automatically re-stocked each day The room also had a safe that was big enough for my laptop (a small one without a CD/DVD drive) AND my digital SLR AND my camcorder. Tight fit, but they all fitted. The en-suite included a bath (with a fixed shower) and was well stocked with toiletries - including toothbrushes and razors in case we'd forgotten ours. There was also a hair dryer. The single room was a \u201cplus\u201d room and was also a decent size. This overlooked the courtyard \u2013 nothing special, but the room was booked for its size, not for a view. Breakfast buffet was included. Hot food (sausage, scrambled eggs, and bacon), cold meats/cheese, fruit, cereal, etc were good. We had a problem at the roof-top restaurant. They delivered the wrong starter. I waited for mine while my wife and daughter ate theirs. When it arrived (with apologies) the food was fine. On other evenings we choose to eat in the nearby restaurants on the pavement / sidewalk (enclosed in glass 'conservatories') where the food was better. Particularly enjoyed the food and atmosphere at the Cafe de Paris - the pianist was excellent, his repertoire included Italian music, Stevie Wonder, and Ray Charles!
