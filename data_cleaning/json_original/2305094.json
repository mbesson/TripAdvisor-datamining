We arrived at the hotel at 7:25 pm and proceed to check-in only to be told that they didn't have a reservations for us. I had booked directly through the hotel 1.5 weeks prior to arrival so we showed the confirmation email via an iPhone. The manager came out and asked if we had the printed copy. I didn't, but said if he could direct me to a printer, I'd be more than happy to do so. After he obtained the printed confirmation, he said that Booking.com didn't have our information. I said, \"That's funny because I didn't book through Booking.com. If you just read the confirmation you had me print, you will see that I booked directly through your hotel.\" He said, \"Ahhh, that makes a difference.\" How does that make a difference? I had other friends meeting us in the lobby at 8 pm. We didn't get into the hotel room until 8:20 pm. At which time we walked in (only one key card worked) to find that it hadn't been cleaned from the previous occupants! Downstairs I go only to be told to please give another 20-40 minutes for them to clean the room. Nothing was comped, no other room offered, NOTHING! What would have happened had we shown up at the original check-in time of 2 pm? So much for my reservations to have dinner at 8 pm! We finally get into our room after 9 pm and then quickly get dressed to meet our friends for dinner (only for some of our friends to give up waiting and leave altogether). I needed to exchange USD for AED and was then told, \"We don't have change right now. Come back in the morning.\" You have got to be kidding me. I didn't deal with the staff or hotel anymore. I simply slept in the bed with limited TV access (there are other channels available in this area than just Dubai One and Understanding Islam), but mostly stayed out of the hotel. I would never recommend this place to anyone. It is more hassle than it's worth and there are plenty of other places that cost the same or less without the headache.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "uae", "Title": "\u201cI would not recomment this hotel\u201d", "Author": "bumbles1971", "ReviewID": "UR123091633", "Content": "I live in the UAE and stay in hotels all over the Emirates for my work - unfortunately this was one of the worse due to the service of the staff and the location.

We arrived in our car to be told they didn't have valet service so had to park it ourself. On arrival to reception I noticed 2 members of staff, a female attending to 3 different customers without eye contact and a male on the phone- Ahmed, after 5 minutes of us waiting he then told me to join the other que. no apology or reason why. I waited a further 10 minutes and he then went on to attend to my mothers (separate) booking. I was checked in by the female receptionist and Ahmed took another 10 minutes- on and off the phone, checking in my mother. All done without any communication and he was constantly on and off the phone, the guy seriously needs a new job or he was not in a good mood that day! After a poor start we checked out our rooms. Spacious,clean and comfortable. Although for a new hotel the decor already looks like its falling apart and I'd give it 6months to a year before things dont look as new as they are. The mini bar was completely empty which I questioned and they said it should be fully stocked, good job I checked otherwise I'd have had a rather large bill. Breakdown... Lobby: very cheap looking-dated already, gold everywhere, terrible reception staff, very unwelcoming and security make you feel like a thief. English pub: Nice. Indian nightclub: Ok if you like that kind of thing :-/ Bathroom: The bath products are cheap, hairdryer was Ok for a travel one, shower cubicle was small but there is another above bath. Bedroom: Large room with sofa/tv/free internet- Note, we had to request iron/iron board- and then again for adaptor. Location is walking distance to Mall of the Emirates, nothing else in the area but you can jump on the metro which takes you to most places in Dubai. I didn't view the pool area, my mother said it was OK but she is easily pleased ;-) Upon checking out the safety deposit box wouldn't open so we called the reception and after a further 4 CALLS and 45minutes waiting security turned up and unlocked it for us. All in all the place was just OK, I would not stay there again.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cA great place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "TravelhappyEngland", "ReviewID": "UR121002914", "Content": "The Grand Excelsior is situated in a good location.

Location was really good as it is near the Emirates Mall, accessible to all routes and 10 minutes to the beach (Jumeirah). Service I can say was above average, everyone sincerely trying to help you out with any inquiry or request. As the hotel was quite new, everything in the room was good. Drove from Riyadh to Dubai and it was a tiring 12 hour drive. Check in was quick and they were ready for us. Our room was upgraded from Superior to De Luxe upon arrival (for free, probably due to Eid Holidays and the fact that we were traveling with 2 children below 12). The room was comfortably bigger than most hotel rooms in the 4 star category, free wifi & activated for 2 pc's. Wifi also available for the whole building with option to get connected via cable in the room. The bathroom was pretty standard but clean and spacious. The pool is located on the top floor, although nothing really out of the ordinary, it was sufficient to accommodate both children and adults alike. There is a sauna and gym, usage is free - but we were not able to use it anymore due to lack of time. As we came by road - basement parking is also available and free. One thing we did not get fond of was the breakfast buffet, the 1st day was fine, we thought things would get better but eventually concluded that they do not really have a range or better variety for this. Pretty much the same everyday. Suggest you get your daily dose of croissant and coffee + fruits and just go to the mall for a better meal. It wasn't that bad, only if it had more choices, specially we were traveling with kids, children seem to be choosy after the 2nd or 3rd day. The whole stay I can rate as very good, except for 2 odd things which happened on our last day and the check out day. The day before we check out we requested the room to be serviced. The room we found out after we came back from a long day of touring was not cleaned properly, they did not replenish the stocks (water & coffee etc) and the bathroom floor was still dirty. We did not bother reporting - we were too tired to argue with the people there and we were about to check out 5AM the next day anyways. We wanted to have an early start driving back to Riyadh so we requested for a bell hop to help us with our bags at 6AM. I had to call the front desk 5 times to remind them that we were checking out - they came 40 mins after. So far this was the only glitch in our stay. The frontdesk clerk - Sergio was very accommodating and ran a block out to help us get a cab to catch our dinner cruise appointment at 8PM on our 3rd nite. All other employees were also helpful. The F & B staff can use some more training as they tend to take your plate even if you are still grabbing a bite during breakfast. Overall, good enough - value for money, location and service. I'd say 3.5~4 out 5.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grand Excelsior Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d2305094-Reviews-Grand_Excelsior_Hotel-Dubai.html", "Price": "$109 - $349*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Al Barsha Dubai</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2305094", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2d/3c/2d3ccd5b8e318af15b5ea63ffd5871b51large.jpg"}}
