But if you are looking for cheap and clean accommodation in the heart of Berlin you can't go far wrong here. The room is basic with a double bed and a single over it - a bunk-bed in effect. There are hangers for your clothes (only a few so take some spares if you like to hang a lot of things up), a small desk, a mirror on the wall and a washbasin in the room. It's worth noting that the shower cubicle is also in the room (and although it's not entirely see-through, if you aren't on your own or with a partner - potentially you could feel a tad uncomfortable about showering with another person in the room). The toilet, although in the room, is behind a fixed door. Don't expect a room with a view. Mine overlooked a building site. But I don't recall any noise. The staff on Reception were fabulous - very smiley and helpful. Breakfast was served in the lobby and was very good and varied. Guests were mostly German - such friendly people! The area seems to be up and coming with a new restaurant opening downstairs (good for a quick/cheap eat before heading out on the town) and building work going on. Great transport links both outside the hotel and from Alexanderplatz (ten minute walk away).

The hotel is not at the Alexanderplatz, but is an easy 15 minute walk down a main thoroughfare. The hotel is off on its own, not much nearby in terms of restaurants and shops, but there is a large grocery store/supermarket just behind the hotel. It has a bakery section with pastries so you can pick up some food to go here. The hotel check in was very efficient, staff friendly. First impressions were that the hotel was better than I imagined it would be for $60 per night. Once up to the room, I continued to be impressed. The place was spotless - room, hallways, reception area. The room itself is quite spartan (think Ikea display room), but it was adequate. It had a queen sized bed, with a single bed over top (bunkbed style). The room had a small desk, with a wall mounted flat screen TV above it. Satellite service brought quite a few English channels, not just the repetitive English language news-only channels that I have experienced at other Berlin hotels. The Bathroom is a bit strange, but functional. The shower/toilet/sink are all one plastic/fibreglas unit. The shower glass door opens inward, and you step out of the shower right into the room. This was fine for me as I was staying alone, but might be a bit odd if you were sharing the room with a fellow work traveller, or older children. the toilet is in a separate room - more like a closet, and the sink is attached to the outside wall of this room. Not much for counter space to put your toiletries. Lighting in the room was well done, with a cool string of LED lights mid way up the wall and around the room. There were overhead lights, and reading lights above the bed, as well. The room is quite cleverly thought out, with very good use of the small space to make it functional. The hotel offers a buffet breakfast, which I did not have, for 10 Euros. It looked to me like it was mostly cold items (cereal, breads), but I didn't stay for breakfast and so cannot be sure. As mentioned, there is a grocery store behind the hotel that sells pastries and coffee for a reasonable price. For the price, I was very happy with the room and hotel, and would definitely recommend staying here for the budget conscious person who wants a clean, safe, and quiet place to sleep.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and close to everything\u201d", "Author": "KitKat9020", "ReviewID": "UR120615676", "Content": "Stayed in the hotel for two nights and was pleasantly surprised.

A busy road junction is the only sense of life around. However, the main centre of Alex has plenty of transport links and shopping. I'm not sure if we would return to this particular Etap.

The shower was great - very powerful, the bed was a good size and firm. The main street out front is very busy with traffic but the windows have good double glazing and there is air con in the room.

It's next to the Fernsehturm so you'll never forget how to find your way back. What I did walking in 1 day: 5mins down the street from the 'Turm is the pretty area of Nicholai Viertal beside the river. Worth a wander around & a large breakfast, then hop on the U bahn at Klosterstrasse to Stadmitte to see Checkpoint Charlie & the interesting Wall Museum. Walk round the old line of the Wall past Potsdamerplatz and stroll up the road to experience the impresssive Monument to the Murdered Jews and the Brandenburg Gate & the Reichstag for a wee sit down on the grass. Then walk under the gate and up to Museum Island and sit by the river to have a late lunch. You can then walk up to the Hackescher market & the Hackescher Hofe to wander round the pretty cobbled courtyards, eat & drink & shop. There are of course lots of other things on this circuit so it depends what you like. I enjoyed the architecture but didn't go into any of the museums or galleries - that's for next time. I spent 9 hours but didn't rush and stopped for lots of coffee and food along the way. I went out at night to the area of Kreuzberg where there are lots of pubs open late. Stick to the main streets here and it's a great area to go out for drinks. A taxi back from here costs about Euro12-15. I took a Rough Guide and was struck by how negative it was about many things.
