Yes there are some faded finishes and lagging repairs/maintenance. If you get a room with a window it probably looks (as mine did) across Jaffe Road to a monolithic parking megalith. Yes you put deposits down for a hairdryer, plug adapter and room key- I got mine back quickly and with smiles. Part of the problem seems to be that the building is owned and run by a huge entertainment corporation: floors 2 through 8 are lounges and clubs of different sorts, perhaps adding shady clientele to the hotel floors. But from my 20 year acquaintance with HK hotels it suited me fine. They are movable on prices if you stay for more than one night. I had no qualms about noise during my stay. The trick to the elevators is to see which floors each one serves- this is basic knowledge to anyone who travels the major cities in Asia. Another good point? Reception is on 11F so one (and one's friends) can come and go as one pleases without the often intrusive surveillance of HK hotel front desks. This could be a negative for some guests, so good to be aware.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cUninspiring hotel but great location\u201d", "Author": "erable", "ReviewID": "UR135028256", "Content": "With rugby (or was it soccer?) in full swing, it was difficult to find a hotel room in Hong Kong. Our travel agent in mainland China worked hard to find us a room, and we ended up at the Kings Hotel. While we were glad to have found accommodation, we thought it an expensive deal for what we got: a small and sterile room with a tiny bathroom. The hotel has a rather stark and austere feel to it so if you are looking for a warm atmosphere, you won\u2019t find it there. Our toilet, sad to say, emitted some noxious odours from time to time, and left us questioning the air quality in the room. Staff seemed inured to this problem, informing us that the drains were at fault. No resolution there. That said, the air conditioning worked well and the beds were comfortable enough. Hall noise and adjacent room noise can be a problem, especially with guests (as we had) who favour slamming doors over closing them and who enjoy long conversations with their door open. The AC drowned out a good deal of the racket, thank goodness. The location was great, and we discovered some nice small (and reasonable) restaurants within walking distance. Staff were as friendly as could be expected, and I was lent a notebook on several occasions to send emails home. All in all, I would say that the hotel served its purpose at the time, but I won\u2019t be rushing back to it.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cGood location for transport\u201d", "Author": "monopuppy", "ReviewID": "UR135025737", "Content": "within 5-10 minute walking distance to the nearest MRT causeway bay station within 3 minute walking distance to the nearest Tram station within 3-4 min walking distance to the Airport Bus A11 bus stop A lot of restaurant near by the hotel. for the traveler stay at this hotel, i recommend to take the airport bus A11 to the hotel or vice versa. room condition / cleanness is acceptable.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cDecent value\u201d", "Author": "Fusiondragon", "ReviewID": "UR121263674", "Content": "Good central location and is easily accessible by the train.

Was told that they had recently moved to hardline ethernet, but that didn't work for us either. After complaining, they told us we could come down and use the WiFi in the main lobby, but that WiFi also failed. My BF spent 2 hours helping them fix the WiFi for the lobby. The hotel staff were polite, but generally had a 'that's the way it is' attitude and were all around useless. They require a 800HKD deposit for the key-card to the room, which is re-used from guest to guest. They did not have an extra key-card for my BF. Signage in the room said to go downstairs for an iron. I went downstairs and was told they needed my passport and a 500HKD deposit for the iron. I said the sign in my room didn't mention it and the guy just handed me the iron. The bathroom door is a sliding piece of frosted glass, which was supposed to be activated by a button, but the button didn't work so we had to manually slide it - no biggie. The shower stall had cracked tiles and mildew. The toilet ran constantly and due to the sliding glass, you couldn't really close off the bathroom and its noises. The bathroom was dark - probably to try and hide all the flaws. There is a small wet bar area in the room to wash things. The bed was firm (like sleeping on the floor), but I like that. The bed and room seemed clean.... I'll tell you why I use the word 'seemed.' About 30 minutes after we checked in, we heard (very clearly - thin walls and room door goes 1-2 inches off the floor, so sound travels very well) a man negotiating prices with a high heeled woman in the room next door. I guess the negotiation was successful because shortly after we heard a lot of 'business'. Initially, I thought things like this happen and I figured the hotel doesn't get to choose their guests. And at that point I wasn't really questioning the cleanlinees of the bed/room. I had run into the cleaning staff several times during our stay and they were very sweet and nice/helpful (completely opposite of the reception staff). It wasn't until our last night that my opinion on the Kings Hotel in Wanchai was solidified. On our last night (we were there for 10 and had 9 days of 'normal' neighbors), we were returning from a late dinner (10pm) and were stepping off the elevator when I noticed a hotel worker (receptionist, not cleaning staff) lingering in the hallway near our door. I noticed she was holding a walkie and a tuperware full of keys. I gave her a polite smile, and she perked up as if to acknowledge me and began to follow me. She continued to follow me until she realized I had my own key, then she scurried back to the elevator. I jokingly mentioned to my BF that maybe they were conducting a sting or something. Well his interest was piqued and he watched her from our peep hole as she got on her walkie talkie and then proceeded to unlock the door to the room next to us. About two minutes later, the elevator door opened and a scantily dressed woman led a man in a business suit into the now open room and more 'business' ensued. Fake screams and all. We decided we didn't need to stick around and listen so we left for an hour. When we got back, they were showering and left about 15 minutes later. I heard a noise in the hallway a short-time later and peeped out to see the same hotel worker carrying some cleaning supplies into the room. 10 minutes later, she was gone and I looked at our bed disturbingly. Since the last 9 nights we had normal guests as neighbors, I knew the room next door wasn't reserved for special 'business'. The idea that the hotel was in on the 'business' just blew me away. Anyway, it was a crappy experience, but makes for funny stories now that I can tell people I was mistaken for a 'lady of the night' while staying in HK. All in all a bad hotel. It smelled like sewage too and the lobby is not on the ground floor. Don't stay here. But if you do, the cleaners down the street are cheap and super convenient.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Qingdao, China", "Title": "\u201cDon't waste your time and money\u201d", "Author": "saylestx", "ReviewID": "UR114700663", "Content": "I am currently staying at the King's Hotel and I wish I wasn't.

No. But the price / quality ratio has to be the lowest ever in 15+ years of traveling overseas. The price was over 150USD, I've been far cheaper for budget rooms in Paris/Manhattan/Tokyo, etc. I was given the \"dungeon\" room, by far the smallest, no windows, the bed takes 90% of the room so I have to crawl from the tip of the bed to get in bed, there is no bathroom per say, but a toilet and a shower without any separation so you can smell the toilet from the bed that is 2 feet away. For some reason the installed the biggest sink on the smallest counter so you have no way to place anything on the said counter. There's also a small kitchen counter and another sink that serve no purpose since both sink are withing 2 feet of each other, no work space, the hardest bed I have ever been in. The noise from the other room can be heard, the doors are hard to open and make a loud noise, so when someone goes in or out, you wake up, the staff makes round at 1am with their walky talky in full volume.
