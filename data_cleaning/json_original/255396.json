Shops all around, a monorail that runs in front of the hotel with station a few steps away, a McDonald fast food diagonally left front of the hotel, and a bargaining market called Paddy's Market at the leftmost side. Back side of hotel are restaurants and shops. Also near the main street where you can walk 3 to 4 blocks to reach a Woolworth supermarket. All I can say its a very convenient location specially with the monorail that can bring you places. HOTEL: Lobby: Its not very grand and not very small either. Quite functional. Breakfast area is small and most of the time full but turn around time is quick. Did not encounter any problem so far. Room: We are placed at 3rd floor where the Gym is located. I guess this is because we traveled by Tour Group therefore room rates are cheaper thus effect is the whole Tour Group of 25 pax is to be placed at lower floor. The room doors... As I walk down the hallway to our room, I find the doors to be quit old already. This already gave me the impression that the hotel had not been refurbished yet and is due for one. As I entered the room, it had the usual layout. Hallway with Bathroom on the right side then 2 twin bed then a TV table with a small picture tube TV set (if not mistaken, its a 21\" or below in size) then a table and chair and the curtained window. Outside the window, view is a wall and another house. A cabinet to put cloths. Inside is a safe, iron and ironing board. What I do not like with the room is despite the lighting that is available, I feel that its still very dim. It would be nice if it would have been much brighter even just a little bit more. Bathroom: It is okay and quite big but the paint color of its wall is dull and boring, which gives the impression (in my opinion) of an old and aged hotel. But I was happy on the curved curtain rod on the bath area because it includes the ceiling light to be in the bathtub area. This is nice because it illuminates the bath area properly. Also a plus for my mom who is a senior already. Service: The reception area people and bell boy knows the basic rule \"Smile and Greet\". However the people in the breakfast area do not even smile. They look like they are forcefully working there. Verdict: Its an aged 4 star hotel with a very good location. Food. Shopping. All within walking distance. All within reach. If you are just staying at night and whole day out, then its a good hotel to be with. But if you are the type that really want to enjoy even your room stay at night then better look for other hotel... unless they already refurbished the rooms.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surabaya, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cBest location in the city of Sydney\u201d", "Author": "SETYADARMA", "ReviewID": "UR127105157", "Content": "5 minutes walk to Paddys market and monorail station.

The food in this area is so good and so many places to eat that I cannot mention. It is a 4 minute stroll to the Paddys Markets. Markets that sell fruit, veg, meat, clothes and anything else you might want to purchase. The markets are located below what is best described as a shopping centre with a supermarket, banks, bars, TAB and other specialist shops. There are some shops similar to factory outlets throughout Sydney and Brisbane. Great value and some good deals to be found. The room was quiet. I had a room overlooking the market building. Internet was wired and around $20 per day. In this age of Wifi etc - it should probably be complimentary. The room had a queen size bed. Large enough for me alone. For two people the room would be adequate and spacious as well. The shower/toilet area is simple and does include a bath tub. The toiletries provided were sufficient for the stay. Check in and check out a relatively efficient process. I ate one morning in Shipleys Restuarant. This is a buffet breakfast. This was included in my room stay. Else the fee was $25 i think for breakfast. I can say that it is overpriced. The restuarant is small and you may need to line up for a seat from around 7am - 8.30am. The food was basic, the quality, ordinary and the selection very restricted. The water had run out in the tea dispenser and when I asked could it be filled I received a strange look from the attendant which amount to \"go away\". I think you could find some better options locally for the $25 they charge. Overall the hotel is clean, great location. Serviced by trains, buses, and the tram system. You can board the tram and be at the casino in less than 10 minutes.

The staff were pleasant, asked us about our plans for the evening and gave handy tios about where was best to view the fireworks etc. We were given a corner room on the top floor which was modern, clean and extremely well equiped. There was a seperate sofa and arm chair and made a very relaxing stay. The bathroom was basic but functioned as you would expected and had nice toiletries. Running late for New Year dinner reservations the concerige went out of their way to get us a taxi (this was difficult as lots of the roads in the area closed NYE) which was really apprecaiated. They were equally helpful at the end of the holiday including printing directions to the Hunter Valley as we had hired a car. The bar was nice and reasonably priced - especially at happy hour. The hotel is in a good location for Darling Harbour, Exhibition centre, China town and Paddys Market. There is also a monorail station across the road meaning you can easily get around the rest of the city centre.

We stayed twice, before and after a cruise, first for five days four nights, then for two days and one night, so our impressions cover seven days of experience. Arriving in Sydney from Los Angeles leaves you a little drug out, and at mid-morning, wishing you could check into your hotel early. We had made this request when reserving our room, and were accommodated just a few minutes after we arrived at the hotel - this was really nice. The maids had just finished cleaning the room, it required inspection, then we were given keys. On our second stay, just after our cruise ship arrived we immediately got keys to our room early. The staff seemed to appreciate we were guests. We had a corner suite on the 5th floor the first stay, and a deluxe queen bed room on the 8th floor the second stay. Every night both rooms were dead quiet, very spacious with a large lounge area, private bedroom in the suite and large bathroom including both a bathtub and a separate large enclosed shower in the suite, with a combination tub and shower in the deluxe room. Housekeeping services were thorough. Both coffee and teas are provided, along with a hot water pot. The coffees are freeze dried in thin packages which you (we) might not recognize right off. Small milk containers were provided in the small refrigerator. We carry a lot of electronics and appreciated the excellent number of electrical outlets, all Australian 240 v style needing an adaptor, with one 120 v North American style outlet in the bathroom suitable for low current devices like an electric razor or cell phone charger. The wonderful, trouble-free room keys you just hold up to the door pad, no swiping through some slot. Elevator service is great, with not much wait, just remember to hold your room key to the elevator floor pad to let you select a floor (a nice security feature). Two great conveniences were the in-room written hotel guide, the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the completeness and comprehensive coverage. Second was the concierge desk was always staffed with two very helpful people for tours, events at the Opera House (concierge got us great seats together for the ballet Merry Widow when the on-line said only 7 scattered seats were left), or the nearby (7 walking minutes) superb Capitol Theatre (we saw the stage musical Mary Poppins). Great location for this hotel. Walking distance to the Capitol Theatre, right next to Chinatown (food was everywhere), Sidney Entertainment Center across the street, a short walk to the Darling Harbor park, ditto for the Chinese Garden, a quick 2 minute walk to a monorail station and the light rail, a TicketMaster booth right across the street, bank ATMs nearby, major shopping less than a three minute walk (with major grocery store, wine and spirits store, wonderful food at Barby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bakery, and everything else), and rapid access to taxis. We did not have a car, and after looking at the layout of Sidney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s streets, the traffic, and driving on the English side of the road, we were glad of this. The only downside to our stay was expecting internet access to be included in the room rate as is common in the USA. Both wireless and wired internet are available at a charge. We used our ATT MiFi instead. A very big plus is this entire hotel is nonsmoking, so you can always enjoy taking a breath.

This was one of three hotels we stayed in during our visit to Australia, and I would rate it second of the three. The hotel is clean, well cared for, its within walking distance of Darling Harbour, which is loaded with restaurants. Unfortunately, that's about all the good things I can say. At best I found all the staff indifferent. Our room was very small; the bathroom was so small it was downright awkward. Something has to be next to monorail, and unfortunately it was our room. Several times an hour, the train flashes by, mere feet from your window, which doesn't open at all, making the room feel very stuffy. Probably the most annoying thing was on check out, we received a bill for very expensive phone charges. All the calls where made to my daughter's cel phone, none of which where answered, just rang. She lives in Sydney, so the charges seemed unreasonable for local calls. By my recollection, there were 4-5 calls, all no answers, and the bill was $70. When I protested the excessive rates, the front desk advised that they couldn't do anything about it, I would have to contact the hotel manager when I got back to Canada. After several emails, the hotel manager finally agreed to refund 50% of the phone bill, but only after I pointed out that their in room documentation did not advise of the hotel phone charge rate.

I appreciated that the room had a refrigerator, robe, and slippers, along with a nice set of bath products. Everything was completely clean. Decor was very basic, but had a modern feel. The public areas of the hotel were not as nice as the room. Hallways were dark and had scuffed walls; the lobby, while it had some new decor elements, had a dated look. The fitness center was absolutely miserable. I didn't try the dining options within the hotel -- you'd be silly to do so given how many great restaurants are within walking distance. Service was fine. Not outstanding or overly welcoming, but everyone did their job. My platinum status with Priority Club was not recognized nor rewarded with any additional perks, but this is my general experience with Priority Club (and is in such contrast to Marriott, Hilton, and other chains, which go to great lengths to reward loyalty). The hotel's location is good; it's at Darling Harbour and therefore is near dozens of restaurants, cafes, etc.; the light rail and monorail are steps away and it's not a bad walk from the Town Hall station for other rail services. So, overall, I was pleased -- hence the \"very good\" rating. Where I think the hotel falls short, though, is on what it offers for the price (or, at least, the price it was charging during my visit). I wasn't disappointed per se in any aspects of the hotel, but when I compare what I got for my room rate to what I've experienced at other Sydney hotels for the same price, the hotel does not favor comparably. (For instance, I've paid the same room rate, during the same season, at a Hilton, where I had a much nicer looking hotel, a room with better decor, better service, breakfast, etc.). So, my recommendation is to comparison shop. If you find this hotel at a great comparative rate, go for it -- there's nothing really wrong with the place.

It was fine once we worked out the ideal setting (e.g. one tap at 6 o'clock and the other at 3 o'clock), but that took a bit of work during the first shower to figure out. Also, the shower dripped incessently unless very firmly turned off. Those are very minor issues though and didn't affect our stay. This hotel was much quieter than I expected. The hotel faces the monorail line and the huge Sydney Entertainment Centre, so has the potential to be a noisy place. However, the windows have full double glazing, so we noticed little noise from outside. Likewise, there was a large, screaming family staying a few doors away from us on the first night and I was worried that we might be disturbed by them, but there were no issues with noise from other rooms and noise from the corridor was minimal.

The concierge was very nice and gave me the ticket and explained to me how the ticket worked. I was in the process of moving my car when my Fianc\u00c3\u00a9e rang to advise that the receptionist would not check us in as the booking was in my name, even though the concierge advised the receptionist that he had checked my details when he gave me the ticket for the car park and it would be ok to check us in. I had to re-park the car and run back to the hotel to show my licence. The receptionist was on the phone during the whole time we were checking in and barley cracked a smile. 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c When we checked in to the room there were not towels. Small thing I know, but at $300 a night we should not have to ask for towels. 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The biggest problem was when we checked out. We paid cash for the room to the receptionist and the account was all cleared up, just as we were leaving my Fiancee asked how much money had been held on our CC for the room, the receptionist advised $400. This was a shock to us as no one had advised that they would be holding so much money on our card, and when we checked in the receptionist advised they would be taking just a swipe of the card. Never did they advise that they would be holding so much money, if we knew this we would have paid for the room up front and paid a cash bond. The receptionist advised that it would take 5 days to return the money to our account. We have no idea, and the receptionist could not explain, why they would hold $400 for the room when it only cost $312 and they already had an imprint of my credit card from when I made the reservation some time ago. We advised that half of the reason that we came down and stayed the night was to shop for Christmas and the $400 that they were holding was a large chunk of our money. After a long discussion with the receptionist and then manager we made an arrangement for them to charge our CC with the $400 and then they would refund that amount to us in Cash. Although this was not the best solution, we agreed. However the next day when we checked out account, we had been charged $400 TWICE and no refund. I then called the hotel back and after talking two to very rude receptionists, spoke to a manager who really did not care at all, he just advised that we would have to wait for the bank to refund the first amount charged. If the receptionist staff just did their job none of the above would have been an issue. Holiday Inn just need to learn some basic customer service.

But apart from the monorail it is a fair walk from any transport - busses are 2 blocks away, central railway is over 1km away (about 5-7 blocks uphill). The light rail and monorail are very close but only good if you are going to the locations they service (great for the shopping district or Darling Harbour). The location is more Chinatown than Darling Harbour - it is a short walk to the chinese gardens and the end of the exhibition centre but a long walk or monorail ride if you want the shops or cockle bay area. The 2 restaurants onsite were attentive and the wedges from the bar were fantastic (best cooked ones I have had in a while!). The restaurant had a wine and cheese tasting as I was going out at night - of course trying to tempt you back. Check in wasn't as good as I would have liked - I arrived about 11 so I could at least leave my bags. The problem was the receptionist wasn't helpful about possible timing for my room. I was told to check back at 12 to see. I got back about 12.45 and was told it would be a futher 1/2 hour so I had lunch. Went back about 3/4 hr later and I am not sure what happened but she seemed to scramble to find me an open room (about 2pm by now). I don't have a problem with having to come back later but to get told one thing and then it is 2 hrs later I have better thing to do - just tell me the room will be available at 2 or 3 pm and I will go explore the city and come back then. I love an early check in when I can get it as I get to freshen up but I understand if the hotel is busy that isn't always possible. The concierge guys were helpful when they were focussed (Sunday am they were a little too focussed on a ebay or such auction!) and the room was fantastic - large, nice toiletries, comfy bed, quiet. Having had a very noisy room at the Novotel up the road the room here was comparatively very quiet in the same area. One more thing that needs fixing is information about the internet access - the website has various prices that are no where near what the receptionist told me - very expensive.

For those who are offended having to walk through the small coin-operated guest laundry room to reach the gym/spa, then perhaps you need to pay hundreds of dollars more per night and stay in some luxury five-star hotel elsewhere. The one and only point I will comment on...I was on the 11th floor, so I had no trouble regarding the noise from the monorail running directly in front of the hotel - practically right outside the room windows on the second and third floors. But upon observation from outside, I found that would be a bit annoying if I did have a room at that particular level. I would highly recommend this hotel and definitely look forward to staying there again on my next visit \"down under.\" Just make certain you ask for a room on a high level, or you'll have the monorail riders watching you getting dressed or sleeping.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "hon., hi", "Title": "\u201cUNPROFESSIONAL\u201d", "Author": "ylbuckwheat", "ReviewID": "UR52418997", "Content": "We stayed at this location twice.

We started looking for hotels only one week prior, and chose the Holiday Inn based on its relative price (which was still fairly expensive, but that is Sydney), location, and star rating. We booked a superior room using Priceline. Upon checking in we were told that due to the room type and using a 3rd party booking website, we were not guaranteed a room with a single bed. At the time only rooms with two twin beds were available, so we accepted that hoping to only stay one night. The receptionist was kind enough to let us check in early in the morning since the room was cleaned and available. We ended up staying for our entire reservation due to the hassle of trying to cancel using priceline, and having to pack and move our items. The hallways in the hotel smell very musty and look like they had water damage on the carpeting. We thought this might just be our floor, but after visiting multiple floors the smell was everywhere. The room also had a musty odor, but not as strong as the hallways thankfully. The room we had was clean, but the twin beds are very uncomfortable. You can feel the springs when you move around, and our backs hurt every morning. The pillows were thin (not good if you are a side sleeper). We wished the windows would open to get some fresh air. We like going to the gym while on vacation, having a gym was one of the reasons we chose this hotel. Getting to the gym is a little strange as you have to pass through the laundry room. At the time, the gym's jacuzzi and sauna were out of order. Then the main fitness area is a small area consisting of 1 LifeFitness machine, 1 bike, 1 treadmill, and 1 elliptical. It's like a nice home gym rather than a gym you'd think to find at a hotel. The location was nice being close to Chinatown that has good eats like Mamak or Spice I Am. It's about 10 minute walk to CityRail stations of Central and Town Hall. I thought being near the monorail station would be great for getting around town, but we found the monorail didn't go near any of the places we wanted to visit. When researching this hotel I thought this hotel was a 4-star hotel based on what most sites had listed it as (one site did have it as a 3-star). This hotel didn't feel like a 4-star hotel. If you need wifi, one nice thing is that you can reach the McDonald's wifi from the hotel lobby and restaurant. But the connection gets really slow and has a lot of errors during peak hours. The hotel wifi has an expensive rate, so we never tried it. The day prior to checking out I asked the concierge what the best way to the get to the airport was and he mentioned there is a bus that comes every 30 minutes at specific times, and costs $14 per person. What he failed to mention was that for two people, the cost of taking a taxi is about $30. And he didn't mention that the bus was an independent party that makes lots of stops at other hotels, so its nowhere near as fast as taking a taxi.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cI will stay here again\u201d", "Author": "Wolin", "ReviewID": "UR48462945", "Content": "I stayed at the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour because it was close to my business meeting location.

Both rooms had 2 very comfortable beds with duvets and many pillows to choose from (plus a pillow menu if others were needed). There were ample outlets by beds and at desk with computer access (US and European plugs by computer desk). I did not have my laptop so no idea how well this worked. Phone with built-in alarm clock-could set time but not activate?? No directions and not obvious how to do. Power connection to back of phone came off very easily-be careful or won't work but there is another phone by the computer outlet. There were 3 bedside tables-one on each side plus one in between two beds where phone/alarm clock were located. This extra space was nice to have. Each room had kettle with coffee/tea supplies provided but no dry creamer-liquid creamer in refrigerator. Minibar items seemed expensive so none used-bought soft drinks down the street and put in fridge to chill. Bought chips twice the size for half the price at 7-11 on Sussex St (one block over). There were 2 complimentary water bottles which were restocked on the 2 night stay. Brochures about Sydney as well as stationery and pen provided by computer desk. Luggage rack-as well as closet with hangers, shelves, iron/ironing board, extra pillows, blankets, and safe (prior guest had left safe in locked position in first room with door open-manager came and reset promptly when called). Mirrored closet door was good since only mirror not in bathroom area. Bathroom had tub, separate shower, sink, and toilet. Room 931 had mold/mildew issue in two drains. They cleaned the one in the middle of bathroom but never cleaned the one in shower even after second request-had to take off cover and put plastic bag over when not using to keep sewer/musty odor from permeating the room. Room 1027 was a corner room and had a slightly different layout but the same furniture (and no bad smells). Room 931 had nothing spectacular to see from room-just other buildings but nothing scenic, but room 1027 had views of Darling Harbour, the ANZAC bridge, and the southern part of the city centre due to windows on two sides of the room. One set of the thicker curtains seemed to be lacking a little but thinner curtain kept out the glare. Had the room faced east, sunrise may have been too bright! Sunset was! Everything was spotless in both rooms except the drains in the room 931. Breakfast included in rate was plentiful. They made eggs to order for me and had tasty Canadian bacon and crispy sliced bacon. Many juices, hash browns, breads, and a juicer as well as coffee/tea and more. One item on the buffet that I really enjoyed was the sauteed Portabella (sp?) mushrooms. It provided a great start to the day! Since we were returning for a 2nd stay 3 days after our first, we each left one bag (dirty clothes, Sydney travel info, wine we couldn't take on plane to Cairns, etc.) at hotel with concierge baggage check. Upon our return, everything was there and untouched and undamaged. They offered to deliver to our room, but we bumped into the guy getting on the elevator on the floor where the storage room was and took them from there. All the concierge staff as well as those at the front desk and in the restaurant (breakfast only for us) were friendly and professional. Great customer service! In summary, I give our first stay a 3.5 due to the musty smell and the lack of response to cleaning the shower drain after a verbal and a written request. I give the second stay a 4.5 since almost everything was perfect. Join the priority club ( and pay the $50 to upgrade to Gold level if you aren't Gold already). I was upgraded on both stays due to my status and felt extra special the way they treated me and my friend.

Initially we had booked 2 nights at an internet dicount rate but we realised we needed an extra night there so had to ring up and book another. The extra night costed a little more because it wasnt the 'internet' rate but we werent too bothered. The hotel itself is situated about a 10 minute walk from darling harbour, not far from china town. We were welcomed by a friendly japaneese staff member who gave us a room on the third floor. However, when we got into our room I was less than happy. It was very very basic and gloomy looking. For some unknown reason we had been given a disabled access room, therefore there was no bath. The room was very dowdy and dark and I felt a little let down so I decided to ask to change rooms. I spoke to a lovely woman at reception and explained my unhappiness. She was very understanding and offered me a room on the first floor to look at. A very helpful concierge man showed me the room which he explained was 'situated next to the cities monorail', therefore, 'might be slightly noisy'. However, I stood and listened to the monorail go past and to be honest I felt it could barely be heard, therefore I accepted the room change. The new room was much more spacious and comfortable- plus a little lighter. However, the windows looked like they hadnt been cleaned in 10 years and we couldnt open our curtains as our room looked out directly onto the street. I figured that this was the best we were going to get so we settled. When I went back to reception to get our new room keys the original japaneese staff member was there again, so I explained what we were doing. He seemed less than impressed with me and his previous friendly persona dissapeared as he handed me the new keys without a smile. I felt a bit like I had personally offended him! At the end of the day...when you are paying alot of money to stay somewhere you have to feel happy. I wasn't expecting the hilton but i was expecting more than what we originally got! The hotel has a small gym with a runner, cross trainer and bike as well as a few weights. I used it once and found it very pleasant. There is also a very small spa which we never got round to using. The only downfall is that the gym and spa is located through the laundry room on the third floor so you feel a little claustraphobic in there. On our last day the concierge staff looked after us by taking care of our bags whilst waiting for the airport transfer. I also ventured into the hotel bar/restaurant to ask if they could russle me up a strawberry milkshake (even though it wasnt on the menu) The guys behind the bar were wonderful, very friendly and a little eccentric! They made me the MOST wonderful milkshake, complete with real strawberries. I thought this was a lovely touch and just wished that the whole hotel made me smile as much as these particular staff. All in all, I probably wouldn't stay here again...I'm sure we could have found somewhere better for the same price.

We decided on this hotel after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and felt that all things considered, this hotel should meet our budget and needs quite nicely. And we were not disappointed. Checking in was swift, and the concierge, prompt and knowledgeable. There is also an ATM and a public phone (which allows you to make int'l calls inside the hotel lobby). More importantly, both were working. The hotel also kindly met our request to have a room on the higher floors (we were given one on level 10 - brilliant!). The room itself was clean, bright and cheery. Towels were aplenty and clean. The housekeeping staff we met during our stay there were polite and enthusiastic. So it may not be a bad idea to hang the \"Do not Disturb\" sign on the door, just to be sure you won't be disturbed by the housekeepers when sleeping in. F&B wise, the bar and restaurant looks great and cosy. The buffet breakfast we had at Shipley's on our final morning there (as usually, we would prefer to try all kinds of food out there) was quite good, despite the usual choices. There was also a refreshing blend-your-own-fresh fruit juice counter, and free flow of cappucino, expresso and lattes. The buffet queue was manageable due to the limited seats. So be warned that the morning breakfast crowd, coupled with the limited seats in this cozy Shipley's restaurant could mean a short wait before you are ushered to your table. Plan your time well to avoid unnecessary itinerary slippage. The three passenger lifts worked well and fast, minimising any time wasted on waiting for them. During our stay there, we also requested for a late check-out to accomodate our flight time and it was granted readily with a smile. Finally, to reach this hotel from the airport, you can take the Kingsford Smith Transporter airport shuttle service, which has a counter at the arrival hall. A return trip costs a reasonable AUD$22 per pax. The KST shuttle also picks up passengers from the hotel every 30 mins. We had no problems whatsoever with this arrangement with our own transfers. Location wise, Chinatown is right behind on the next street and Paddy's Market is just right outside the hotel. Lots of cheap and good Asian cuisine available from these places till late at night. Capitol Theatre (where we caught Billy Eillot) is also a 10 mins stroll away. Lastly, there is also a Macdonald's just across the road at the Sydney Entertainment Centre in case this is important to you. There are a smattering of convenient stores around the hotel but the nearest 7-11 is two streets away. For more upmarket dining choices, the happening Darling Harbor is a mere 5 -10 mins walk away, taking you on a lovely stroll across a park. To reach the City Centre quickly, you can take a bus (AUD$1.80) from George Street - which is mere minutes from the hotel. At the bus stop in front of the hotel, you can board the Sydney Explorer Bus. If you desire something more direct, I notice that a taxi or two is always parked perpetually in front of the hotel. If you wish to stay in Darling Harbor but do not mind not having a harbor view, this is an excellent value for money choice to consider.", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City", "Title": "\u201cWatch what you sign up for\u201d", "Author": "jbar434", "ReviewID": "UR16862673", "Content": "The hotel was nice enough, but I was there with my significant other and they gave us two twin beds.

The rooms were spacious enough and had well equipped beds and cabinets. The bed was wonderful and was a real comfort for our backs especially after an intense day of touring Sydney. The TV had enough channels and we didn't get bored with it. The furniture was also adequate and things went well. All in all, this hotel was wonderful- the housekeeping was superb and the room was really cozy for us. oh yeah, i forgot to say so but the hotel's location was really fantabulous! It was near Paddy's ( the flea market open only from Thursday to Sunday) and the attractions of Chinatown. if you stay in this hotel, food wont be a problem because of all the restaurants and kiosks just a few blocks away. BUT, here comes the pinch, as i've said several times already, the breakfast buffet receptionist was a TOTAL RACIST. He's a middle-aged Chinese guy and this is how he does his discrimination. When the guests are Caucacians (especially the blonde guests and the guys) , he's really nice and hospitable and he's like an angel. He gives the Western guests pleasant greetings and really speaks to them in a polite manner and he really hides all the rudeness in him. he's like this:\" Good morning sir/ ma'am! =)How are you today? having breakfast on your own or with your friends? Anyways, let me show you to your seat. =D \" But, when it comes to us, the Asian guests, he gets all bossy and mean plus he gets so impolite. He's like this: \"Hey you! X( What's your ROOM NUMBER?! COME WITH ME!!!!!!! Here!\" We felt that he's a very impolite receptionist because it's his job to show every guest to their seats PROPERLY and he should'nt just choose to whom he should he be polite to. And, the fact that the people he chose to despise were of the same race as him, we felt that he was very unreasonable. The most discriminating part of that receptionist's attitude was that when we were at the juicer station at the buffet, there were Caucacians sitting at the table near the station. There were three of us from our party who were helping out in making the juice so it was quite crowded that the only space i could stand on was beside the teble of the Caucacians and when the receptionist passed by, he just suddenly pushed me from where i was standingso when he could've just said 'excuse me' or asked me to move! If you're a Caucacian, you'd have fun at breakfast because he'll be all over you and he'll be really hospitable. But, if you're Asian, it'll really be annoying to deal with this receptionist. This is a good hotel, but I suggest that everyone have breakfast somewhere else instead (even if the food at the buffet is good) so that they won't experience racism at breakfast.", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, great rooms\u201d", "Author": "canatrace", "ReviewID": "UR16615413", "Content": "Booked most of our hotels for Australia and New Zealand trip based on other trip advisor postings.

The location was also one of the best we could have hoped for, being right next to China town with amazing shops and eateries ranging from budget to more expensive meals. There were several convenience stores nearby. The awe inspiring Darling Harbour was on the door step from where you get ferries to lots of other Sydney areas. Bus, light rail (tram) monorail and rail connections were also all within walking distance. Paddy's Market was right next door - open on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sundays where you could do your souvenir shopping all in one go.

The Concierge had an excellent knowledge of the city and was able to give great assistance with driving directions etc. Parking is limited and we were accomodated in the Entertainment Centre Car Park which was a short 3 minute walk. The room we had booked several months back direct through the hotel was a queen deluxe with breakfast package and we were pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to an executive suite on one of the new upper floors. The room was great in every regard. Spacious, spotless,modern and well furnished. As we were on a high floor, monorail noise mentioned in other reviews was not an issue. Eating options at the hotel included a restaurant that served an excellent breakfast buffet and a bar/grill with a limited but good quality and well priced menu and drinks. They cater well for people attending evening concerts at the Entertainment Centre across the road. Meals are light with a reasonable choice on the special \"show menu\". It was hard to find fault with this hotel and based on this experience we would most definitely stay again. Accor hotels often receive mediocre reviews for the perception of \"generic brand\" or \"sameness\" but to some of us there is a certain comfort in knowing what to expect quality wise.

I booked the room through HI's website and got a 14 day advance pre-paid rate. I booked a 2 queen bed room and that's what we got. We had a few problems driving to the hotel - first of all, there were roadworks at the end of the street and we couldn't get through. Luckily we're locals, so had our trusty street directory & managed to find another way around. Then when we arrived at the hotel, the car park was full so we had to park at the Ent Centre and had our ticket validated by the hotel. $15 per 24 hrs. There are renovations going on in the public areas which are supposed to be finished on 1 October. I found the lobby to be a bit small especially when crowded with people coming and going. I'm not sure if this will change once the renovations are done. Our room was nice...the beds were very comfy and sheets clean. The fridge is inside a cupboard with lots of room to make coffee etc. The only downside I could find was the lighting. Our room (134) had a very small window and it faced into an alleyway so was quite dark. Even with the lights on, it was dim. The lights didn't seem to have very bright globes in them. Plus you needed to have your room keycard in a slot to work the power. There are 4 steps from the room door down to the sleeping area. I wonder if many people fall down the stairs as they are located directly in front of the door & as it's dark when you enter, it's hard to see the stairs. The bathroom & wardrobe were both located just near the door so if you needed to get up in the middle of the night, you had to negotiate the stairs. The bathroom was modern with sufficient towels and what looked like a new shower screen (the shower curtain rod was still attached to the ceiling). The shower was in the bath but there was a railing for assistance. The shower head was quite high (a problem I see other people complain about but not me, cos I'm short!) and the water pressure was good. The hot water came through quite quickly. The breakfast buffet was $24.50 per person and children are free. This is around the normal price for buffet brekkie in Sydney and as we were only staying one night, we decided to have it. There was quite a long line waiting for tables as obviously we were there at the busiest time of the morning. The selections were pretty standard. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

I booked the twin room through one of the websites that pop up when you google 'discount holidays sydney' or some such, and got it for $139 per night. This was a good price given the quality and standard of accommodation - lovely big, air conditioned room, comfortable beds, still new carpet, clean walls, Foxtel, gameboy facilities, internet; lovely bathroom with shower over bath and plenty of space. Complimentary everything ie shampoo and conditioner, shower cap etc, tea, coffee, milk - the only possible catch being the non-complimentary wine, orange juice, chocolates, muesli bars, crisps, soft drink etc which are also provided at exorbitant cost should you lack the discipline to resist them! Food at the in-house restaurants was also expensive to my mind although comparable with other classy restaurants in the area. We ate our own food for brekky and packed lunch, and ate elsewhere the 1st night. On the 2nd night I found I was able to get a decent room service meal for both of us by ordering from the kids menu - we had battered fish with steamed vegies, fruit salad & ice cream, about $18 and the single serves were easily big enough for both of us.

For half an hour you can walk around the garden in costume and take pictures. It's so much fun and such a different memento to take home!!! We were very happy with the staff at the hotel.

They were also extremely helpful with getting us a shuttle back to the airport.The bell boys were especially friendly and helpful.
