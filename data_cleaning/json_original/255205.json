It's located half way between airport (Barajas) and city centre in a quiet street. It's a 10 min walk to the next tube station, next bus stop 200 m. Price was quite low (less than 50 Eur for a single per night), however quality of room and services were pretty good. Rooms are small but functional (incl. flat screen TV and internet via cable), bathroom clean and well equipped (even hairdryer). Bathroom details were in need of some repair though. All additional services are at extra cost (breakfast, internet access, safe, minibar, etc.) but at low prices (6 Eur for breakfast, 3 Eur for 24 hr internet, etc.). 24 hr reception was friendly, english spoken and helpful. There is a restaurant in the hotel (Italian). Some more places to eat and a shopping center in the streets around the hotel. In the lobby are machines with cold drinks and snacks at low prices. Not a hotel to stay for a week of holiday but ok for a short visit to Madrid or stay overnight before flying out. Liked it, would stay there again and would recommend it to friends.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGood value, helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "bedford123", "ReviewID": "UR65710418", "Content": "This is a good hotel if you want to stay in the Arturo Soria area. We stayed 1 night coming & 1 night going from Madrid. It is near the airport- a 10 minute taxi drive, but located in a nice, family oriented neighborhood. The staff was friendly & helpful. They allowed an early check-in (10 am) when we were only hoping to drop our bags. They also made all the taxi arrangements for us.

We booked a room with 4 beds, and had a very large and elegant room to ourselves, paying only about 60euros per night for all 4 of us. The hotel is quite new with excellent room facilities - bathroom is large and spacious and a hairdryer is provided. Our room was on the 1st floor and even had a balcony to ourselves, where we could star-gaze at night. The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and welcoming even though we only arrived at 1am in the morning. In terms of location, the hotel is a good 10-minute walk to the nearest metro station, but it's not that far with good company. The lobby is large and beautifully decorated, adjacent to the breakfast room. Overall, a very pleasant experience!", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cLong way from Centre\u201d", "Author": "JamesAnnaIvor", "ReviewID": "UR2991010", "Content": "Hotel El Parque is a good hotel, but one thing lets it down. Descriptions do not mention the fact that it is 30 mins from the centre of the city, or that it is a 15 min walk to the metro. This might well have put me off had it been clear. Taxis are quite good, but if you factor these into the price of the hotel, you are probably better off staying in town somewhere. And be warned - city taxi drivers do not seem to have any idea where the hotel is either - make sure you have a map with you. The staff were mostly great (they spoke good English!), but when we asked about buses we were told to take a number 70 - it went nowhere near the city at all. Also, take a few mins to explore the area around the hotel - up the road is a great shopping centre, and round the back are some large restaurants that we missed out on. But on the whole we had a good stay. It is impecibily clean and the breakfasts are great (but make sure you get there early - i think food runs out!).", "Date": "January 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sherwood Park", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed our stay!\u201d", "Author": "Travelingraysgirl", "ReviewID": "UR2483269", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel just after it opened in February 2003. It was a quaint hotel that offered underground parking. It was located in a residential area. Our room offered a huge terrace. The room was clean and very nice. The bathroom was small but offered all the amenities. We ate in the restaurant and it was awsome! Still remember!!!! Very impressive. The steak was better than any I have ever tasted. Everything from appetizer to entree to dessert was delicious. When I went the hotel was rated a 4 star.
