I was aware it was slightly out of town but was prepared to stay further out for a better hotel and this is exactly what we got. Because of the excellent metro system in madrid - it makes the hotel very accessible and it really is only a 15 min metro ride into downtown. The area is a business district and is clean and well maintained. The nearest metro station Bolgna is a 5 minute walk as you turn left out of the hotel. Here you will also find a hopsital and a mcdonalds with their own cafe which we availed for breakfast - great coffee and pastries ! After a couple of hiccups with our room first being a broken tap and the second being a leaking shower, we were kindly upgraded to a junior suite for 2 nights of our stay. Rooms are very comfortable and classy with dark wooden flooring and gorgeous bathrooms with great city views. Found room service to be ridiculously priced ( probably because of the euro ) so mainly ate out. *Tips Nearest station is Bologna as you turn left out of hotel onto main road.

The staff serving breakfast where excellent and always happy to serve and there was a great deal of choice. The Spa was around 29 euros and you booked it through the main reception, you can have a DVD player installed in your room but you need to arrange this before your visit, if you look on the map it is quite a distance outside the centre but with the metro station so close its so easy to get in and you will be guarenteed a great nights sleep as there is no noise.

After check in she showed us the room that was on the 27th floor as we booked a skyline room. As we booked a Madrid card arrangement she told we could get a free welcome drink in the bar that was very much welcomed. The room was very nice and superb clean. It had all the features you would expect from a five star hotel. The design was very beautiful and the bed looked very comfortable from the beginning and did gave us a good night rest. There was nothing to complain about the room. The first evening we ate at the restaurant that was on the top floor and gave some breathtaking views over the city. As we didn't reserve a table there was no view for us but anyway we were very happy we could eat that late on the evening. The food was good but not fantastic but at least it tasted good. The service in the restaurant was mediocre. To many people serving one table and so they asked a few times if we wanted bread what we didn't want and let the first waiter know. But anyway, better 3 waiters at your table as no one. The bar at the first floor was good looking and you could also enjoy sitting outside for some drinks. The wine served was of good quality and served with potato ships. The bar man (Vladimir) is very professional and you could see he very much enjoys his job. The bar was almost empty but he did everything very fast and with much profession. We had a great time with Vladimir, as it was so quiet he had some time for a conversation with us that we started our own. Thank you for that ! The breakfast was also on the top floor and had also breathtaking views. The food was from very good quality and there was plenty of choice for every bodies needs. From smoothies to warm dishes, you name it and they have it. Coffee, tea and fresh orange juice was served right after taking place. The second day at breakfast they already knew they should serve one coffee for me and tea for my wife with both orange juice. That seemed all employees had their 5 star service level. A big plus was the free internet with computer in the lobby, that was also very fast. A service that is hard to find these days. Some reviewers complain about the location but my wife and I found the location very good as we didn't want a hotel in the middle of the city centre. Also on the website they don't give you the imagination it is in the centre so everybody could have known it was not close to the city centre. So why complaining about the location, just do your homework. The subway is a 2 minute walk away, is in a safe surrounding and didn't cost that much money at all.

After a month of touring Spain we wanted to end on a high note (the pun is intentional) and stay with a little luxury. The Towers - part of a larger, ultra-modern complex - showcases modern design and modern amenities. Everything works; air conditioning, water, lights, wifi, the comfortable bed. The view is exceptional from any of the upper floors. It's a 5-star hotel after all. Construction is still continuing behind the hotel, but there is no problem with noise in the hotel room. The towers are new to the city's skyline and signify Madrid's modern side. They are an impressive sight and can easily be seen from the train as you approach Atocha station. You are, however, some distance from the colorful center of the city and getting there will require a bus, cab or metro ride. The metro is fast, easy, avoids congestion and takes about 25 minutes to reach Plaza del Sol. The nearest metro stop is only a 3-5 minute walk from the hotel, along the edge of the tower complex and near a hospital. There are few restaurants nearby and the apartment buildings that line the wide, busy thoroughfare add little distinction to the area, giving a less appealing 'any big city in the world' feeling to a stay. That said, we had an excellent dinner at Casa Nemesio which is just a short walk from the hotel. And, frankly, after a month of travel, the Eurostars Madrid was a good place to unwind before the flight home. Check online for the best rates.

And it is indeed gorgeous. However, I'd never go there again. There are 3 classes of problem. 1. facilities - one small lounge-bar with seating for about 20 people to eat: not enough for a 28-floor hotel! - six lifts (elevators) for 28 floors. This results in long waits (several minutes sometimes) for a lift. - public areas are small and narrow (bar, lobby floors) due to the tall thin tower shape of the building. A lot of people can stay here, but they can't all use it at the same time. 2. room usability - the only full length mirror in the room is behind a low-hanging pendant light, and a bedside table, meaning you can't see yourself in it! (I've uploaded a picture of this). - the lighting (halogen downlighters) and the surfaces (black polished marble, black reflective glass) actually mean you walk into things because it's visually confusing! The public toilets on the lobby and bar levels caused almost everyone I spoke to to walk into the wall as they entered. - although free, the WiFi ran very slowly (less than 1Mb/s) and ceased to work completely on the afternoon of my 2nd day there - the sink in the bathroom was a free standing bowl with a mixer tap high above it. The result of this design is that everything, the floor, the mirror, your belongings and you, get wet if you even run the tap very gently, due to the large area of splashes this creates 3. location - it's in Madrid - but only just. It's in a peripheral, suburban area with no bars, restaurants or cafes that would cater to tourists, and non-Spanish speakers. It's about 7.5km from the city centre, which is a quite expensive taxi ride. There's a Metro station near-ish, but I guess you probably aren't thinking about public transport if you're staying in a 5-star hotel. Then there are little things, which even in 3-star hotels, you really expect. No box of tissues in the bathroom - just a plastic packet of 4 tiny tissues. A tiny folding ironing board which is awkward to use, and has to go on the desk, meaning you need to rearrange all the stuff the desk is already loaded with. (There's a picture of this). And not quite so little things. The TV is about 26\". Small by modern standards and hard to see from the bed 10 ft away. There is no alarm clock or stereo or radio. Nothing to plug an MP3 player into. This is very unusual. The Hotel Arts, a 5-star place in Barcelona, has a Bang & Olufsen stereo and TV in every room. And every Hilton, Marriott, Crowne Plaza (etc.) that I stay at in the world always has a clock and a radio, and sometimes an MP3 speaker. Noise is also quite a problem, due to the hard wooden floors in the rooms. You can hear your next door and upstairs neighbours walking around, quite loudly, which isn't again what you expect in a 5-star hotel. Overall, the hotel is beautifully designed, and certain to be of interest to architects and architecture students. However, it's not practically usable by guests in my opinion, at least not as an expensive 5-star hotel, and in any case, it's location on the edge of the city near nothing in particular makes it fairly pointless. I can't see why it was built like this, here.

The girls at the front desk will check you in and them pop open a map of the city and give you some insider tips of where to go and what to see and how to get there. Very helpful. The quiet elevator ride to the rooms opens up to a very modern and classy hallway. Very European in decor and very modern. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. They have everything from different mood light settings to pillow menus. The king bed provides a perfect nights sleep, the flatsceen TV on the wall has sat channels from around the world to cover many of the main European languages.

The room was spacious, comfortable, clean, luxurious everything you expect in a 5-star hotel, well almost. The toilet seat in my room was wobbly and got wobblier as the days passed! I forgot to mention it to the reception but hoped the cleaning staff would notice and fix it which did not happen. Complimentary breakfast was served in a hall on the 30th floor with magnificent views of Madrid and neighbouring areas. This was a buffet service cooked and continental breakfast with a very wide and excellent choice of juices, fruits, cold meats, pastries, bread, cereals and hot food like eggs, sausages and bacon. However, the first day at breakfast was chaotic as the place was heaving with humanity. The waitressing staff on site were struggling to cope with trying to clear and lay tables and cutlery. There were no supervisory staff in the hall to regulate the numbers of guests pouring in. It was indeed a shambles; it was more a cattle market scene rather than breakfast room in a 5-star hotel! Apart from these blips my stay there was enjoyable. Just a note about transport in Madrid. They have a very extensive and excellent Metro system, which is very cheap, only \u20ac 1 for any trip. The trains are frequent, clean, well lighted, the stations clean and spacious not to mention talented resident buskers with South American bias. Sight-seeing trips on the open top buses especially the Madrid Vision route was interesting. Ask the reception for advice about good tapas eating places; stay clear off the obvious tourist traps.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNice design, but NOT a 5-star service AT ALL.

Downs, everything else: - The staff is ABSOLUTELY unhelpful. People in check-in/reception area didn't help me with my luggage even if the lobby was completely empty and they just were chatting!! I couldn't believe I was in a 5-star hotel. Also, nobody came with me to show me the room and ask if everything was correct. - The woman in the check-in was totally unfriendly, the only question she made was \"can I have your credit card!\". Her English was terrible. For my experience, this is common in Spain. I can accept it in a family hotel in a rural area but this is a 5-star business hotel in Madrid. - Location way far from the city center.
