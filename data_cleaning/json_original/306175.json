There's flat screen TV in each room. The bed was really comfy. The electronic safe was in the drawer and it is big - large enough to even hold my 15\" laptop and etc. My room has a view over the garden and the pool. The bathroom was great. It has a ceiling rain forest shower. The room temp was easily controlled by the thermostat - one for each room. I did use the gym. It was located at the back of the hotel - only about 5mins walk by the garden/waterfall area. It was reasonably well equipped with usual weights and cardio machines except there's no rowing machine. They have one water rowing machine which felt different from the usual rowing machine. I didn't use the pool. They also have a sauna/steam room and jacuzzi in the changing room.

The spacious lobby, the luxurious and comfortable rooms, the large pool surrounded by tropical gardens, the excellent gym, the great restaurants serving a thoughtful variety of regional and international cuisine, and the abundant food and beverages in the executive lounge are all world-class. And the Hyatt is an easy taxi ride to the airport and everywhere else in Singapore, steps from the entrance to the Orchard MRT station, and a short walk to all the shopping and eating that Orchard road has to offer. I have only one small complaint: all the restaurants and even the main bar/lounge (\"10 Scotts\") stop serving food at 11 pm, and the lounge closes at 11:30. I was told that something called the \"Martini Bar\" serves drinks but not food until 2 a.m., and there's also a noisy basement bar called BRIX whose customers all seem to be Western men of a certain age and much younger Asian women. Neither of these places would have been right for the late-night snack and glass of wine I sometimes like to have while checking/writing email. Many other hotels of comparable quality in the region have a reasonably quiet and dignified lounge area where you can get a snack as well as a drink until 1 a.m. or so, and many have coffee shops that are open until late or even 24 hours. But the only real reason I don't stay at the Hyatt more often is that, like other good hotels in Singapore, it's terribly expensive. Only the very rich and those who are lucky enough to work for very generous employers can afford the standard rates. If you are one of these people, or if you qualify for a corporate or government rate (still moderately expensive but somewhat less than the standard rates) or have a free night award from Hyatt, this is the place to stay in Singapore.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phuket, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cDecent Hotel but somethings could be better\u201d", "Author": "livinasia04", "ReviewID": "UR124662368", "Content": "as someone who has stayed with hyatt off and on, I can say honestly say the hotel has pros and cons and while the stay was acceptable i don't feel as their club member it was on the mark with its brand pros - location, really good food at there main restaurant, service was fantastic, nothing to small to handle and helpful.

A MUST TRY! 2/ Concierge: a special thanks to all of the staff but especially Gwen \u2026What a great associate and hotel should be proud to have such professional & dedicated employee Asked for info about a theme park in my last day in SG, she ended up arranging everything for me in few minutes \u2026You would say it's normal, it's her job???

It was a good hotel choice in the past, primarily because of its' ideal location (close to Orchard Road but shielded from the hustle and bustle as it's on Scotts). But nowadays, years after its' last renovation works, it is creaking at the seams and has become very aged.. I have been staying at this hotel for more than the last decade, so I know it well. It used to be pleasant, especially after the new garden wing was constructed. But that was many years ago.. Since then there has been limited refurbishment and the rooms/public areas are showing this distinctly. Nothing has been refreshed in the lobby/reception areas - from the marble floors to the concierge desk, everything looks and feels worn. Though there is a new tea room on the ground floor, most has stayed the same.. and from 15-20 years ago! And it's all starting to show. Only the pool, spa and gym have aged well but most other public zones are at best, retro. The rooms are the most disappointing due to the lack of refurbishment. The Grand King rooms in the new wing are particularly worn. Wooden floors are scratched, furniture is worn, and even the toilets smell quite bad. In my past experiences, the safes don't work properly and electrical sockets are so worn that you can't plug in your computer, etc. More recently, I decided to pay more and stay in the Grand Deluxe Kings to see if there is any improvement. These are similar to mini suites as they have a separate sitting room/office and were renovated after the Grand King rooms (yes, the similar categorization is confusing!). In spite of upgrading myself and paying around 20% more for the Grand Deluxe room, I was still disappointed and once again, the age of the hotel showed up clearly. The air conditioning in the bedroom area didn't work, the toilet flush button was stained around the edge, and even the alarm clock was an item from the last century, ticking away noisily! What was particularly disappointing was that internal windows were dirty, the pillows smelt and housekeeping failed to perform a turn-down service. So, perhaps it's not just the age of the building which disappoints but also management. Yet, I cannot blame the management for everything. I believe that the problems mainly lie in the age of this property, and the lack of investments into refurbishment (surprising as the owner is the Sultan of Brunei, who isn't short of cash!). The management, though young, seem to try their best to make up for what the building lacks.. But in reality, they can only do so much as the hotel is so worn that it is gagging for an overhaul! The Grand Hyatt Singapore is not the best option in the area as there are many other hotels which offer you a fresher stay. More importantly, it is a pricey option and the high cost (USD 300-400 a night for the most basic room) is not justified by the aged nature of this property. Stay here if location is your greatest consideration - but remember that there are a plethora of other newer/renovated 5 star hotels nearby (see my other report on the St Regis, for instance - cheaper especially if you prepay and book online).", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork", "Title": "\u201cSunday Brunch\u201d", "Author": "pannieCork", "ReviewID": "UR122624667", "Content": "5 people +5 month baby really enjoyed the all inclusive brunch. great variety of food .and no shortage of drink including Cocktails and Champagne", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MUMBAI", "Title": "\u201cGUEST UNFRIENDLY\u201d", "Author": "ANJUGOELA", "ReviewID": "UR122496808", "Content": "The location, off Orchard Road, is the only thing going for this hotel (besides the room).

Having stayed in various five star brands across the region, I must say that this one stood out. Travelling with friends, we dined at StraitsKitchen, 10 SCOTTS, Pete\u2019s Place and mezza9. StraitsKitchen is a hawker style restaurant with surprisingly authentic cuisine, I had one of the best Laksa\u2019s I have had in Singapore there. All the restaurants are very good and far above normal expectations for hotel dining, however my favourite would have to be mezza9. Predictably we had the Chilli crab from the crustacean bar and I struggle to remember a better meal, I certainly cannot remember a better chilli crab..and I have eaten a lot of chilli crab in my time. Which brings me to the service. The first day/night at this hotel I came down with a 24 hour bug of some description that I had picked up from my previous stop in Bali. I was unable to leave the room and became well acquainted with the amenities, which luckily are very well appointed. The staff were just fantastic. The Front Office called to check on me regularly, but not so regularly as to become annoying. The concierge headed to the chemist next door to purchase a range of items to assist with my predicament. Overall they made me feel very well cared for without impacting my need for privacy. The next day I was perfectly fine and heading for breakfast when I was surprised to speak with the housekeeper on my floor as she expressed her genuine concern for my wellbeing. I had the \u2018do not disturb\u2019 sign for the previous 24 hours and she had been very worried about me, checking with my friend if there was any way that she could assist.

Indeed I asked to sign my bill and have it allocated to my room in the expectation that this would not be allowed as the bar was not really part of the Hyatt - it is. The service in Brix is just appalling - think waiters and bar staff clad in black, slick pony tails and completely consumed with their appearance, looking cool and having fun. Dealing with customers comes last by a long chalk. Waiters are unbelievably rude. When I pointed out to a waiter that the service was poor and that he was rude he summoned two very menacing bouncers and held a flashlight in my face to identify me. I am quite sure if I had not pointed out that I was a hotel guest - something they checked before backing off - I would have been physically assaulted and removed from the premises for my complaint. A European manager, who looked about 15 and clearly was not able to control his staff, seemed too intimidated to do anything about it. Brix is also essentially a meat-market with wall-to-wall prostitutes aggressively soliciting clients. This is encouraged by the bar and waiting staff who act like pimps for the girls.

The lobby is vast but dark, with low ceilings: OK as a meeting point, not inviting to hang around. It is cool and quiet in comparison to the hustle and bustle of the street. The small reception counters, and a processing system on the slow side, result in long lines for check-in and check-out. The rooms are large but their layout is not ideal, with a small window and balcony in a corner making them slightly claustrophobic. Decent beds, decent equipment, one positive being the presence of a DVD player. No complaint about the restaurants and bars except that they too are rather unmemorable.

Consider the Club rooms if possible as its well worth the extras and the Grand Club Lounge is amongst the best of any hotel's executive club lounges in terms of decor, ambience, food and beverage selections. This Grand Club is ideal to unwind after a day long of shopping, business meetings or even hosting some friends. Check out the evening cocktail too. The room is spacious with a separate hall.

Check in was a breeze. Our bags were brought promptly, room is clean and smells fresh. Our room was 726 in the 'new' wing, but towards 10pm on the first night, while laying in bed after an exhausting day, my wife and I started to hear a rhythmic low bass thumping sound. It was annoying. At first I thought it was the room above us. Putting my ear to the window, I figured out it was the hotel's night club. To confirm, I jumped in the elevator to the lobby, and yep, same thumping beat. So, even on the 7th floor, we were experience that low annoying bass resonance. Must've been through the building's structural members or could have been transmitting via the ducting system. Stuck it out for 1 1/2 hrs thinking it'd go away, b/c we were still up and watching tv anyway. Well it didn't. So, around 11:45pm called the front desk to kindly investigate (again, I still wanted to believe it was the folks above us), so they mentioned they'd check out the 8th floor. About 8minutes later, there was a knock on the door and it was the night duty manager and an assistant. I was mildly surprised but even more surprised when he kindly asked if he could come in and experience for himself. Which is very good in my book, I'd rather him be there in person and ask for \"proof\" rather than try to convince someone over the phone who's detached and may not necessarily have your best interests in mind. Some people may be offended or put off by someone asking to, basically, \"prove it\" (which, I in no way took it that way, but rather very much welcomed it, and was more than happy to let him in the room at midnight and almost forgetting my wife was in bed), but I've soon realized, particularly in asia, that the more you yourself has a \"coke & a smile\" attitude, the more others are willing to accommodate, help, negotiate, or help fix your problem; if you have a gripe about something or anything, first outfit yourself with a \"coke and a smile\" then present your case. 9.9 times out of 10, you'll get yourself a \"coke and a smile\" treatment in return. If you the customer don't have this approach, you might as well take an aspirin for the headache to come. People'll shutdown on you quicker than a rolling blackout, AND with a grin...no smile. Anyway, so, we stood there in silence, lol & wife still hunkered down in bed, and listened for a good minute. Of course, it seemed like the hotel's club was having an intermission with their music playing or something like that while the DJ's figuring out something better to play or taking a break...you know. But, the manager did agree with us, and on the spot offered a couple options. He'd call back within a few minutes with a new room to move to or move first thing in the morning. Wife & I chose the morning. Between my wife & I, we decided we'd just tough it out and wear our airplane earmuffs for the night. However, no more than 5 minutes after he left, sure enough, the downstairs club came out of their \"intermission\" and resonance was worse than before. So, I called the front desk again and said we'd take up the offer to move now. They offered us the 20th floor, top floor, exec suite, corner room, and complimentary internet and exec club lounge access for remainder of our stay. Told em we'd be ready in 15 minutes. Well, lo' and behold, bellhop is there to transfer our bags and escort us to new room. Wasn't sure if it was our \"coke and a smile\" attitude or hyatt gold pass membership that assisted us in this matter, but it didn't make a difference. At the end of our stay, I realized Grand Hyatt Singapore's staff would have done their best and treated any other guest with the same respect, promptness, professionalism and sympathy, regardless of stature. New room was great, of course. Downstairs Mezza9 restaurant was reasonable, and actually surprising. At first I thought the dishes were overpriced, however, after receiving my rack of lamb, I was mistaken. 6 full, large chops. Plate was huge, lamb was a plenty. I was exepcting the normal 3 puny/petite chops some 5 star restaurants are getting all too familiar with serving nowadays. And when you order a glass of wine, it's a proper GLASS of wine. So, Mezza9 was worth it. However, due to the very convenient location of the hotel, we only ate inside that one time. Location location location. A hop, skip and a step to your left out of the front entrance and you're at the entrance to the metro service. Taxi's are readily available in the lobby. Concierge was helpful with providing maps, bus schedule/tours, or even which bus/metro to ride to make most of our time and with what we wanted to see. Probably 1/2 mile away by foot, great area for locals & tourists alike to enjoy some after work/happy hour drinks, tapas, meals, or whatever at a string of tavern, outdoor-like bars. Wife is pregnant so we didn't get to experience this. (Not to get off topic, but one day during the trip I'll never forget, she was adamant she wanted a turkey sandwich. We ended up walking all over place, and no turkey sandwich. So, if you want a turkey sandwich, goodluck. I forget where we ended up eating, but I'll never forget the turkey sandwich episode.) All in all, Grand Hyatt will be the first choice if/when we were to return to Singapore. Clean, comfy, great location, and genuinely friendly & professional staff. For the cost, which isn't unreasonable, the hotel's convenient location itself should be enough to convince you; pending, of course, the reason for your visit either business or vacation/sightseeing/shopping.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "Hardtopleaseofhk", "ReviewID": "UR118600423", "Content": "I have stayed here several times now and find the guest experience to be consistently good.

Hotel service is great and the food over at their in house restaurants (Mezza 9, Pete's place and Straits Kitchen) is pretty decent, although the prices can be a bit on the high side. However, just to give you an indication on how good the service is, on my last trip to the hotel, I dined at Mezza9 and just briefly mentioned to the waiter than the Tom Yam soup I ordered was a bit too spicy, without hesitating he offered to waived the charges for the soup. Which was really good, because waiters are willing to comp you on service that wasn't perfect (the menu does mention the soup is spicy and he still comped the meal). The Hotel really has high standards for it's service, the staff always greet you by name and the reception staff are the friendliest anywhere in the world.

The less expensive, newer rooms have a cool desing with two way closets, a drawer safe that will fit your laptop and artful touches. Pool area is very nice. Stayed in room in new building wish was terrific and in the older \"junior suite\" building, also fabulous! The breakfast buffet is SPLENDID, varied and abundant.

Its location is just off Orchard Road. The gym is really good, you get free bottled water there. In each corridor they have free fruit at the end of the passage also lounge chairs and tables to sit at and a phone if you wish to use it. The rooms were always cleaned early. The television had 48 channels so plenty to choose from to watch at night if your in. They have a cigar shop. There is also another big restaurant upstairs it looked lovely we did not eat there.

In the 2nd night, I returned to the Hotel around 8:30pm after a long day of work to drop off some personal stuffs before heading to dinner. When I entered the room, the smell in the room is very unpleasant, so I looked around and checked out where the smell came from. When I opened the tiolet door, I found out there's a piece of excrement(yes, it's a real excrement, not too sure it's human or dog only) on the floor. It's really shocked me and I called Housekeeping immediate after clam down. After hearing the story, the Hotel send a Supervisor and 1 general staff to come to my room. Then, I left for dinner. When I returned to the Hotel, I went to the Front Desk and looked for the Hotel Manager. The receptionist told me that I need to make appointment to speak to thier Manager. I told them that I don't mind saying it loud with all your hotel guests surrounding me, it's a complaint, and obviously won't be something nice and cool. I him what I found in my room, and the Receptionist is astonished and opened his mouth wide for 10 seconds.Then, an on-duty spervisor came over and offered to a room change. However, I told them that I'm checking out tomorrow morning, and I won't bother to change the room. So he offered me a free ride to the airport and helped me to go up and checked the room. When he returned, he tried to jog down some notes and explained to me the process for the car arrangement. Up to this moment, I'm happy with what Grand Hyatt has done.However, the next morning, when I was about to leave the room, I saw a blinking light on the phone, I dialed \"Concierge\" to check the message, because this's what the Supervisor told me last night about the procedure. When the Concerige picked up the phone and I disclosed my room # and asked for the message. The Conceirge said she didn't know what's the message and she's away from the terminal and asked me to call Operator. When I called Operator, they asked me to call Concierge to make the arrangment. I told the Operator that i just talked to the Concierge and she asked me to call Operator. Then, the Operator replied that she's just relaying the message, nother she can arrange,so I need to call Concierge. I think this's what I cannot afford is the poor and unprofessional service of a 5-star Hotel like Grand Hyatt.

From the moment we arrived, we felt that we were very much welcome. This was the first time that me & my wife traveled with our 2 yr. old boy - and we were quite surprised that he felt at home the moment he stepped in the room. Grand Hyatt is conveniently located on Scotts Rd. and is (literally) a few steps away from the Orchard Rd. MRT Station. If you're planning to go to any of Singapore's attractions (i.e. Zoo, Bird Park etc.) the hotel also serves as a pick-up point and a direct stop of the Singapore Attractions Express Bus. So, going around and about the city is not a problem. And, since the hotel is situated almost at Orchard Rd., one can go on a shopping spree as a lot of malls are around the vicinity. We stayed in a very spacious Junior Suite with 2 LCD TV's - a 42\" TV with DVD player in the living room and another 32\" TV in the bedroom, where all channels are in HD. We had complimentary wi-fi access, a spacious closet, and a very appealing toilet & bath with June Jacobs amenities. Simply nice! We tucked our nights away in a very comfortable king size bed. Light controls and Air-conditioning were not a problem, with the switches and temperature knob located conveniently by the side table. Since we were staying in a suite, we were given access to the Club Lounge (with kids' play area), where continental breakfast was served everyday and cocktails was served every night. Needless to say that Club access means free flowing drinks - ALL DAY. The lounge staff were so accommodating. Going to the pool was such a treat when one sees the nice tranquil water falls in the middle of the two towers. The pool was nice and had cabanas where you can sit back and relax.

The room was on the 20th and 21st floor. The hotel lift runs up to the 20th floor, so you can enter the suite from there into the living area, then walk up the internal staircase to the bedroom/bathroom/closet area, and out another door there onto the 21st floor, which takes you to the location of the club lounge. Service and food there were very efficient for breakfast, and also a nice place to come for tea/coffee and cookies/cakes during the day. The only negative during the stay was that the internet service was out for almost an entire day (from early morning to about 4pm) - they had no access from anywhere in the hotel. Was only an annoyance for us (on holiday), but could have been a real killer for anyone hosting a business meeting at the hotel. We came back to the room that evening to find a packet of biscotti and an apology card, which was a nice touch.

An buggy met us at the airbridge directly as we got off the plane, drove us through the airport to a private terminal at the airport, with its own passport control desk, then we waited in a lounge drinking tea until called to our car, with the suitcases magically already in the back, and drove out of their private airport exit and off to the hotel.

I traveled with my senior aged parents for general check up in Spore, my mom at her 67 was tired and upset since the room was not ready... (we booked a month in advance). But Hyatt led us to use the club lounge but then we found out it was not the club lounge but the meeting room across the lounge (what a joke), then after called on the reception staff they provided us with other spare room for us to lay down till 9.00 PM when our reserved room was ready. Well, this was not good start of the 1st night with Hyatt, but then they compensated us with this and that to express their apology. Well it worked and accepted the offers. It was their best to welcome us staying there and I appreciate how they handled us and respected my mom's condition who stayed there to see her doctor.

I stayed at the Hyatt a couple of times over the past 2-3 years for 2-3 nights respectively, mostly for leisure trips. I also used to live in Singapore at some point for 5 years. The Hyatt in Singapore is probably the 'Grandest' hotel in the City, at the busy intersection of Scotts and Orchard Road. The location is the strongest point of the Hyatt; for shopping fans, it is a 3 minute stroll to the latest and largest malls. For business, it depends on the location of your meetings; there are other hotels closer to the 2 or 3 areas in the city where most offices are located. The lobby is always bustling with activity, particularly towards the evenings; the restaurants are good and the Sunday Champagne brunch one of the best in the City. Overall design is nice, the gym solid and the pool area not bad. The rooms are very big and the bathroom spacious. However, the first major drawback is the quality or lack thereof of the interior; while the bathroom is nice though has limited towels and the bathtub is short, the bright wood of which everything in the main room, from the floor to the cupboards, desks, wall decoration etc is made of, is not very classy and quite run down. The bed is very good. My room had a view not worth mentioning into some old high rise condos whose inhabitants had a good view of my room interior. The phone and most items inside the room where a bit outdated, though the TV and programs where good. The second point of critique and for me the biggest drawback is the noise levels. Noise regularly woke my up early, coming from a) the outside, with the windows not very well noise-insulated; luckily, to this end, my room was towards the more quiet hotel backside; b) some form of renovation that must have been going on from about 7am somewhere above me, adding to the problem of lack of customer focus I will discuss next; c) noisy pipes ie someone flushing above your room resulting in a 1-2 minute soud in your bathroom; and d) lack of noise insulation at the door, which made you very much feel part of the conversation going on outside in the hallways while lying in your bed. Many of the louder conversations of this type appeared to be driven by staff walking by, which gets me to the 3rd point of critique Aside from the receptionist, the staff overall seemed very sloppy. General attitude was a chatty, careless unfocusedness, people were very hard to understand particularly on the phone and training seemed not up to scratch. This is surprising in one of the world\u2019s premiere hotel chains in a well-educated wealthy country. Room service was expensive and actually pretty shocking. Overall, these negatives gave me the feeling that I am not getting what I pay for (given the place is not cheap) and apart from the hustling and bustling feel in the lobby and the size of the room there is limited 'wow' factor here. Next time I'll try the Marriott which is just next door, and for business the Conrad or the Ritz.

In line with Andaz Wall Street and Sofitel Bangkok. Granted it is not cheap, although I am using Gold Points, it is lots of points, but I think it is worth it (my wife and kids also agree with me). The goods: 1. We are staying in the Club Room, so it comes with daily breakfast and evening 'snack' (not quite full dinner but can get you full anyway). The floor is only accessible to guest so I guess it is pretty secure and quite. Although the lobby can be very crowded. 2. The room is huge and extremely clean, and with a separate small area for work. Wireless connection is amazing. The bathroom is even more wow. The sheets are really soft, and the towels are THICK and soft. My kids will complain if we came back to the hotel after 19:00 because they will feel they do not have enough 'quality' time in the room. 3. The service is great. I am not sure if it is because of the fact that we are staying at the club floor, but no complains from me. 4. The food is also OK, the breakfast and the evening snack. 5. The pool is rather small, although the layout is great if you have kids. There is a section for kids, where you can watch them all the time while you are swimming. 6. Location: Orchard Road, the best area in Singapore for Tourist. And about 100 meters from the entrance to Orchard MRT or 50 meters from Bus stops. Can't ask for anything better. The only drawback of the location is that getting a taxi will cost you an additional $3 or 5$ because it is located ion CBD. The bads: 1. With the points we are using I would kind of expect that the 2 twin beds are not really a twin but rather a 'full' or 'queen' size, but unfortunately they are just twin beds. I am travelling with 2 young kids, so it is quite challenging to arrange. 2. Not sure if I should complain about this or not, but I am just trying to do my part for the environment by not washing my towel every day. The towels here are really thick. I came back at 13:00, the room is already made up. I took a quick shower and went out. I came back again around 17:00 and the towels are already being replaced with new ones.

The entrance is spare, immaculate, and feels uncrowded and exclusive despite being in the heart of the city. On the right are the check-in staff; there were at least 4 staff on hand and there was no line; they were very quick to retrieve my booking, and because I was checking in in the morning, relieved me of my bags right there and promised to bring them up to my room when it was ready. The conference facilities are professionally managed, considering the large number of people in attendance the buffet lunches were actually very good, catering also for the Indian delegates (some of whom were vegetarians). The room was very large for central Singapore, and turned a potentially odd layout into a bonus, with a separate area for a desk overlooking a residential building.

In a competitive environment this Hyatt is priced at the top end of the range for hotels in Singapore competing against some of the big chain names and new hotels.

The only downside to the room was that if the bathroom door was left open at night, you could hear the plumbing everytime someone flushed the toilet or took a shower. This was easily rectified by closing the door Service I experienced some poor service issues during my stay but on complaining to the duty manager I was pleased to see that my concerns were quickly and effectively dealt with. I feel confident that the management does listen to its guests especially when issues arise. Downside - no free wifi Room service I ordered room service and I was suprised at the generous size of the portion. It took about 35 minutes to get to me at 11pm at night. Club lounge Very basic facilities. Breakfast was a huge dissapointment - it consisted of chicken sausage, scrambled egg, tomatoes, cereals and breads. That's it. No local foods, very limited hot food, not even close to what's on offer downstairs in the main restaurant. Bell captain The issue I had was with the bell captain / front door staff. When staying in a high-end property you at least expect someone to be there to help with your luggage and open the door. This was not the case on arrival. Additionally, on leaving the hotel to the airport, the person in charge of the taxi queue (who was there this time) quickly shuffled us to the side and plonked us into a waiting taxi (by-passing the normal queue). I was suspcious at this and asked whether we were getting into a normal taxi.. his response was yes. The reality was that it was a more expensive metered taxi (there are apparently two grades in singapore), while I suspected this and don't mind paying the extra 50% to the airport for a slightly nicer car, I was very very disappointed to be deliberately mis-led by the hotel employee.

I was given a Grand King room on a non-smoking floor. Unlike lesser branded hotels like Renaissance, the non-smoking room/floor, was truly a non-smoking one. The lift lobby was bright and cheery with chairs and two apple platters in the lobby. The room itself came with a King sized bed, study table, large panel mounted LCD TV with DVD player, a very spacious bathroom. Everything was impeccably clean, well designed and unlike other hotel chains, they were generous with the quality and quantity of towels and toiletries. What I liked about the room design was its clean lined beech wood deco, good lighting as well as the fact that they built in the usual tea making counter and the safe box into drawers and cabinets. Very classy, even if it took a call to guest services to locate these things. Another thoughtful feature of the room was the double sided access to the wardrobe. Meaning, one could access clothes from the wardrobe from the bedroom itself and from the inside of the bathroom. Also, I realised that the Hyatt also catered to the health conscious guest by providing a yoga mat in the cupboard as well as provided a DVD of a yoga session. I didn't use this because there was a super 5 star luxury spa and gym in-house that was available to hotel guests. Called the Damai Spa, it housed a luxury five star spa (treatments start from $150 onwards), a well equipped gym with the latest TechnoGym branded equipment including 2 top of the range Kinesis machines which used air pressure instead of weight blocks. In line with the Hyatt experience, the Damai spa staff were professional and very helpful at the reception, with the personal distribution of bottled water and an exercise towel, as well as the provision of any other amenity you would need. To be honest, apart from the toilet and wash basin, I didn't take a shower or a bath in my room as the facilities at the Damai Spa was so much better. True, it was basically a luxury locker and changing room. However, after each gym workout, the appeal of relaxing in the hot and cold plunge pools and then a shower in the more spacious shower cubicles was just too enticing. Furthermore, the amenities provided at the locker room was much better than in the room. Plus, I didn't have to bring anything else except for a change of clothes and my room key. Seriously, everything else was provided for - lotions, toothbrushes, mouth wash, face moisturisers, etc. As the pool, its a chill out pool at best and not really meant for a proper swim. I tried doing that but I found myself doing more turns than actual distance. Based on the number of sun beds around the pool and the pavillions, I really felt that it was a feature pool more than anything else. I also enjoyed lying on the loungers that they placed in the water. Even if you weren't dressed in bathers but in a robe or your usual outfit, it was nice to waddle into the ankle deep section to get to the chair with a magazine. As usual, the F&B outlets were very good. During the stay, I dined at Pete's Place for their buffet lunch (about $28+++) which served one of the most satisfying salads and tiramisu; Mezzanine for dinner (about $100 per person without drinks); and Straits Kitchen for an American breakfast ($35+++ per person). Ah, the breakfast was really satisfying and could count among the best breakfasts amongst hotels in terms of quality, range and service. There was the usual a la minute cooking stations for eggs, pancakes/ waffles, but they also had a good Indian breakfast section with crispy and tasty rotis, tosai, and accompanying curries and chutneys. Also at the same station was a good Nasi Lemak with rich and tasty coconut rice and the usual condiments. I dare say, that the Straits Kitchen brought together the best in class of of all the local and international breakfast foods (sans Japanese). I also enjoyed the wide range of fresh juices (grapefruit, orange, carrot, etc) and free flow of local teas and coffees, as well as the usual cuppa. I was a little disappointed with the Mezzanine for serving me a tasty but cold tenderloin steak in my Meat Platter. Also, while waiting for my food, I got bitten by the mosquito - twice and informed the staff that I wanted a repellent, or coil, or just something for my bites. Unfortunately, this is where the impeccable service lapsed. I was firstly informed that the hotel didn't have any mosquito salve, or repellent. But they offered to go to the nearest pharmacy to pick one for me (my expectation was that they would have picked it up themselve instead of asking me). Second, I had to give them a solution to my problem by asking for a natural repellent which I knew they would carry in their kitchen - fresh lemongrass. When I told them that the lemongrass would help, the staff looked at me in disbelief (okay, she wasn't local, nor Asian, so I could imagine her surprise). I got my lemongrass anyway and the mozzie problem went away. Basically, if you stay at the Grand Hyatt and want to dine at their popular Mezzanine or Straits Kitchen, please be warned that without prior reservations (at least 36 hours in advance), your chances of getting a table at the time you want, or a table at all, is very slim.

The bang and olufsen tv's, the smart decor, the lobby, straits kitchen, everything. I come and stay in the Hyatt often, as I am from Jakarta. My very first stay in the Hyatt was when I was 11, and I have stayed here close to 10 to 11 times already. Now, when I stayed here again after all these years, I was thoroughly surprised that the 'magic' was gone. There was no wow factor. The grand deluxe room which from memory was huge (it was 56m2), was nowhere near huge. The B&O tv's that was amazing 6 years ago, was sadly outdated. Very small tv's (and non-flat) for 2010!! The wonderful restaurants (straits kitchen, mezza9) haven't changed their menu in 6 years! And Pete's place, Pete's place was AWFUL. Hands down the WORST italian restaurant I ever tried and I live in Jakarta, Indonesia. We stayed at the club room and the snacks in the club lounge was ok, I gave it a 7. The club lounge itself was nice, big with nice staff. I'm not into wine and sweets but the dessert selection is awesome. Ishak the feminine 'manager' is talkative, almost annoying but not. Borderline. You get free wifi at the lounge but not if you are staying in regular rooms. And this is a business hotel. You get meeting rooms if you are staying in Club floors (I think). Room service was ok, quite a selection and the hotel staff are a kind, attentive bunch. May the reception lady messed up our reservations, our rooms (we booked 4) were not ready until 2 hours later. Not all of them, only 2 out of 4. She wasn't that great handling our check-in and left us (switched to a gentlemen) near the end but to be fair the hotel was super crowded that day. Overall this is nowhere near a bad hotel, probably the best in Orchard road but from a top hotel back in the day, it has downgraded itself to a 3.5 out of 5.

From the winning smile of the attendant who opens the door to your taxi as you arrive from the airport, to the quiet assurance from the Concierge that you are indeed \"recognised\" and your special needs (and I have several!) will be catered to, you immediately feel at ease. The Grand Deluxe rooms, in the Grand Wing, are actually junior suites, with separate living and sleeping areas, partitioned by sliding doors. They are furnished in a simple modern style, perhaps a shade too spartan for some people but they are comfortable and homely....and I like it. However, the furnishings are now showing their age! Air-conditioning too seems to have a problem: when the thermostat stops the cooling action, the air-flow stops completely! So the first thing one has to do is ask Maintenance to disable the thermostat....and regulate the temperature on your own, by switching off the unit in one room at a time in the suite. However, the standard of house-keeping is superb , the sweet ladies who come to clean the room and replenish the amenities, very efficient yet courteous in a charming old-world way. Restaurants: cutting-edge world cuisine in \"Mezza 9\" coupled with a jaw-dropping wine and champagne list; good old-fashioned Italian comfort-food in \"Pete's Place\" and interesting sandwiches and salads at the Poolside....though they need to know that a Margarita is NOT always served frozen!! Speaking of which, the pool and spa have recently been renovated and are truly a haven of relaxation, complete with a lovely garden and waterfall. Especially incredible in the middle of the bustling Scotts/Orchard Road area, which is the location of choice in the city. I would like to end this long-overdue review by coming full circle to the Concierge-staff, who are probably among the most efficient and hard-working I have ever come across. Being the kind of shopper who prefers not to walk around, they were amazingly helpful in procuring whatever items I needed from nearby stores; and managing deliveries of items pre-ordered by me, all the way up to my room.

The hotel clearly caters to business travelers and has all amenities that a business traveler might need. However, children are as a rule ignored by the hotel at best. We always stayed at the Grand wing in club rooms. Even though it costs extra, it is well worth the money. The food at the lounge is fabulous: the continental breakfast besides usual staples includes smoked salmon, cheese platter, fresh berries and fruit (\"regular\" and exotic variety), cold cooked muesli, etc, etc. The lounge stays open all day with tea/coffee, soft drinks, fruit, nuts and cakes. The evening cocktail hour includes sushi bar, small sandwiches, vegetables, cheese platter and fruit, and deserts (\"western\" and always unusual local variety) and an adequate selection of wines and other alcoholic beverages. The lounge staff varies from professional to snobby, but all of them completely ignore children. High chairs are available, but never visible and never volunteered. Our daughter practically grew up in front of the hotel's staff first staying at the hotel when she was less than 2 years old until age 9. The lounge personal never knew her name and never bothered to ask. Only hotel maids kept commenting on how she grew. Also, club level has its own reception and concierge. We found them totally unhelpful and unprofessional. There was a number of times when we were told \"no\" to a request at the club reception, only to be told \"no problem\" by regular reception in the lobby. From then on we only used regular reception and concierge and always got excellent service. The rooms are recently renovated with comfortable beds, glass top desks and leather sofas. Bathrooms have \"sunflower\" shower heads and removable massage shower heads and deep bathtubs. Be ware of a very shallow glass sink that overflows quickly. One of the most excellent features of the hotel is its pool. It is surrounded by lush tropical gardens, has a huge waterfall and a meandering creek, comfortable teak chairs and tables. When one is by the pool area, it feels like a topical island vacation, it's hard to believe that you are actually in the most central, busiest area of Singapore. To sum it all up, it's an excellent hotel with premium location.

I'll talk about the rooms first - Club Deluxe King - at 54 sqM, the room feels bigger than it is, with a nice separate working living room from the bedroom and bathroom. It was spanking clean and very well maintained, including the small minor things like bathroom tiles. Nothing to fault on cleaniness, comfort, and style. The bed was big enough for 3pax actually. Grand Duplex Suite - the 128 sqM suite is divided into 2 floors, with the living, meeting, and kitchen areas below and the bedroom, master bathroom, and separate make up area on top. Similarly spanking clean with ultimate comfort in mind. But it comes with an extremely narrow staircase which only makes for 1 way traffic. Grand Club Lounge - Only accessible via a stairway from the 20 floor and was a much bigger area than I expected. It was quite empty most of the time, and the bites served during the evening was not too bad, although I think the Club Lounge at Conrad Singapore serves better food. Service was okay, although I felt the staff tended to attend to non-Chinese more. Service - I was abit let down by the service throughout the stay as I thought well, its Hyatt. When I arrived, my taxi was packed with luggages and wedding stuff but no one came forward to help me with the things; only 1 doorman approached, took the stuff only to place them on the floor beside the departing taxi. ???!!!. I ended up lugging all the things from thedriveway to the hotel lobby myself. The same thing happened when we returned to the hotel the 2nd night, at almost 2am. We had numerous packs of things with us, including one huge wedding gift but no one came forward. I had to gesture them to bring a trolley, then 1 staff slowly strolled out with no trolley in hand. During the 2nd day, we were running out for the wedding proper at 3pm and because we knew we would be back very late, we called for an extra bed to be put in while we're gone so the extra guest can rest immediately after we return without having to wait. At 2am, we opened the door, and no extra bed. We called again to ask for it, then after 15mins, 2 staff rang my door, and I thought oh good, the bed's here. Nope. I opened the door only to have them ask me what was it I needed. I couldnt believe it. I told them about the bed, and just had to call to scream at the concierge because I was in absolutely no mood to be nice at 2am. Something else very irritating to me happened on the 3rd morning too. We were moving loads of the wedding stuff from the deluxe to the suite coz it was all on the same floor, just on different ends of the floor. My siser's mother in law is Causasian and was walking in front of me, both of us struggling with as much stuff on our hands. One senior staff saw us, and smiled politely to her and asked if he can help her with the things, which she declined. Then, he took a look at me then turned away without even mustering a smile, I caught more of a disdain than anything. It was very iritating to have hotel staff practice blantant discrimination like this but I was in a hurry to finish moving our staff. Didnt have time to try the room service, pool, gym but I'm sure they are quite nice.

The good points are as follows: Room: - Bed is very, very comfortable - It is chic, modern and well designed - It has really good tv, radio and speaker facilities - lots of desk space for business and stuff Bathroom: - Nice marble decor - BIG bath - Speakers feed through, so you can sing a bit in the shower, or on the throne!

Arrived at the hotel and was checked in and to my room in less than five minutes. Friendly staff and warm greetings. Room: Stayed in a deluxe room, King sized bed, modern decor. Huge bathroom. Maid service 2X daily and towels were constantly restocked. Very comfortable bed. Particularly liked the light controls mounted next to the bed as well as the overhead reading lights and night lights activated by the bed-side controlls. Large desk and work area. No problems with internet service. Main Restaurant (Straits Kitchen): I've been all over Asia in the last 10 years and the Straits Kitchen is by far the best hotel buffet / general restaurant that I've come across. 4-5 main kitchen stations serving western, Chinese, Singaporian, and Indian food styles. They have a huge juice making station that also does a great pulled tea. Then there is a continential breakfast area as well serving fresh fruit, cereals, breads, etc. Then in the evenings they serve one AWESOME set of food at the dinner buffet. Hard to stay at this hotel and not gain 5 lbs per week. Pool / Fitness area: The Damai pool and spa area are great. Reminds me of staying in Hawaii with the set-up, plants, and overall atomsphere. They have 2-3 cabannas and a great pool-side restaurant called Oasis Cafe which I ate at several times. They have a happy hour at the pool side bar offering 50% off drinks from 4-6 PM. The fitness center is great with 4-6 bikes, 4 eliptors and 4-5 treatmills as well as a dozen weight machine stations on top of several free weight sessions. The locker rooms have private showers, a meditation room, wet sauna, dry sauna and hot & cool pools. Hours are 6 AM to 10 PM. Location: The location is great. The hotel sits about one block noth of Orchard Ln on Scotts Rd and about 100 yards or so from the American Club. The bus stop is right at the intersection of Orchard and Scott and for $14 SGD you can get an all-day bus pass that stops at ~20 tourist destinations on the island.

The bathroom is a typical \"four-point\" bathroom one expects of a full service hotel with a bathtub, shower, separate toilet, sink etc and plenty of room within, My particular room had an annoying malfunction of the closet light that would turn on automatically with the slightest movement at night as the door would not press the switch shut upon being closed. The other \"negative\" is the corridor noise - if any guest checks out at night as often happens in such hotels, the noise seeps into your room and if you're a light sleeper it can be a problem.

Our last stay before this one was 3 years ago and at that time, we were not very impressed,espacially the service was not up to standard.. As the location of the hotel is excellent, we decided to give it go this year and we were so glad we did. We booked a room (Junior suite) in the older (grand) wing, with access to the Club Lounge, with free continental breakfast in the morning; free coffee, tea and soft drinks during the daytime and free cocktails and snacks from 6-8 pm. Our stay was 5 nights. Our arrival at the hotel couldn't be more welcoming. I was greeted by one of the concierges at the entrance. Check-in was done in the room. Even our preference for the beds (no duvets) had been remembered, without me having to ask for it before arrival. Amazing! The same goes for our preference in newspapers. Not often do you see such a well kept guest history record! The room hasn't been changed or updated over the past few years and some people might find it a bit outdated, but it certainly has a charm: Not too posh and opulent; everything you need (including two flatscreen televisions) and a great and big bathroom with all the amenities you could wish for. The view was great: Overlooking Scotts Road. There is a lot of construction going on around the hotel, so I was fortunate to have a room with a view. Staff, concierges, housekeeping (\"guestrelations\" as they call themselves) were outstanding and extremely friendly and professional. At the Club Lounge, every waiter and concierge called us by our last name from the beginning. Impressive. Service at the Club Lounge doesn't come better than this: Very attentive, catering to your every need, helpful in every way. It felt like coming home, every time we came up to the Club lounge. Housekeeping twice a day, of course. The hotel has a few wonderful restaurants: Strait's Kitchen for the amazing buffet; Pete's Place for the Italian touch and Mezza9 with a great variety of dishes from all over the world. Everywhere, the service was outstanding. As said, the location of the hotel can't be beaten: Corner of Scott's and Orchard (where it all happens..). The subway is around the corner and so is the latest luxury shopping center, ION: All the major luxury brands have their flagship store at the ION. The pool has undergone major reconstruction and is absolutely great with big sun loungers. There is also a restaurant with all day -al fresco- dining. The new Spa is absolutely worth a visit. The hotel may be a little older and less posh and opulent than other, recently opened hotels, but it has a quiet, sophisticated feeling and is an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Singapore. It has the 5 star touch and feeling.I visited the nearby Four Seasons and the St. Regis: And espacially the latter made a rather \"stuffy\" impression with respect to the opulant lobby with its huge chandeliers. chandeliers. The Grand Hyatt is absolutely highly recommended. Consider a stay in a \"Club\" room (with Club Floor access). Service is second to none. Breakfast in the morning is very good: great choice; but beware: No eggs, only Continental. The snacks in the evening are to die for: So many choices and the taste is exquisite. Free internet on the Club Level: It's a WiFi zone or you can make free use of one of their computers.

Last year we stayed for about a week. This year it was 11 days. Both my husband and I enjoyed every minute of our stay at the Grand Hyatt Singapore. We arrived at about 1.30am Tuesday morning, tired and foggy after traveling for almost 24 hrs. Upon arriving at the hotel, one of the staff on duty helped us with our bags, welcomed us back and greeted us by our family name. My husband was astonished and kept asking me how they knew our name. It is still a mystery to me. We did not have our name written on our bags anywhere. So I guess, it is a Hyatt trade secret. :-) Check in was very easy and quick. Within minutes we were on our way to our room. We never missed our breakfast at the Straits Kitchen. We saw some familiar faces among wait staff who actually remembered us from last year. Breakfast was wonderful... we never got tired of the food. I even made dinner reservation for my family at the Straits Kitchen. In one day we had two meals at the Straits Kitchen! My older family members were treated very kindly and with respect. The housekeeping staff were polite, discreet and efficient without being overbearing. I am very impressed as usually most hotels don't really put a lot of effort into training their housekeeping team in customer relations. Everyone from the front desk to the staff at the hotel door were attentive and efficient without trying too hard. I have stayed at the Four Seasons in Singapore and while the service there is as excellent, Grand Hyatt got my vote for being a more welcoming hotel. There is a certain warmth as you enter the hotel. No stuffiness of a 5 star luxury hotel that you may expect at other places.The staff work well together, there is a certain zen like calmness among the staff... everything seemed to 'gel' in this hotel. We received a gift from the assistant manager, hazelnut biscotti to go with our coffee in the morning when we came back to our room. That was a nice touch. On our last day Oct 9th 7am, we woke up late and almost missed our flight if not for the concierge who checked us out quickly as the front desk were busy with other guests. I wished I remembered the name of the staff member who was on duty but I was in such a hurry to leave. Also thanks to the bellhop who helped us with our six pieces of luggage.

Unlucky for us, it was raining when we wanted to go for a swim, a minus point was the pool was adjacent to Oasis Restaurant and there were patrons sitting next to the pool without any barrier in between, it would felt weird going swimming knowing within less than 1 metres, people could be staring at you. But the DAMAI (its fitness centre and spa) which was quite recently revamped looked great; we would try the spa treatment next time.

I travel quite frequently to Singapore but this was my first time at the hotel. What really disgusted me was their really painful check in process. Somehow the check-in staff took almost 10 minutes per pax for check in, which is shoddy by any standards. Having waited for more than 20 minutes, I finally got my turn. Having completed check-in, I was left all to myself to find my lift (least expected in a 5-star hotel). What made things worse was that they have apparently added some rooms to the hotel recently, but with different access points. So I spotted a lift and landed up on 6th floor looking for room 660 while the floor plan showed room nos. only up to 645 or so. After taking a round of the complete floor and also feeling disgusted, I called up reception and they told me I had taken the wrong lift! Apparently my lift was located in some obscure corner of the hotel and there was no one to guide me there. There weren't even any directions to help a first-timer to the hotel. Finally, I came to the reception and blasted the staff for not letting me know about the lift. They started apologizing and one of the staff members at the check-in counter left his seat in a flash to guide me to my room, much to the anguish of the person who was being checked in at that point of time. Rooms though small, are decent, beds are comfortable. But view of the room I got was really bad as my room window was pointed towards a street and residential apartment. The area surrounding the hotel is definitely good, and is well suited for those looking for some quality shopping and cool nightlife in the Orchard road area.

What i liked 1) The breakfast - i\"m not a fan of huge breakfasts - Im ok with lesser variety but all of it can be high quality - however the variety and the quality at the GH was very high. We were a family of 4 with friends and breakfast was a leisurely affair where 8 individuals(including kids) had choices of what we could eat and because of the variety in offer we could relax on the breakfast table and move onto our next dish that we selected. Truly - the kind of breakfast you want when you\"re on holiday. 2) The Swimming Pool - was very nice - the look and design made us feel that we were on a holiday - we went swimming after dinner at 9:30 pm once and that was just awesome!! 3) The Location - if you're going to be on orchard road and look forward to hitting the malls then down you go and there you are right next to them. What I didn't like The rooms - were maybe a little dated as the decor and the upkeep looked like the rooms were a little older - maybe renovated 4 - 5 years ago - nothing bad as such but gave the feel of an older room. What I loved - was the personalized service and the great training of the staff at the GH - all the staff were a pleasure to interact with and they were very outgoing and made us feel welcome all the time. This shows the great effort the GH puts in training of its people and I think its necessary to recognise the same as its not an accident but a lot of hard work!!

The Grand rooms are 55 square metre suites, but despite a refurbishment 3-4 years ago, the accommodation looks tired. Carpets looked and felt dirty, and the the much-touted Bang & Olufsen televisions produced poor sound. The Grand rooms are good value for the amount of space you get, but they do not feel luxurious or cosy, in my humble opinion. Hanging space is quite limited. Toiletries need to be of a higher quality and at least of L'Occitane or Molton Brown standard - this is a Grand Hyatt after all, and the shampoo and conditioner smelt and felt like dishwashing detergent. Biggest disappointment of all was the Club lounge on the 20th floor, whose breakfast spread was the poorest I had ever seen at any Hyatt or chain-hotel's Club/Exec floor. When I brought this to the manager's attention, he admitted that space constraints prevented them from putting out a larger spread, but I suspect it's cost-related. There was plenty of space in the lounge where additional platters or chafing dishes could have been installed. Loved the new Damai Spa - amazing treatment rooms, designed around Japanese Zen gardens and bubbling streams. It was so tranquil that I fell asleep, helped by the hands of my massage therapist. The gym was pretty well equipped too. Pool area nice and tropical, but felt very exposed, being surrounded by buildings on all sides. I felt so vulnerable in my bathing shorts!

Three hours later, around 3 AM, they must have finally gotten around to doing something about it, as the noise subsided, and the \"family\", (remarkable in having so many young girls with a nearly identical preference for skimpy clothing, high heels and excess make-up), finally stopped their traffic in and out of the hotel room. Later conversations with workers in the hotel yielded the real data: it is not at all uncommon for the hotel to allow parties in rooms designated for sleeping, even if the room winds up trashed. Apparently, money talks. Since I don't know the specifics of the franchise business model for the Hyatt in Singapore, I can't say whom the fault for the questionable policy of allowing parties in hotel rooms next to those used for sleeping lies with: the hotel manager, the franchise owner, or the Hyatt company themselves. But I do know if you are expecting a quiet nights sleep, or a relatively smoke free room in this hotel, buyer beware.", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hong kong", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "kthongkong", "ReviewID": "UR19901019", "Content": "My previous stay at the Grand Hyatt Singapore was very good and based on this I decided to stay again during my last business trip. Surprisingly I was disappointed. Check in was slow, to their credit they were quite busy, but when it came to my turn a woman who had not been waiting rushed up to the desk and was helped first. Not a big deal but after being made to wait I felt it could have been handled better. Once I got my room key I was really surprised by the size of the room, I now think I must have been upgraded during my last stay because there was no comparison in room size. While efficient and clean the room was very small, and the bathroom even smaller. There was only a shower, the toilet crammed between that and the tiny sink. This is compared with my last stay where the room was very spacious. Overall the rooms are kept very clean but are showing their age and need to be refreshed. The rate paid was certainly not worth the room when there are so many other options in Singapore. We ate at the Straights Kitchen the first night which is a unique take on the standard hotel buffet. I'm not a buffet person but the various areas all featuring a different Singaporean cuisine (Malay, Chinese, Indeian etc) was very well done. The hotel bar was also very pleasant and the service was great. The hotel also has a night club in the basement that seemed to be a prime pick up spot and prositute hang out, we left after seeing it. We saw quite a few guests taking women up to their rooms which was not really meshing with the image of a 5 star hotel. All in all not a terrible stay, but it could be so much better.

I visit Singapore regularly and I usually stay at the Marina or City Hall district. I must say I prefer this area to Scotts Road which is too frenetic for me.

Check-in is always crisp, even at 1am. I\u2019ve stayed in both the Grand Wing and the Terraces Wing. Grand Wing is all two-room (living room/bedroom) Grand Rooms, which are similar to the Dusit Thani in Bangkok, except very, very clean/modern. Lot of blonde wood and stainless steel. This trip was in Terraces Wing, which is regular single rooms. The room has a large wall-mounted LG flatscreen (I think the Grand Wing rooms are Bang & Olufsen). Bed is in the new Hyatt bedding, which is really nice. Hardwood floors with carpet, marble in the desk area by the window and the bathroom. Desk area is spacious, and is tucked in by the window, with a very nice array of power and plugs and stuff, and large desk surface. Bathroom has separate tub/shower, and has generic toiletries. The shower has a large \u201crain\u201d style showerhead in the ceiling. Very clean. The Club lounge in Terraces Wing is not as large as the one in the Grand Wing, but the folks there were just as friendly, helpful and crisp as over there. This is one place where the Hyatt stands-out\u2026 their people are really well-trained. Breakfast has a very broad spread, and eggs can be cooked to order. Evenings they have drinks and light munchies. Concierge services were well executed\u2026 I needed help with ground transit in both KL and Bangkok, and they arranged both for me within minutes. Ate at Pete\u2019s Place, an Italian restaurant in the basement; very good, and having an Italian waiter (!) made choosing something different great fun. Have eaten before in Mezza9, and the food was good. Straits Kitchen, their main dining room, is not only an outstanding place compared to other Hyatts, but one of the better places in Singapore. I\u2019ve taken employees and guests here, and it never ceases to impress them. The location here is a 50:50 proposition. The good news is that it sits at the intersection of Scotts and Orchard, in the middle of some of the best shopping anywhere in the world. Marriott next door, Sheraton Towers down the street, Hilton and Hard Rock around the corner. If you\u2019re not here for shopping, though, it is NOT in either of the business districts. It does sit within 200 feet of the Orchard Road MRT station, which is a quick, clean and safe subway shot to either downtown, Raffles City, or Bugis areas. Taxi rank is as good as any in Singapore. Once the new circle line is completed to Suntec, it\u2019ll be helpful. I stay here because it's a terrific hotel, and when downtown/Suntec/Marina hotel rates get outrageous (more and more common), this is a reasonably priced refuge.

I was very happy with the accomodations. Here are my thoughts Decor: This has a fung shway look and feel. For those that complained about the seating in the lobby, there are some by the elevators and near the check in desk. It has a minimalist feel when you first enter, but there is more once you enter the heart of the hotel. Elevators: You have to have your key each time you use the elevator. There is a slot that you insert your key in, then press the floor. You can only go to your floor. This keeps people from wandering the floors that are not staying there. (This is singapore where some things are legal that are not in the states) Work out Facilities: Very nice. They do not open until 6:00 am. On the 4th floor. You can't access the 4th floor until then unless you stay on the 4th floor. It is challenging finding it. Ask for directions! Pool: see pics, large towells provided. Restaurant by the pool as well if you wish to eat outside. Breakfast: Outstanding!! If you can afford it, it is worth it. If you request it upon check to be included in the price of your room, you get a $5 discount per day. If you purchase ad hoc, you pay much more. If you are leaving early in the morning, you can order room service in lieu of waiting for Straits to open if you get the breakfast with your room. Room: Excellent. Put your room key in the slot by the lights right when you enter. Push down all the way. This enables the lights. I had 544 and had a view of Scott Street. Taxis: If you leave 7-7:45, there is not a long line for the taxis. By 8:00 the line is long. If you want to shorten your trip back to the hotel, since they have one way streets, you can tell them it is ok to drop you off across the street in front of the Galleria. There is a close walk you can take over Scott street back to the hotel. This cuts off 5-8 minutes when you come from the East side of town. Money Exchange: They do have that at the hotel. There is a place next door in Far East Plaza that gives a better rate. There are numerous place in the shopping areas to change money. We ate at the restaurants in the basement.

I only rated it as 4 here because those two let it down. I stayed in a Club King - and it is an excellent room. The windows are on the corner but used cleverly to create a working space that's effective. The photo on the web site is exactly how it looks in the flesh. Comfortable and very well equipped, light wood tones. The check is in smooth and the entry to the hotel uses a clever use of glass and lights because for the ground floor resaturant and bar there is virtually no natural light. THe feeling is spacious, chic and very modern. However, whilst the club lounge hasa good range of drinks on tap, breakfast is limited somewhat. More to the point despite being on the higher floors it is darker than some nightclubs. Little natural light and dark wood on the walls makes it feel small. There are better club lounges than this in Asia, including the Plaza and Conrad's in Singapore if that's what you look for. As for location, it depends greatly on what you want. A couple can happily shop in the area and lots of eating places. However, the cross the road from the hotel and walk toward the THai Embassy and the atmosphere changes - Singapore's Orchard towers and strreetwalkers of all genders inhabit that part after dark.

Taxis are abundant, giving you easy access to anywhere in Singapore. Rooms: I cannot say much about the regular rooms, but the grand deluxe rooms which is a Jr Suite is an excellent place to stay if you want extra space or a family tagging along. The bed linen and towels are very plush! Service: The front desk attendants were very polite and helpful. They even called up to check if the room was alright. That is good service! Little things matter a lot. Also, parking is free which is a great plus! Food: Food was good, but there are so many restaurants outside, that I'd suggest you try them rather than the hotel outlets. The lounge breakfast is great, although it is not an American Breakfast. Conclusion: If you are short on time and would like to shop and do business, this is the perfect place to be.

The breakfast buffet is very good but has exactly the same items every day. No variation whatsoever. Here are some examples of room service prices. Subtract 35% for USD. Add in about 30% in taxes and fees. Continental breakfast: S$28 (~US$17) American breakfast S$38 Breakfast buffet: S$35 ($48 with taxes and fees) Hamburger: & fries: S$25 (tasted good but was VERY undercooked, basically raw even though I asked for well done) Ham and cheese ciabiatta: S$22 (terrible sandwich, avoid) Australian rib-eye steak: S$98 Tuna filet: S$35 Side dishes: S$11 \u2013 S$13 Bowl of penne (no meat): S$27 Soda (can): S$8 We had some laundry done. The prices are about S$12 per item. Our five items cost $60. Dry cleaning runs from S$12 to S$25 a piece. If they pick up by 10:00 am they have it back by 6:00 the same day. Add 50% for rush items. The pillows are hard and thick. If this is an issue for you, they say they have additional pillows of different types available. The internet connection is fairly fast but somewhat unstable. It costs S$25 a day. When you check in be sure to ask for a room away from the construction next door which is VERY noisy. The work starts early in the morning and runs into early evening. The location is awesome but you pay a price. Literally. Everything is expensive. For example, lunch that cost us S$60 would cost S$12 not six blocks away from the Orchard area.

This is the best Hyatt I have stayed in bar none (I stay in about five Hyatts at year). The location is excellent on Scotts Road, just off the main shopping road, Orchard Road. Also, the MRT (Singapore's train system) is only a two minute walk from the hotel (on the corner of Orchard and Scotts). Check-In: Super-efficient and the staff was extremely professional and courteous the whole time. Even though I arrived at the hotel at 1030, my room was ready. Room: I booked the Grand Delxue room and was elated. The room is similar to an executive suite with its size, large work desk, and upgraded amenitites. The room was also very clean and well-stocked. I especially appreciated that the bathroom had the rainshower head. The only thing that I did not like were the two Bang & Olfusen TVs (one in the living room and one in the bedroom); I could not understand how to turn the TV in the living room off from the confusing remote control. Other than this minor problem, the room was everything I wanted and more. Restaurants: I had room service the first day I arrived: a hamburger with fries and chocolate cake for dessert. The meal arrived within 30 minutes during lunchtime, it was elegantly prepared, and tasted delicious. Also, my special requests were all honoured. I also ate at Pete's Place (Italian Restaurant) in the basement for lunch. I had the buffet and it also was excellent for 26SGD. The meal included many main courses, appetisers, and dessert. Exercise/Spa: This hotel has a nice exercise facility with personal trainers available. The cardio machines were not the latest Life Fitness equipment with the LCD TVs built-in to the on-board electronics but were the previous generation (still modern and good and had separate LCD TVs). The best part about the facility was the steam room in the men's locker room. The temperature was set high enough for an excellent steam. I find in many of the locker rooms, the steam room's temperature is not set high enough for it to be meaningful. The hotel also has a pool outside the exercise facililty and a mini-pool inside the men's locker area that seems to be nice, but I did not venture in it. Also, there are many spa treatment rooms in the health centre, but again, I did not use the spa services. Everything was clean and in order though.

This hotel is pricey but looking at their website, the room looks attractive and location is convenient, right at the centre of Orchard Road. The \u201cGrand Deluxe\u201d room is actually a junior suite with a separate bedroom and living area with sofa. On first look, the room does looks nice, stylish and spacious actually, charming in its own sort of way but a bit too minimalist for my taste. It has a separate sitting area with sofa and a working desk. But on closer inspection, the hotel really cheap out on a lot of things. The sofa is kind of Ikea type, the TV yes it is a Band & Olufsen but it is not flat screen, it is a CRT tube TV, no more than 30\u201d and not even widescreen. There is also no DVD player, no sound system. Bathroom is black marble with rainforest and a deep tub. But the rainforest shower head is very small ( size of a small plate ) and the water pressure is definitely not adequate. Also it is very difficult to control the shower temperature as it can fluctuate from cold to suddenly very hot before it stablised. For a \u201cGrand Deluxe\u201d room and with the rate they charge, the hotel only provide a miserable 2 bottles of no-brand mineral water. Sound-proof is not adequate. I can clearly hear people talking at the corridor outside. Also, there are a lot of strange noises in the hotel room at night, mainly from the aircon and the bathroom ( water flowing underneath in the pipes ). No view from my room, just buildings. The room faced the Far East plaza building. Now to the biggest complain \u2013 Service! The service here is really sub-par for 5-star hotel. When my taxi arrived, no bellboy was in sight to pickup my luggage. A hotel staff was standing right next to where my taxi stopped but did nothing. Surely if I came to their hotel by taxi and have luggage in the taxi, then I am their hotel guests! My taxi driver has to literally went into the lobby to call the bellboy to collect my luggage. Even a 3-star hotel has better service. Check-in took 25mins, including 10mins of waiting in a queue and another 15 mins waiting for the checkin staff as she type furiously on the computer trying to locate and assign me a room. Moreover her first form got it wrong and printed another guest name instead. This is really unncessary and unacceptable. They already should have my reservation under confirmed status and I did inform them of my arrival time so they should already be expecting me and have my room ready. After room keys were given, no \u201cthanks for staying with us\u201d or \u201cenjoy your stay\u201d. And of course, no escort to the room. There is also no welcome letter in the room. The concierge is not helpful either. I ask him where can I buy some artwork near the hotel in Orchard Road . He refers me to Tanglin mall, a good 20 mins walk from the hotel at the corner of Orchard Road . Actually it is avaliable within 5 mins walk at Takashimaya and Paragon. The casual answer showed me that he really can\u2019t be bothered. Breakfast is included in my room rate and food generally OK but I definitely won\u2019t pay S$40/= for it because they cheap out by serving local food like chaw kway tiao, nasi padang, rotti platta which can be bought outside for one fraction of the price and properbly of better taste too. Service during breakfast is good though ( the only time when I got good service from this hotel ) and the caf\u00e9 staff are much more attentive, at least they greet me! Internet is very expensive at S$25/= ++ a day. Another service hipcup occur during checkout. I waited almost 30mins for the bellboy to come up to collect my luggage. And this is after 3 phone calls to chase and also after I intercept a passing staff along the corridor to help me locate the bellboy. Then after I checkout and paid, they misplaced my luggage and took them another 15 mins to locate them while I wait and wait and wait.This is definitely not worthly of the hotel\u2019s \u201c5-star\u201d status. Overall, for the room quality and the 2-star service, it is way overpriced and poor value for money. I definitely won\u2019t stay there again, at least not at those rates they charged me.

I stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms. It was equipped with very modern accessories, like the wall mounted flat screen TV and DVD player. One corner of the room had these floor to ceiling windows angled towards the corner. The workspace area was in this corner, which made it quite inviting, and I imagine would be great to use if you were here on business and had to take work back to your hotel room. In fact, it would have made my old days of working in hotel rooms very pleasant. The bed was huge and the bedside tables had a very user friendly control panel that controlled the lights/TV etc. My favourite thing about the room was the bathroom. The bathtub was huge, and even had a waterproof pillow at the head of the tub to use if you were soaking. The walk in shower had one of those huge ceiling mounted rain shower-heads that were the size of a dinner plate. The toiletries came in a black box. There was a nice vanity table and chair in the bathroom that was separate from the sink area. This was so comfortable to use when putting your make-up on, and ideal if you have numerous cosmetics and toiletries. I was a regular guest at this hotel about 10 years ago, and it has changed so much. The hotel bar is good as well, and has a large variety of interesting cocktails. The restaurant mezza9 looked very inviting, which is why I went. The d\u00e9cor, atmosphere and service was good, but the food just average. It was fun for people watching though. The tables were so closely placed together that you could very easily eavesdrop on the conversation taking place at the tables next to you.

Of the many positives, location very near Orchard Road and overall quality/condition of the rooms are the most significant. Orchard Road is a 1/2 block walk from the front door of the GH. There are numerous shops, restaurants, malls all within 5 minutes walking - fantastic location. The rooms appear to have been recently renovated - as the decor is very modern/contemporary with fresh, clean, minimal design and such features as a flat panel plasma tv, wireless internet and plenty of room - large by comparison to other hotels. The fitness center and spa at the GH is also very nice by comparable hotel standards. All equipment is new, clean and would be appropriate for any fitness center. The spa facilities are also very nice with sauna, steam, whirlpool and roomy changing areas. Generally speaking, the service I experienced from the front desk staff upon check-in, to wait staff for room service, to fitness center attendees to my massage therapists was of upmost courteousness and professionalism. The staff really went out of their way to ensure my comfort. The only negatives to mention are the rather long taxi queue in the morning - at the front of the hotel. After a 20 minute wait on my first morning, I learned that hotel guests can \"prebook\" taxis the previous day - this information would have been nice to know. If you need a morning taxi then best to prebook with the bell staff. The second slightly less negative experience was with the checkout which was longer than usual - maybe 10 minutes due to a shortage of staff at the counter. The positives of my stay so far outweigh the 2 minor negatives that I will definitely stay at the GH Singapore on future visits.", "Date": "September 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cLOVED IT!!!\u201d", "Author": "Jessica819", "ReviewID": "UR5793643", "Content": "orchard road is 1 minute from your doorstep! i've been to singapore numerous times for business but i've never stayed at the grand hyatt. i decided to stay there, even though i read a lot of negative comments about it on tripadvisor........ because my favorite restaurant in singapore is mezza 9! it's an open kitchen kind of restaurant and you can see the chef prepare your dish. they have chinese, japanese and western food, an extensive wine list...... the menus are like books. you can eat there everyday for a month and you still won't be able to try every dish on the menu. i read a lot of negative comments about the staff and the size of the rooms. well i booked my flight and hotel package with cathay pacific holidays and we got upgraded to a grand superior room. i was amazed at the size of room! everything was modern and clean. the housekeeping lady took the initiative to line up my sister's 20 something bottles of moisturizers, tonic lotions, make up remover, etc. from smallest to biggest. the front desk and the concierge were equally helpful. my sister even got a \"tour\" of mezza 9. she went through the different areas, even the martini bar and the VIP rooms. everything was great. the food was great, the shopping was great, the room was great - and i almost forgot to mention - they have B&O flat screen TVs in the living room and in the bedroom!", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location, Much Improved Hotel\u201d", "Author": "l-globetrotter", "ReviewID": "UR5702605", "Content": "This hotel is in an excellent location, with Orchard Rd on your door step, the convenience of it all is brilliant.

Fab views from Club Lounge accompanied by a glass of red at the end of a long working day was heaven indeed. The same can be said about fabulous rooftop gardens on Level 3 leading to the gym. It is particularly spectacular all lit up at night, including the 3 storey waterfalls, so if you are there on a romantic getaway, don't miss out on the opportunity to wonder there at any time, but especially at night. The service at reception/check in-out is ordinary; door men are excellent and show genuine concern for the guests. The service at the Club Lounge was also attentive and excellent, which is more than can be said for the gym. The restaurants downstairs and the one on the mezzanine are very good and service excellent. The biggest complaint I have about this hotel is the gym is opened only till 10pm, with rude staff kicking one out at around 9.40pm. I find it difficult to believe that a 5 star hotel in Singapore, in this location, does not have 24/7 gym, or at least access to one with security pass. No flexibility on the issue does not help.

The problem is that the minute you step out the front door, you are jostled and shoved by huge crowds of pedestrians (on their way to Orchard road and the MRT).

The restaurants in the hotel are overpriced completely. For the breakfast buffet at Straits Kitchen they rip you SG$40, but when you go for a second plate of food or more juice (to get value for all that money), you get dirty looks and snide comments from the waitresses/waiters. Wait a minute! I paid for this, I can damn well eat all I want!! Oh no, the serving staff treat you like dirt, and bring you the bill to sign immediately, before you are evven done. Pete's Place is a more casual restaurant downstairs. The ambience and decor tells you it must be authentic italian food. Heck no!! My husband ordered lasagne and it looked and tasted exactly like Dinty Moore's beef stew. It was so disgusting and tasteless, we were pretty miffed at paying SG$36 for that rubbish. The housekeepers at this hotel are very rude. They knock on your door even if you have the \"Do not disturb\" sign on! One time, the maid knocked on the door and I told her to wait 2 minutes while I gather my stuff so that I can leave while she was cleaning, and she started tapping her foot and snapping her fingers at me!!!
