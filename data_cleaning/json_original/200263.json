This was delivered to our room immediately - but I didn't need it, the room temperature was perfect. The bathroom was small but new and spotless and the bed hard, but that's how I like a mattress to be. We slept really well. The other positive is the location. It's 10 min walk (or a tram opposite) to Alexanderplatz and 5 mins on the way is the Hofbrauhaus of Munich if you fancy a bit of oompa music! 10 mins uphill in the opposite direction, if you turn left around Knackstrasse area there's some lovely cafe bars and restaurants and we found a wonderful restaurant we ate in twice (Endlos) - big portions, good choice of food and very, very tasty.

I didn't try the breakfast as I was never up in time (served until 11am at weekends) but did use the bar for drinks throughout the day and it was quite reasonably priced.

The bathroom was a little small but did the job fine. The hot water and water pressure was awesome, especially since it was so cold outside!

Free wifi is in the lobby, but you have to pay to get it in the room, we didn't end up doing that, I guess considering how cheap the room was this is expected. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Breakfast was amazing! It was 10euro per person but totally worth it. I loved it as they had smoked salmon and lots of fresh salads and hams, very filling and light - I'm not much of a pastry/sweet breakfast person. My friend loved the cereal with chocolate in it (I didn't try it) and large selection of pastries. A coffee machine with cream, juice machine, champagne, sparkling water...everything! Best hotel breakfast I've ever had! The only negative thing that happened was on the day of our checkout we had to get up quite early and noticed the power was out, I'm not sure what happened but after about 20mins it randomly came back on.

I needed to stay somewhere that was easily accessible, inexpensive and wasn't going to be awful. I've stayed in many Ibis hotels all over the world so was certain this would be a reasonable bet. The hotel is in a building that looks mid-90's in construction. There is a large petrol station at the front of the hotel with a shop (handy!) and the hotel entrance is to the side. Inside the hotel reception is what you would expect of an Ibis, and the bar is to the rear. There is a 'business centre' with PC's and printers and free wifi. I stayed in room 218, which was overlooking the road. A bit noisy with the window open and the constant bell from the lift, but nothing too disruptive. There is air conditioning in the rooms if the noise is too much to have the window open. The room is decorated in the older style of Ibis rooms - a pale green and pine theme. The bed was two singles pushed together, but travelling alone meant that this was fine. As in every Ibis I have been to, the room was extremely clean and had everything I needed. As mentioned in the other reviews, the bed was a bit hard but I think this is just a personal preference. Breakfast is served on the first floor overlooking the petrol station forecourt (!). It is the usual Ibis buffet and is best described as continental with lots of choice. The room is large and the staff are helpful. The reception staff were friendly and fluent in English, despite my attempts at German. The hotel looks a little tired in places and could benefit from some updating. I think that anyone staying in this Ibis though is given a clear impression of the standard from the website etc. so this should not be a surprise. For me the worst feature of the hotel is the location - walking from Alexanderplatz to the hotel means passing lots of other hotels that are all in a slightly better place. The Ibis is not in a bad location, but unless you want to take the tram everywhere there is a walk of about 15 minutes involved in getting to most places.

The rooms were average sized, but spotless and functional. Our room was at the back of hotel and very quiet. The bed was a large kingsize and firm. Did not use the airconditioning as opening windows was sufficient for October. The TV only had CNBC, Eurosport and MTV as English speaking channels, but there was also one English radio channel. The bathroom had a great shower, average sized but with a good spray and very clean. The staff were wonderful. We asked for extra pillows and towels and got these within 10 minutes. There is a cafe in the hotel which we didn't use but next door to this hotel is a garage, where you can get soft drinks, beers and snacks, croissants etc which is handy for late snacks. The M2 tram is just across the road and will take you into Alexanderplatz (one stop) where there is a main interchange, from where you can get transport to most areas of Berlin. You could walk there in 10 mins. We took the overground train from Schonfeld Airport to Alexanderplatz and were at the hotel in 35 mins. We bought an all in one ticket from the helpful info desk at the airport to cover our transport costs. There is so much to see in Berlin it is hard to recommend places to visit, but in particular the Reichstag (get there early, we got there at 8.15 and went straight in, when we came out the queue was 90 mins long! The TV tower is worth a visit, also if you like museums we thought the best one was the Pergamon in Mitte, small but perfectly formed. If you like shops visit the Alexa Centre at the back of Alexanderplatz (a little hard to find), they have everything you could need there is about 200 shops in there and a miniature Berlin museum too on the top floor (something different).

What I found was excellent. The hotel is situated on the corner of Prenzlauer Berg and Prenzlauer Allee, conveniently next to a filling station. If you are arriving by car, this is the only place you can park until you arrange underground parking with the hotel. The staff on Reception were very friendly and helpful, especially when they realised that a mistake had been made with my booking. They sorted out the error calmly and efficiently and even offered me a coffee while I waited. They were also a fount of local knowledge and because of this I was able to provision my room from the local supermarket in a very few minutes after checking-in. The room was spacious and spotlessly clean and commanded a wonderful view of the Fernsehturm in Alexanderplatz. The shower was powerful and the bathroom well stocked with hair and body wash. The hairdryer worked well and plenty of towels were provided. The TV showed only German-language stations with the exception of France TV5 and Eurosport, although BBC World Service could be obtained on the radio channel. There were no drawers in the room; clothes had to stacked on six narrow shelves in the hallway. However, there were plenty of coathangers to hang items from. The airconditioning worked well, but only when the room was occupied and the key card inserted into the slot to activate the electrical supply. Since we were in a heatwave with temperatures of 30-35C, a little friendly pleading with the cleaner was required to obtain a spare card to plug in and thus ensure that the room remained cool. The bed was a double and had a summer-weight duvet. The mattress was more than firm and those travellers who like a softer bed might be advised to call the hotel in advance and ask if one might be provided. Breakfast is served on the First Floor and boasts a good variety of options with dishes to suit all tastes, although those who favour the full English 'death-on-a-plate' might feel disappointed. The coffee is excellent; tea drinkers might be advised to take their preferred bags with them. The Dining Room is light and airy, has an excellent view and newspapers are provided for free. The hotel bar is located behind Reception and is quite reasonably priced in comparison with other Berlin hotels. Opposite Reception is a lobby area with free internet access. Parking is in a underground garage which is accessed from Prenzlauer Berg on a card system; this can be a trifle tricky for drivers of right-hand-drive vehicles, so having a passenger is a bonus. Parking was charged at 10 Euros a day. The hotel is located just 10 minutes' walk from Alexanderplatz; if you don't fancy walking, there is a tram stop a couple of minutes' walk up Prenzlauer Allee. A tip when travelling around Berlin on public transport is to buy the Tageskarte which is valid for 24 hours and costs 6.10 Euros at time of writing. From Alexanderplatz, all public transport is accessible. The hotel is also located some 10 minutes' walk from Kollwitzplatz, which is where you will find lots of eateries, including the excellent 'Endlos', which specialises in Berlin cuisine.

The Ibis is on Prenzlauer Allee and takes about 10 minutes to reach if you're reasonably healthy. If you can't face the walk, use the tram - there are tram stops in the road opposite the hotel which means that you have good links to other parts of the city. You can always use the tram to get to the nearest U or S-bahn if you need to, or simply don't fancy a long walk anywhere. The Ibis is not particularly cheap, but the rooms are clean, spacious, and comfortable. They are well soundproofed, which is just as well as the road is busy 24/7. The breakfasts are not included in the price, but if you opt to take them you can really fill up from the wide ranging buffet provided. I noticed that a previous reviewer had said you can't do anything about the view of the factory - the first time we stayed this was derelict and there was a squatters party going on in the roof area. The factory has now been converted to a gym and business complex as the whole of Prenzlauer is becoming a bit of a yuppy paradise.

My fiance is German and I speak fluent German so we had no communication problems however we really had the impression that the staff at reception just couldn't be bothered. Check-in was ok but nothing special. On our 2nd night we went to ask something at the reception before going out for dinner. I had sprayed some perfume before we left the room (quite a normal thing to do I think) and whilst we were waiting at reception a woman working there started complaining loudly about my perfume to her colleague beside her was serving us! Not a problem if she doesn't like my perfume but how odd to start complaining about it in front of me! I went down to reception to ask for a hairdryer on another occasion and had interrupt the 2 receptionists from their personal conversation so that they could attend to me (my pet peeve), not only that but I then had to leave a \u20ac10 deposit for the hairdryer... Overall the hotel is not good and the staff there aren't making it any better.

The Ibis hotels website was easy to use and provided maps of the hotel's location. Used in conjunction with a Berlin transport map, getting there from Schonefeld was easy beyond words - only one change of train needed. The hotel has a tram stop right outside and the U-Bahn station at Rosa-Luxembourg Platz was within easy walking distance (if I'm truthful - the tram route passes the U-Bahn station, so there's no need to walk!) This means you can easily link to U and S-bahn by using the tram. The hotel was clean and well worth the price charged. Staff were friendly and very helpful, especially when dealing with my pitiful attempts at German! They all wear name badges with flags that identify which languages they speak. The bar was well run and served Berliner and Warsteiner (available in most German Ibis hotels) beers. Snacks were easy to arrange and tasty. The room was basic but was ideal for use as a base for seeing Berlin. Take a trip to the top floor at night for a brilliant view of the radio tower at Alexanderplatz. I would recommend the hotel to anyone visiting the city. I've stayed in many others in the city and haven't found anywhere else with such good and easy to reach transport links.", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cJust the Job\u201d", "Author": "Bristolcitytillidie", "ReviewID": "UR7988592", "Content": "Just returned from a lad's weekend in Berlin where we spent two nights at the Ibis.

There is a bar behind the reception desk, and though we didn't have a drink there, the prices were cheap and they also serve snacks like soups and nachos. The people at reception were very friendly and helpful, and kept the free apples and sweets at the front desk well stocked. We passed on the 9 euro breakfast and bought heated rolls and fruit from the petrol station next door - there are small tables where you can eat standing up, italian style. The location is not exactly smack bang in the centre of things, but the 10 min walk to Alexander Platz was nothing to complain about. Although the area doesn't look particularly appealing, we felt very safe walking around the area late at night. Berlin Mitte was a great area, lots of cosy little restaurants and shops which was about a 20 minute walk away. There are also many little bars to explore in the area north of the hotel.
