It's true it's noice,...it's true they have small rooms, but the location is great- near to all the touristic atractions and also to the train, breakfast is tasty and enough, reception staff is friendly and always capable to give you a good tip. They change towel and get clean every day. In our opinion, is a good place for someone who's interested first to the city.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tbilisi, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cThe worst experience, I have ever had with hotels\u201d", "Author": "Nino D", "ReviewID": "UR119246211", "Content": "I was alone and they gave me a hotel room, smallest as anyone can imagine and the window was looking into some whole with no air source and no air conditioning in it, No minibar was functioning. They told me there was no other room and they would change next day. Location is on Laleli, which is the main street for wholesalers street and many Russians with lots of bought goods where in the hotel and they are quite noisy. Restaurant was providing same oily food every day. Next day room was too far from wireless connection, so i had to sit on a floor next to door to catch very slow signal. It's too noisy street if you prefer open windows. But the views from the room is real Istanbul!
