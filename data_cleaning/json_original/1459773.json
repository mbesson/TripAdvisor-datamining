Although the lobby doesn't seem glamorous- it's a bit tight and furnished in wood, the rooms are spacious and look very warm and cozy. Clean and provided with everything you could possibly need. The staff is kind and helpful. A lot of shops in the neighboring area where you can buy food or souvenirs.

On the other hand, if you would be visiting Istanbul for sightseeing and for major tourist attractions, then you better stick with one of the hotels around Taksim district or the historical peninsula (Sultanahmet). The hotel is one the borderline between top of the line business/shopping district, and a lower income and not so safe Gultepe neighborhood. But where hotel is located is safe, even at night. 3-story new building, with fairly-sized rooms. Furnishings are new, clean, and functional. All rooms have got a/c (a blessing in humid summer days). The modest breakfast fulfills the function - nothing more, nothing less. To complement it all is the friendly and helpful staff.
