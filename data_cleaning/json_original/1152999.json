It ruined our stay in beautiful Istanbul. On arrival, no rooms were available, so we got a \"garden room\" in the basement for 1 night with a 10 Euro pice reduction, and a promise that we will be transfered upstairs to a \" nice room\" the following day. The garden room had a bathroom and a toilet in the same space, the showerhead placed above the toilet so while we showered the toilet got cleaned as well. The room had a bed and nothing more. No table, no night stand, no lamps. The hotel, the rooms need a major cleaning. We were hopeful that our nice room will be nice. Wrong. The paint was peeling off the ceiling falling on the bed and on our clothes. The breakfast was the same every morning. No juices or fruit. Bread with some small packages of butter, jam, cream cheese and a miserable coffee. After this review I am erasing this experience from my memory.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, ON", "Title": "\u201cGreat for small boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "merchy10", "ReviewID": "UR122911045", "Content": "I stayed at Nayla from Dec 27th to 29th and enjoyed my stay. The hotel owner Qadeer is very helpful and speaks fluent english which really helps. He guided us on places to eat and how to schedule our day. We had the family room which had a double and two single beds. I was traveling with wife and two little kids. Its a small room which only has room for a couple suitcases but was just enough for us. We were literally 5 mins walk from Blue Mosque and maybe 10 mins from other tourist stuff in Sultanahmet. The hotel doesnt have an elevator so not recommended for elderly that can't climb stairs. Breakfast on roof top was decent (bread, boiled egg and milk). If you are looking for a decent hotel close to attractions, I'd definitely recommend this place.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat for budget travel!\u201d", "Author": "BeeAndKay", "ReviewID": "UR119940503", "Content": "After lots of research we chose to stay at the Nayla Palace. It's exactly what we were looking for: budget prices, great location, clean rooms, good sleep. It was VERY helpful that the owner spoke perfect English too. Our room had a private bathroom en suite and I was surprised at how comfortable the bed was. We slept great! We had a hot-pot in the room to heat up water (we brought our own instant starbucks coffee). The owner loaned me a hair-dryer so I wouldn't have to pack my own (THANKS!!!). The breakfast was great! A boiled egg, fruit, tomato, cheese and lots of bread and coffee or tea (choose the tea!). We loved it! The breakfast lady was wonderful. We really liked the location as we could walk everywhere and got a lot of exercise while there (we lost 15 lbs between the two of us!). There was public transportation nearby as well. The owner arranged airport transport for us the day we flew to Ankara. We would definitely stay here again as the price was right.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "flayosc france", "Title": "\u201ca nice place and nice people in the center of the historical city\u201d", "Author": "claudeFlayoscFrance", "ReviewID": "UR118852208", "Content": "Small bedroom and a very very smal bathroom but very quet at night and a splendid place to have breakfast with a view on the Bosphorus in the morning..
