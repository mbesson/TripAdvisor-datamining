The reception staff were friendly and knowledgeable, the rooms were a clean, a nice size and the decor was contemporary. We stayed during an expensive weekend, 212 euro per night is a lot more than I'd expect pay but I'd say 170 euro would have been a more realistic price. Small issues: There was no where to place shower gels/shampoos in the shower area(really nice shower) and there was no full length mirror", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cnew, clean, modern\u201d", "Author": "NyLilli", "ReviewID": "UR127997978", "Content": "new, clean, modern, good location. can accomodate family of four commfortably. The sofa splits into two twin beds. Front desk helpful with any requests and good restaurant recs. comfortable bed, good housekeeping. nice towels and sheets. a couple of things about bathroom.. the shower curtain too short, and the shower head is a handheld sprayer with nowhere to to hang it from.( takes some getting used to) also the bathroom door is glass ( alittle bit see through) Other wise the use of space is clever and cool. Also free wifi, and free use of computers in lobby. Does provide room service breakfast but 12 euros a person. This hotel was chosen based on trip advisor reviews and because it could accomodate family in one room. The photos provied by the hotel are accurate.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely and ideal if you need a bit of space\u201d", "Author": "markhusted", "ReviewID": "UR127283746", "Content": "I was very impressed with the rooms at the AKO. You open the door and they are light airy and very clean. Small kitchen diner lounge opens into a large bedroom space. Immaculately tidy and fresh and the service at the hotel is very efficient. The location is good and its only a ten minute walk to Place Catalunya and all the sites are easily reached from Universitat which is around the corner. I would recommend this anyone who likes a little more space than the average hotel or indeed familes with young children as the rooms can accommodate up to four people.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGreat modern appartments with hotel service\u201d", "Author": "oller", "ReviewID": "UR125352138", "Content": "First of all the location is very central: Passeig de Gracia, Placa Catalunya, Ramblas are all within 5-10 min. walking distance. We hardly needed any metro to move around - but in case you need one, the Universidad station is just one block away. There is an airport bus stop coming from the airport just next to this metro station. However departing to the airport you need to enter the bus at Placa Catalunya. Also traffic noise at the street in front of the hotel is bearable - we slept with the windows open (5th floor) and didn't wake up because of the noise. Recently opened, the AKO suites hotel offers modern styling, but still functional. The appartments, even if they aren't huge, certainly are more spacious than a normal hotel room. And they give you the freedom of catering for yourself. The kitchen equipment is however not really meant for preparing gourmet meals. We just used the fridge for our drinks and we bought food for breakfast - there is a bakery and a small supermarket across the street which is handy (breakfast wasn't included in our room rate). There is a small bar where you can eat, a couch and a tv in the living/kitchen section. A glass door separates it from the sleeping room, equipped with a comfy bed and a second tv. The bathroom consists of a tube (as written in the previous review the shower curtain is too short, and there is no hook for the shower head - you have to hold it in your hands which is a bit of a pain), a sink and a separate toilet with a sliding glass door. All in all I recommend AKO suites, the quality is good for the price you get, the location central and it gives you the opportunity to prepare meals yourself.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "holland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel, perfect location\u201d", "Author": "dutchmanHolland", "ReviewID": "UR121956228", "Content": "Beautiful new accomodation, very spacious rooms with separate sitting room/kitchen, good bed, two flatscreen tv's, rain shower.
