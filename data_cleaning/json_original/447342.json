Stay away! DUMP! DUMP! DUMP! I was there just this weekend and I do not recommend this place to anyone! A group of 18 of us went there and after 5 minutes of checking in our rooms, 14 of us were at the front desk to complain along with other travelers who were there to complain about not getting what they paid for! The hallways of the hotel are filthy and upon opening the room, it smelled extremely funky. The electricty didn't work and there was zero air conditioning. The decor is outdated by 25 years with cirgarette burns on the furniture. My bed was made up but there where seasame seeds in the sheets and the bed was so hard that it felt like you were sleeping on a box spring. The bathroom is full of mildew and mopping must be only a yearly thing there. The carpets were too gross to put your feet on, thankly they give you slippers! The location is merely okay since there are other places in the city that are much more interesting. Our group stayed only one night and found a much better place for the remainder of of stay in Beijing. Also, I got a weird rash on my legs and I am thinking it was from the bed. People in our group remarked that hostels are nicer than this place.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR116824457", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "kennen"}, {"Content": "Good location only The location is excellent. It's right next to a subway stop. It's also close by to restaurants and a Walmart. I agree with other posters that the staff can be quite rude. I was yelled at by housekeeping for asking why the electricity in half of my room wasn't working properly, but they did eventually send someone to help me.The rooms were okay- I suppose they are what you get for the price. The room smelled rather musty. There were cockroaches in the bathroom.

Beijing was our longest and final stop in China and we were staying at the hotel for 8 days. Almost immediately after checking in, most of the group was ready to leave. I do not understand what makes this hotel 3 star but I do not recommend trusting that rating. The rooms were old, and not well kept, in one of our rooms the bathroom plumbing was exposed and there were several in which mildew was on the shower walls and ceiling. The floors did not appear to have been vaccumed prior to our arrival (there were crumbs and a sock under one of our beds before we ate or slept there). Our floor of the hotel smelled like burned hair and one evening we returned to our room and found a roach in the entry way. The breakfast was the worst I had experienced on the trip. They did not even have fruit or eggs cooked to order and plastic-looking covers remained over the table even while people were eating. Only a few members of the staff spoke any English which made it hard to request irons, wake up calls, exchange money or get directions to other locations in the city. The lobby reeks of cigarette smoke and the using the internet costs 1 RMB per minute. Unless you only plan to sleep at this hotel, and you may want to bring your own pillow and blanket, I would not recommend it.", "Date": "Jun 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR520154886", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "geauxeg"}, {"Content": "Stay away from this hotel! (Long) We just got back from Beijing and stayed at this hotel. It was the worst vacation we've ever had in our lives. The staff were non English speaking, extremely rude, noncourteous, and unhelpful to say the least. The hotel was very old and the rooms were disgusting and very filthy. We were even left a half eaten fruit tray on the dresser when we walked in the room! We reserved two triple rooms for our family of six. When we got to the hotel late with our four children the hotel tried to give us two double rooms. How can six people sleep in only four twin beds? They also tried to rip us off on our breakfast by giving us four vouchers for each day and telling us we would have to pay for the only two. We paid our travel agency for everything in advance before we arrived in Beijing. Our breakfast for six was supposed to be included with our tour package. We couldn't communicate with them and so they had to call our tour guide to the hotel. They ended up bringing in cots for the rooms and we did get the other two vouches each day for breakfast. We went to Xian for one day  one night and when we got back to this hotel they tried to give us smoking rooms. We specifically asked for nonsmoking rooms. We have two children with asthma. They told us the hotel was a nonsmoking hotel. It was a complete lie as there are ashtrays all over the place to include the front counter in the lobby! They ended up giving us double rooms again and bringing in cots. The Chinese breakfast was gross. The only food edible was the toast and fried rice. We were very busy with our tour most days, but did get one day to sleep in. The staff told us breakfast would be served from 7-10 a.m. We got down there at 9 a.m. and all the fried rice was gone. My husband asked if they would be bringing any more out and they told him no and in fact were cleaning up! We practically starved the whole week. The restaurants the tour guide took us to all week weren't any better. Thank God for Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Dairy Queen, and the snacks we brought from home! The little store we saw our tour guide (Lilly and Hatty) buy us water from is taking used water bottles, refilling them with tap water, super gluing the caps and selling them! Beware when the cap is very hard to open and the water tastes funny. My son got food poisoning while we were there! Stay away from this hotel at all costs! I don't want this experience to happen to anyone else.", "Date": "Apr 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR452647481", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "momof5J"}, {"Content": "Good Experience I was glad I chose this hotel. The price was great, and a convenient location (right in front of a subway). You can find a place on line where the hotel and address are written in Chinese characters, which you can show to a taxi driver. This got me from the airport to the hotel with no problem, as well as to and from other tourist sights. The level of English was very low, but the staff really went out of their way to bridge the language gap. The room was comfortable and clean. The in room safe did not work, but someone was up to my room in five minutes to fix it - and did not accept a tip. I also thought the TV was broke, but I just didn't know how to make it work. Again, someone showed me how. Not much to see on the TV though. Only one English station of a local variety. You could order movies, though. I wasn't in Beijing to watch TV however. Breakfast was not included in my rate. I did go to breakfast, and at first felt a bit unwelcome. They had to always call the front desk. It was a great treat, though. For about $1.20, I got an unlimited amount of food. I am not fond on Chinese cuisine, but was able to try things I would not normally try. The food was fantastic. The juices were great - especially the purple one (some sort of flower drink). However, I am still trying to lose those extra pounds I gained from the breakfast. I will definately be returning.", "Date": "Jan 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR306331220", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Jlem12"}, {"Content": "Front Desk has problems You can't communicate much if you don't speak Chinese.

Don't belive that you could walk to any tourist site (forbidden city, tian an man e.t.c.) is too far + all of the attractions are huge so save your foot for attractions. Since there is not much use of the metro sistem in beijing and buses are needed, girls from the reception are very important. Some of them (2-3) speak english and are very usefull (they write you down in chinese your destination, how to get there, early check in, money change, map and many other information-some times they will try to put you in taxi and save themselves from explaning the No. of buses but if you insist, they will help you).Hotel is convinient if you plan to continue your travel with train, since there is train ticket office next to hotel, as well as nice restaurant.Lobby is just OK, bell boy usefull. Rooms are small and (at least one I got) very very noisy during 24hours. Windows are small and the bed not that much hard as some say. TV has 1 english canal and mini bar is empty.

The staff, with the exception of a particular day manager who went out of her way to help us, need some brushing up in the manners and service dept. Perhaps this is just the way the Chinese conduct themselves? I certainly was treated better in Hong Kong. If they are to host the world in 2008, they've got some work to do. There is a currency exchange in the hotel, however they would only change one bill for me, and wouldn't do the same for my friend, and they did so grudgingly. Check out was a shambles. No order. Men served first. Three people doing various jobs in various stages of the process left my card being shuffled around from place to place on the counter, with people coming and going in front of me.
