It is very reasonably priced for all that is provided. The room was nicely furnished, with a very comfortable bed, good pillows, a microwave, mini refrigerator and free wi-fi. The desk staff were friendly, professional and very helpful with our questions. The hotel provides a free shuttle to Epcot (2 morning departures, 2 evening returns), and has a workout room and swimming pool. The complimentary continental breakfast has great variety, including oatmeal (with raisins, sliced almonds, brown sugar, honey toppings available), bagels, English muffins, fresh fruit, waffles, etc. It's a pleasant 10-15 minute walk to a low-key shopping center with a small grocery store and several restaurants/cafes, including a good locally-owned Italian restaurant. The hotel also offers complimentary baked cookies in the evening. Our only recommendation is that recycling containers be provided in the breakfast area.

Great value for the area. I thought that the carpet needed cleaning and didn't really like walking on it with no shoes. Other parts of the room showed signs of wear. I would say it's time to paint and replace the carpet. The bathtub did not drain properly. At the end of a shower, I was standing in several inches of water. The bed was fine; room was very quiet. The breakfast was marginally up to Hampton Inn standards. My last day there I had to leave by 6:30 for a flight, so went down for breakfast about 6:10. There were no scrambled eggs out yet and they weren't put out until 6:25 or so. Another day there had been bacon, but it was all gone and never replaced while I was there eating. I look forward to a treat of having a donut when staying at Hampton Inn, but this one didn't have them. They did have a nice selection of muffins, bread, and some bagels, however. Overall, it was a nice stay, but just not quite up to the standards I associate with Hampton Inn. At that, it would still be my choice if going back to Orlando.

My room was away from the group and I had no issues with too much noise etc. A very pleasant stay and I would definitely stay here again.

We checked in at about 9:30pm after being at Magic Kingdom all day long. The front desk attendant was very nice and got us checked in quickly. When we got to our room and unloaded our things, I got the kids ready for their showers and let me tell you I have been in many hotels and this bathroom was spotless. I have never seen a bathroom at a hotel that clean before and I was very impressed, kudos to the housekeeping team. The bathroom was very nice with a granite counter and good sized shower with an adjustable shower head, there were plenty of towels as well. The beds were fabulous and so comfortable. We brought out own pillows but if I had known how comfy the pillows were going to be I would have left it at home. The microwave and mini fridge were great conveniences and the flat screen TV was a nice touch. The next morning we were headed back to the parks so the complimentary breakfast was awesome. There was a lot of variety from waffles, to cereal, egg, oatmeal, bagels, toast, you get the idea! Very filling and the dining room had a nice atmosphere. We took the shuttle to the parks and it was an outsourced company but it was kind of worn down, but it got us to where we needed to be and back. When we got back from the parks there were warm cookies waiting on us....yum!! Then we made it to the pool area to relax a bit before dinner. The pool area was very nice and the hot tub was great for soaking after walking the parks. There were no towels but I notified the front desk attendant and she had some for us pretty quickly. There are a ton of places to eat around the hotel as well and some you could even walk to if you don't mind the walk. All around this place was more than I expected even after reading all the positive reviews. I would definitely stay here again.

There are also a lot of places to have dinner nearby and the Orlando Premium Outlet is very close. They do not have safes in the rooms. The only problem I had was regarding the payment at the check out. They are not prepared to work with Visa Travel Money (VTM). In fact, it seems they do not know the existence of such a card, which works like a debit card for international travels. In my case, when I arrived to check in, they charged my debit card a value above of that I was supposed to pay at time of check out. At the end of my stay, they wanted to use my debit card again, like a credit card. I explained to them that the payment had already been completed and I showed them the extract of my bank account, which included the payment of the hotel. I explained that they had also charged me more than the correct value, and I would like to receive the excess amount back. They said they would investigate the situation and send me an email. That was two weeks ago and I have not received any contact since then. I will send them another email to get my money back. Anyway, here s a tip: do not use Visa Travel Money at check in.

If you get a taxi you will pay approximately 60$. If you are like me and want to save money, there is a city shuttle that you can take from the airport (Lynx bus 111). You can catch the shuttle from Zone A of the airport (Level 1). You will then get off at Downtown disney westside transfer center and catch the Lynx bus 50 ( which goes thru palm parkway) and you can get right in front of the hotel. I only paid 4$ for the ride from the airport. The ride from the airport to this hotel will take about 1 Hr 20 Min but its worth the money saved. You can get more bus info on the Lynx website. This location is very close to lot of different restaurants/fast foods. If you like to walk it is about 10 Minute from this location. You can buy all sorts of tickets to different attractions right in the hotel. That is very convenient. This way you can avoid long lines at the parks to buy the tickets. There is a complementary shuttle the hotel provides to walt disney world ( Drops you off at Epcot). You can take the monorail to travel to other parks form there. The complementary shuttle departs at 8:15AM & 12 PM and the earliest the shuttle will pick you up from the park back to the hotel is at 5:50PM) If you want to go to universal studios there is a fee of 10$ per person. If you decide you want to come back early from walt disney and not wait for the complementary shuttle, you can catch a lynx shuttle (Bus 50) from the disney ticket center and get right in front of the hotel (Will take about 40 Min for the ride). The rooms are in good condition. Its is clean. Room has a standard TV (not a flat screen), a small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker. Clean bathroom. You can get coffee and drinks (juice) any time from the breakfast area. This location has Wi fi. Breakfast if excellent. Lot of things to chose from.

The same red headed/blonde girl checked me in that checked me out and I nagged her the whole trip with questions and she was more than willing to go out of her way to make sure all my questions were answered and was friendly and very funny. When I got back from disney I had more questions and the guy at the desk was soo nice and was pleased to see people who know how to do their job. The only flaw is you can tell they are understaffed when it gets busy when we got back from disney in the evening and when we were checking out they were trying to converse but phones were ringing, lost foreign guests, and paperwork everywhere. It does lessen the personal experience you get when it isn't busy but that is more poor management, what happened to two people at the front desk?!

We quickly agreed and had a room very close to the lobby which made moving in and out a breeze. The room was very clean and the beds were so comfy. In the morning, the breakfast was better than some of the character breakfasts we had in Disney World, the Mickey waffles were great as well as the coffee, eggs, bacon, etc. More than enough to start you day. There wasn't a yogurt that I liked and the lady monitoring the breakfast went back and brought me a strawberry one. When we checked out in the morning, we were once again greeted by a smiling staff member who asked about our stay quickly and asked if there were any airline tickets they could print for us or if we needed directions. We asked the quickest way to magic kingdom and were given great directions, I think we were there within 20 minutes and this was on christmas eve day. Overall, this was a fantastic stay.

We booked the hotel via Hilton Honors web site. The web site indicated that this was one of the few hotels that had a single room for five people for six days of stay. The price was high since we requested a room for five. When we arrived, the front desk person name Chris told us that the room could only hold four people and they did not have any movable bed to be added to our room. I showed him the print out of our reservation that stated we had five people, he said that was the problem of the Hilton Honors web site, and the hotel had nothing to do with that. I asked for my options, he contacted the hotel manager. The hotel manager told Chris that I could pay for another room for 4 days. As the hotel was sold out for the last two days of our stay, he said that he would give me a movable bed for the last two days of our stay. As I don't have any other options, I had to pay an extra $449.96 for an additional room for four nights. After checked into our rooms, we found out that the fridges on both rooms were very noisy. We had to unplug them in order to sleep. Other than that, the hotel facilities are similar to other Hampton Inns. We checked out the additional room after the fourth night and expected to see a movable bed in our other room after we come back from the park. To our surprise, when we came back near mid-night, we did not see the movable bed in our room. When my wife came to the front desk to ask about it, she was directed to the telephone to talk to the hotel manager. The manager told my wife that there is nothing the hotel can do. The only option for us was to check out of the hotel and go to somewhere else. This was at 12:30 am in the night and my two kids were already sleeping. My wife told him that if we were forced to check out at this late hour, we would have to sleep in the hotel lobby, and we might have to call the police to help us find a temporary shelter. He finally gave in and give us another room in the hotel for the night. On our last night of stay, we finally saw the movable bed that should have to be in our roon on the first night of stay.

This is no longer true. Now the room is very, very cheapo, with yellowed towels and sheets, and the mattress and pillows are very cheap and uncomfortable. The pillows used to be high-quality, a choice of \"firm\" \"medium or soft written on them from the same manufacturer.

The sheets were yellowed and worn looking and not crisp. Even the TV was old and cheap, looking like something out of 1970.

The owners of this hotel intentionally went cheap, sacrificing quality and comfort in order to make a few more bucks out of their customers.

So, I didn't come for Disney World, Sea World, or Epcot. We knew it would be a family environment with kids, and this didn't bother us at all. I wanted to discuss this first to let people know it's still possible to stay here and do other things! The location is good. It's great for the theme parks I mentioned above (I think the hotel has shuttles to these places, but not sure). It was less than 10 minutes by car to each golf course we played (Shingle Creek and Marriott Grande Pines). It is walking distance to a fair amount of restaurants, but your choices are somewhat limited. I would say it was about 0.5 miles to the first business center cluster, and about another 0.4 miles to the intersection of Palm Parkway and HWY 535. I give a word of caution to those walking: it's fairly dark walking at night because there are little or no street lamps, so walk with another person (or in a group). There are sidewalks on both sides of the road, but just be careful. Even though you are in a highly populated tourist area for Disney, you never know what type of people are out and about. The room was clean and well kept, and the hotel overall was also clean. The room has a mini fridge, a wall AC unit (a bit noisy), and an old rear projection TV. It's rare to find these in hotels today, so I was disappointed with this. No, I wasn't here to watch TV, but it's also nice to have a nice TV to watch when you are settling down for bed. We smelled bug spray multiple times during our stay in the hotel: first in the elevator and once in one of the hallways. I guess it is Florida, and there are bugs, but you really don't want to walk around and smell that. I guess you also don't want bugs crawling around either? The hotel offers free parking (the lot fills up pretty nicely at night), free wireless internet, and free on site breakfast. The breakfast is your typical Hampton Inn spread, but their waffle maker produces Mickey Mouse Ear waffles for the kids. I am sure they enjoy it. The hotel elevators are VERY slow. My biggest problem was with security. I walked out the rear door of the hotel one morning and found it propped open with a piece of wood, allowing anyone without a hotel door key to \"come on in\". This is a pretty big security issue, and thus I can't really recommend the hotel. I wouldn't bring my wife and kid here because of it. I reported this to the front desk. The reply was the doors are checked around midnight and there was a uniformed guard walking the property. Well, I hope they check the doors more often than that. Also, I didn't see a guard once while on the property. For $88/night, it's a good deal for the location and what you get. I hope they work on their security a bit. I would at least research the area for other hotels for similar prices (and security) before deciding.

We noticed that the Radisson was much closer to the restaurants and bars and given that the price is not much different, if we go to Orlando again we would probably pay the extra to have the added convenience of closer proximity to eateries & bars in the evenings.

The beds were comfortable and the room was a good size. We over looked the pool, the hotel was very quiet, no slamming of doors etc late at night! Breakfast was buffet style and was included in our good rate. It offered a range of hot and cold foods from scrambled egg, omlettes to cereals and muffins - it was probably the best breakfast we have ever had which was good as we needed the energy for the parks! We booked our tickets via the concierge who is there from 7-11am every morning. We had a car so we were able to get to the parks easily but not sure how we would have done so if we hadn't got one. There was a small complex of shops, pubs and restaurants close by. We ate at the Crab House on the first night which was okay but not fantastic, see other review on Trip advisor for more detail and also the Havana Cafe which was a cuban restaurant and very good, also see other review on trip advisor. One night we also ordered chinese to the room as we were too knackered to go out! We also loved the free wi fi in he rooms. The pool was on the small side but was ample and was very quiet. one complaint I would have if I have to have one is that the shower pressure was very weak and with thick curly hair it is not good for getting the soap out!

The price they quoted me at the front desk per night was $79 per night which was a little more than what I wanted to spend; I went online to Orbitz.com typed Hampton Inn Orlando Lake Buena Vista in the search bar and booked through Orbitz, saving $10 making it $69 per night. I think it was worth it even if you are in a budget. Very quiet at night and my room was two doors away from the lobby. I'll definitely stay there again!!!!!

Our family planner that got the hotel for us was assured we would have a pleasant time in the lobby. We had a \"pizza\" get together and started to play cards. I was pulled to the side by a man wearing a pair of shorts and tee shirt with a ball cap on. He tells me he is the manager and that we need to leave the lobby cause we are too loud. Hummm, when we made the reservations no one told us that we had to act as if we were in a library. We were told we would have the back room for our get together. They over booked and we were in the front lobby. Even the girls at the desk didn't have a problem with us being there. There were NO complaints to them either. So where did he get that we were being too loud? When I left to my room a couple of times and came back to the lobby there was no noise past the computer room. Not only did he say we had to leave he then said we may have the cops called on us! What?????? You have got to be kidden!!!!! When I told our Aunt about this she wanted to talk to the \"manager\" and 45 min later and only after she told the girls at the counter did he finally show up to only wave in her face and say \"I won't talk to you!\" Our family ended up going separate ways for the rest of the time cause there was no set place we could all meet. It separated our family at our family reunion. My son will be leaving for boot camp Aug 8th and will go straight into active duty. This may have been his last family reunion for many years to come. I will never spend my money at a Hampton Inn again. I will post to my facebook, myspace and everywhere else to make sure that no one has this kind of experience with them again.

We really liked this hotel and considered staying for our entire 5 nights at Disney but glad we didn't. We liked our room, we thought the staff was the best and the price was awesome! Even after tax, we only paid $88.88 - the cheapest hotel of our 9 day trip - we drove to DisneyWorld and stayed at 4 Hampton Inns along the way & 4 nights at a Disney Resort. It really, really is a great deal to stay here & be so close to Disney. However, there were two reasons why we are glad we didn't stay here the remaining 4 nights at Disney. We stayed here because we wanted 5 nights at a Disney Resort Hotel but they were booked and we could only get in for 4 nights - so we stayed at this Hampton Inn before moving onto the Disney Resort Hotel. The reason we are glad we stayed at the Disney Resort Hotel was for the convenience of the shuttle buses - our Disney Resort Hotel had different shuttle buses going to ALL the different Disney Parks - most leaving every 30 minutes from early morning to past midnight. This was amazing convenient! This Hampton Inn has a shuttle bus that goes to Epcot only & only twice a day - like 8:30 am and 12:30pm - so if you miss it, you are out of luck. Plus they have only one return time - it was something like 5:45pm which you need a reservation for. We wanted to stay late to see the Epcot fireworks and if we used the Hampton shuttle, we couldn't have done that. Once at Epcot - if you wanted to go to Magic Kingdom you'd have to leave Epcot on a monorail to a transportation center then take another monorail to Magic Kingdom - very time consuming. I notice another guest complained about the shuttle service from Hampton and I also noticed that the management frequently responds to guest comments on tripadvisor so I'm sure they'll be reading this review. The management responded to the other guest's review by saying \"Free Shuttle to parks: Disney controls where they allow such shuttle services to drop off guests. Once at Epcot guests can take Disney's own internal shuttles to any park you want.\" So in the hotel's defense, I could see how limited they are due to Disney's rules but it is still not guest friendly. But I did think of a great solution! IF guests at Hampton have a vehicle with them and do not need to use the shuttle, it is still cheaper to stay at the Hampton Inn & drive to the Disney Park of your choice & pay $15 to park there - with direct access to the park you are visiting instead of paying $$$ to stay at a Disney Resort Hotel like we did. We thought of this only after we moved to the Disney Resort Hotel so we could have access to more direct shuttles. The second reason I didn't like this Hampton Inn was the awful breakfast! Out of 8 hotel breakfasts on our trip - this was the worst! Only 3 choices of cereal from a dispenser - which was not labeled - were those regular cheerios or honey nut cheerios?? Milk from a dispenser. No fresh fruit, but cut up fruit chunks served in a bowl. Their fruit chunks looked spoiled. I can say this because the night before we stayed at a Hampton Inn in Mobile, AL which had an amazing breakfast serving the same cut fruit chucks which looked like fruit and tasted good. This Hampton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fruit looked pale and awful and not like fruit. They had 1 choice of muffins along with a bread selection to toast. Their \"hot\" breakfast had 3 choices - none were hot. In fact, they had an egg dish topped with shredded cheese that was so cold, the cheese wasn't even melted. And lastly - they had 1 and only 1 waffle maker for tons and tons of guests. The line to a make a waffle was very long & to make it worse - each person was making 3-4 waffles which took extra time. I don't blame them for making waffles for their entire family at the same time. I waited and waited and finally got to cook my waffle, shaped like Mickey Mouse. The waffle tasted awful - like cardboard. I never use syrup on pancakes or waffles and had to for this waffle since it tasted so awful. However, again - in the hotel's defense - I can understand why they don't offer more convenient breakfast foods - like choices of cereal boxes, milk cartons, fresh fruit, danishes, lots of muffins, lots of bread options, peanut butter or jelly. Because guests could pack an entire cooler with \"to-go\" options to eat later in the day at Disney. I've see that at other hotels - people grabbing food to go as they left to eat on their road trip. This is a great hotel, clean hotel, friendly staff, very close to Disney and a great deal for the money. If you can park at a Disney Park and not worry about the shuttle - do so - it's still a great deal.

The selections included all of the usual choices plus Mickey Mouse shaped do-it-yourself waffles. The dining area was larger than most we have seen in the past and very comfortable.

When we asked if they had any without a fridge or microwave for $69 we were told they all have fridges and microwaves but he would honour the rate!

Free wireless internet was available throughout the hotel and a business centre if you didn't carry your own laptop. Breakfast was good with cereals, yoghurt, juices, pastries and a couple of hot items. Previous reviews have mentioned the location. Although it is a good walk to the restaurants along Apopka Vineland (Red Lobster, Perkins, Olive Garden etc) we did walk, although we would recommend a car for this location. All the staff at the hotel were very friendly but we eventually stayed only 1 night although we had originally booked for 4, as we discovered they were doing a special 4 for the price of 3 offer - but we hadn't been offered this. At the same time we found the Quality Suites next door were doing an exceptional deal on a 1 bed apartment (booked on Booking.com) so we checked out after the first night and moved next door.

Staff was knowledgeable, courteous and friendly in every aspect. Our room was very clean and tastefully appointed. Continental breakfast was very good. We would only stay here again, however, if we had our own vehicle. We asked about complimentary transportation to restaurants within the near radius. They offer no complimentary transportation within the area and restaurants are not real close. They do, however, have complimentary transportation to WDW. On our first day to ride the shuttle the bus driver was not real observant with his stops. He did not come in and see if anyone was waiting. We missed the bus and had to walk across/down the street to meet up with him in order to get a ride to WDW. The bus was filthy dirty, seats were torn and I actually worried about lice and bed bugs in the seat it was so dirty. Also, the schedule did not work well for us for return at the park closing time. There was a lot of wait time for the last bus after the park closed. Upon arrival on our first day we asked them to call a cab for us so we could go eat. They said they could not call a cab for us because they were tied in with the shuttle service company that provides transportation to WDW. We asked them to get us a ride. This service was very expensive for the distance we went. Fee almost as much as a meal. On another occasion we asked them how much a cab fare would be. They could not tell us. We did get the phone number for Yellow Cab [--] and called ourself. The fare was just several dollars plus gratuity. My suggestion would be to use Yellow Cab in lieu of their transportation mode.
