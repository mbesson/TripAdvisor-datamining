{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great long term stay We spend 3 months in Ubud, Bali every year, usually Oct through December. In 2007, we selected ARMA as our hotel for 2008. You can tell a lot about a place when you are there for a long period. ARMA was excellent in all regards (except the food in the restaurants could be more interesting). The beautiful grounds, the access to real Balinese culture and the friendly staff made ARMA special. Our suite was roomy, very clean, luxurious and a good value. The local owners were especially friendly and helpful. We are proud to consider them friends now. There is a very friendly kitty that hangs around the reception desk. Kitty added to the joy of our stay. If you go, pet the kitty and take the Golden Hour tour - it's good. When we left, we were sad, it felt like we were leaving home and family. We look forward to returning for another 3 month stay.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR906309636", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mbw1"}, {"Content": "Exceeded our expectations       Sofa at ARMA", "Date": "Dec 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR220588757", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "chewiegranolabar"}, {"Content": "A special place I probably would have given the ARMA an excellent rating in any event but I especially wanted to do it to overcome the reviewer who gave it a terrible review. Perhaps the difference is that our family of 7 people (including 2 young children) stayed in 2 villas as compared to the reviewer who apparently stayed in a room; I did not see the rooms so cannot comment on them. Our villas were absolutely wonderful! One was the family villa which had 2 structures with one pool. The other was a separate villa with its own pool and jacuzzi; it had 2 showers - one of which had gold fish - and a loft overlooking rice fields. Both were immaculate. Flowers were abundant inside and out. The grounds are dreamlike with a meandering stream, ponds, fountains, sculptures, fish, bridges, etc. It's gorgeous. A woman went around every morning placing offerings at the various garden sculptures. Breakfast was brought to our villa and set up in our gazebo. Wow! By the way, in all regards, I would actually rate the ARMA just as high as the Aman Jiwo in Java which we also stayed at on this trip. Both are very special in their own way. Don't be misled by that poor review. We almost were. We told our travel agent we didn't want to stay there because of the review and only stayed at the ARMA after our Indonesian travel agent, Lek from Remote Destinations, personally visited it and assured us that we would be happy there. (I do have some beautiful photos of the ARMA but we just returned and I shot in RAW.)", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR403425302", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mediatorr"}, {"Content": "Beautiful gardens       Arma Resort garden", "Date": "Dec 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR680034283", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Ttcat"}, {"Content": "Several Problems at the ARMA resort       Arma Resort garden", "Date": "May 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR923702098", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LTK"}, {"Content": "This Hotel is a sample of Paradise I have stayed at the Kokokan many times and will return again soon.
