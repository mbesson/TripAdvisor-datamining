{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great We didn't have a reservation for any rooms in Berlin and we got there at 4 a.m. We were walking around looking for a decent priced hotel when we found Hotel Crystal. It's on Kantstrasse, very near the Savignyplatz Bahn station. Anyway, we got a great deal, great room and the staff was really friendly and helpful. If you're looking for high end hotels, then maybe this hotel is not for you. But if you don't mind staying some place very antique-ish, then this is for you. Our room didn't have a tv, but there's one at the lounge downstairs. It is quite near great places to eat and easy to commute from the hotel too. Great experience, and we are even planning to stay there next time we are in Berlin.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR228350358", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Expatriots forging common bonds I quite literally stumbled upon the Hotel Crystal on arrival in Berlin. The Hotel is centrally located, in Savigny Platz about a 10 minute walk from the Ku-Dam and 5 minutes from the S-Bahn. We had a room on the top floor with balcony facing the tree-lined street. Very quiet, unassuming and gem\u7709tlich. We felt very much at home with our British concierge, Scottish bar friends, and other traveling Americans. If you like a bit of the old world (think Cold War spy movies), you'll love the ambience here.
