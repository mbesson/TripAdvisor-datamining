The room consists of a queen-sized bed, a writing table, and a TV, with ample walking space in between. There is no wardrobe in the room (only a compartment with hangers), but this was not a big issue for us. There is also a bathroom in each room, but without soap and toiletries. Coffee and tea-making facilities are also available. We did not have our breakfast at this hotel as we had already tried the food at Whetstone. However, we know that this hotel provides good English breakfast, buffet-style. Similar to the Whetstone hotel, this hotel also requires a 10-min walk from the nearest tube station.

Our room was really warm, too warm in fact that we had to turn the heating off! The room was clean and the double bed was spacious. The only downside is the sofa bed (not very comfortable), but we are regular campers and took a self inflating air bed for our girls to sleep on. The bathroom was clean, a little on the smallside but adequate. We had clean towels everyday and the beds were also made for us. We didn't use the onsite restuarant, however it looked very clean. The tube is only about a 10 minute walk up the high street and there are plenty of shops. It was very safe.

The service on reception and in the bar / restaurant was very polite and the food was acceptable. The duvet is flatter than an A4 sheet of paper but this is common in all Travelodge\u2019s lately. However the problems are: The walls are as thin as the duvet which means you can hear things you really don\u2019t want to hear when staying on your own in a hotel. Doors banging outside are loud and echo and they bang at 3:00am in the morning. At somewhere around 6:00am a generator comes on and stays on - it is loud so ask for a room at the front of the hotel. And if you are at the back, open the curtains and hey - a lovely brick wall - so pleasant !!! For me - I know its London but this hotel is not worth \u00a3 89.00.

Travelodge frequently have sales that have \u00a310/\u00a312 rooms, even at weekends! (register and they pre warn you when they are going to start) which is astounding for one of the most visited capital cities of the world! Without a doubt, Central London IS stunning! I watched this hotel being built in 2010, at the time I was working in a building diagonally opposite it... and it is still in pristine condition. Crisp, clean rooms, great size, no views but ermmmm we don't stay in hotels to stand at the windows all day and night!! (Dunno about you guys??) ;) No SKY/Freeview, but about 11/13 channels on flat screen TV, fixed on the wall at the end of the bed..Excellent!. Room cold? Turn on the little heaters, room is soon toastie warm. Bathroom clean. Lush double shower. Bring your own bathing products, which is no hassle when you can buy travel size everything anyway. Bed's..We sleep like babies! (Hotel is very sound proofed...Mr Sleep lives here!) This hotel is economy concious, which a good thing for the world and great for the low prices! The staff (\\o Hi Gina..Hi Guys) are friendly and more than helpful and polite. If you want or need anything extra (pillows, tea, sugar, milk etc) you just ask! (It's not rocket science, their training didn't include 'mind reading!), they are MORE than happy to accommodate you. Arriving late? There is a snacks vending machine in reception. If you can't/don't want to get anything to eat at the hotel.. A short walk either way on the Uxbridge Road will bring you to 24hr shops/supermarkets, and various restaurants/fast food outlets open until 2am+. Lots of local pizza places will deliver to the hotel. Staff can provide the numbers or search on your phone or laptop..Wifi free.. and works perfectly! Parking is at a premium in London, so good advice to pre book a car parking space when you are booking your room...that goes for any hotel you want to park your car at in London.If you need to take your car..you need to take your car!. If you need to pay, well pay then! Travelodge only charge when there is little space for parking on their hotel sites. So it's not that there 'money grabbing' about it..What's \u00a35 anyway when the room is dirt cheap??. Trust me, go check out a Central London hotel's parking rates...Ooooohhh it's painful!!. The Ealing Travelodge is located perfectly, and is lucky to have an amazing historical park behind it's hotel, called Walpole Park, which has a fab jazz festival in August! The shopping centre's aren't too bad, (they used to be better but Westfields has killed a lot of local shopping centre's), but they have cute markets within the shopping centre, on certain days, and lots of different, very good restaurants to eat at dotted all over Ealing, turn right out of the hotel and you are spoilt for choice within minutes. Read up about this area before you stay, we have quite a few interesting places to visit. Hotel in a safe area you may wonder??? Well the police station is 2 doors away to the right, so that's a comfort. :o) but I would be very guarded when you walk about, especially at night, be aware, stay safe, don't do stupid things and you should be fine, but that's common sense for every City isn't it? Train station about a 6 minute walk away, turn right out of the hotel. The station has no parking. Overland trains into Paddington and Central London is a 40 minute tube journey. Westfield delicious Shopping Centre is 20 minutes or so. As Ealing Broadway is the first/last stop on the Central Line. You ALWAYS get a seat at least into London...if you get one back ..feel lucky, but once the train returning to Ealing Broadway goes overground at White City~Which is where Westfields is, you get a seat. Bus stops are not far from the hotel going either way. Ealing has fantastic access into, and out of London. Heathrow is about a \u00a330 cab ride away. Don't forget this is a budget hotel, but the Ealing Travelodge feels like a home from home for us..We are already booked for twice in January!!.

We found it easy to drive to (off the M40/A40) BUT be warned - very limited parking on-site. We arrived at 11:30 on a Sunday morning and managed to get a space for three days, but there are only around a dozen places the bulk of which are blue badge spaces. Not sure where the staff would direct you to alternative parking, but having had a look myself, it seems that around \u00a310 per day is the going rate in the area. As we were using the hotel as a base for visiting Central London, it was ideally located for Ealing Broadway station (10 minutes walk) and Central/District line trains. We purchased an Oyster Card each and topped up with \u00a320 - more than enough for our trips into London and a few bus rides in the capital itself. However, be aware that Ealing Broadway is not a London Underground operated station, so to get a refund on the Oyster Card (deposit plus unused cash value) you do need to visit a LU station. We ended up cashing in our Oyster Cards at a Central London station then paid the standard single fare back to Ealing Broadway on our final night. We didn't eat in the hotel, but there are a number of restaurants around the Ealing Broadway Centre area - we ate at Pizza Express. Also a number of places to get breakfast on the way to the station if you are travelling into London. The only major issue we found with the hotel is that it is on the departure flight path from Heathrow, so aircraft are flying low over the building from early morning until late in the night.

Oh boy, how picky are people. This is a GREAT hotel, its fresh (in a sense its a new building) and possibly the best Travelodge i've ever stayed in. The lighting in the hallways is pretty slick - as you walk, they turn on - even the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn didn't have the kind of interior did. So I was in London for a few days and stayed in three hotels. Crowne Plaza was first and of course that was going to be a pleasurable stay with great beds, room luxurious etc. Next up was Holiday Inn express was next and was okay (free breakfast ftw). Could compare it with Travelodge as it was that kinda level in terms of room size. Travelodge Ealing was the last hotel I was going to be staying in during my trip in London and to be honest, i wasn't looking forward to it - judging by the comments on here. It was an excellent stay, FREE wifi (even the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn didn't provide) plus there was a new lounge/food area beside the reception which 'looked' very slick. The rooms were great, simple and basic. of course no toilettries were given, just the soap... but then again this is expected of a budget hotel. Bed was great, room decor was nice with orange lighting behind the bed. Carpets, sheets and towels were nice and fresh. I don't know what else to say but i will be coming back here. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the nearest station (ealing broadway - walk out the station, take a left, take a right at the traffic lights and walk for 10 mins and you'll see it on the left hand side beside office blocks and a police station).

On the positive, this hotel is in a good location and everything is still in pretty new condition. However, as soon as the Premier Inn being built opposite opens, we would stay there first every time. The rooms are fairly small and sparse but we found this ok since everything still felt new and clean. Did think cost cutting had gone a bit far as other reviews have mentioned. For example, no shelf in the shower was a pain as was no phone in the room and no lock on the bathroom door. Also only provided one spare pillow between two to supplement the thin ones on the bed and (as mentioned by others) only got one set of towels. Noise was the thing we struggled with most. Maybe if you are a really sound, heavy sleeper you would be fine, but we clearly are not! Why the doors couldn't have been fitted with soft closers we couldn't understand (more cost cutting?)?!?! They slammed all night. Also the room we had on the first night faced onto the car park barrier. Everytime a new guest arrived (into the small hours) it buzzed and creaked open then clanked closed. Also, there is an intercom on the car park barrier and we could hear every word. After very little sleep on the first night we asked to change rooms at reception. Again, as mentioned in other reviews, the lady on reception, although she did arrange a room change, was not friendly or even polite. She silently tapped away on the computer for several minutes then gave us a new key card.

On calling them they told us they could not accept bookings over the telephone and only on the internet, this was not too much of a problem for us but for the older generation it could be a problem. On checking in we informed them we have 2 books, 1 for the Sunday night and 1 for Monday to Friday. The reception person said no problems leave it with me to book you in, give us our keys and told us we were on the 3rd floor. Sunday nights sleep was fine except the constant slamming of doors, but at the end of the day your in a hotel so you have to expect it. The room we had, consisted of only 1 set of towels for 2 people! On the Monday night we were in bed and 3 random people walked into our room with another key... NOT VERY GOOD. In the morning I talked to the front receptionist for 30 mins and she explained that our room had been reallocated as we had not checked in????? Then she went on to tell me our room keys had been reset and we had to pay for the whole week. How nice is that. I, like a fool, paid for the rest of the week and accepted her apologies. As it turns out or new flat was ready so we checked out on the Wednesday morning and they told me that they would give me a refund for the 2 days which we did not stop in the hotel.... As of yet and hours on the telephone, emails and visits I still have not had a a refund. The manager never returns my calls and now they are saying they have no record of my stay.... To say this is a new hotel is a joke.. the room had loads of faults, lights not working and marks / scraps on the walls. The rooms are very spars as well... not wardrobes here! The maid when she bothered to clean our room insisted on putting out 1 set of towels so we were constantly going to the reception to ask for more. BTW they have no phone in the rooms to call the reception. I would not stay here ever again and never recommend it.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "portsmouth,", "Title": "\u201cCan't see what the proble is\u201d", "Author": "bru1955", "ReviewID": "UR116562626", "Content": "We booked to stay here prior to going to Heathrow as we knew that the tube went from Northfields or South Ealing and it was easier than getting up in the early of the morning to travel from home.

A 10 minute walk gets you to the Underground which can spirit you away direct to the West End shows. The carpark it boasts is small and most spaces are disabled-dedicated so dont count on getting in. Alternatives are unknown to us. Its very tight but it seems secure enough. The Hotel is clean and tidy throughout. Most staff members were pleasant and helpful, except for the lady cleaning the room in the morning who appeared to have her own agenda into which guests did not fit. The room was a huge disappointment. minimalist may well be in, but it bordered on unfurnished to the amateur eye. We had a family room and it was spacious but seemed spartan, with solely one chair and a smaller than normal dressing table. Wardrobe and clothes facilities were extremely reduced to what I would normally expect. The bathroom/toilet was adequate if not a little cramped, especially for those of larger proportions such as myself. the most striking feature of the room was the floor to ceiling frosted window, which permitted reduced light to enter but did not afford a view. The room therefore felt somewhat claustrophobic despite its large size. We had breakfast there and whilst the cooked menu omitted some of the normal items it was well presented and of reasonable quality. The continental menu looked to expected standards. All in all teh hotel did what we wanted from it, acting as a base for our excursion. That made it satisfacory. We woudl have been unable to spend much time in the room in daylight hours because of the window. We are assured that only the rooms atthe back that directly overlook residents are so equipped.

Ophelia, who never returns calls, eventually contacted the housekeeper who had found it and reluctantly agreed to post it to me (for which I was grateful) providing if I ever stayed in a Travelodge again I wouldn't expect the same service! Needless to say it was never sent and after telephoning 4 times and leaving messages I gave up and bought a new one.

We traveled from Manchester to see a concert in Hyde Park at 3pm so we arrived at 1:30pm understanding that check in was 3pm but asked if it was possible to check in. We were told there is a \u00a310 charge to check in early, to save the extra cash I said we will wait until we get back from the concert at round 10pm but got told we wouldn't have a room then! I had already pre paid for the room so couldn't understand why this was. The abrupt receptionist said 'It's just the way it is'. She said THEY NEVER CLOSE THEIR ONLINE BOOKING SYSTEM! So thay can receive booking after booking online even if they're full which I find bizzare. So reluctantly we paid the \u00a310 to check in early. This was after waiting nearly 15 minutes at reception as there was a sign up saying 'The receptionist is working in another department, please press buzzer for attention', we pressed 3 times and by this time there were 6 other people waiting behind us. Got to the room, there was no shower gel, no shampoo, 2 plastic cups in the bathroom, no shelves for your clothes, a pole sticking out the wall to hang your clothes on, I know it sounds petty but no shelf in the shower to put soap, shower gel ect. on. Although I found an empty bottle of shampoo from the Ramada on the floor in bathroom... I had a shower in the morning and realized there was only one towel, so thought I would give reception a call to ask for another, but there was no phone in the room. So had to go downtairs from the 5th floor to ask. When we checked out the there was no receptionist again so just left our key on the desk.

BIG mistake - they treat you like prisoner here! No amenities, no services and, to top it all, the staff here seems to believe that customer service is optional! The staff here (especially the morning staff named Ophelia and John) seem to be recruited out of a prison-warden school. Very rude and unhelpful - let alone going out to their way, the staff here make it seem like they are doing you a great and personal favour for even things that every single other hotel in the world happily do for you. If you complain, they threaten to throw you out of the hotel if you do not shut-up! If you ask them for a manager to complain to, they shout at you! Indeed, the ability to shout at paying customers seems to be one of the qualifications they look for here! And it was not just me - When I was there, the staff was also shouting at a disabled person, who they had unceremoniously roused out of bed early in the morning and then completely abandoned outdoors (over his car - which was parked, with full permission, outside the hotel). The chap was very stressed and the staff were very uncaring - let alone an apology, they did not even bother to be polite over their mistake. If you are only looking for a bed for a night (no expectations of other things like food/service/politeness/or anything else a hotel is supposed to provide), then this might be fine - for a more hotel-like experience look elsewhere.
