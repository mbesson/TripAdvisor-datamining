Actually, you can even walk to Suntec Convention Center and the Esplanade if you're in no hurry. The hotel is fairly new, so it's very clean. We only had two carry-on luggage with us, so the size of the room wasn't an issue. We were in Singapore to go out and see the sights and not to hang out in the room, anyway. The furniture was decent, the design minimalist. WiFi connection is decent as well. It's true, though, that according to some reviewers, the walls seem to be too thin. You can hear vacuuming in the morning. And, get this, one night when my husband and I got back at the hotel, we actually heard a couple in one of the rooms having \"an awesome time\"---if you get what I mean. Might not want to run the risk of hearing something awkward when you're in this hotel with kids. But overall, we would stay at this hotel again because of the great location and cleanliness. And by the way, we were accommodated for check-in (by a friendly lobby staff at that) even if our flight got in at past 1AM already. Just don't forget to shoot an email to the hotel beforehand to inform them if you're checking in late.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDungeon like rooms!!\u201d", "Author": "CGC1983", "ReviewID": "UR125158080", "Content": "Stay away from this hotel of you don't want to suffocate yourself.

We booked for Superior room without breakfast as posted at booking.com. Easy check-in, no waiting took place but when we get into the room we have trouble positioning our luggages because the room was so tiny and with our luggage the space left for us was the bed and the restroom. Because we find it uncomfortable to move in a very limited space we requested to be upgraded to the higher category of room Executive Deluxe but it was full so we waited for 2 days to be upgraded. On the last night of our stay we were upgraded to Deluxe with breakfast with additiional 50 Singapore Dollar- it was not a problem because we wanted a much bigger space to move around. We let the hotel move our stuff and when we came back from Suntec Conventiion Hall we found out the Executive Deluxe room was still very small, so I went downt o the reception and asked whether we are in the rigth room and they told me yes, so I asked what size is the Deluxe and what size is superior because it is the same. And they told me the size is the same and the only difference between Executive Deluxe and Superior is that Executive Deluxe - it has window and breakfast while Superior room has no window and no breakfast. I was a little bit disappointed because for 2 days we've been living like sardines in the room and the staff were not helpful in explaining the difference between superior and executive deluxe rooms. But I thought it's done and I could not do anything about it, so it's ok, one more night and it's over. The following morning we went into breakfast only to find out they served only porridge. My companion told me we should have not upgraded ourselves and we could have enjoyed eating in a decent restaurant with our $50. It's the same anyway, so we might as well enjoy the food in Singapore with our $50 instead of spending it for window and porridge.
