The hotel is 3 stars, but I would rate it 4+.The location is walking distance from the center of the city, so we never took the cab. Breakfast was included and was great. Rooms a very clean and good size. Front desk was very helpfull. The only minus is that there is not enough information about different tours and excursions at the front desk.

We found it to be a solid, reasonable 3-star hotel in the city center. The location is not in the dead center of the city, however it's only 15 minute walk from Plaza Mayor, in a nice and relativety quiet neighborhood, metro is just two steps away. Puerta de Atocha train station also easily reachable by bus (line C2), which was important for us. The room was of adequate size, furniture nice, bathroom clean and modern. The buffet breakfast was very nice, good variety and quality of food. Check-in was quick and hassle-free. The reception staff spoke English and overall were nice. The hotel has free wi-fi in rooms, very convenient.The room had a nice flat-screen TV, but unfortunately only few channels were available and for some reason the picture quality was bad to the point of unusable. This is a minor complaint, as watching TV was not our primary goal in Madrid :-).I readily recommend this hotel as a very reasonable place to stay in Madrid city center for sightseeing of business.", "Date": "Jul 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR493386553", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Leonid"}, {"Content": "This Hotel was Great ! Me and my partner had a four day trip to Madrid in July of this year. We were wary of city centre hotels abroad as we booked for Rome last year and ended up miles out of the city !!!. Not this time. The Ganivet was roughly 10 mins walk from the City Centre with a Metro stop literally at the bottom of the road. It was fantastic location. Not too far out but far enough out from the hustle and bustle of city life as Madrid is extremely busy. If you caught the open top tour bus again, this stopped at the bottom of the road. We were pleasantly suprised when we opened the door to find a clean, air conditioned room, which was very modern and had excellent facilities and clean towels on a daily basis. The bathroom was really well equipped with an excellent power shower. I would say this is top end 3*. We could not review the breakfast however because we eat out every day. I would not hesitate to recommend this Hotel to anyone and were certainly return here if we ever went back to Madrid....!!!", "Date": "Jul 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR997993444", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Collier886"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel as well as location       Ganivet Hotel", "Date": "Jun 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR785268225", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "russ6212"}, {"Content": "Excellent hotel       Looking towards bathroom", "Date": "Apr 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR640834549", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Heclsm78"}, {"Content": "Great hotel We've just returned from a 4 day trip to Madrid and we loved this hotel. i would rate it as Excellent if it wasn't the fact that we booked a triple room and the room became too small for 3adults.

The hotel is not as it may appear on many websites as it has had a full re-fit last year and is really rather nice (some sites have some very old photos which no longer apply as the Ganivet is now under the ownership of Porcel Hotels) The place seems to have been completely gutted and refurbished from the floor up. The facade has also been re-rendered together with the bank alongside it.The beds were very comfortable, the shower was powerful and the bath comfortable. The windows are now double glazed and we didn't hear anything from the road at any time during our stay. Our room was climate controlled, had an LCD television and a safe. The fixtures and fittings are of a high quality.The Ganivet provided a very pleasant environment to stay in and was largely at the top end of 3 stars. Breakfast was acceptable but sometimes a little warm instead of hot which we mentioned on our departure. There is a lack of local restaurants, unless you want something along the lines of Tapas or very traditional food. You'd need to jump on the Metro two stops to Opera and wander up the Calle de Arenal to find a great selection of restaurants.We stayed for three nights, the reception staff were very efficient, the lift wasn't a problem at all as other reviewers have noted. All in all, a trouble free stay in an excellent standard of accommodation which we got at a very good rate.
