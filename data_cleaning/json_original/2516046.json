It was on the tail-end of a week and a half on the West Coast. I was worried about the area, after I booked I was told horror stories about west hollywood, but everything worked out perfectly. The 'room' I rented was actually the cottage suite. Our parking spot was in the driveway, fenced in. Kitchen: Large kitchen with stove-top, oven, sink, and full-size fridge. Fully stocked with cooking materials 9pots, pans, plates, bowls, forks, knives). There is no microwave (weird) so be aware when you go grocery shopping. Everything is clean, and they have garbage bags, sponges, soap, etc. The rest of the suite: Living room has two couches and a chair, large TV with Direct TV. Dining room table was big. I was ironing in the living room with the window AC unit on, and I blew a fuse/circuit. They sent someone out in 5-10 minutes to fix this. Bedroom: Bedroom was CRAMPED. The king-size bed took up basically the whole room. There is a TV you can watch while laying down. There is a door that leads to the driveway in the bedroom. NOTE-they rent a spot in the driveay to a food-truck (tacos or something) so early in the morning you hear them banging around outside loading the truck, and around twilight they are back parking the truck. It wasn't too much of a bother, but some people wouldn't like this. Area: There is a Trader Joe's nearby, so we stocked up on cheap wine and easy-prep meals. we also walked to Hollywood Blvd and ate at a sushi place in the plaza that has the kodak theatre. The area is fine, don't beleive people that say its ghetto.

The cottage was bigger and nicer than we expected and was priced well under what I would expect to pay for this type of accomodation in Los Angeles. The Cottage consisted of a full kitchen that was well stocked, a living room with flat screen tv, dining room, large bathroom and a good sized bedroom with a second flat screen tv. The bedroom also had doors out to a wrap-around deck. The cottage seemed much more like our home away from home than a hotel room. There are some differences to this type of hotel than a regular hotel room that people should be aware of. These are not bad things and I actually really liked the concept. I never met anyone in person from the hotel as we arrived late and the code to enter the cottage had been emailed to me. The keys, welcome info and credit card receipt were waiting for us when we arrived. We did not have housekeeping in our cottage while there but there were plenty of towels, etc for us .I also knew this going in and was fine with it. Villa Delle Stelle is located in a residential area about 1/2 mile or so from all the major attractions on Hollywood Boulevard and was within easy walking distance. The Enchanted Cottage was a bit difficult to find at night as the address was actually located on the curb. Maybe just operator error on my part but good information to know. Parking is tight but sufficientand is free. About the only issue we had was that the hotel specified parking for compact cars only and the people staying in the villa next to us had a very large SUV. This made it next to impossible to park in our designated spot but I solved that issue buy just parking behind them. The hotel staff said they would resolve the parking issue and we never saw the SUV again...not sure if they checked out or were asked to park elsewhere. Either way, it appears all of the villas have free parking but they mean when they say large cars or trucks won't fit. The villa also had Direct TV connected to the tv's and the villa was wired for free wi-fi. The wi-fi worked ok but at times was quite slow. This could have been due to some bad weather and didn't affect us much at all. Overall, this is an excellent option in Hollywood...especially for someone who doesn't need or want all the normal hotel amenities.

All very different and as I said 'querky'. My one little moan was I wasn't quite prepared for a fast food truck to be parked up on the drive next to our window that night. This normally wouldn't have been a problem if it wasn't for the fact we were still trying to adjust to LA time and desperately needed sleep.

Inside we had a queen bed (very comfortable!), with a flat screen TV, and another in the living room, both with satellite TV. There was an air conditioning unit installed as well. The living room also had an electric fireplace, but it didn\u2019t seem to be working. The bathroom was quite cramped, but it got the job done.

The main office is a block away, so you can ask them questions, but they close at 3pm. I believe that they provide you with # of the owners in case there are any emergencies after hours. They only provide housekeeping every 6 days, so no one came the whole time we were there but we preferred it that way. We had more than enough towels, soap, etc, although they would have brought more if we\u2019d called. They do provide room service but you have to order 24 hours in advance.

Our hearts sank at the sight of this, but the rooms themselves were lovely (although very, very dark). We stayed in the neo-classical suite which is basically a small apartment. The bedroom was a fair size, and had the best mattress and pillows (although the bed linen needs an update), the kitchen fully-equipped, the bathroom very nice. The Dining room, however, is just a dark room with a table in the middle of it and a huge sofa around it. Needs some re-thinking. The apartment is nicely furnished with some interesting bits. The bathroom was great and there were lots of plush towels. The area is not that nice, but close to restaurants and you see the Hollywood sign every day. I tried to find someone at the office every day as I had some questions, but no one ever answered. You are really on your own.

It was nice to walk right up to the entry of our suite, find the key in the location emailed to us before we arrived, and settle in ... a definite change from the usual \"hotel\" check-in. We liked the feeling that we were staying in an apartment rather than just a hotel room. The suite features all the amenities of an apartment ... full kitchen with stove, fridge, sink, dishwasher, and all the dishware, utensils, pots and pans you would need to make all of your meals. There's even coffee, tea, sugar and creamer, enough to get you through the first morning! Just beyond the kitchen is a dining room that is available to guests which was a pleasant surprise. The bathroom is equipped with a hairdryer, full-size bottles of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, moisturizer, yummy towels and, the best part, a rainshower shower head ... my husband said he would come back just for that! The bed is one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. We like it cool when we sleep and the A/C unit was perfect! My only complaint for the entire stay is that, on our second night, we could hear the guests in the suite above sliding furniture about but, thankfully, we were only inconvenienced for a short time. The location suited our needs for this trip. We came down from Northern California to attend a taping of a show at a studio within walking distance of Ville Delle Stelle. Hollywood was central to the all of the activities we had planned during our short stay, including a visit to the original Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles which is less than half a block away! (As a side note ... go to the Roscoe's on Pico ... better for people/celebrity watching!) I lived in Los Angeles for 10 years so I am comfortable navigating around this city, and I feel very safe on the streets surrounding VDS, but I can see how some may not. We had no problem walking to and from the Arclight theater 3 blocks away. (Another side note ... the Arclight was awesome! We bought our tix in the morning for the evening show. They offer reserved seating so you can stroll in 5 minutes before the start! Just don't be late) The room features a very informative binder with information about local attractions as well as maps and taxi info.

It would be great to see more investment and regeneration in the Hollywood area in recognition of unique history.", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cVilla Delle Stelle - Cosy home in LA\u201d", "Author": "Geoff_1979", "ReviewID": "UR13119128", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed at Villa Delle Stelle in September 2007 for 5 days during our 2 week holiday touring California. We had a splendid 5 days in LA especially thanks to Villa Delle Stelle. First off it is in an excellent location to easily find your way to all the central attractions in LA as well as bars and restaurants on Sunset Strip. Villa Delle Stelle itself is LA's best kept secret. It is a cosy home in the big city. We stayed in the ground floor apartment, and came away with no complaints. Loads of space, good size living room with plasma tv, dining room, kitchen, bath room and bedroom. Everything is spotless and in good working order. You really do feel like at home in Villa Delle Stelle. Just down the road from Villa Delle Stelle are some local shops for you to stock up on groceries. If your not familiar with the area and you are driving there from the airport, you might want to get Sat Nav with your car, but its not too hard to find. After our long flight, we were so happy to get to Villa Delle Stelle and put our feet up. As I said before the location is perfect, all of LA's main attractions are close by and it is also within easy reach of the freeway if you want to explore further out of the city. We visisted Venice beach and Santa Monica a couple of times during our stay and would recommend you do too. Santa Monica is beautiful and you cant beat an afternoon on the beach (don't forget plenty of sun cream) their after visiting the shops inland. I don't have a single bad word to say about Villa Delle Stelle, but a couple of things you might want to consider before visiting LA. If your from England don't be expecting a City Center full of bars. If you want a lot of night life do a little planning to as where the bars you want to go to are. Although you will find quite a few on Sunset strip, as well as fine places to eat. Second thing, just chill out and enjoy LA.", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Villa Delle Stelle", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d621153-Reviews-Villa_Delle_Stelle-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$182 - $285*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">6087 Harold Way</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Hollywood</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90028</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516046", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0d/81/0d814a417e8756755ddbd69df6ac98d18large.jpg"}}
