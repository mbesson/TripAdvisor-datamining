The location is fantastic, within walking distance to the campus. There's also a huge shopping mall 2 blocks away with free wifi, McDs, movie theater, as well as, a taxi stand always readily available. In addition, there are 4 grocery stores steps away & endless dining possibilities on Rue Ste Catherine a block away. Problem is that the bldg itself is very outdated. Besides the nice lobby & great security system (front desk guard 24/7 & keyless entry required), the units themselves are falling apart or maybe I just got unlucky. They call themselves an executive apt. but I find there are more students residing on the premises than professional businessmen. The photos on their website is very misleading though there is an indoor pool, sauna, laundry facility onsite, a gym, cleaning service at additional expense, indoor garage parking, internet & cable service as stated.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cNOT a hotel anymore!\u201d", "Author": "Larryliscious", "ReviewID": "UR23671409", "Content": "I last stayed at the Montfort five years ago and it excellent and economical so I now that I'm planning another visit to MTL, I decided to try it again.

One area they could improve on is the elevator system, which is terrible. During the day the house cleaning staff use the main elevators and tie it up from guests trying to get to or from their rooms. Additionally the front desk staff don't always answer the telephone in a quick fashion probably due to low or non existant staff being at the counters. However the location is perfect for any visitor to Montreal and its a few blocks away from almost any where you would like to go. Two metros within walking distance. Main streets of Ste. Catherine & Sherbrooke a short walk away. Two shopping centers and easy access to the main highway system in Canada. Staff is very friendly, place is very clean and yeah at times there are a noisy element especially during the summer months. Pool is wonderful, sauna and weight room and well as game room available, under ground secure parking with easy access a plus. Fine eating and dinning across the street at Chez Ennios as well as your local fare of McDonals and Wendys as well as Post Office and hospitals within walking dstance. All and all a great place to stay. Highly recommend this hotel. But be prepared as I said to wait for an elevator, especially if your room is on a floor higher than Floor 8..! You couls always use the stairs...", "Date": "November 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener,Ontario", "Title": "\u201cgreat family accomadations\u201d", "Author": "sharmc_11", "ReviewID": "UR1730421", "Content": "We almost didn't stay here because of Jan.2004 review.
