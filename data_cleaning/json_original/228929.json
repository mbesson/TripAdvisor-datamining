Yes you can walk about rome with the glint of adventure and discovery in your eye, and trust me EVERY day you will find more, but after 3 days (as i found out) catching the buses about really helps. Soooo cheap too. Fantastic staff. Reception (blonde lady and joe, porters and wait staff at breakfast) even when busy managed really well. We had routes highlighted each day from reception on a map, bookings made for us in advance for the trip to the Vatican, breakfast food was great, the choice of pastry, fruit, bacon and eggs, bread, meat and cheese, juice, coffee, cereal and more. It really was a great variety. The room was comfortable and clean with a safe and fridge (buy a bottle to keep chilled) the shower was powerful and over all 9/10 it only misses the last point beacuse we would have loved to see the Da Vinci code or other related movies in bed, but really who goes away to watch tv???

First of all this hotel was the one of the worst places I have ever stayed at. I know its not a JW Marriott but seriously who ever rated this as a 4 star was drinking to much Vino. The first night we checked it our room was not ready as it was spose to be ready at 2:00. After traveling all night from the US I just wanted to check in and get ourselves together to start our vacation. Room wasnt ready until 3:45 at least they did comp a bottle of wine. The toilet ran for like 15 min after flushing. When you open the door to enter the room it hit the bed. Air did not work or the fan. We were told that there was a city ordenance and they couldnt turn it on but at least the fan should of worked. We ask to change rooms due to it being so noisy. So they moved us up a floor but was so lucky to be next to the elevator lift. Room bigger but still noisy. There is no bar,gym or restaurant. They do serve breakfast but you can count on waiting to get a table ( i think there was like 10 in there) and they served the same thing each morning. The coffee machine was a joke! 1 lift for the entire hotel and it was extremely slow. I timed it one time it took 3.5 min for the elevator to make it from the 3rd floor to the main lobby. Last but not least this hotel is not in a central location if you are wanting to hit the main sites.

When we got back to the hotel at about 5 PM our room was prepared and our bags already up there. Also on the day we were leaving they kept our bags from the time we checked out (~10:30) to when we needed to go for the train (~16:00). Breakfast is excellent with a wide choice available, I would recommend it completely. Having eaten breakfast we found we didn't need more than a snack at lunch time to keep us going to the evening. The economy room we stayed in was at the back on the third floor, not much of a view (but then it was an economy room) but the room was spacious, nice shower room with toilet and bidet. The bed was also very comfortable and more than enough storage space (3 wardrobes and several drawers), also a safe in the room. TV showing a variety of channels is several languages. Nice restaurants nearby too. We found the hotel to be well situated, only about 200m from a bus route (62) that goes direct to the Vatican, most of the other sites you want to see are within walking distance, and only about 1km from the Roma Termini, Leonardo Express is a direct train from there to there to the airport.

The hotel is less than 10 minutes walk from the Terminus and with a bus outside the door who could ask for anything more? The staff here were excellent and any request was attended to at once. Great knowledge of all sites and map of central Rome given on arrival, discussed with us and key locations highlighted. Pocket sized Guide book given at breakfast identifying churches, museums, routes and maps. Pleasant rooms, not overly large but clean. classy and comfortable. The bar was stocked for a night cap not a session. Breakfast was excellent, with plenty of variety and the room layout allowed for a lot of movement. Friendly hard working staff on duty.

If we were staying longer then I would have thought long and hard about upgrading to a larger room - but for a short stay it was fine. The breakfast that was included in the already cheap price was great. All you could wish for: from fruit and cereal to a 'full English' with everything inbetween. Great way to set you up for the day and the breakfast staff were polite, cheerful and helpful too. Free [fast] internet meant we could keep up with the family back home and research for the next days adventures too. All in all - more than we expected for the price and would happily come back and stay at this hotel again. As others have said - good clean and safe location: easy access to to the main station 'Termini' or very close to bus connections to all parts of Rome - we caught buses to the Vatican, Pantheon, Forum and Collessium from 'just around the corner' ... Oh and the restaurant directly across from the hotel was nice too! -", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crofton, Maryland, United States", "Title": "\u201cDelightful place to stay in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Richard P", "ReviewID": "UR125417285", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Gambrinus for 2 weeks in February 2012 and used it as a base of operations for our visit to Rome, Florence, Assisi, Pompei, and Amalfi.

Nothing about close attractions or restaurants which it seemed everyone else was given upon check in. This wasn\u2019t really a problem for us as we had done our research and knew where everything was in advance, it just would have been nice. As other reviewers have said, the rooms are small but it didn\u2019t bother us. The rooms were a bit outdated and a few of the things were broken in our room. The toilet seat was wonky so whenever it was sat on it slid to one side and the shaving mirror had broken completely that it wouldn\u2019t stay in an upright position. The shower leaked a little but there were enough towels that this wasn\u2019t a major issue. The toilet door also didn\u2019t shut properly and didn\u2019t even have a lock. We were there for the sights, not the room. It was cosy enough that it was lovely to return to after a long days walking. The hotel is in a good location. It is a bit far out but we walked everywhere and found that wherever we walked it was beautiful which made the walking a lot more enjoyable. It is about 10/15 minutes from the Termini, 25 minutes away from the Trevi Fountain and about 40 minutes away from the Colosseum. There are also a lot of restaurants around. We only visited a few and they were all good. There is a tabacchi across the street where you can buy a travel pass although we didn\u2019t do this. Down the road from the hotel is a lovely little shop called MiaCasa. It is more of a homewares shop but they do ornaments of some of the major attractions in Rome which are a million times better quality than the ones you can buy off street sellers and in the souvenir shops. They were a lot bigger and have a lot more detail so if you are after something like this it would be worth going there for it. The hotel staff were overall very helpful and friendly. We found the female staff to be more friendly and more helpful. They helped with booking tickets, making reservations for restaurants and printing our boarding passes for our flight back. One tip we would give is don\u2019t use the tour guide they use; Green Line Tours. We booked one and were gutted with what we got. We paid \u20ac59 each for a tour of the Vatican that lasted about an hour and a half and to cut costs they did the tour in both English and Spanish. This got really annoying as you had to keep stopping whilst she said the same thing in Spanish and got a little boring when it was something long that was being said. The tour could have been a lot better and we could have seen more had they just done it in English. We also had to sit on the coach for about 15 minutes whilst we waited for the tour guide to come out. Breakfast at the hotel for me was terrible. The cooked food was very salty which made it inedible to me. A lot of other people seemed to enjoy it so it is more a matter of personal taste. There was a huge selection to choose from ranging from cereal, bread, cakes, cooked meats, cheese, cereal, pastries, bacon, sausage and egg. It would have been better if there was more selection of hot foods to choose from. The pastries are also coated in sugar making them very sweet. It would probably be worth looking for somewhere else for breakfast. They also have two drinks machines which do all sorts of drinks ranging from hot chocolate to coffee, although the sugar in the hot chocolate settled at the bottom and took a lot of stirring to get rid of it. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would say the hotel is more of a 3 star establishment than 4 star. We went to Rome to see the sights so the room wasn\u2019t too bad, just a place to sleep really. If we were to return to Rome we would probably go with a different hotel although wouldn\u2019t turn this one down.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice staff and great location\u201d", "Author": "wharky", "ReviewID": "UR124921117", "Content": "Lovely hotel in a great location.

The summer of 2011, As I traveled through Italy with my husband, daughter and son in our first trip to Italy, we stayed at the Hotel Gambrinus after visiting four other Italian cities. we arrived by car, having rented one to leave Florence and explore Tuscany. After facing the crazy one way streets and disorienting directions that led to our hotel, my husband was happy to drop us all of at the lobby to head over to the car rental place to return the car. I proceeded to check the family into two adjoining rooms and to unpack to take advantage of the free afternoon for sightseeing when he returned. It wasn't long before I noticed our video camera missing. It was a brand new $600 Sony I had just purchased to document our vacation and whose video I was also counting on including in a secret, this is your life type of presentation I was hoping to present my daughter with the following month as birthday gift. The memories, more than the value of the camera itself, was what was most important to me. I asked the young girl at the desk to help me track down the car from the rental company, convinced I had left it inside. She got me through to some voice mails that I couldn't understand. I felt hopeless and when my husband finally arrived we decided to return to the car rental to check in person. We left that afternoon to explore Rome without my joy in my heart. The dispatcher at the rental company assured us that the car was no longer in the shop as it had already been re-rented and nothing was found inside. I was crushed. Several hours later, after visiting the fountain of Trevi, the Spanish steps and having a very nice dinner we returned to the hotel to unexpected news. The same young girl at the desk, whom we later found out was named Ilaria, was the daughter of the owner, and was on her first week at the front desk of the family business, had stayed on the phone for two hours after we left. She found the manager of the car rental company, insisted on further investigation into the loss of our camera and actually got it returned! We not only got out video camera but our memories back. I came back to the states and finished my daughter's video surprise, which made my daughter thrilled and my husband cry. We could not be more happy to recommend Fabio's hotel, or his daughter Ilaria's hospitality. These are the types of family businesses that help us remember why family businesses are still so important in our society. This is where the larger, maybe more luxurious hotels can't compete. It's in the sensibility of a 17 year old girl understanding what it would mean to a 15 year old that her mother had spent years saving videos of her to gift her during a coming of age birthday party. Thank you Ilaria. We are grateful for your honesty, hard work and the serious responsibility you take to work with you every day. Work ethic matters at any age. You are a proven professional already.

Rome was our first leg after 29 hours of flying from Melbourne, via Hong Kong and London. So you can imagine we were both a tad tired on arrival. The week before leaving, I had checked the Airport web site for details on Taxi costs and length of drive from the airport to the city. As the airport website warned of being conned by illegitimate cab drivers, I emailed the hotel asking if they provided a transfer service. They were very prompt in responding advising they could arrange a car transfer at a cost of 60\u20ac which compared very well to the amounts quoted on the airport website. We were met as we came out of customs by the driver with our names written on a sign. From that first experience to the moment we left all I can say is that the hotel and it's people were fantastic! They welcomed us, made my mum feel special all the time. From the reception team to the people running the breakfast room (really great food - very tasty and many options) - you were all brilliant. The owner even came up to us at breakfast and had a chat. I had no problems with the location - always felt safe. We walked all over Rome and just got a cab back to the hotel. The rooms are small, as were the showers in both rooms (but then again - I could afford to lose 30 kilos!) but are tastefully appointed. Also very clean. I asked reception to arrange a couple of things for my mum as a surprise and they did so with great interest and joy. As a surprise, they helped me arrange a 1/2 day classic Fiat tour even coming out to check out the car and wave to my mum as we drove off. Guys - all hotels offer the same service a place to sleep and feel safe whilst away from home. What differentiates one from the other is the overall customer experience. The Gambrinus Hotel Rocks!!! And this is because of the great team behind the brand. You made my mum feel so special - thank you so much.

We watched an older woman wait through four buses before she finally pushed her way on. The front desk personal is very helpful - especially Dano and Roberta. They speak very good English, and are willing to give pointers on areas to see and do in Rome. We did not get the name of another of the desk clerks - who looked like an overly-tanned George Hamilton. Do NOT ask him for directions - he says \"everything is easy\". His directions are too confusing and nowhere close to where he says. Our reservation had said \"option to upgrade to contemporary room\" but we were never given the option to see a \"regular\" room.

The breakfast had a good selection of food; loads of pastries, cereals, breads, cooked ham, fruit, scrambled egg, tea, coffee and a range of juices - breakfast is served from 7 - 10 and would recommend getting there early ish for a better selection of the pastries. The hotel is in a PERFECT location. It is about a 10 minute walk from a main strip of restaurants which includes the famous hard rock cafe (which won the best hard rock in 2010) amongst this there are many other great restaurants. We didn't eat a bad meal in Rome and ate at this strip most nights. Also the Pizzeria directly opposite the hotel served up the best pizza we had in Rome! and was very well priced. Also location wise the hotel is in walking distance of the Spanish steps, Trevi fountain, Piazza novona, campo di fiori and the pantheon all ranging from 10-25 minute walk max. The hotel itself was lovely. All the staff, particularly reception and breakfast waiter, were very friendly and helpful. We had to ring green line tours to confirm our trip to Naples and Pompei and had to also ring and confirm our shuttle service to the hotel which the front desk were happy to do for us. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND GOING TO POMPEI!!!!!!!!! The room was nicely decorated and well cleaned everyday, even if you decide to have a morning off and stay in the hotel room it will still get cleaned in the afternoon. Free wi-fi was available in the lobby but had to pay a cost for it in the room. However we didn't have time to sit around on the internet as there is so much to see in Rome. When we got to the Colosseum we were asked if we wanted to do a tour which included the roman forum and Palentine hill, skipping the queue's. This was 100% value for money. The lady's name who does part of the tour is Elaine and she also does tours of the Vatican and we skipped a 3 hour queue for doing the tour with her.

Vatican City, Coliseum were maybe 20 minutes walk if going directly but of course we stopped and shopped and made many detours. Breakfast selections maybe not the greatest, but breakfast staff was attentive and cheerful. 2 self serve coffee makers were a plus. Rooms are clean and updated. Very nice bath area! There is free wireless in the lobby area and pay wireless in the rooms. Used the free wireless in lobby as the desk clerk recommended against the pay wireless and that was fine. Two doors down the street is some sort of embassy and there are armed guards sitting outside. I think those are the guns the Canadians are talking about. Frankly, I saw them as a source of comfort.

We had subsequent nights booked at the Marriott Grand Flora on Via Veneto, and we walked there and it took only about 10 minutes and an easy and pleasant walk. Price was fair.

Pictures of this hotel can be a little deceiving...especially the main photo of the hotel facade. The hotel is not located on a corner, if anything it is sandwiched between other buildings/apartments. Having said that, the location is okay in terms of its surroundings. There is a bus stop across the road which we used quite often. We also walked to Via Veneto which was approximately 10-15mins from the hotel. Also, many restaurants and shops are nearby, including a department store. We liked the pizza restaurant across from the hotel...delicious. Upon checking in, we weren't really greeted but we sort of expected that from the previous reviews here. We had to take our own luggage up to the room, and could barely fit two normal sized suitcases in the lift, which also was out of service on one of the days we were there. The room was worse...it was so small that we had to jump over our suitcases to get to the bathroom and to the beds. Even housekeeping could not cope in the room, the maid kept moving our luggage about so she could make the beds and tidy the room. This was very upsetting to us, since we had fragile items and fluids in our suitcases and we did not want them to be moved about or to stand upright. One day, we could not find one of the suitcases and incredulously thought we were robbed. We frantically looked under the bed, in the wardrobe and even in the bathroom (room was so tiny but funnily enough the luggage was nowhere to be seen). We soon found the suitcase standing upright by the window, behind the curtains. I immediately called the front desk to request that our suitcases not be moved again. After calmly explaining the situation, giving my name and room number I was most annoyed when the person said, 'Excuse me, who are you and what is the problem?' I repeated the request and still the person did not understand. We returned the next day to find the suitcases had been moved again! We were prepared for small rooms, but honestly nothing could have prepared me for how tiny the rooms really are at Hotel Gambrinus. We had a twin room which would still be considered small if it was only for one person. Even though the room was tiny, it was very clean and we found the beds to be most comfortable. The breakfast (which was included in our Expedia deal) was very mundane, stale bread, runny eggs, pastries, cold cuts, yoghurt and juice/tea/coffee. The toaster was out of service a few times, so even toast was a luxury! The staff at breakfast though were polite and helpful. Service was so-so, with one exception being the lovely lady at front desk (forgot her name) who helped us with directions as well as booking our taxi transfer to the airport. We went back to her a few times to make changes, and she was always reassuring and helpful. Overall, our hotel experience was average - nothing too spectacular to report.

The room was large enough. We didn't do breakfast, since it was optional, we felt there were better values outside the hotel. It was the bathroom that needs mention. The shower was a corner of the bathroom. There was no shower stall, just a corner of the room with the shower head. A glass partition kept the water from going everywhere, at least until it hit the floor. Note: the shower floor is the bathroom floor; the bathroom floor is the shower floor. Had the bathroom floor had sufficient slope to it, this wouldn't have mattered, but the design of the floor was such that it was level, so the water from the shower, after doing its duty on your body, hits the floor, and flows hither and yon trying to find the drain, which it does, eventually. we used up any spare towels and mats in an attempt to dam the water and direct it to the drain, but the aftermath of showering was that nearly the entire bathroom floor was flooded. Shower == FAIL. The hotel staff was helpful, they spoke English, and there are restaurants a few blocks away. On the Sunday that we arrived, the street that the hotel is located on was nearly deserted. We searched a bit for a restaurant, and found one. Location: distances in Rome are deceiving, and things seem further away than they are. The hotel is \"only\" about a mile and a half from the Pantheon, and about 2.6 miles (street route, not straight line) from St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican. Numerically, it seems short, but walking, it seems much longer. Yes, cabs are expensive, and I think it's the initial fare that causes it. It seemed like everything was 10-euros away. Because of Rome's archaeological significance, their Metro is quite limited, not really an option. We never took the bus, we either walked or used cabs. Walking was an adventure, but we saw a lot.

We booked a twin room for the 3 nights which wasn't available when we arrived due to a 'problem with the water'. We were put in 2 single rooms in the hotel which were next to each other. One of the rooms was barely big enough to fit a single bed (the porter even made a joke about this) but I didn't mind too much as it was only for one night and there was no extra charge. However, the next morning when we went down to breakfast we were met with a damp cellar which had mould growing up the walls. The cereal I had was stale, there was no fresh juice or tea or coffee only a hot drink machine. The rest of the breakfast did not look particularly appertising either. The second night we were moved to our twin room which was not in the hotel, but in an appartment block down the street. It did not feel particularly comfortable being outside of the hotel and the bathroom window was broken.

The room we received was very small, although the bathroom made it look positively spacious - there wasn't room to swing a cat in the bathroom, there was hardly anywhere to keep our toiletries and there was no ventilation for when we were using the shower. It's also worth noting that if either myself or my partner was on the large side, we wouldn't have even fit in the tiny shower cubicle. The room itself was what I would consider to be average three star quality. Everything in it worked, but there were small irritations such as there only being four hangers in the wardrobe. The walls were fabric covered rather than wallpapered or painted, and there were various stains on the fabric that made the room look dirty. We chose not to eat breakfast in the hotel as it was quite expensive, instead venturing out early in the mornings before it got too hot. The location of the hotel wasn't great in terms of nearby amenities, but it is very well-served by buses, which are much better value than the Metro and cover a much wider area. The bus stop immediately opposite the hotel has a number of buses which serve Termini station (much better than taking a taxi - taxi drivers in Rome WILL rip you off if you're a tourist), whilst the main road around the corner has a number of buses which go to the main sightseeing areas, including Vatican City. A single fare is 1 euro, and 4 euros will get you an unlimited day pass. Overall, this hotel was fine for the price I paid and the limited amount of time I spent there, but it was a reflection to me of Italian hotel standards - nowhere else in Europe would this pass as a four star hotel.

I needed cold drinks Even if the fridge had worked they charge 20 Euros a day if you put any of your own food or drink in it. Never seen that at a hotel in 40 years of travelling.....what a nerve. No bath. Basic toiletries. Breakfast was cold everyday, cold greasy eggs, bacon and indistinguishable other things. They are supposed to serve breakfast 7 -10 but stop a 9am. Staff are rude.There was never anyone on Reception Desk to greet guests and when someone did emerge from a back room they were extremely rude. Rome is horrid, this hotel is disgusting. Never stay there. You can't walk anywhere because the area is dark, vacant and eerily dangerous. You can get a bus regularly to Termini from opposite the hotel, but finding right bus back is not easy so you always need a taxi. Rome taxi drivers rip you off, same trip can cost 6-15 Euros depending on which taxi driver you get. I travelled Europe on my own for an extended period, only feared for my safety in Via Piave coming and going from Hotel Gambrinus. DO NOT STAY THERE.

The rooms were on the small side, and even though they advertise airconditioning - it was not on. The option was to hear the loud traffic all night or bear the uncomfortable sleeping temperature in the room. There was not a coffee maker in our room (our traveling companions received one two days into the trip), but it was not a problem - because we were always up early to enjoy the breakfast downstairs. The breakfast presentation and personnel were very good. The front desk personnel were helpful most of the time -sometimes there was noone who spoke english, but understandable. The worst thing that happened - and really soured us on this hotel and its ethics was when our traveling companions returned from their cruise to stay another night (we had already left for home a week earlier), and they were told by the front desk that we had stolen their coffee pot from the room!!! This is unexcusable, and ridiculous... why would anyone from the states want their plastic coffee pot with the foreign adapter!!!!

What a terrible taste this left for us - having been labeled as a \"thieves!\" We would never take anything that was not ours, and resent very much the distasteful way this happened. Perhaps the hotel would be well-served to check their own employees, or have a better system of accounting when each guest checks out. If anyone should choose to stay at this hotel, I would make sure that you actually have a coffeemaker - or anything else that was supposed to be included in your room, so that it is not left up to the hotel staff to accuse you!

Paid $790. C. for three nights. The best part of this hotel is the beautiful white marble lobby, cool and well air conditioned. The rest is like a Twilight Zone story. Take the tiny elevator to your floor and you step out into into a damp and overly warm hallway. Enter your room and you're met with an offensive smell in the air. The walls are completely covered in a plumped up fabric which give off a musty odour. Entering the bathroom and you are greeted with a very pungent and off-putting mould smell. The sleeping room is very warm and humid. The air conditioner is on at its coolest setting but there is only a hint of cool air falling out of the ceiling vent. Front desk tells us that a technician will be available in the morning to check it out. Too warm too fall asleep, so we move the bed to under the air vent and we unplug the mini-fridge which is venting plenty of hot air into the room. Following morning we searched out the technician who eventually comes to the room, removed a ceiling panel, reached in , pulled out a small, furry, rectangular inset from air duct, quickly dropped it out of sight inside the ceiling cavity and began to reinstall the ceiling cover. Recognizing the furry rectangle he removed and dropped out of sight as the air filter, I stated that I did not want to sleep in an enclosed room with unfiltered air coming in from the rest of the hotel ducts. He did go off and returned with a relatively clean looking filter. When my wife woke up with half a dozen bug bites in the morning. We stored the cover and a very well worn, fuzzy blanket in the bottom of the bureau drawer for the rest of the nights. Breakfast was in the basement of the hotel. Low ceiling and musty. Very nice white \"linen \" napkins, white ceramic plates and cups and metal cutlery settings at the tables. Food choices consisted of stale breads, croissants ,etc, instant coffee expresso machine, huge open bowls of yogurt and generally some of the most unappetizing food we had anywhere over a three week period.

Also, only one elevator.) The driver arrived and apparently had words with the front desk personnel. My Italian is limited, but I could understand most of it, and it appeared to be a problem of ego. In any case, the driver left in a huff, leaving us stranded and having to catch a flight. As I recall, the transportation was called for at least two hours in advance of our flight time. The front desk man who had engaged in the argument with the first driver promised to deliver another. We waited and waited and waited. Finally, another appeared but unfortunately by the time we arrived at the airport, we had missed our flight. The reservations were a bit flexible, so I wasn't too worried until I found out that the next flight on the airline we were booked on didn't depart for Venice until 5pm (it was 8 am on Sunday morning). Long story short, I had to purchase emergency full fare tickets on Alitalia to the tune of over $700 all because two Italian egos got in the way of our getting to the airport via transportation that I was forced to allow the hotel to arrange and deliver.

We flew to Ciampino Airport and got the Terrorvision coach to Termini Station as the reviews we read said the hotel was near enough to walk from there. Well we agree it is but it certainly wasn't the few minutes/couple of hundred metres we were led to believe. We got to the hotel for eleven but couldn't check in until 2 which was fair enough as this was clear on the booking form. I must admit after seeing the photo's of the hotel and the rooms on Expedia and paying between \u00a3134 to \u00a3150 per night I was hoping for a bit of Four Star comfort. The reception area although small was clean, and the person on reception always acknowledged you.

It was at the back of the hotel with a tiny view of the back of other people's apartments and was dark all of the time. It was also boiling hot so we were greatful for the air conditioning.

We also had problems with the cleaner who said we had come back to our room too early ( we came back at 4pm after leaving at 8am) and could we go away again for five minutes. Considering it took her five minutes to do and believe me they start very early (our room was next to their sore cupboard) what where they doing? We also had to go to reception to ask for toilet paper. I think we were prepared for breakfast to be a problem from some of the reviews we read but even we couldn't face it on the last day. You are literally squeezed into the packed basement with very little choice of food and with a waiter that shouted in your face. On the one occasion we went to the bar for a drink, the bar was closed. If you even look at the basement area you really wouldn't consider having an evening meal there.

In general, the lack of attention to detail is reflected in the quality of the service, the room and the common areas, bringing the overall experience of staying at this property unpleasant and certainly not worth the over US$230/night we paid. The room was the biggest problem. My objections are not so much with the relatively small size, which is to be expected in any major European centre, but the low quality of the bathroom, bed and amenities. Considering we were expecting a 4 star hotel, the flourescent bedside and bathroom lights were a disappointment and the ugly 70's era furniture also brought down the tone of the room. Though we were promised a 'double' room, the bed was just two twin beds pushed together. I've seen this done before and it wasn't a problem when done properly with a full mattresscover holding the thing together. At the Gambrinus however, the two beds were only kept together by a top sheet, meaning they easily split up leaving an uncomfortable crack down the centre. The bedding itself was of poor quality, with no duvet, but just a rough blanket and bed cover. Only two pillows were provided and they were limp and lumpy. The bathroom lacked a bath and the tiny shower was awkwardly placed so as to only have a 40 cm opening by which one would squeeze in to the cubicle. Moreover, the bathroom lacked a ceiling, instead having an industrial looking black grate covered in dust, through which one could see the piping and other utilities above. Other issues with the room included the lack of a bathroom fan, the lack of a clock and a guest directory that was just a mini bar menu. The thin walls also meant we could hear everything from the next room, whether it be the television, a cough, the door bell or muffled conversation. There were notable problems with the hotel's service as well. Housekeeping simply failed to show up to clean our room one day, and while they met our request for extra pillows promptly, they simply did not answer the phone at all when we ran out of toilet paper. While one day we were frustrated by their inattention, on another we were upset over their zealousness when the maid chose to ignore our do not disturb sign and walked right in to the room. The breakfast staff, while efficient, seemed harried and overworked. An early 11am checkout time, the lack of notice of noisy maintenance repairs and a 20 euro charge to store things in the room minibar also seemed to reflect an inattentiveness to guest comfort. To top it off, the location of the Gambrinus is not exactly in central Rome and requires atleast a 20 minute walk just to get to the edge of the sightseeing district. The neighbourhood is nice from an aesthetic perspective, but being surrounded by embassies and government ministries hardly makes up for the lack of restaurants nor the charm of other central Rome neighbourhoods. This is not to say that the Gambrinus is wholly terrible.

Location: The hotel is situated just north of the town centre, there is a bus stop right opposite the hotel, and 3 different buses take you to the Termini, where you can get the Metro or loads of other buses to the sights. I brought a 3 day ticket from the tobacconist, which you can use on all the public transport. Just remember to put the ticket in the small yellow machines on the bus each time you get on. Most of the buses have LCD screens letting you know what the next stop is. You can walk to most places and I walked from the Termini to the hotel with all my baggage on the 1st day and it took around 15 mins. There are various bars and restaurants in the area if you walk round the streets. Hotel: As previously mentioned in reviews the rooms are small, but ok if you, like I, just wanted a base. The staff were great, all spoke great English, and will give you a good tourist map when you check in. The bed was comfortable. The room was very clean, and the room was serviced well. Nice towels. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, I took a small travel kettle and adapter which worked fine. The shower is small but effective. There are four floors to the hotel but only one small lift, at breakfast you may have to wait your turn for it. Breakfast was fine, but the restaurant area small and I had to wait for a table twice. My room did not have a view, and was situated near the lift so was noisy when the lift was being used, it did not disturb me during the night. The room does have a TV in there, but choice of channels are limited. The AC wasn't brilliant, and i was glad I wasn't there in August. The bar isn't cheap and very quiet. I would recommend the hotel, it certainly served my purpose, and Rome was fantastic. I enjoyed the sights sounds and people. Be a little wary on the buses and Metro, there are pickpockets and beggars were everywhere. Also south of the Termini is a bit rough, stay away after dark. A tip for sightseeing would be hire a guide for the colleseum, forum and palantine, only costs an extra 10 euros and it brought them all to life, For the vatican go around 3pm, as earlier the queues were around 2-3 hours long.

After looking at so many hotels and not knowing exactly where they were we found the Hotel Gambrinus within our budget. We stayed for 3 nights. I had e-mailed the hotel ahead of arrival asking about transfer from airport. They were extremely helpful and booked this for us at a discounted rate of 4 Euro each. When we arrived and checked in I asked them about the return trip to airport they said this would be more expensive (58 Euro for both of us) which we were happy about as they explained that they subsidised the inward journey. The hotel, check-in was great and the staff were extremely helpful and courteous. They explained on a map where everything was and how to get around and gave us information about trips using the Green Line Tours. Because we were only there for 2 full days and flying back out on the morning of the 3rd day we decided to book trips to ensure we made the most of stay. We booked 3 half day trips: Trip 1 - was partly walking, we got dropped off at the Trevi Fountain and it took us through to the Pantheon and the bus then picked us back up and took us to St Peter's Square we were able to go in and look around. Trip 2 - took us to the historic centre, the forum, capital hill and St Paul's Basilica and then on to the Coliseum. Trip 3 - took us straight to the Sistine Chapel and we had to queue for an hour and a half before getting in and I believe that was quite short its hours longer in the summer/peak times. The tour guides were great, especially Massimo who was very passionate about the Sistine Chapel and the bus picked you up from your hotel and dropped you back off wherever you wanted. On our last day we were dropped off at the Spanish Steps and we walked back to the hotel from there it was only about a 3 minute stroll. Not long at all. The breakfast in the hotel was great, just what you needed, plenty to choose from. The rooms, we opted for a superior room which was decorated to a very high standard although we were in a room that had an adjoining door to the next room and my mum got a bit of a fright on the nights as the neighbours were making a bit of noise and she thought they were going to get in. The pizzeria across the straight was fantastic and not at all expensive 30 Euro for starters, main courses, wine and water for 2 people. The receptionist at the hotel did recommend a restaurant a couple of streets away which was a traditional restaurant. You weren't given any menus you just went in sat down they gave you wine, water and then started coming with different courses, mozzarella, ricotta cheese, salami, antipasti etc. then a pasta dish and then even more they came with a roasted pork dish with potatoes etc. Then desert. We almost rolled out of there. It was a bit more expensive 40 Euro each but well worth the experience. Up the street from the hotel there were some boutiques and a department store called la Rinascente where we did some shopping which was great and the store was open until 10 pm every night - fantastic!

So, if you don't spend lots of time in the hotel, (and why would you with so much to see and do), and you want to be close to the train station book this hotel, if you get a good deal.

I\u2019ve stayed in room in the UL round London that have been way smaller, not as nice and more expensive However, out room, 102, was perfect - it was a standard double room. We had no ants, no missing fixtures or fittings, the TV worked fine and reception was good (What a nice surprise it was to be able to watch the BBC world service channel). The room was clean and tidy, nicely decorated and arranged - a large bed and a large leather armchair. The bathroom was smallish, but large enough - what are you gonna do in there exactly?!?! Staff were courteous and helpful - they marked out anything we were looking for on their complimentary map. They recommended the wine & grill restaurant near the trevi fountain and it was fabulous. The hotel is not completely central - being quite far from the Vatican etc (10 euro taxi ride), however its very close to the termini station and the Spanish steps (15 mins walk each) and reasonably close to the forum and coliseum area (About 8 euros in a taxi). If you want a really central hotel check out the hotel white - that was next to the trevi fountain and looked great. The only real gripe I could have about the hotel was its own bar & restaurant. While it was clean and beautiful with its vaulted ceilings and cool beer, they aren\u2019t making the most of it with their menu and food, which was average. However given that they seemed able to recommend half a dozen places to eat locally and in the centre, and mark them on their map I don\u2019t see this as too much of an issue.", "Date": "July 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cA Fantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3654289", "Content": "Wow!

Our room overlooked the back of the hotel and a leafy courtyard which gave a real countryside feel which was very pleasant and not at all what you would expect from the front entrance. Breakfast was generous with many interesting things to chose from. The free internet access after 11am is a nice thought although we had problems making it work. The staff, although not overly friendly, where very efficient and helpful. The air conditioning chill in the lobby was lovely when we returned from walking during the day. In the room it appeared to struggle a bit but the temperature did creep down and we were comfortable at night. Any downside ? The room and bathroom were certainly adequate, but possibly a little cramped and boring. For what we paid I was hoping for just a little bit more. It is this that would probably make me try somewhere else next time rather than return here even thought there is a fair risk I might not be as satisfied.

This is an obvious problem to hotel staff, as we saw a can of ant spray in the housekeeping cart. Since we checked in on a Saturday, the only available room was much smaller. We took it, choosing cleanliness over convenience, only to be distrubed until 12:00 midnight by a family living in an apartment directly above this room. Apparently the hotel does not own the entire buidling. After waiting 2 days for another room to become available, we were switched to a much nicer room, although we frequently heard a young child practicing piano, as once again, there was an apartment above our room. The piano was much more appealing then the sound of of a family with children running and yelling and singing and banging constantly. The only bright spot during our stay is the level of care provided to us by Christina, the night front desk clerk. All other staff did not care about our inconveniences or annoyances. Also it's good to note that the airport shuttle advertised is ONLY one way FROM the airport to the hotel. A trip from the hotel to the airport by taxi is 49 euros, otherwise you must take a bus to Termini and then a train to the airport. Also, we paid an additional $2.28 per person per day for a breakfast that was already included with each room purchase. We did bring this to Expedia's attention. Internet service is provided but only available after 11:00am. Last annoyance - the hotel charges 20 euros per day to put your own drinks inside the minibar. Tip on Dining - If you have 3 hours, are hungry and want an experience, dine at Piccolo Abruzzo, just a 5 minute walk from the Gambrinus. It costs roughly 50 euros per person but well worth the money. All the wine, water and food you could ever want. Great restaurant, atmosphere, food and experience.

Room size was perfectly adequate and well equipped, with iron and board, TV, hairdryer, and a free bottle of wine which was a nice touch. The hotel is located in Rome's commercial district, it's a ten minute walk from Termini, and the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain are approx 15/20 mins walk. As I mentioned, buses to all the major sights are within a short distance, and the hotel will advise you on which bus to catch for which stops. Rome's attractions are relatively spread out anyway, therefore even if you booked a hotel near the Colossuem, you'd need transport or a good walk to get to the Trevi, for example.
