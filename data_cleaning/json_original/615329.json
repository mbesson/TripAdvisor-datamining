When we arrived at the hotel, we were given keys to 4 different rooms which were all occupied. When he was advised that rooms were occupied, he became belligerent..He was clueless, confused and disrespectful. When we finally got our room, it had an awful smell, there was no hot water, needless to say after a long trip we had to take a freezing shower - Not impressed. On our return on October 3rd, we were given a different room and it was a lot better. No Smell . Location is excellent. Accesible to banks, stores, and main tourists attractions ie. Vatican, St. Peter's Square. Spanish Steps was also accesible by reasonable taxi costs approximately 8 euros. However, would not recommend this hotel to anyone. There are other great hotels within the same proximity. The only redeemable feature in this fiasco is the staff Angela, friendly, accommdating and respectful.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorothy_Finland", "Title": "\u201cHotel in a ok place but be careful\u201d", "Author": "Dorothy_Finland", "ReviewID": "UR116463827", "Content": "We spend here four nights and at the first night I woke up when someone was going to come in to our room.

Then the peole went away. We guessed that the receptionist had give this hotelroom to other couple as well and they tried to get in first. When they could not do this they went to get the receptionist who used some spare key to get in. We didn't get any explanation to this, but we were on our toes the next night.
