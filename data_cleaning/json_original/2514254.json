Not happy at all with the bedrooms. The first one was shocking and I would have left but it had been prepaid. The room was old and smelt and bedding was sheets and blankets I told reception I could not stay there. Then she showed me to a slightly better room and we suffered it but again I was not happy so we went out and came back and went to bed. Surprisingly, the bed was comfortable, but my companion had been bitten by the morning. Breakfast was not very inspiring and the service was not good nor the quality of the food and bevereges. Coffee was spooned out of a large can of Nescaf\u00e9 Instant and the waitress growled at me when I asked for a drink after a 10 minute wait. The proprietors should take a walk up to the Coronation Hotel in Neven place to get some idea of simple but good standards of hotel keeping and service, as currently the Olive Hotel Cromwell Rd reflects very poor value for money.

The hotel was well placed for us to walk to where we wanted to be and by taking a family room for \u00a3120 the four of us could afford to visit London. When I was looking at alternative accomodation most hotels would only provide 2 rooms so the cost was upwards of \u00a3200 for us. For the money we got a reasonable sized room with a shower / toilet. It was big enough and everything worked, other than a couple of light bulbs. It was reasonably clean. It was quiet and the beds, a double and something a bit bigger were comfortable. In the morning there was a table service breakfast with boiled eggs, ham, toast and jam and coffee. If you wanted more of anything you could have it. The food was basic but fine and there was plenty but limited choice. A note on car parking. after I think 7pm on saturday you can park your car free outside the hotel until early Monday am but otherwise you need to park it elsewhere. I paid \u00a325 to park in the car parking spaces the hotel has just over the road. It is an under ground car park and you need to ask for clear instructions on how to get in and out on foot. You drive in with a tag which the barrier recognises but you can not walk out the same way. You have to find the right door which is not marked up and use the tag to let you in to the flats above the car park. The staff we met spoke quite limited English but they did their best for us. I guess they don't earn a lot and we made the small effort to be polite and they were helpful. I think for what we wanted, that is a cheap place to sleep and have breakfast, it was fine. I can not imagine staying here for more than a few days. For London it is good value ( a one course meal for 4 cost \u00a350 for reference) and we would stay here again. We were in the new part of the hotel so can not comment on the rest of it but it seemed quite busy and I heard no complaints but it is basic.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Headcorn, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery good value\u201d", "Author": "Leeofmani", "ReviewID": "UR123489161", "Content": "This hotel is very convenient for public transport, in a safe and pleasant area.

The first thing you think as you walk through the door is \"What's the cancellation policy again?\" I was dutifully interrogated by the ex KGB employee who manned the front desk and ushered off to my room. Surprise, yes the room was small...well tiny actually: so welcome to London! All par for the course... but then I saw the bathroom... oh my God. I'm 5 feet 8 inches, not exactly tall but there wasn't enough room for me to sit on the toilet, I had to sit sideways to accommodate my knees! Well that was good for a laugh. (remember, sense of humor required) But I wasn't particularly amused when I tried taking a shower and discovered that there wasn't enough space in the stall to move my arms, I literally had to soak under the water, step out of the shower to soap and scrub and step back in to rinse off! Thank God I was only here for one night. After my shower I made the mistake of going downstairs for the \"Continental\" breakfast that was included with my stay. What I wasn't told was that the continent in question was Antarctica! Undrinkable coffee, rubbery egg (singular), slimy yogurt and miserable service, there was not one edible thing in the room. And speaking of miserable service...not a single smile the whole time I was there from any of the employees. They offered consistently \"Soviet\" service that led me to believe that I was really just an annoyance...or an inmate. Needless to say unless you're fresh from the Gulag avoid this place like the plague...which I suspect is being incubated in the bed linens!

The first problem was with the phone line. My friend could not call her family to inform about the hotel change, as there was simply no phone line available. We later found out that the phones were actually working, but the hotel did not allow people to use them, because they did not have a way to control the length of the calls and charge them later. That's ridiculous! Second and worst issue: my friend arrived before me and made the check-in first. When I arrived, the receptionist gave me the room keys and told me that she had left for a while. After about 20 minutes, I started to get worried that she hadn't come back yet. Then I realised that some of her things in the bedroom were in Italian and we do not speak any Italian! I was given the key to the wrong bedroom! As soon as I realised this, I ran to the reception with all my stuff. The receptionist did not admit that he sent me to the wrong room until I saw the correct room number in the form that my friend filled in at check-in. The receptionist did not apologize for this unacceptable mistake. Thirdly (as if it was not enough), our room was in the basement, located under the reception. We could not sleep due to the sound of steps from the reception and from people on the street during the whole night Other issues: the water in the shower was not hot enough and the breakfast was very poor.

On contacting the Oliver, the receptionist sounded \"a mess\", not entirely sure of whether she could book us into a double room. following various phone calls, she finally manged to organise herself and get us in. 60 quid, not so bad considering the location for a double room. In hindsight, it may have been a large, or should that be enlarged single.. Our room was on the first floor, bonus, but on opening the door I was greeted with what can only be described as a nuclear heat wave. Ah well, I thought, maybe I'll open the window... NO CHANCE! Window was the size of a small child and utterly smattered in pigeons poo. I arrived late at night so didn't quite understand the reason for this until the next day. Opening the barely locked window, I discovered it looked out onto the side of the building. In this alleyway there was not one, not two, but three pigeon's nests and spikes to prevent said pigeons. As well as mounds, and I mean mounds of more pigeons mess. Utterly vile and completely unhygenic. I'm quite surprised one of the little blighters didn't come in for a nose around. Breakfast, we were told was served from 7.30 to 9.30. As our night's sleep was interrupted by various sirens, traffic and the unberably hot room preventing us from getting any rest, we slightly overslept and got to breakfast at 9.20. Reasonable I thought, oh no. We were ignored until 9.35, at which time I had to attract the waitresses attention with a polite \"excuse me, can we order some breakfast?\" She glared at the clock, about to completely refuse my offer when I again politely informed her that we had been sitting there for 15 mins. She disappeared and slammed down our new cutlery and plates and informed us of the varied and high quality choice of breakfast which was egg or cereal. The manner of this particular waitress was utterly inexcusable, she treated us as if we'd just slaughtered a small puppy. Not 5 mins later, an elderly couple appeared, confused as to what time breakfast was, and at one point it seemed that she was about to refuse them food. Luckily they were fed the same high quality rubbish that we had. And all on my 24th birthday. Utterly disgraceful. Give this place a wide berth in future.

The staff friendly and nice and from the outside really nice to look at. However, when we got in, you could smell the damp and it was really old fashioned and grim. Ordered three rooms - one single, two twins. The twins smelt of damp as soon as you opened the door. Ther was not a proper shower in the bathboom. The bathroom did look modernised but I felt nervous about having a wash in there and so did the others as did not look clean. The rooms were boiling even though the raditors weren't on so we had to leave the windows open which caused alot of noise from the traffic which went on all the night. The beds were hard and it had an awful rough blanket on which didn't look or smell clean so that was off putting. Came back from a show wanting a cup of tea went into the coffee/breakfast room and the cups were dirty, the kitchen was unclean, the kettle was dirty and the tea and coffee were left in maragine tubs which did not look attractive or like I wanted to drink from it. So I didn't have a cup of tea which I was really disappointed about Managed to sleep relatively okay despite the TV next door being contanstly on and the noise of the traffic. Was really looking forward to my breakfast as it boosted of a contential breakfast. Which in my mind is croissates, smoked ham, yogurt, selection of breakfast cereals. No, we got an apple (no choice) slammed on the table, rubbish and vile orange juice, was offered cereral which was really cheap and was left unopened over night as I saw it in the kitchen the night before. The tea and coffee were in old fashioned and dirty teapots. I hated the breakfast and so did the young people. You had no choice. We also was offered an egg. I think in total the breakfast per person was \u00a31 worth of the money you paid it was really poor! Overall, I was really disappointed because for the young people it was there first time that they went to London and stayed in a hotel. These young people are homeless and there hostel and standard of living is better than that living in a YMCA than the hotel. Also myself and my work collegue had flea bites when we got up so we have to get some ointment. It was from the hotel because we did not have them before we entered there!!!!
