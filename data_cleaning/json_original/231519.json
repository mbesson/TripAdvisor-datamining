The location of the hotel is excellent, near enough to the Ramblas to be central but far enough away so that it is quieter. The desk staff were welcoming and provided a pack of information about trips at check in. They also managed a very efficient security box system which we used. The hotel has a generally good state of decoration and pubic areas were well maintained. Our room was clean, although small and the bed was a bit hard for our liking. The hotel bar was in the basement dining room, doubling with the breakfast room. It was competitively priced and a couple of very nice girls served us, but they were also laying out for breakfast on the tables around us so this was not a relaxing place for our night cap. There is a roof top terrace with a very small pool, which was too cold to use while we were there, but one night was warm enough to take our glass of wine from the bar to the terrace, which was pleasant. Breakfast was a self service buffet with a very extensive range of hot and cold items. The choice and quality was excellent.

The first night well the room was like a sauna the aircon didnt work so the choice was to open the door or suffer. The next day we complained and asked to be moved to a room where the aircon works but were told its winter the heating was on and there were no rooms availible.......so we had breakfast which was not bad and decided as we hadnt been able to sleep that we would get a refund and go and get another hotel.....there are lots and lots nearby......... we were told we couldn't so i asked to see the manager......a phone call was made and then we were offered another room but it was going to cost us more money..... we said no thanks and asked to see the manager again.....another phonecall and suddenly we could have the other room free of extra charge......i wasn't happy especially as the manager could not be bothered to come and see us but my wife decided we would take the room and not make a fuss. This room was double the size of the first and a dam sight cooler. So thats the bad bit.....the good bits are location it is located at the top ramblas so plenty of shops bars restuarants etc, it is very clean which was good th e breakfast was reasonable although there were lots of problems with the coffee machine, the poor waitress certainly earnt her money. It was buffet style both english and continental. In summary i'll give as open a view as possible once we moved rooms dont get 310!!!!! its tiny it was ok. Very clean with reasonable food......but there are lots and lots of other hotels nearby and next door priced similarly or cheaper and i would definately look at one of them for better value....but thats up to you.

Picked this hotel because of it's relatlively low cost and location near the Placa Catalunya and the El Corte Ingles department store. We had one night, had been to BCN before, and knew we wanted to spend it shopping! Overall the hotel itself was great. Here is my breakdown: Pros: ---Very central location for sightseeing in BCN, just off Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas (this is also a con --- see below). ---Updated, modern hotel. Clean, contemporary rooms. Comfortable bed. Rooms had a flat screen TV, desk and small chair. Rooms were average size for Barcelona (those from the US will consider them small. But this is the norm in BCN so accept it and move on). Rooms facing the street have a small balcony with a view of Carrer Pelai. ---Exemplary staff at the front desk. Multi-lingual and very knowledgeable. ---Restaurant at the hotel itself. We did not take advantage of this, as it was a bit pricey. However, friends traveling with us raved about the breakfast buffet. Cons: ---Only con I can think of also deals with location. Because it is so centrally located, there was a LOT of noise -- mostly of young people partying -- coming from the streets. We were five floors up, had the terrace doors closed, and were still woken up by the noise at 3am. This is not the fault of the hotel, and this probably doesn't happen every night. But apparently we just got lucky. If I had to do it again, I'd probably ask if there was a room not facing the street. The view was nice -- but not nice enough to lose sleep over. ---Noise issue: while this did not happen to us, this happened to friends traveling with us who stayed on another floor. There were apparently a lot of young people staying on their floor and they were in the hall going from room to room, smoking, drinking, and basically partying it up till the wee hours of the morning. I asked if our friends reported them to the front desk and they did not. I would hope they would have done something had they actually called or asked the young people to keep it down. This is more the fault of my friends than the hotel, but in the interests of full disclosure, I thought you'd like to know. Overall we were very satisfied with this hotel.

We snapped it up. He gave us maps of the city, showed us exactly where we were, advised us to walk everywhere to get the most out of the city and pointed us in the right direction for local restaurants within our budget.

That list is not exhaustive by the way. There is something for everyone. The only fault I found was that the coffee is ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL!!!! I couldn't believe it. I expected excellent coffee in Barcelona at breakfast. It's one of those machine things that you press the button for the type of coffee you want. I have seen the same machines in Spring Hotels in Tenerife and had the same opinion. It really isn't nice, cannot be any cheaper than brewing good breakfast coffee and I do not know why hotels do it. Easy solution is to go to Starbucks on the corner opposite and get a takeaway or Cafe Vienna right next door do fantastic coffee, so all was not lost.

I made a special request for a double bed and a non smoking room and these requests were met and quoted to me on arrival....fantastic!!

On both these points we were not disappointed. For a novice to this beautiful city Inglaterra provided the ideal \"home base\". The La Ramba, Placa de Catalunya, Passeig de Gracia are all within easy walking distance from the hotel. The check-in was a quick and easy process and the staff were pleasant and professional. The rooms are on the small side, but well furnished, so on the whole no complaints there. I could mention the water stain on the bathroom wall behind the bath/shower...but this was a minor point in an overall cozy room. Some have made mention of the busy road Inglaterra is situated in. This really is not an issue when the balcony door is closed, so I would not worry about it too much. Overall the room fitted out purpose, so from that perspective the hotel was a good choice. Only two issues would stand out for me. Firstly, there is no Internet access in the room. Two terminals are provided next to the restaurant, but these days it is almost a given that Internet access would be available in your room. Secondly, although the breakfast provides a good selection, some work can be done to improve the quality. The grilled tomato was watery with nearly next to no taste and the scrambled eggs resembled a think chunky porridge. So this is one aspect of the hotel that I would skip. Better breakfast is to be had in the numerous open air cafes nearby. Finally, is the hotel value for money? As a three-star hotel I'd say that the daily rate is at the very top-end of what could be considered acceptable. Possibly you are paying for location, or maybe Barcelona is generally more expensive...those are really the only justifications that i can think of. Would I stay at Inglaterra again?

I got a very bad response from the reception staff when I reported it missing. The man on reception just shrugged his shoulders.

One landing down from the street level lobby are toilet facilities (very clean) and a computer area with two computers for use by guests at a nominal charge ( 8 Euros for 45 minutes). One level lower gets you to the cafe where breakfast was being served when we arrived; a very nice assortment of cereals and breads, etc. We were early for our check-in so our luggage was stored in a locked closet used for that purpose. The very friendly and professional reception staff included Senorita Maribel and Senorita Montse; both ladies spoke English very well and could not have been nicer to us and to our needs. They represent very good ambassadors for the hotel. They gave us instructions on finding an ATM machine, and suggestions for sightseeing. We took a hop on, hop off bus tour for two hours (the receptionist Maribel was able to sell us the tickets helping us avoid time at the bus stop for that purpose). When we returned from the tour our room was ready and we were very happy to learn we had been given a free upgrade to a sixth floor small suite that included an outdoor patio. For dinner we went to a very nice restaurant, the Attic, recommended to us by Senorita Maribel and another staff member. It was about a six or seven block walk from the hotel. Our only complaints about the hotel are that there is no coffee machine in the room, and the cafe doesn't start morning service until 7:30 am, and our cab to the airport arrived at 7:40. We never had coffee or breakfast even though paid for as part of our fare. The living quarters while spacious had \"poor\" lighting. Not that there wasn't enough lighting, it's just that the overhead \"can\" lights aren't over you when in front of a mirror for makeup or shaving purposes. The shower glass partition was only about two feet or 30\" so it was impossible to not get shower water on the bathroom floor. If checking out in the morning and you have a room on a \"higher\" floor, allow extra time for the one elevator to arrive.

The people there were insanely friendly and the coffee and orange juice was fantastic. The location is alright if you love to shop, not very good for nightlife. The proximity to Las Ramblas was great, but at night everything was closed. Also, not very close to cultural sites either. Barcelona can be a walking city... if you love to walk. If you don't, this hotel will call for a lot of cab fares. Also, you never know what you'll get as far as views if that concerns you. My room had a great shot of a concrete wall, while another group of friends got one with a terrace.

In short, my room did not have a safe, my iTouch (a cross between an iPhone and iPod) was stolen while I was out exploring the city, and the staff of Hotel Inglaterra were anything but helpful - they were downright rude. I let them know I'd be writing a review on Trip Advisor, and that it was a shame that they would let such a blatant incident of thievery occur within the confines of their hotel. Given the price of the room, they should expect their clientele to bring items that they would require a safe for.... Here's my story: Thursday, 1 PM: Checked in at Hotel Inglaterra for a 4 night stay... showered, arranged for internet service (very expensive!), quickly left to explore the city. Thursday, 9 PM: Returned to hotel to shower, left for a rather late, yet delicious dinner. Thursday, Midnight: Returned to hotel, brought iTouch downstairs because internet was not connecting to hotel network. Man at front helped me to get it to connect, he thought the iTouch was a pretty cool gadget. I sent an email to my boyfriend from my room, and to sleep I went... Friday, 10 AM: Left room in neat condition, hadn't unpacked completely, noticed room did not have safe but that refrigerator had lock (weird!?), so locked passport and credit cards in fridge). Excited for 1/2 day bike tour, only brought camera (put $ in camera case), and left iTouch on bed, along with various other items (pack of tissues, chap stick, gum, etc... which i couldn't bring with me biking - nobody brought bags!). Friday, 6 PM: Returned to hotel - bike tour was amazing and the tapas we had after were delicious. Beds were made, and items from bed moved to side table. iTouch gone! Shocked, I ripped apart the room... unpacked my entire bag, lifted up mattresses, searched every inch of the room. Alas, the iTouch was nowhere to be found. I calmly called the front desk and reported the incident. I was told that she would leave a note for the cleaning staff and would receive a call regarding the item the following day. She explained that sheets are not changed daily, that they merely make the beds (I initially thought maybe it had been accidentally swept up with the sheets... but this clearly was not the case). I asked to speak with the manager, but she was not on duty. I also asked when the man who previously helped me with the iTouch would return to the hotel, and was told he only worked Thursday nights (WEIRD!!). Saturday, 10 AM: Before leaving hotel for Parc Guell, stopped at front desk to discuss incident, was told that nothing was found. Saturday, 5 PM: Returned to hotel to clean room, and again ripped it apart searching for the iTouch. I told myself that whoever stole it would return it... knowing that their job was on the line... After realizing it was still gone (stolen....), I called the front desk... the woman working at the desk, who spoke great english, said she would send up the maid who cleaned the room on Friday. The maid arrived shortly, but did not speak english at all... she showed us how she cleans the room, and how she moves everything from the bed to a side table or to the desk. Clearly, she was not going to incriminate herself if she had taken it. I called back downstairs and had the front desk woman translate over the phone what the maid was explaining. I asked to speak with a manager again, but was told that the manager would not be in until Sunday morning. Sunday, 9 AM: Before leaving for the day, I stopped by downstairs to ask what steps would be taken next, repeated my story, and received a nonchalant response: \"We trust our employees and there is nothing more to discuss. We will let you know if it turns up...\" How would it turn up?! Monday, 9 AM: Check out time.

After a lot of research, I decided on Hotel Inglaterra; it had great reviews. I booked the Dali Room at 249 Euro per night (about US$360/night), because it looked like this room has a rooftop patio. We arrived on September 4 for 3 nights. The room was great, and the patio was much nicer than I had even anticipated. While unpacking, we noticed that the room seemed warm, which I\u2019d expect for a room on the top floor of the building. I checked the fan/thermostat; while the register felt cold, the fan was not working. There were three settings on the fan: low, medium and high. When switched to either low or medium, there was no air flow and no fan sound; when switched to high, the fan did come on, but there was still no air flow. So, while the ac did work (as the register felt cool), it was useless without a fan to blow the cold air into the room. I went to the desk to ask for assistance. The attendant told me that the ac did work, but that it just required a longer period of time for it to cool down. I explained that the fan did not work, and was told again that I just needed to give it time. So, we left the room for 3 hours, leaving the fan and ac on high; we closed the curtains so the room was dark. When we returned, the room temperature was 82 degrees (according to my iPhone app). I then returned to the desk and was told the manager would come up. (I think her name was Francesca?) The manager felt the register, which was cold, and told me it was working. (I own a number of corporate apts in the U.S., and know a lot about about HVAC units.) I knew the fan did not work, so I then told the manager that clearly it did not work, if the room would not cool down when the ac was on high for 3 hours -- windows closed and curtains drawn. The manager then agreed that the room was too warm and said that she would have someone to check on it. I heard nothing, so a couple of hours later, I went down to the desk to ask for her. The manager then told me that the maintenance person had checked the unit and it was working properly . I asked her if I could explain the issue to the maintenance person, but she told he had left for the weekend. I then asked if we could move to another room, and she told me the hotel was fully booked, but that she would give a discount and move us to another room on the next day. I understand that was all that could be done\u2026 so, we slept with the windows open to get a breeze. The room was uncomfortably warm. The thing that bothered me most, is that they (manger and front desk attendant) kept trying to tell me that it was working correctly, although the temp was 82 after cooling for three hours. While I tried to explain the issue was with the blower, they just didn\u2019t seem to listen or care. Basically, I expect some ac when I pay US$360 per night. Gaudi Room \u2013 No outside access; window are sealed shut. On Saturday, we were told that we had to vacate our room by noon, in order to move to the new room. We were going to do sightseeing, but we needed to wait around until noon, as the desk clerk told us that they would not move the luggage; we had two suitcases a backpack and a computer bag. Humm. We waited to move our luggage in to the new room at noon, while it was still being cleaned. We were very happy to get a room with ac, and the Gaudi room did have working ac. However, do note, unlike Gaudi\u2019s appreciation of nature, this Gaudi Room was sealed up like a drum!.. No outside space; the windows were sealed shut. So, if you want to open a window, or step onto a balcony, do not book this room. However, It is a very nice size, and the air conditioner does work. Elevator out of order Actually, it\u2019s a good thing we moved from the top floor to the 1st floor, because when we packed up to leave, the elevator was out of order. I waited on level 1 for a ride to -1 , which never came; no problem, it was only two flights down. There was a sign on the elevator on the main floor, but no signs on the other floors. (I guess it would have been asking a lot for the desk staff to place a note on each of the floors.) Anyway, moving the luggage down one flight was pretty easy. Our first room was on the 6th floor, and so I would have been really bummed. 10% discount for rooms without Air conditioning? Upon checkout, I encountered the same desk attendant who had initially told me that the ac just needed more time to work. I asked her about the discount, and she again told me there was nothing wrong with the ac. I reminded her that the hotel manager did acknowledge that the room was too warm and had told me there would be discount (although they continued to tell me there was no problem with the air conditioning.) She said she would give a 10% discount for that night. Basically, I can pay, and it\u2019s OK. But, 10% is an insulting compensation for sweating overnight in my $360 room; she then went to 15%. How generous! Internet Charges. The charge was 30 Euros for three nights. On checking out, the desk attendant told me that she had waived the Internet charge, as if I were complaining too much about the air conditioning \u2026 and I should be content with that. However, the 30 Euro charge was still on the statement. I travel a lot in the U.S., and Internet charges are a big pet peeve of mine. If a hotel wants to charge $360 for a room without ac, it seems a bit galling to charge another 30 for internet. Overall Reaction? If something goes wrong, don\u2019t expect caring service from this hotel. As a contrast, we\u2019d just spent four nights in Rome, where the staff from A to Z were super nice and welcoming. Hotel Inglaterra (or at least the manager and our front desk clerk), were not helpful or caring.

Unfortunatly this terrace was rather grubby, had no plants, umbrella or lighting (that's all it needed to make it a real treat) and didn't overlook Barcelona, but railings/industrial rooftops. This didn't matter too much, I simply rang down and asked for the staff to sort things...could they bring up some candles and an umbrella perhaps? They said they couldn't. I was really disappointed - and quite flabberghasted that a day later (when the staff had changed) that they immediately did all these things and apologised they hadn't prepared the room properly. We had a great evening out on the terrace, the staff even brought up an extention cable so I could bring a lamp outside so we could see each other. I did feel some money off would have been suitable - afterall, we only stayed for 3 nights and for 1 of them we couldn't enjoy the terrace we paid for. So it seems staying here MIGHT be a gamble as it depends upon which staff member is in charge. The manager who was in charge when we arrived didnt really know what he was doing (maybe new?). He was sweet enough though, even while admitting the aircon never works! Fortunately lovely Barcelona isn't too hot at the beginning of April. We did have a good time and the rooms are clean, decor good, bathrooms nice. My friends stayed in normal double rooms, which weren't spacious, but quite nicely decorated. There is no doubting the hotel is in a FANTASTIC position, and I cannot fault the very excellent breakfast.

We were a group of 8 people aged 60-70 and we had 4 rooms in total. Our room was 512 (5th floor) and had a balcony overlooking the street - Carrer de Pellai which is midway between Placa Universitat and Placa Catalunya. When we arrived, we got off the aerobus at Placa Universitat and walked the short distance (diagonally right) to the hotel. We boarded at Placa Catalunya for the return journey. The room had air conditioning and the toilet facilities were clean with a large walk-in shower. It was nice to have access to the balcony and once the door was shut, the street sounds were in- audible. During our stay, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey (their equivalent of the FA Cup) and after watching the 2nd half which was televised in the Placa Catalunya, we were able to watch the celebratory parade from our hotel balcony. Our friends in an adjacent room closed their balcony door and slept right through! Safes are available in reception and we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel on our last day until our evening flight. This was another bonus to having the hotel near the Placa Catalunya. We bought a 2 day ticket on the Orange/Red Tour Bus and spent the first day viewing the sights from the top deck, changing from the Red Route to the Green Route in order to see everything. Once we had got our bearings, we spent the second day hopping on and off in order to visit specific locations. We did see one incident of a wallet snatch in the park opposite the Sagrada Familia. Two young girls carrying a clipboard were asking for money. When an elderly gentleman stopped to read the notice and took out his wallet to give them some money, they snatched it and ran off. This was the only time we witnessed an incident of this kind. The girls had previously approached my friend and I whilst we were sitting on the bench waiting for our husbands but we simply told them to go away. As everyone says: Barcelona is no different to other cities. Just be on your guard and try not to make yourself a target. We walked down Las Ramblas late at night and had no problems although I would warn tourists not to venture too deeply into the area of Raval where there are many \"dodgy\" side streets, especially after dark.

Loads of places to eat and far too many to mention however about half way down the ramblas on the left is a courtyard with resturants lining its out side, I would recomend this area it was busy yet once at your table you can sit and watch the street performers and the word go by. My 2 top tips for any stay at hotel Inglaterra are, Have a lazy day on the roof terrace, its a lovely place and you can order room service to the roof - Potatoe Bravas and 2 beers only 11 euros which is reasonable. The second is to sight see via the bus touristic, it's 26E for 2 days and opperates on a hop on hop off basis. It is opened top and includes headphones for your own guided tour (very touristy-looking but a great way too explore at 1 fixed cost) the bus departs fron the square at top of the Ramblas but if you catct it opp the hotle on the corner you will beat the massive que at the square and are nearly certen a top deck seat. The tour vists all majior attractions including gaudi works, port olympic, nou camp and loads more - its a must if you have the time.

Breakfast (included) is served in the lower ground floor breakfast room with an ample basic continental breafast to start the day. The roof terrace was a delight. It was a great place to go and hang out and the hotel were most accommodating in providing a good size ice bucket and glasses in order to enjoy a glass of wine in the late afternoon. The location is perfect - you are 5 minutes walk from Catalunya, Gracia and the top of the Ramblas and yet in a slightly less frantic setting than being mid-Ramblas. The Museum of Contemporary Art (MACBA) is 5 minutes walk and the entire area of El Raval is wonderful to explore with great street markets are 'real' life. I stayed at the hotel with a group of friends and so we had six rooms of varying shapes and sizes but all were excellent quality and ideal for a stay in the city. If you are looking for large motel size rooms this isn't the place for you (but why would you be!).

The beds and towels were changed daily. The room was not very large but adequate enough for a short stay. A longer stay would warrant asking for a larger room. Storage space was limited, a chest of drawers would have addressed the shortfall.The hotel is just two minutes from the Placa Catalunya which is at the top of the Rambla. There are great shops between the hotel and the Placa and El Corte Ingles store is in the square. We only ate in the hotel once as we found a great restaurant on the left of the Rambla, near the hotel, called Attic. This had great food and evener better prices. We ate breakfast in two places, Viena, a cafe next door to the hotel (freshly squeezed orange juice, croissants and coffee), this cost 9.50 euro for two of us. We also had the same in Cafe Zurich on the Placa and it was 12.50 euro there but we did not mind as the cafe is steeped in history, worth a visit. To see the city and outskirts the best way is the hop on, hop off bus which leaves Placa Catalunya very regularly. There are two routes, the North and South and these join up for ease of transfer. We were a bit anxious, having read previous reviews that the staff might not be welcoming but we did not have that experience, quite the reverse, in fact. I fell on the afternoon before leaving and broke my wrist and sprained my foot. The staff were great getting me ice and ice packs plus sympathy and advice re contacting medical assistance, if wished. I could not fault them and found them very warm and welcoming. TIP - if ordering a taxi do it from reception, the receptionist will have the taxi driver call into the lobby and she confirms his booking, this way you are secure in the knowledge that you have got a proper taxi. I would recommend this hotel to couples, older people, smaller families, business visitors and single persons. As it is a quiet select type hotel it might not appeal to younger groups.

I chose this hotel for a holiday with my girlfriend, after having read promising reviews on this and other websites. We had a deluxe room with a terrace / patio and here is my experience of it. Strengths first. The hotel is very convenient to reach via bus (EUR 3.5) from the BCN airport to the Placa Universitat only 100 m away. The hotel service was impeccable, with very helpful and friendly staff. Breakfast buffet was affordable and of resonable quality at EUR 8 per person. Positives also include a clean hotel with nice decor and a superb location for easy access to the main tourist attractions. The room was reasonably clean (not under the bed !) and boasted a well-filled minibar and a modern SONY LCD TV. The patio was good to ventilate the smoke out of our clothes after restaurant visits. However. Deluxe rooms cost extra and I regret to write that our deluxe room with a terrace / patio was a minor disappointment. It was located on the ground floor, without any sunshine on the patio, and the room was nowhere near the 30 sqm as indicated on the hotel website. Around the double bed was only a 1m margin of free space. The bath was ca 3 sqm. The room also surprised us several times with a recurrent and quite unpleasant cloak-like odor. We even had problems with some loud and drunk neighbours who shouted for long in our corridor at 3.30 am. Had to call the reception to get those people quiet. Value for money ? Not for a deluxe room I would say. Take an ordinary room instead and save your money for something better. Or, alternatively, go all the way and book a suite. The hotel is a good one but somewhat misleading on the marketing side. Examples include the misleading room size, web pictures of the exterior looking way more grandiose and visible that reality (just a bit silly), and the promise that we could use the pool facility of their sister (luxury) hotel Majestic. It turned out to be closed for renovation. Again, silly, as it only takes a minute or two for them to adjust the hotel web to inform all customers about that. Some say the devil is in the detail. But there is space for improvement for the Inglaterra. This is only partly reflected in the hotel price.

Just a block from LaRambla area, it was conveniently located but next time I would stay in the Eixample area.

Eixample's just a short walk to LaRambla area, if the LaRambla area is important to you.

On our first morning my girlfriend was using the shower, and no sooner had she got her hair full of shampoo, the water supply from the shower totally stopped. We tried for some time to figure out what was wrong but there seemed no good reason for the problem. Hair washing was finished in the small bathroom sink. We reported this to reception, who with some sympathy said they would look into it whilst we were out for the day. On our return we politely raised the issue with a new member of staff, introducing herself as the manager. Without hesitation she began to insist with some aggression, that WE were responsible and that we caused the water to stop by turning on and then off the supply in quick succession. We only turned the water flow lever on and off AFTER the water had totally stopped. The manager then involved the maintenance man, who with an aggressive tone, made similar remarks in spanish (which was translated for us) - We all went to the room - the maintenance man walked into our shower wearing his dirty work boots and became irate with us. Their explanation for the problem then changed - they now said the shower hose had kinked and this was the cause. However, we did not adjust the shower once and neither did we notice any \"kinks\" in the shower hose that caused the water to stop. A serious kink would have been glaringly obvious to us as we examined the shower to see why it was not working. The Manager - Never apologised, took no responsibility for the problem, made aggressive comments, lumped all blame on us, dismissed our every comment, and used the angry words of the maintenance man to back her up.

Some noise from the street, but not enough to keep us up at night if we closed the window and turned on the air conditioning. Hotel staff were freindly and helpful. Room was in OK repair. Three comments: 1. Room was very small, and often two people would be in each other's way during busy times (like when getting ready in the morning). In all fairness, the hotel did offer to upgrade us from the Deluxe room to a suite when we arrived for 35 euros a night, and we declined (since we already thought at 210 euros a night was enought to pay for a hotel). 2. As others have written, no full length mirror in the room. 3. Bed was not comfortable, both my wife and myself had sore backs after sleeping on the bed, and we typically are not picky when it comes to beds in hotels. We did eat breakfast the first morning at the hotel for 12 Euros each. Breakfast was OK, but we decided to explore the area a bit, so we ate all subsequent meals outside of the hotel. There are hundreds of restaurants within walking distance. We found that in general you get what you pay for (expensive restaurant, better food, cheap restaurant, cheap food).

It was supposed to be guaranteed non-smoking but on opening this tiny window I found at least 10 stubbed out cigarettes on the ledge. When I spoke to the manager, Gemma, of the Inglaterra she said that if I booked again, I should email her personally and explain, and she would ensure the same thing didn't happen again.
