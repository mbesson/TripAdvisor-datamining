{"Reviews": [{"Content": "BEYOND EXPECTATIONS! this hotel was amazing from start to finish. i was there 2 years ago with my family.very clean and big for the price you pay... EXTREME VALUE! Everything is spotless and functional... the A/C was a little noisy at night but honestly... for the price you pay... you cant ask for more.staff was amazing and very willing to help. though english was minimal, it was sufficient. and for the price we paid... FREE INTERNET and hear this.. FREE INTERNATIONAL CALLS!!! what?!!? YES!!! THATS RIGHT!!! FREE INTERNATIONAL CALLS ANYWHERE WITH NO TIME LIMIT!!!!about a 10 minute walk from the Ikebukuro JR Station. On the way though, there are plenty to see and plenty of culture to absorb.free breakfast every morning.. not the biggest selection but food is fresh and taste great... selection of drinks is HUGE... u get about 10 choices and we're not talking bout coffee, tea or water.will definitely come back and planning to this year. highly recommended!", "Date": "Dec 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR498505236", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TripAdvis0ror"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066460-d1095040-r22710916-Super_Hotel_City_Ikebukuro_Kitaguchi-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1095040", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
