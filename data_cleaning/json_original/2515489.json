We were looking for something on the beach near Mission Bay or Pacific Beach but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. We stayed in Diamond Head for about 3 nights. For our price we had a suite that included a kitchen, living room, and separate bedroom. I'd say the pros are the price and the location. For the price the room is very big and we loved the separate living room and bedroom so that when the baby went to sleep we could still be out in the living room with the lights on and such. Also, the hotel was very family friend and provided a pack-n-play type crib which was already set up when we checked in. The location is just amazing. You are steps from the beach and boardwalk and walking distance to lots of restaurants and shops. We did not have any problem with parking and though we didn't use our car much, when we did we never had too much problem finding a space right in front of the hotel. The biggest downside is that the rooms are a little dated and just not that fresh feeling. I wouldn't say it was horrible or unclear necessarily, but the couch in the living room has seen better days and when we checked in I found pieces of peanuts on the carpet. Also the bathroom is fine but small and the room we were in the toilet seat lid was permanently open since the counter top was sitting on top of the lid. Not a huge deal but with an active and curious toddler it was one more thing to remember. The bed was fine but a little saggy in the middle. I'd say overall the strengths are the price and location. The rooms are clean and functional and a nice place to launch your vacation.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cWay beyond what we expected\u201d", "Author": "bill g", "ReviewID": "UR124784833", "Content": "I had read the prior reviews and was somewhat concerned about staying at the Diamond Head Inn, long story short, it was great.

I read tons of reviews on this place and was a little concerned by all the negativity! But the location was amazing, so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot, and for the price, it was too good of a deal to pass up. People were saying the, carpet/room dirty, no hot water, no ice machine, loudness of people outside, no parking, rude staff, no one helped with carrying bags, blinds falling apart, etc. None of that is true!!! I had called on our way into town, and the extremely nice lady at the front desk said we could get an early check in. The moment we pulled up, there was tons of parking. Yes the Diamond Head Inn does only have 4 parking spaces reserved for guest only, but along the street, right in front of the Inn, there are about 20 parking spaces. And we found a spot everytime we came back from somewhere. Although you really don't ever need to take your car anywhere, because everything is within walking distance. (But we like to venture out, and cruise down pch!) So we got there, checked in, the lady was extremely helpful; she even walked us to our room to be sure we wouldn't get lost! As soon as we walked into the room, I felt so relieved. You could smell the cleanliness of it, and the carpet was not dirty at all!! I guess this place was renovated about 4+ years ago, but if you ask me it is still in very good condition! The room was beautifully decorated with a bungalow type feel. And no blinds falling apart! When you walk straight into the back of the room, you enter a very nice size kitchen with a table and seating area for about 4 people. It was fully equipped with a refridgerator, microwave, and stove. And all cooking and silverware utensils, along with plates and glasses. The bathroom was extremely clean!! A little on the small side, but definitely did not bother us! As for the ice machine, there isnt one easily accessible, but we did go to the front desk, and the lady said they had some, but because she was so friendly and honest, she said it was most likely old, and told us we could go to the hotel next door and get some from them. She even called over there to let them know we were stopping by to get some. Our stay here was absolutely amazing. We went out during the day, but ended up just staying in at night because it had that nice, warm, cozy feel. We celebrated my boyfriends birthday, Valentines day, aaaandddd he proposed to me here down on the beach!! I am so glad we stayed at this Inn, because it just made all the celebrating that much better!!! This will always be a place we return to, not only for the great memories, but for the wonderful stay that we had here! Thank You to all the staff at the Diamond Head Inn! I hope this review helps a lot of people find their way to this beautiful spot in Pacific Beach!", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "31\u00b0 54\u2019 04.32\u201d N / 35\u00b0 00\u2019 51.82\u201d E", "Title": "\u201cPleasant rooms on a good location\u201d", "Author": "GeoPhil", "ReviewID": "UR121550312", "Content": "We: 2 families with adult children We were friendly received by the front desk staff.

We park day one and WALK everywhere. That's the beauty of this hotel. Where else in Mission Beach can you stay 20 yards from the beach at such affordable rates? NO WHERE!! \"You can hear people talking\" Then don't stay on the boardwalk at a popular beach. Go stay at a Motel 6 on Hotel Circle instead. \"No utensils\" Yeah, well people steal of break. Yeah, over time we have noticed less, but you know what, we bring our own and they don't know unless people tell them. \"There is no pool\" Um, hello?? There is this thing called the Pacific Ocean right in front of you. I just want people to know that this is a nice little \"diamond in the rough\" find. The front staff is friendly. One girl even attempted to find us a special store on-line, however we did not want or need to bother, given how busy she was. The offer was good enough. I think some people just expect too much.

First time was wonderful but this time not so much. Now I will say that the rooms I had both times were very nice, clean and comfortable. The location can not be beat. Just a quick walk across the parking lot and you are at the boardwalk walkway AND steps away from the beach. This was the main reason I picked this hotel the first time I stayed and what drew me to it again this last trip. The abundance of homeless people hanging out is something to consider but it not the hotel's problem to solve. And being a single woman staying at this hotel I can honestly say I did not feel that my safety was in jeopardy. I'm not one for hanging out at the bars or being out alone after dark so this a non-issue for me. Now if you are looking for a place right at the beach and close to resturants and a nice walk to Belmont Park then this is the place. The cons would have to be that if there is a problem AFTER HOURS when the office closes then you are suppose to call their sister property- which I was never told nor is it posted anywhere in the room- until AFTER I had a problem. The problem was a group of drunk & extremely noisy people in a room directly across from my room and in a room downstairs across from my room. These people decided it was ok to yell, talk loudly and carry on from 1am-3:30am. IF I had been told or had known to call the sister property I surely would have. But unfortunately I just had to lay in bed and listen to them. Again being a woman alone in the hotel there was no way I was going to open my door and say anything to them. I did slam my windows closed but that had no effect- it only made my stay in the room stuffy and warm, even with the overhead fan on. The next morning I did go down and voice my complaint and was told they would inform the manager. No offer of any refund was given. Thankfully I was checking out that morning- I was tired, cranky and irritable. After waiting about a week and not hearing anything from the management I decided to write a letter. THAT did the trick and I received a call from Jim Silva the manager- who told me that he had just put a partial refund back on my card for the inconvienence and apologized. I was happy that he did call and for the refund. My only suggestion to Jim is to PLEASE post in the rooms that if there is a problem when their office is closed to please call their sister property and list the phone number. It sure would help knowing that is what to do and to have the sister property's phone number accessible to call. I can't even remember what the sister property's name is so it would have been impossible to even look it up at 2am. One other thing I need to agree with is one reviewer mentioned that they had emailed the property and asked about an upgrade and got no response. I also did this- in fact I sent off 2 emails and never got a response. If Diamond Head Inn isn't going to answer emails then don't put an email address on the website. That's just plain bad customer service and doesn't instill one ounce of confidendence to prospective customers. Overall I will say that even though this hotel has a few issues they need to address it is a really nice place to stay and you can't beat the location for being near the ocean and in the heart of Pacific Beach/Mission Beach shopping & resturants. I'd love to stay here again next time I visit San Diego but have to admit I'll be checking around at other properties before making my decision.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAvoid - dirty, overpriced and disinterested staff\u201d", "Author": "bollidear", "ReviewID": "UR108945330", "Content": "So having read all the TripAdvisor reviews - we were looking forward to our 6 days at the Diamond Head Inn. Ok, some some reviews were extremely negative - but most were very positive. There lies the issue. Don't believe all you read!! We booked into the small untidy office and collected the room key. As soon as we entered the room (110), we were in total darkness and no light switch. After opening the blinds and turning on all the sidelights (this was at 3pm), it became obvious why dark would have been better. The carpet was badly stained in several places, pillows were off white with stains, walls had shoe scuffs on them and the chair was badly stained. It's at this stage you look deeper. The vertical wall radiators were filthy with dust/dirt/grime on every element and the place just felt dirty. Even the wall picture above the bed was broken. The back door opens out to a very dubious rear footpath and the rear windows have no security on them at all. Rear door just has a standard lock on it. Kitchen utensils can be counted on one hand. We asked to see another room, that was even smaller though marginally less stained - with the staff being entirely indifferent to our issues with filth and staining. Time to call Hotels.com for a full refund and get the hell out of the dump. I read a lot about the wonderful staff offering up a valuable car parking space. But lets figure this one out. The Hotel only has 4 spaces allocated to it - when it has 21 rooms. The Manager thinks its ok to suggest having to use parking facilities several blocks away - and yet reviewers have thanked staff for moving their cars to allow them to park????? So you think Diamond Head is cheap? Think again. You have to pay $7.95 a day for internet and will probably have to park several blocks away. We got a reservation at the Dana om Missionary Bay for the SAME price as the Diamond Head. If you have already booked or are still going to book - CHECK THE ROOM OUT FIRST. Also book with someone with clout who will ensure you get a 100% refund - like hotels.com. A final note - I emailed the Hotel 3 times before we arrived to inquire up an upgraded room - not one email was replied to. This may be a great hotel for surf bums, who will likely be too smashed out of their heads to notice the filth - but with age comes an expectation of what a Hotel should be - and clean is usually top of the list. It amazes me that there are so many positive reviews for what is a dump of an establishment.

A hotel/motel with typically unhelpful, uninterested staff and adequate if not awe inspiring rooms. However, the real pay off is the location of the property. It is 20 feet from the steps which lead you down to the spectacular Pacific Beach and ocean. To put things in perspective, the Pacific Terrace (\u00a3270 per night) if right next door and Tower 23, (\u00a3230 per night) my personal favourite if money wasn't an issue, is a 2 min walk away. During the day you are sharing the same beach space with guests of these 2 aforementioned hotels and in the evening you are dining in the same restaurants. These 2 hotels are certainly a cut above what the rest of the area has to offer in terms of accomodation.

We booked a promotional rate on the website and ended up paying $69/night, an unbelievable price considering the amenities, neighborhood and proximity to the beach. We requested a one bedroom suite and mentioned that we would be two adults and one child. They accomodated us well by putting us in a room with two queen beds (I didn't even see this option listed). I thought that was a nice touch. The lobby area isn't impressive, but who spends time in the lobby. The rooms are very nicely decorated and clean. The kitchenettes are very newly remodeled and have granite countertops and table. It was a very comfortable room (despite the lack of air conditioning). It was in the low 50s on the first night and we couldn't get our wall heater to work. A maintenance person came within minutes of reporting the problem and it was fixed immediately. The temperature ended up in the high 80s on the last day of our trip and to be honest the room was uncomfortably warm. I was glad we were packing up that day. The continental breakfast was muffins, awful coffee, and \"juice.\" Fortunately, we went to Trader Joe's on our first night and stocked up on breakfast items, so just used the muffins as a snack. The kitchennetes have a stove-top, full-size microwave, a small fridge, and sink. I think that adding pantry staples such as cooking spray, salt, and pepper would be a good idea, because cooking eggs on old teflon pans isn't always tasty. We never had a problem parking within one block of the hotel during our six day stay. I'm sure this becomes more of a problem during the late summer, but it wasn't an issue for us at all. The only major complaint that I have is that there was no internet AT ALL. The website lists \"wired\" internet as an amenity. This would have been a serious problem if my husband couldn't connect his computer to the internet through his Blackberry. I wouldn't have booked there at all had I known they didn't offer internet.

Great maid service every day, helpful staff and totally close to the beach. Only downside was that as other reviewers have said, it can be noisy but we only had one bad night.

California. The room was very clean, the kitchenette had everything we needed to cook in the room. Bring spices! They don't take up much room in the luggage and you'll be happy you brought them! The manager there was very quick to help my boyfriend when he locked himself in the bathroom our first 15 minutes in our room! There was always fresh coffee brewing in the lobby, and lots of brochures about things to do in the area. Be sure to take the Tijuana Trolley to Tijuana, Mexico. It was an experience we'll never forget. It was easy to get to the Old Town Station from Diamond Head Inn. Okay, I have only ONE thing to bitch about...the parking situation at times, (6AM to 9PM) was horrible. They have no parking garage, and the parking spaces out front are NOT reserved for motel patrons. They are usually filled with surfers from early morning to late night. So you may have to park 2 blocks away sometimes, but it's good exersize anyways, and it's well worth it. We would stay at Diamond Head Inn again because the people were great, it was right on the Boardwalk, and it was a great value....Thanks for the great service, and we can't wait to return...Randy and Annie", "Date": "February 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA, California", "Title": "\u201cToo Hot, Too noisy\u201d", "Author": "Kadoogan", "ReviewID": "UR1854461", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel on May 1 2004.

The other guests in the hotel were also up till all hours of the night.

HOWEVER, what is it that you want from your hotel? The price was incredibly inexpensive especially for being right by the beach and in southern California. From what I have read, some travellers were expecting a world class resort with five stars. The hotel and its staff never promised nor advertised such amenities. If that's what you want, then expect to pay for it. One person made the comment that he or she moved to the hotel across the street, which he or she commented as being \"much nicer\". Well, I noticed that the price was $100.00 more a night. That is a significant difference! The hotel marketed itself in a very professional manner and when I contacted the office, they were very honest in letting us know the amenities, location, and condition of the hotel. They told me that it was under repair but we would get a spacious room with a kitchenette. We had a suite with four separate rooms and a complete working kitchen! All this for less than $100.00 per night! We were usually outside on the beach or in town anyway and the room was more than enough to give us a place to rest at night! It was extremely safe and clean. In conclusion, the Diamond Head Inn and its staff surpassed my expections.", "Date": "December 21, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loudon, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel ever!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1424425", "Content": "This is the worst hotel ever... I will never suggest this hotel to anyone. In fact, because it was so horrible my husband and I moved to another hotel after only one night. We got to this hotel on Wednesday, September 24, 2003 for three nights. When we checked in the front desk clerk immediately told us that there wasn't any water for at least an hour because they were doing construction on the building. Fine, I understood that these things happen. We dropped our bags in our room and went for a walk on the beach. This is the only thing that was going for this hotel, it was so close to the beach. When we opened the door to the room it was not clean and it had a gross mustly smell but I was determined to make the best of it. When we got back after two hours we did have water. I was looking at my reservation confirmation wondering how I could have spent $100 on this hotel and noticed that it said \"all rooms with kichenettes.\" This room definetly did not have a kitchenette. I decided to ask at the front desk. He told me that he did not have any rooms left with the kitchenette but could move us to a suite. I thought, oh good this has got to be better. Well I was wrong. Yes, technically it was a suite. A kitchen, livingroom, bathroom, and bedroom but this room smelled worst than the last. The rug looked like it had stains all over it so bad that I wouldn't even take off my shoes to walk around. The bathroom was missing the toliet paper holder, the toliet ran constantly and faucet dripped. The bathroom had stains all over the walls and looked liked it had never been clean. The pillow cases had stains and because we didn't have any air conditioner we looked in the closet and they had three box fans that were covered in more dust than my grandmother's attic. We decided to suck it up for the first night to see what happened. It actually made me nausea to lay my head down on that pillow. The next day we moved across the street to the Pacific Terrace Hotel which was heven compared to this hotel and only cost $100 more a night. A small price to pay for piece of mind. When my husband checked out the guy at the front desk told him that this happened quite frequently and that's why they were attempting to renovate. At our check in they told us that because this particular hotel didn't have a pool we could use the one at their sister hotel (never told us where) and that a continental breakfast was served in the morning (never told us what time or where). I think this hotel attempts to rip people off. They need to do more than renovate and it really isn't fair if they know that there hotel is in such bad shape to rent it out to others. Close it down and renovate.
