The hotel is very cool and had a lovely laid back feeling. The room was pretty nice and big for how reasonable it was- although the quality of some of the fittings weren't amazing it was clean and had some really nice design features. (Actually the entire hotel has some really nice design!) It's right beside the U-Bhan and really easy to get to. Situated in the middle between city centre and arty Kreuzberg. Breakfast is a bit pricey but worth it. The only negative was that the cleaners left the window open 2 days in a row in our room. So after being out all day in the freezing cold we got back to an ice box of a room! But once I complained they apologised and offered us a chocolate mit rum! Overall it was a great hotel-good fun (bar stays open pretty much all night) and I would recommend it to other couples and groups, probably not families with very young children though.

Just call this place the hipster mothership. OH I forgot - hipsters would never call themselves hipsters. OH so sorry. Well if the shoe fits... Myself - I most, absolutely, do not fit into that category, however I do love me a fancy, not trying to look fussy designer hotel so when I landed in Berlin the Michelberger was the only option. I mean look at their front entrance. How could you not love a place that welcomes you with \"New S**T Has Come to Light\"? OK so to be serious for a minute here are my thoughts on the Michelberger as a hotel. 1. Good location more or less. Across the street from a subway and down the street from the train that connects you to the main station (prob. 15 mins). 2. Daytime staff is cool. and friendly. Of course they are international hipsters. Hipsters speaking English, German, Italian, Spanish, Hungarian, etc... take your pick. The overnight staff however is this decidedly \"not cool\" older dude (who only speaks German) prob cause all the cool kids are hung over from some \"art pahtee\". 3. The \"cozy\" room is compact and has all you need. Most important the queen bed is nice and firm (and could be quite kinky if you have 3) with a view of your showering buddy for those into that kinda thing. 4. WiFi is free and fast. 5. the place is hopping! There is a restaurant and cafe and bar. IMPORTANT!!!! If you want to actually sleep make sure to get a room that is NOT facing the courtyard as there are people partying there until 4am. If you plan on joining them - never mind. 6. Finally the breakfast buffet (not free) is actually one of the best hotel breakfast buffets I've seen in a very long time. Lots of choice and very delicious. Also the people watching in the morning is quite the riot - I lost count of the ironic T's, arty giant glasses, etc... Have I mentioned that the staff here are more friendly than you have the right to expect them to be? I was half expecting to hate this place but ended up liking it in spite of the trendiness.

The courtyard is lovely, and must be a great place to spend an evening in summer. Cool and trendy decoration all over the public areas and the rooms, with a lot of small details. I had a band room (that would easily fit 5 people) for myself. Comfy beds (two of them in the \"loft\"), and I l really like the \"book / paper theme\" that is all over the hotel. The hotel is just opposite the Warschauer Strasse U and S-Bahn station, from where you can pretty much reach every place in Berlin.

WIth the U-Bahn, S-Bahn and tram on the doorstep there are really easy connections to all of the city. The Michelberger is a great hotel with a really friendly feel to it. We had a loft room, which was a good size for two but easily could have slept three people. It was warm, comfortable and had lovely big windows, luckily double-glazed the hotel is on a busy road. There was a tv and some interesting decor/furniture, including rope shelving and a ladder up to the mezzanine sleeping area. There were not many extras to the room (no kettle, iron, etc) but these seemed to be available at the reception, and it was nice to have spacious room that was lofty and uncluttered. Shower gel and a big bottle of water were included with the room. The bathroom was small and en suite. The shower was good but the bathroom was dimly-lit and separated from the main bedroom by a frosted glass window - private but not completely so! It is definitely worth paying the extra for breakfast - it is served in the restaurant downstairs and there is plenty of choice - cereal, breads, pastries, eggs, meat, cheese, fruit and lots of teas and juices as well as coffee. It's also served until 11am in the week and 12 noon at weekends so no early starts necessary. The bar downstairs serves good coffee, fresh cakes and pretzels and very scrumptious hot chocolate. The guy with the beard behind the bar mixes a mean margerita too. There's a really friendly party feeling in the evenings, and a good mix of random pop from the 80s and 90s was played on Friday night. By day it's more like a coffee shop or a common room and provides a nice place to hang out. It's not somewhere to stay if you want a standard generic hotel - this is for people who want a bit of character and something that's a bit more like a hostel but without the budget feel. It's also for people who don't mind a bit of noise from the other rooms when other guests get home after a night out. The hotel has some of the biggest warehouse clubs nearby and some clearly come here to party. But don't think this is just for young people; there was a really good mix of ages and nationalities and the atmosphere is very relaxed and welcoming. The staff are brilliant - speak perfect English, always very helpful and genuinely seem to like working there. We asked for information about travel to the aiport and got a bespoke printout with timings, platform numbers and clear instructions - so helpful!

We will certainly be back and would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for an easily accessible location in Berlin and a good base for exploring the city/ sightseeing (especially for those in the city for the first time). There are so many \"uber-hip and trendy hotels\" in the world's major cities that just disappoint and fall short of expectations. In some cases, the staff are too hip to care or nothing properly works in the rooms. I'm glad my initial concerns about the Michelberger were proven wrong. The pros: Friendly and helpful staff who efficiently checked us in when we arrived in the morning and out. A hearty breakfast with hot and cold food options (and sufficient choices for vegetarians as well). Daily housekeeping service and the room was always kept clean. There is a restaurant/bar right by the hotel's reception area where they sometimes have live music (Not sure what the food is like in the restaurant/bar because we didn't get a chance to eat there but they have a good cocktail and wine list). I really liked (and appreciated) the modern aesthetic of the place and the smart use of space in the common areas and bedrooms. Even though the hotel has a very modern feel it wasn't cold or uninviting. The cons: The internet connection (although free) was very spotty and slow in the room and even in the common areas. It only worked 10-20% of the time we were there. We didn't mind this very much since we were in Berlin on holiday and only tried to access the web for trip planning and personal email. This is definitely something to consider for business travelers. Other considerations: The hotel is located in the Frederichain district, an up and coming and increasingly gentrifying/yuppified part of town but it still has much of its gritty character and industrial quality (at least for now). There are several restaurants and interesting boutiques/stores (selling clothing, jewelry, art, etc.) within a walking distance from the hotel. The Michelberger is also within walking distance from the East Side gallery. The U-bahn and S-bahn stations are located across the hotel. Berlin is very well connected by public transportation (i.e. trains, trams, etc.) and the major attractions (i.e. Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, Christmas markets) are no more than 20-30 mins by train from the hotel. The hotel is 45 minutes to an hour by train or bus to Tegel/TXL airport. I would guess the guest age demographic at the hotel is between early 20s to early 40s but that does not mean you can't stay here if you're much older. It depends on your preference. We stayed at the \"cozy\" room which is certainly true to its name. The room is very basic with a full sized bed, bathroom and toilet. I would say this room is best for couples. The Michelberger has other bigger rooms (more loft-like spaces) available. Our room was all the way in the back and it was generally very quiet so we managed to get a good night's sleep during our stay. I'm not sure how sound proof the other rooms are especially when there is live music playing or an event at the bar downstairs.

The rooms are big and clean, the breakfast is a delicious smorgasbord of German food (and the dining room is gorgeous), the bar is a fun place to hang and the staff are super friendly. The staff were more than willing to show us how to get places on maps, recommend restaurants and nightlife -- all recommendations were spot on. Only a few small complaints: 1) the wireless seems to be a little spotty throughout the hotel. I wasn't able to pick it up at all and you need to get an individual code to access it. Weird. 2) there are no phones/landlines in the rooms. if you don't have international service on your mobile phone, you're pretty much out of luck. There is a hostel a few doors down that has an international pre-paid phone booth that's not too inconvenient to use if necessary. 3) They advertise that they have sandwiches and snacks available 24hrs, but actually they don't. We came back starving from a night out hoping there'd be something to grab in the bar area and there was nothing. We ended up having to go to the pretty gross kebab shop down the street. Plan accordingly. 4) One afternoon, we asked a girl at the front desk to recommend some shopping streets in Kreuzberg to check out and instead of showing us quickly or telling us to take a short walk over the bridge down the street on the right, she told us to buy these Michelberger Guide maps for 1 euro each and sent us on our way. I felt a little ripped off. I get it, they want to sell these guides but it would've been nice if she had opened them and taken 30 seconds to show us where to go.

They were going to have a dj with a bbq the weekend that we left- it sounded fun. The room is funky, it's not luxurious. The bed and towels are not super comfortable. The stairs/ ladder going up to the bed is not for everyone. (there's a day bed on the main floor if you're too drunk). I found the city of Berlin so exciting that I didn't really want to hang out in my room. There is not a gym, but you can rent bicycles down the street. I stay in a lot of corporate hotels when I travel for work. I was really charmed by the design and personal details of the Michelberger.

It was a much bigger hotel than we had anticipated - but this was good. We had a loft room which faced the main road. Unfortunately there was no A/C and this was a big downside for us, because we experienced some hot days and nights. Luckily there was a small fan next to the beds; which saved us. The loft room has a toilet with shower, TV, some comfy loungy thing and a sink; downstairs. Upstairs is just a bed - or shall I say 2 thin matresses side-by-side. The beds could have been better. PRO's: * Even though the room faced the main streets, it was quiet at night once we closed the windows. * It is a funky hotel with an awesome (and Fresh) buffet breakfast - with anything you could ever want. * Sometimes the hotel organises lunches, dinners, BBQ's outside in their bar, which is really cool - good atmosphere. Really good use of space * Mostly the staff were friendly * Awesome for transport - 1 minute away from both S and U Bahn stations. CONS: * Bed could have been improved; werent big fans of the 2 thin mattresses side-by-side. * We couldn't seem to get our room serviced properly on 2/4 nights that we stayed. After the 1st night, they took away our towels and didnt replace them. So we were left with one wet bath towel and 1 wet floor towel. Toilet paper wasnt replaced either. We had to ask for some from the cleaner we saw in the hallway. * Location - wasnt as close as we would have liked - it was about 15minute walk to the more lively streets in this area. Overall, we had a good stay, but will probably stay elsewhere next time.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tijuana", "Title": "\u201cA Hipster's Hotel/Hostel: Different and interesting. The best? ...Not sure!\u201d", "Author": "Psicoloco", "ReviewID": "UR115192611", "Content": "Hello readers, hope you're enjoying your day! Well, we stayed at this interesting Hotel through July 2 till July 7 2011 traveling as a couple; we chose this place because of the reviews posted in this site and also because of the Hotel's website which let me tell you, it captivated us! Yet we didn't made a bast research of Hotel options which we should have done. Now that we experienced it I would say that we ended up with \"mixed up\" thoughts about it; the best thing of this place is definitively the price! Although Berlin is very cheap city (no using the word \"cheap\" as a pejorative) but for sure this hotel is a good bargain for what it offers; basically we did OK in this hotel, not awful not excellent, but OK... And I would say that this Hotel has a very peculiar public as a target which might be young Hipsters, alternative personalities, modern design lovers/freaks , local arts scene dudes, in other words something very \"Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg\"; we're not gonna use \"lay-back\" as an adjective to describe this place since we didn't experience that vibe (in general) actually we observed some amount of pose and attitude but again its a Hipster thing. So if you're an average tourist, a family, someone looking for a regular hotel features, someone traveling without a budget or none of the above mentioned I would rather suggest looking for more \"orthodox\" options. Now we would try to explain very objectively OUR thoughts about this place with a PROS and CONS list, (we find necessary to mention that this comes out from our personal experience and we do not intend to give rather a good or bad impression about this interesting place, just personal perception): CONS: - Dumpster: As a the previous reviewer said, choose wisely your room (avoid 212 to 238 rooms), there's a huge local dumpster just in the back of the hotel and it's not only the view what is mortifying, since there's no AC in the rooms you'll have to open you window to get some fresh air (now imagine whats next!), also, activity at this dumpster starts very early so if you have a light sleep be prepared to be woken up by machinery noises. - Beds: Beds are not so comfortable so people with back problems, be aware. - WiFi: So slow! - AC: No AC in the rooms and believe me, Berlin can get very hot and humid in summer. - Layout: Reception and Hotel Entrance layout, to reach the reception (and hotel's elevator) you need to cross through the bar's lobby and the bar, this might be OK or cool for some people but since there's a party every night it might get very crowded, some nights we dealt with crowds (and very drunk people) to get into the hotel after a long and tiring day out. So if you're not intending to stay in the party, this is not a very comfortable feature. - Attitude from some of the personnel: this is a very interesting point, we were attended by six different people during our stay (in the bar, in the reception and in the restaurant) and I would say that 3 from 3 were cool, kind and helpful, the other 3 were very indifferent, long faced and we felt like they were annoyed by our questions and/or requests. We thought this might be because of the lack of English (not everyone speaks good English and we don't speak German, LOL) or a cultural thing but a couple of German friends (one living Mitte and the other one in Friedichshain, Berlin) told us that it was all attitude, they used the phase \"Sh***y Berlin Hipster's Attitude\" and that because of the hotel concept and vibe it would a common thing to get it. Well the point is that since its a Hotel, good quality customer service must be always a must, and even tho they're cultural differences between locals and tourists, a Hotel staff is expected to know them and manage them to make their guests stay pleasant and comfortable. PROS: - Location: Such a huge plus; Warschauerstrasse S/U Bahn (just across the street) connects you with everywhere worth visit in Berlin. There's a Kaiser's supermarket about 5 minutes away from the hotel were you can buy treats, booze, groceries, etc. - Nightlife: If you like the night life you have amazing bars and clubs near the hotel like The Berghain, The Waterfront, The Lido, the Ichiban Karaoke, all bars, restaurants and venues around Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. And if you like to walk, well you can reach Alexaderplatz in just 20 minutes away. - East Side Gallery: Just around the corner. - Concept: The concept is amazing, more than a common stay its an experience, we really think that it gives you a good idea about what's happening in Berlin's design, cultural and art scene. Obviously they're a bunch of good designers and artist beyond this project which is a very interesting thing to observe and experience. - Some of the staff: Again, half of the personnel that assisted us during our stay was very helpful and friendly, there's this tall and pretty girl in the reception that was extraordinary helpful and attentive, sadly we saw here once during our check in process. - The Bar: Well if you're don't wanna party outside the Hotel you can do it inside, there's something going on every night, a local rock band, a cool DJ, etc. - Price: for us, the best feature of this place is the price. Such a bargain! Before Berlin we visited Belgium, The Netherlands and other cities of North Germany and this was the best deal as for hotels. If you're using your hotel just for sleeping and shower I believe this might be a good option just because of the price. Overall this Hotel might be enjoyable or the opposite depending on taste, interests and expectations. If you're a frequent Hostel customer this place might be amazing (also if you're into the Hipster scene) but If you often stay in regular 3-5 stars hotel, think it twice and be aware. If coming back to Berlin this hotel might be a second option if we don't find a better place to stay.

We had a horrible location tiny budget room (226) over the rubbish dump but our friends stayed in the luxe gold room and loved it. Breakfast although nice was expensive at 11euros each. We didn't stay in the room much, Berlin is there to explored, it turned out to be a good stay. However, the low point merits mentioning. First night some idiot set the firelarm off at 3am, so we had to walk through corridors of chemicals, waiting outside without explanation for 45minutes only to returning to our room door open (with all our belongings/passport / creditcard/cameras in there) without appology or explanation, let alone refund by staff Positives: Nice relaxed vibe in hotel, friendly staff, communal spaces were comfortable & stylish. Transport is on doorstep, location is excellent for kreuzberg and friedrichstein bars. Lovely hotel dog. Free wifi Negatives: Budget room which was absolutely tiny; 3 hooks for a wardrobe; shower was an clear window so not only could the room see us shower, but the worker from the rubbish dump saw naked. The toilet in the room meant this was far from a romantic stay. Without a fan or air conditioning we had to leave the window open so the noise (bin men every day incl. weekend started at 6am plus birds squarking over rubbish) and smell wasn't fun. A ceiling fan would help enormously!! Top tip: Get a room overlooking the courtyard!

Our room was spacious and unique. I enjoyed spending a few minutes exploring its quirks before crashing for a nap on the lofted double bed. The free wifi they offered me at check-in allowed me to track my boyfriend's flight and map a route to the airport to meet him on time. His feelings about the hotel were just as enthusiastic as mine. Although we did not have time to check out the bar/cafe next to the lobby, we did thoroughly enjoy the 9 euro breakfast each morning and let me tell you, it was worth every CENTIME!!!

The second time I went back with 3 girlfiriends. After a drive of 12 hours we arrived at the Michelberger in the evening to find out that they had overbooked the hotel and that we had to go to another hotel, because other people wanted to stay in the room one day longer!!! We made the reservation months ago! Why didn't they said to the other people that the room was already booked and that THEY had to go or had to wait untill we where there? SInce we had the terrible long drive we didn't want to go in discussion and we really wanted to come back anyway.....cause the nice stay of the last time was one of the reasons to come back again! The other hotel was really crap. It was a hostel with shared bathrooms, not nice looking rooms and not as nice looking hotel. So we were very very very dissapointed that we couldn't stay at the Michelberger have of our stay in Berlin. All we got is 1 free breakfast. Since I really like the atmosphere of the hotel we went back for that other night (and beacuse the other hotel was bad). I will go back again, cause of the looks and location. I just hope I just hope that next time I will get the room for all the days I reserved it. Or else it would me a big dissapointment, again and I think I wouldn't go back anymore. I am not sure whether it is a hotel for older people, I would more say that it is for young people. Couples or friend doesn't matter.

The reception area sits adjacent to the cafe and lounge area, which you have to walk through whenever you come into the hotel. Mostly this was ok, but every now and then when I just wanted to get to our room (and a winding path it was, too, to reach it), especially at night, I wished we didn\u2019t have to go through this area. No a big deal though, especially since the people in the cafe and lounge area always seemed very chilled out. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful, and all in my experience spoke excellent English. We didn\u2019t book our room with breakfast, but ate there pretty much every day of our stay because they were so good, and were very good value for money \u2013 it was a help-yourself buffet. The breakfast room itself, where they also held dinners sometimes, was really cool, with a few small stand-alone tables and large tables with long benches \u2013 there were views out to the S-Bahn station, and as an interesting people-watching area this proved to be quite good fun as part of the breakfast experience. The hotel is in an excellent and interesting area (e.g. close to the East Side Gallery), with lots of great places to eat and drink very near-by. It was also close to both U- and S-Bahn stations, and to the tram, so public transport was easy and convenient for going anywhere at all in Berlin. Possibly the only disadvantage of this versus a more central hotel was we were often reluctant to return there to chill out in the late afternoon before heading out again \u2013 not a big deal though. We had a 12 night stay in one of the loft rooms (ours was room 111), which was close ground level with a view of the courtyard. At first I thought this would be a problem from a noise perspective, but this proved unfounded. It was a very quiet room, even when there was music in the cafe and lounge area. We didn\u2019t end up hanging out in the cafe/lounge much, but the events they had seemed to include cool music and chilled people. It was a very mixed crowd of people staying at the hotel, too, which was nice.

The rooms are quite quirky too - we booked a band room for four people and had a great upstairs area with netting to stop you falling out of bed! The whole place had a great 'Berlin buzz' about it and we ended up finishing our nights out with a bottle of wine in the bar which has a great chilled out ambience and which seems to be frequented by locals as wells as musicians, artists and dancers as they travel. Very convenient for tube and overground trains too and an easy 5-10 min train journey to central Berlin. We also walked one day and it only took about 30-40 mins.

I went to Berlin for a week's holiday and booked this hotel through Expedia, having read other positive reviews and seen some photos I decided this was the hotel for me. My room was small but perfect, with even the basic room having big beds (queen/king, I can't remember which) as well as a TV, wet room with great shower, and a fan. Honestly I don't understand why people are complaining about the lack of air conditioning. This is Berlin, Germany. The heatwave was a one off, maybe if you were in a year-round warm country you would expect A/C but not in Europe! Also this hotel isn't 5-star, so if all inclusive breakfast is what you want, you're looking in the wrong place. My only gripe - and this is very minor - is that there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, I only say this as even the cheapest budget hotels provide this facility in the room. Otherwise for me, the room was great and I really loved all the little details, from the rope towel racks, to the cute colourful coat hangers, the sepia photos on the walls - and who could forget the funny Michelberger labels on everything. Very fun! The location of the hotel is ideal. I knew I didn't want to stay right in the centre of Berlin so chose this location. As others have said, the Warschauer Strasse U-Bahn and S-Bahn station is right across the road, with all lines stopping there. A short walk away is a Lidl, Kaiser supermarket, the East Side Gallery, and lots of highly recommended cafes and restaurants. Step out of the door of the hotel and walk left, about a minute later you'll discover an amazing falafel place, Momo Falafel, where you can get a pita bread or box of falafel and help yourself to the accompanying salads and sauces for just 3-4 euro. Perfect for when you don't feel like venturing far! Breakfast was great and at \u20ac9 I was expecting great things - I needn't have worried. Plenty of fresh fruit, muesli, homemade breads, meat, smoked salmon, croissants, jams, butter, fresh coffee and tea, eggs - all sorts of yummy stuff to help yourself too. I think I had breakfast at the hotel nearly every day of my stay! The staff were always really helpful, never rude, and the only time I had to wait to be seen was if they were speaking to another guest, or on the phone. Yes, the hotel does focus on the kitsch and quirky side of things - but that's the point! To have somewhere a little different, informal, doesn't take itself too seriously. During my stay I saw other guests of all ages, couples, solo travellers, students, businessmen - it just goes to show that this hotel can suit everyone. Often I would just go downstairs to the bar/lounge area just to read, grab a drink and a slice of cake, and relax somewhere outside of my room. The bar is also well stocked, with hot and cold drinks at reasonable prices and strongly mixed! For anyone who's a fan of the Big Lebowski, try the Michelberger's 'The Dude' cocktail :) Mostly, I loved the fact that you could just wander around the hotel, take pictures, or do whatever you wanted without feeling like you weren't allowed to explore. My advice to anyone staying here is, take this hotel for what it is - a budget but fun, comfortable and quirky hotel in a great area of Berlin.

We stayed there for 7 nights, and started to notice that everything wasn't so great after all. At first the hotel was just like described, very cool, nice details and also the room (loft room) was very cosy. The hotel is near public transportation, u-bahn, s-bahn and tram. So very easy to get to and also in an interesting part of town. But. ..First of all, the room was cleaned properly only the first two days of our stay. The next days it was bearly cleaned at all - beds were not made, floor wasn't cleaned, or table tops. They seemed to only take out the trash from the small carbage bin. There was dust everywhere from the street because we had to keep the window open, due to the fact that there was no aircon. Towels were not changed until asked. Not that they have to be changed every day, but during a week you would think so. We told the reception about this, and no change in the cleaning. About the staff - they seemed quite nice, but you would always have to wait a long time before they had time for you. Sometimes there were three staff members kind of there, near the reception - but only one to serve the customers. They didn't seem to be very professional, a bit too much hanging out and not doing there job. I had the feeling that I was bothering them if I had a question. They did not do anything about the cleaning in our room - I didn't think they took it seriously. We checked out in the evening because we had a really early morning flight, and had to do it through very loud music as there was a band playing in the lobby. The desk could be in a different place - so that the music wouldn't disturb talking to the staff at the reception. Also music from the bands in the lobby (almost every evening) was too loud (could hear it clearly to the room) and disturbed our sleep as the music went on until at least twelve in the night. So - I would recommend this hotel only for a short visit, and only if you care more about a trendy and cool atmosphere than the service of a hotel.

But, because it was quite hot and humid in the rooms (due to no circulation), we had to make the choice of either getting some air or sleeping. I agree with an earlier review that said the staff were not particularly helpful. They weren't unfriendly, just a bit disinterested. The biggest issue I had was I reported a (very) noisy fan in the bathroom on my way out one morning, and asked for it to be fixed that day. That night (around midnight) the fan started a loud thumping noise meaning sleep was impossible. I reported it to reception who made an effort to fix it without success and who couldn't answer why it hadn't been done during the day. In the end I opened the window because the street noise was preferable to fan noise!

Very easy to get to as it's right across the street from two bustling U and S-Bahn lines, one of which (the U1) runs through Kreutzberg (like Berlin's Brooklyn) and many of the decent and un-touristy places to eat and hang out while there. When we arrived we were amused and impressed with the decor and the small touches of kitsch everywhere (ie. the old vinyl-framed b&w photos of random people). The beds in the upstairs loft seemed pretty comfy, and the shower was nice. Cool layout and great utilization of space. Stylish and unique above all else. So, we took advantage of the locale and went out to some great clubs and bars each night of our stay. Michelberger is across the river from Watergate and around the corner from Berghain. The loft was sweltering each night or morning when we came to bed despite having a fan blowing right on us, and neither of us had a good night's sleep for the time we spent in Berlin. There's no ventilation at all. Even worse, napping during the day was way out of the question because of the roar of traffic below; our options were to roast like turkeys in a quiet room with the windows closed or deal with the noise and try to get some sort of air flowing with open windows. It's paradoxical in a way--this is a place where a lot of partygoers flock to, yet a terrible place to sleep off a hangover. It is not the staff's fault that there was a heat wave while we were there, nor is it their fault that a torrent of endless and cacophonous traffic rolls by here twenty-four hours a day. We appreciated the unique vibe this place has to offer, but we simply couldn't sleep a wink while staying here. We paid around e80/$100 a night for no amenities besides hipness and lo-fi appearance. In a city with 600+ places to stay, you can find something better for this price.

The bar serves probably the best coffee in Berlin and some very decent cocktails too. Breakfast is a relaxed buffet affair set in a separate room with long refectory tables and a delicious organic range of breakfast items such as salmon, eggs, cold cuts, juices, coffees and teas, breads and cereals and fruit and veg, at 9 euros per person. Snacks are available all day in the bar at a reasonable price and are of great quality. Service is charming, welcoming, friendly, efficient and super-helpful. Bedrooms are set around a large courtyard, home to smokers, bicycles and some tables for warmer climes. The cosy Room does just what it says on the tin; its compact and ship cabin like, with not much storage or hanging space. The rooms are simply decorated, with humorous touches (altermative Do Not Disturb door sign is a classic example). Even though the rooms are small, they are all surprisingly airy and bright, the double bed is large and super comfortable, and the shower hot and powerful, and everything is spotless. The hotel is right opposite the U1 line that runs east to west and there's a tram service too.

In addition, the neighborhood where it is located (Friedrichshain) is a very interesting neighborhood if you're a young person looking for a dynamic neighborhood with cultural activity.

The room where we stayed was the Loft. It is a large room where a big bed is housed at a height. There is a big table too, to put everything you need there, and there is also an extra bed with big cushions that you can use like a sofa. The windows facing the street were beautiful and the bathroom is clean but have little light. Another notable thing perhaps is the breakfast. For just 9 euros have a varied breakfast with various products of high quality. In addition, people who work there are very friendly. It's very recommendable to have a breakfast there!

The hotel's theme is \"under construction\" - and they play this out with spackle on the walls above a certain height. One does gets the feeling they might have just been too cheap to finish painting, but they manage to pull it off. The lobby and cafe are really confortable, and have the vibe of a chill cafe. Hipsters hung out all hours of the day and night, and the decor is created by rotating displays of bold art and piles and piles of random books. We stayed in three different rooms over three nights - we had booked a room for 3 people, but when we arrived they didn't have that room available. To their credit, they gave us two doubles for the price of one - but this still was not adequate as we wanted 3 individual beds, and 2 of us guys had to bunk together. The double-bed rooms are really small and only adequate for a close couple or single. The last two nights were better, as we had the \"loft\" room we originally reserved, which are a fantastic deal in this city. The hotel itself is clearly an old factory, and the rooms do have a very loft feel - I wish they did better with the appointments and toiletries, as these are a little on the cheap side. The hotel is really great for young people who don't need lots of service or luxuries - when we asked for bedding for the sofa/bed in the room, it was dumped off by the night watchman. We had to make the bed ourselves. I'm not looking for Ritz-Carlton service, but having to make my own bed in a hotel was a bit annoying. I grew to really like the location, but first impressions were that it was strange. It is located out on what feels like an overpass by a major convention center. The U-bahn line terminates across the street, but it is not the most useful line if you are trying to get to the center of Berlin. The S-bahn station is a bit of a walk through inhospitable industrial surroundings, but nothing unsafe or really far. It doesn't really feel urban - surrounded by rail yards and vacant lots, but somehow works with the place. The location is, however, very close to the hippest nabe in Berlin - Freidrichstein. Great restaurants, shops and cafes are really a 10-15 minute walk away. The location is kinda perfect for what must be the interests of their clientele. If you don't go expecting top service or a \"normal\" hotel, the Michelberger is truly a hipster find - this is not your typical boutique hotel or design hotel experience, but one that has rougher, edgier vibe that bespeaks uber cool Berlin.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cThis is the perfect hotel for tourists in Berlin; I will stay here on all future trips.\u201d", "Author": "BosTrav", "ReviewID": "UR53885450", "Content": "This hotel has everything you need for a great trip to Berlin, and represents a tremendous value. The location is ideal for exploring the hip neighborhood of Friedrichshain (and the East Side Gallery) on foot. To get to other parts of the city, the U-bhan and S-bahn are directly across the street -- this will end up saving you loads of money on cab fare. Even in the dead of winter, we used cabs only to/from the airport. For all other trips, the U-bahn, S-bahn and buses are the way to go. The public areas of the hotel are decorated well, especially the breakfast room. Speaking of which, the buffet breakfast could not have been more perfect -- and for only 9 Euros, it is a steal (especially if you eat as much as I do.) The rooms are very basic, but very comfortable. You have everything you need as a tourist in these rooms. The beds could not be more comfortable, and if you stay in a loft room as we did, you will not want to get out of bed because of the \"cocoon\" effect you experience on top of the loft. Also, our room was on the second floor and looked out onto the street facing the U-bahn but there was zero noise from the outside. Note: if you are a business traveler, this hotel might not be ideal for you. There are no fax machines (or telephones) in the room and there is no business center or fitness center. These are things I usually look for when traveling on business. Also, I do not think the location is ideal for business travelers who probably want to be closer to other areas of the city. I also do not think there are conference rooms available at the hotel for business meetings. The price cannot be beat. When staying in Berlin, I normally pay more than double what I paid to stay here. Yet I found myself wanting for nothing, and, in fact, enjoying my experience much more. Lastly, I want to comment on the service. On the morning of our checkout, we waited outside the breakfast room just before 7 a.m. when it opens. Because an employee was ill, there was only one staff member responsible for preparing the breakfast and setting it up on the buffet. She saw us waiting and opened the breakfast room a little early for us. She could not have been more friendly and apologetic for the fact that she needed a little extra time to get things completely ready due to being short-staffed. She put out items as they were ready and told us repeatedly (in perfect English) that if we needed anything we should ask her for it. Her apologies were totally unecessary as we understood that we were very early (we had to get to the airport to catch our flight) and despite being short-staffed she had the place under control.

My girlfriend had booked so I was aware that it was going to be a 'hip' budget hotel but could not have envisaged the ambience, the relaxed aesthetic that infuses everything about the place without ever comprimising on quality or value for money. The ground floor is welcoming, warm and stylish. There is a large lounge bar area that guests and non-guests lazily mingle throughout the day and night. The bar is well stocked - it has good quality and tasty food - and was tended by a quirky range of staff ranging from pretty young things to men in their fifties in strangely apt bow ties. I really liked it that the one quality that united the staff was friendliness and not age, looks or background. The room was an impressive design feat with a mezzanine floor holding the bed that faced a huge window overlooking the grafitti-strewn train line. It might not sound a huge aesthetic hit but then it depends what you like; I liked the quality of the room, the view showed me an undeniable aspect of the city I was in and it felt honest but stylish. The breakfast is fantastic value and was a real pleasure. For 9 euros they serve fresh breads, fruit, meats, cheeses, wonderful scrambled eggs, tasty coffee and the nicest jams I've had in a while. It makes a mockery of the breakfasts too often found in large corporate chain hotels. Finally, I guess I would say the staff were a significant aspect of our experience. They were friendly, clearly loving their jobs and part of something more than simply a business. The place has an ethos of relaxed but unwavering style, and it is delivered at a bargain basement price.

The hotel is cool and funky and definitely fits the neighborhood it is located in. They openly admit that they are in quite an ugly area of the city right on the sign out front but they make the best of it. The rooms were always clean and made up quite promptly - there were a few hangers for clothes and a small space to put your bags. The breakfast is pretty good and served until noon - a rarity with hotels so they are definitely aware their clientel spend their nights out late. On the down side, this late night habit of guests proved a bit of an issue. We give service 3/5 primarily because even though they were quite helpful when we spoke to them, there was only one person working the front desk even at busy times and it would be quite a wait to speak to them. And a bigger deal - at around 4am one night someone came back - obviously froma night out drinking and started pounding on a room door across the hall, yelling for someone to open up. This went on for quite a while and unfortunately there are no phones in rooms to call the front desk and our room was quite a distance from the front desk. The noise issue is the main reason for only 4 stars - the hotel backs onto a recycling destination and at 8am each morning but Sunday we had machines hard at work. Overall it was a great experience - lots of good bars and restaurants within a short walk and U & S Bahn connections plus a Tram right across the street. They were unable to locate our reservation which could have been a big problem on the big weekend but they seemed unworried and settled everything quite quickly. There is free wireless but you have to renew your password each day at the front desk. Definitely recommend this place - especially if you are planning a visit around an event at O2 World or want to visit places in Friedrichain.

Common Areas: Great vibe -- the lobby seating area has plenty of obscure books and magazines to peruse, and the lampshades were constructed with old East German glossy magazines. And that's before you even reach the front desk. For some, the central focus of the common area is the small, pleasant cafe area, which serves the usual coffee drinks, sandwiches and the like. But more important for this weekend's festivities was the courtyard, which would be the scene of a tropical-themed 2-night kickoff party sponsored by Bacardi (or some other damn brain-pollutin' dark liquor that always bites at inopportune times). Generally speaking, my room was on the 1st floor, facing the courtyard where the band would be playing. More specifically, my window opened onto the stage. As in, I could lean out the window and nearly tap the bassist on the arm (I refrained from doing so). The lovely young lady at the front desk had explained that because of this weekend's festivities, \"it might be quite loud at times.\" Woman don't tell no lie -- it rocked like a Blue Oyster Cult concert, circa 1978. (I can't find the umlaut on this computer.) Anyway -- No sleep, and I didn't care. With so many nightlife options in the area, the one (loudly) outside my door turned out being the best. Gotta love it when a plan comes together. Rooms: Small, functional, and economical. Paid about 62 Euro per night. That first shambolic weekend, the accommodations were still a work-in-progress -- on my 2nd night, the shower broke, and leaked water all over the floor. No harm, though. Handled with a smile. Service: Five stars. I'll be honest -- being from a more, say, \"staid\" part of the world -- I was fearful that the place would be infested with Annoying Hipster Douchebags (AHDs). Several of the artistes at the bar, who were clicking away on their MacBook Pros, raised my Douche Awareness Level to 4. And there were more potential AHDs near the front desk. Did they... work here? I should've calmed down. The staff, while undoubtedly dressing the part of the dissolute mid-20s slacker, were outstanding. Case in point: I mentioned that I forgot my razor, and the guy standing next to me disappeared, almost without saying goodbye. Five minutes later, he returns with a razor he bought at the local drug store. I could see he was out of breath, too -- he must have jogged there! In all my years staying in hotels, I've never seen anything quite that ... well, touching. Class move. (To return the favor, I picked up some power adapters at the electronics store in the mall at Alexander Platz. The staff thanked me way too much for this little housewarming gift.) Location: I grew to like Frederickshain, but all in all, like Prezlauer Burg a little bit better. The Hotel itself is right across the street from a main station. That is a good thing. Overall: Crazy, chaotic, cheap, fun and friendly. Great concept, and while it's still a work-in-progress, they appear to have an enthusiastic team. I'll definitely be back.

The unusual layout of the website speaks for the hotel as a whole. This is really a funky hotel. Well worth the money, as it is not at all expensive (rates as low as \u20ac65 for a double room with a proper third extra bed, not a sofa). Even though the hotel has only been open about a month or so, the atmosphere is already a bit like staying at your best friends place and I am certain it will be more expensive to stay here in the future once the hotel has been open a few months. Location is brilliant. About 100 meters from the U1 (Warschauer Strasse) and another 3-400 meters to the S-Bahn which takes you out to Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport in 15 minutes. Trams and buses stop outside for connection with other tube lines and other cool parts of old East Berlin. However, if I am to give the room a few bad pointers they are: 1. The room type that we were staying in was defineatly not suitable for a person of larger size or with a disability as there are very narrow stairs leading up to the double bed. The whole room is built according to \"compact living\" ideals. If I think about it, you should propably not be too drunk either, as falling backwards might leave you permanently lodged into the flat screen TV on the wall behind you. 2. There is an in-wall light installed by the lower right side of the toilet that gets seriously hot. Risk of getting burnt. 3. Not a single English speaking TV-channel which could cause some distress for someone who doesn't speak German.
