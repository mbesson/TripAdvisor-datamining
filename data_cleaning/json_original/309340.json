I have stayed at Rambutan Cottages with my husband three times over the last 5 years. It is always a treat to get there and be greeted by friendly and efficient staff. The rooms are delightful no matter what you choose with well designed and appointed features. The grounds are beautiful and the pools clean and refreshing. There are plenty of relaxing places to hang out ranging from day beds to pool lounges. The restaurant sells delicious and well prepared meals catering from western through to local tastes and the bar selection is comprehensive with some great wines available. There are some fantastic tours on offer. We've been to isolated waterfalls that take hours to get to (Lemukih), snorkelled in places that rivel the Barrier Reef (Menjangan Island) as well as adventures closer to Lovina like a trip to Munduk and into Singaraja, all with very good drivers from the hotel.We love it there and will definitely be going again to explore more of the region with the help of our hosts Richard and Tini Hood. They are a very friendly family oriented couple who make us feel special. Tini runs a shop on the grounds which sells very good quality crafts, jewellery and textiles.", "Date": "Aug 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR528651307", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "triki997"}, {"Content": "Paradise at Rambutan       Setting off at dawn", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR679256653", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Travelmad05"}, {"Content": "Cant wait to go back A highlight of our recent trip to Bali was the week we spent in Lovina at Rambutan. Our hosts Richard and Tini made our stay. They were friendly and helpful, but seemed to know when we needed our space. Our teenage daughters were welcomed and included in activities with their daughters and experienced a 'non tourist' side of Bali. We felt relaxed and comfortable. Our rooms by the large pool were quiet and comfortable having an interconnecting door was a great peace of mind for us and our girls. The decor was delightful and the plumbing worked!Next time we go it will be to visit our frinds Richard andTini and family.", "Date": "Aug 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR641176024", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Siliamru"}, {"Content": "Paradise Found We stayed at Rambutan as it had been highly recommended by a family member. We were not at all disappointed. In fact it was like being in paradise surrounded by tropical gardens of palms and flowers and a choice of two tranquil swimming pools. We had planned to do a bit of sight seeing yet we found we preferred to just spend our time relaxing around the pool and enjoying the excellent service offered by the staff with all meals enjoyed overlooking the big pool and just soaking in the ambience. We could see it was a great place for all types of travellers. There were excellent provisions for children, making family holidays enjoyable as well as rooms for people on a budget and when venturing through to the larger swimming pool you come to the deluxe rooms and suites for people seeking indulgence.

After being collected from the airport by a driver, organised by Rambutan Hotel, we stepped into the grounds of Rambutan feeling like we had stepped into a Balinese paradise. The grounds are beautifully layed out in a mix of Balinese and Western styles with very creative and well maintained gardens.Our room was spaciuos and clean and overlooked a piece of farmland of palm trees and a rice paddy. Richard and Tine were always friendly and helpfull and gave us lots of hints on what to do in the surrounding area.The restaurant is right next to the larger of the two pools and the food and service were excellent. I'm afraid we were a little guilty of spending a bit too much time around the pool....there is nothing like sip[ping a Tropo Dropo (a cocnut full of a delicious cocktail) while the sun went down.We would have loved to have stayed longer but we had already booked to spend time in the south.....next time for sure!!!Timothy", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR968065091", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jojopili"}, {"Content": "rambuttan cottages-heaven on earth we stayed at rambuttan cottages for 3 nights in july- it is an absolute paradise- fabulous villa, beautiful gardens, sensational pool and lovely staff. i would highly recommend anyone going to bali to get out of the hustle and bustle and head up to lovina- great scenery, no tourists, fabulous off shore snorkelling, dolphins and much more- we will definately spend longer there next time.", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR815974213", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MelbourneHelenb"}, {"Content": "Don't Believe the Hype This place was curiously busy despite the fact that the rest of Lovina was relatively quiet at the time we visited. I imagine that was because of the large amount of good reviews it has received on this website. Unfortunately we were the victims of these good reviews. Having never visited Bali before we made our reservations at the Rambutan in advance. Based on our previous experiences in Southeast Asia the price seemed a bit high but with all of the rave reviews we thought we would splurge a bit. I admit that this may have negatively influenced this review because our expectations were pretty high, Especially since we had stayed at several other hotels earlier in the trip which were considerably cheaper and, as it turns out, much nicer. First off, the grounds are lovely and each pool is very nice. We stayed in one of the rooms surrounding the smaller front pool on the second floor. Although nice on the outside the room lacked any type of character that we had grown accustomed to throughout Bali with four blank walls and a very dark and drab bathroom. In addition, the walls were so thin that we could here everything our neighbors were saying. The shower was OK but most of the time the water was lukewarm at best. The room was equipped with a TV with 10-12 channels of an identical station. The station would occasionally change randomly presumably by the staff utilizing a master control somewhere! The most annoying thing about the hotel was the 10 AM checkout time. This is the earliest we have ever experienced and since we had a lot of time to kill on our last day prompted us to pay a half day rate in order to leave later. Breakfast was included and adequate at best. All in all the place was OK but once we checked a few other hotels out nearby we realized that we had really overpaid for what we got. We are still trying to figure out why so many people like this place when there are so many options in Lovina that are not only cheaper but much more attractive. We won't be going back to this hotel.", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR481036616", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "thoth182"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Hotel, Wonderful Staff...

We had asked them to arrange the wedding for me and my wife as well as the wedding dinner. We had booked the three villas as well as two deluxe rooms.The hotel grounds are beatiful as are the rooms and especially the villas. They all have been built with an incredible attention to detail and personality and they all feel really unique. One thing that might be of interest though is that the honeymoon villa lacks an indoor bathroom, so if you're afraid of bugs you might want to choose a deluxe room or one of the other villas instead. Also, the floor of the shower (in the honeymoon villa) is covered with loose stones. Shoes are recommended!One thing that was lacking were decent locks on the doors, at least on the villas. This might not be a real problem, but if felt a tad unsafe. Especially since the hotel information specified that they didn't take any responsibility for items in the safety deposit boxes either. The pool was a bit small, but worked great for our needs. It might get a bit crowded with more people in the hotel, but we were very happy with it. Sadly the beach close by was very dirty and full of hawkers. After a walk there we stuck with statying on the hotel grounds.We took all our meals in the hotel restaurant. Food and drink were cheap and everything was very tasty! In hind sight we'd probably preferred to stay on the Rambutan rather than moving on as we did.Service in the hotel was great and left nothing to be desired. Everyone was polite and happy to help out.After a bit of stress due to a Balineese holiday being on the same date as the wedding everything went great. We left the hotel in the morning and drove to Munduk waterfall (I recommend getting a car with AC, something we did not. We just figured that all decent cars had them). We held the ceremony by the waterfall and it worked out splendidly. If I could do it again I'd probably have had the priest hold the ceremony in his native tongue instead of english. We'd have heard and understood about as much and he would've been much more certain of himself. As it stands it just added spice to a wonderful ceremony!After the wedding we headed back to the hotel. Our villa we're almost covered in flower arrangements. All very beautiful and much appreciated! In the evening we we're served to a delicious buff\u8305 dinner by the pool, with a lot of candles lighting the area. Great food and arrangements throughout!Check out went without a hitch. The only problem being an erroneous charge that we discovered a few days later. This was solved immediately though and without argument, which just gives us an even better view of our stay at the Rambutan./Magnus and family from Sweden", "Date": "Jul 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR202928269", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Lorkster"}, {"Content": "Fantastic architecture at the Rambutan Had two nights at the Rambutan in a two bedroom villa right by the main pool.The buildings look fantastic and are a credit to the owners, and airconditioning in both bedrooms  living area are all top notch.Also had a garden toilet and shower which was a nice touch.The mosquito nets on the beds came in handy as the traditional style rooms meant they didn't keep the bugs out.Richard and Dewi (apologies if I got that wrong!) are very nice and add a real family feel to the hotel with their family and menagerie of pets.Breakfast was more than adequate, and we had a great pizza, nachoes and chips for lunch one day.The pool was great with a large shallow end that's suitable for small kids, and is nice and close to the bar.Wireless internet can be bought down the road at SpiceDive.We dined one night at Sea Breeze, and another at Spice Cafe which are both on the beach. Food was great at both and it's heartbreaking to see how quiet some of these places in post terror bali.We found the Lovina area a couple of paces slower than South Bali and really enjoyed our time at the Rambutan - the architecture on the villas is something else.The best thing that could happen to Bali is for tourists to return, particularly to the places off the beaten track.", "Date": "Feb 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR557394286", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hardsell"}, {"Content": "Nice short stay Stayed for just 1 night at this quaint ultra clean hotel in Kalibukbuk.

Superb cottages, bathrooms to die for (apparently they took 3 weeks each to build). Run by a Bali/Aussie couple therefore you get the best of both worlds: - excellent Bali service and price and good wine! It also means there is a selection of 'western' food to complement the superb bala Dishes (can be useful if you have kids). The owner is also very good at pool and will happily challenge guests. The owners also made an effort to talk to all their guests, but were not pushy, they just made you feel very welcome and relaxed. 2 lovely pools and it's in a quite location but within easy walking distance of other amenities.What would I change/bad points? Can't think of any, just fab! If you want to just relax by the pool after sight seeing, I can't think of a better place.
