We picked this Hotel mostly based on Rick Steeves\u2019 travel guide recommendation, the good location and reasonable rates. However their impressive website fool you, it just doesn't match reality, at least not for the room they put us in. The furnishings and decor is not nearly as clean, spotless and maintained as it looks on their website. The bathroom was ridiculously tiny (for four), smelled mouldy and had a A/C drain pipe coming out of the ceiling, dripping directly into the shower stall. Because room service left the floor mat neatly folded on the shower threshold, it soaked up some of the A/C drain fluid and caused it to leak all over the bathroom floor. The staff was not particularly friendly and the breakfast was simply not worth sitting down for, (if you can find a table in a very cramped and noisy dining area during peak morning times) - nothing fresh, just pre-packaged foods, including the 'croissants'. In regards to the A/C charges, beware they will charge you as long as you have the remote in the room, even if you don\u2019t actually use it. I made the wrong assumption they monitored A/C usage with their computer, as most hotels are able to control the A/C from the front desk. Even though we didn\u2019t use it the first day, they insisted on charging me. It wasn\u2019t so much the 10 EUR/ day, as the attitude I received from Sabrina which really annoyed me. We also had noisy neighbours above us, (kids jumping on beds it sounded like), and when I made enquiries at the front desk, they told me that the floor above does not belong to the hotel, and are private residences. The one good thing was the location in terms of nearby attractions, however the actual street (via Venezia) and building entrance was very unattractive, sooty and dirty. Overall not a great value. I emailed the manager after our return to tell him of our experience and he said he would try to address some of the issues I had raised.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville, Virginia, United States", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay all around!\u201d", "Author": "GabrielRodriguez", "ReviewID": "UR122758074", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Italia from December 26th, 2011 to January 1, 2012 and everything about our stay was excellent.

It was really well-located. It was a short walk from Termini for buses and trains and there was a bus stop a few paces away - handy as the metro was on strike when we stayed. Our rooms were nicely appointed with spacious shower rooms and tea and coffee making facilities. If I have a bleat or two to make it was the aspect of our room (70) which looked out onto a small enclosed space directly over the kitchen vent of the 5-star hotel restaurant next door. We could tell what time of day it was from the cooking smells. Our hotel owners had thoughtfully provided an air-freshener which helped a bit. Also we did not have bedside lights and only one bedside table. Our daughters' room (66) looked over a different 'inner space', equally ugly to look at, but both of our rooms were incredibly quiet because of their aspects - no noisy traffic to disturb our very sound sleep. I think we had these rooms because of our late booking. I saw a number of other lovely rooms by nosing through open doors while the maids were preparing them for new guests. The rooms had Italian TV only showing Italian versions of all the tripe we get at home - e.g a ladette to lady programme, cookery, millionaire - so being able to speak Italian wasn't actually necessary to follw what was going on! The hotel occupies a few floors in a tall building with a lift. We were on the third floor which had its own little breakfast room (breakfast until 10am) where a maid looked after us each morning by making tea and lovely coffee. In addition we had a nice buffet to choose from - breads, pastries, cereal, tinned fruit, yoghurt, hard boiled eggs, omelette, sausage, many spreads, mayo and ketchup! We walked all over Rome and were pretty tired at the end of each day so we were pleased to find a little restarant immediately opposite the hotel door on the first night serving pizza and pasta amongst other things. Subsequently we ate at the reaonably priced Ristorante al Viminale (turn right then left from the hotel door) which seemed to be popular with the locals and served a variety of pasta and other dishes with lots of side veg dishes which we were really beginning to crave. The service was great and incredibly fast. We'd recommend the 20 Euro 48 hour bus ticket which was a hop on and off deal going all over the city. This was great for sightseeing when one of us couldn't walk any more. Rome traffic is heavy and very slow so we didn't mind relaxing on a slow tour bus taking it all in. The hotel also booked Vatican museum tickets for us online. This cut down on queuing but it was still a couple of hours shuffle with 100s of other people to get to see the Sistine Chapel. Queues for St Peter's Basilica were 2-3 hours long so avoid if possible or risk going later in the day. Take your own hairdrier if you need to blow dry. The ones in the bathrooms are white tubes without much puff. There is free internet access in the foyer - brilliant! We would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a city break.

Otherwise, our preference is to stay at B & B's. This was our second trip to Rome. First time (4 years ago) was only 2 days. This time we stayed 6 days starting on 22 December at Hotel Italia in a quad room on the 3rd floor (where they have remodeled rooms that were formerly part of an apartment). The room was comfortable, very clean, with a large beautiful bathroom.

This, alone, made us feel like home - but add to that the wonderful, helpful staff - and you really do want to stay there indefinitely! At the main desk there is Sabrina, who is so very personable and full of helpful suggestions and so very easy to talk to. She made dinner reservations for us on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (along with Abdul - who also assisted in making reservations when Sabrina was off). The breakfast each morning was so lovely and delicious! We left to go to Sicily for 5 days and returned again to Hotel Italia for 2 more nights before returning home. This time we had a quad room on the main floor - which was just as lovely and clean. The bathroom was smaller, but was just fine for us. As everyone else has already mentioned, the location is perfect, the neighborhood is great with many wonderful places within walking distance to eat. Do be careful of pick-pockets in the subway station during rush hour. We had a very close call - we knew better, but were still feeling jet lag and not thinking straight.

The hotel is on a small street called Via Venezia, off Via Nazionale. To my understanding, it is split into two locations in opposite buildings on the same street, and we were staying in what I suppose was the main one. It is not so obvious from the outside, but just follow the sign into the residential-looking building and you'll find it one floor up.

Everything was cleaned very well each day, and the included breakfast was a great start to the morning before all those hours of walking :) The staff were all very courteous and helpful.

The hotel's location was fairly distant from the \"major\" sites, but close enough to the metro. This made it a little tiresome at the end of each day/night to hike all the way back to the hotel.

We met up with my cousins here, after we'd been traveling in Italy for over a week, and they picked the hotel, so I did not do any research into Rome hotels. Our double was half again more than any other hotel we stayed in, except for the luxurious Hotel David in Florence--same price for the room, but extra for parking (45 Euros per day, although hotel staff told us it would be 20) and and 10 Euros extra for aircon--which stopped working at 2AM. So, this turned out to be by far the most expensive hotel we stayed in, and certainly not the nicest. One set of cousins had room 14, which was on the corner and quite pleasant--nice size bathroom, and breezy, Another set was down a long hallway, and the only window looked out onto a filthy interior airwell, so no breeze whatsoever. Our room had a shower so small, with a fixed shower head, that it was easier to walk down the hallway and use the common shower in the hall. And no breeze, so even though it wasn't particularly hot, the room was uncomfortable because there was no air movement. So we paid extra for the aircon remote. When it crapped out around 2 AM we had to open the windows, which let in only mosquitoes and noise--no breeze, as we faced a 6-story building. It also gave 16 windows a direct view of our bed. Went to see the night manager around 4am, a very pleasant man, who tried all the remotes he had--none of which worked. Explanation was that \"sometimes machines just don't work, and it can't be explained.\" But we still had to pay for it. It wasn't a bad location--Despar market at the end of the street, and a very good restaurant just across the street from the hotel.Ice machine did not work well, and we had no refrigerator in room, altho one cousin did. 15min walk from Colosseum.

You can also hear people in the corridors easily * Safe wouldnt work and Shower head was broken (showers are tiny i'm 5'4 and average size anyone bigger (round the middle) could not get in them. * Bed is rock hard and 1 pillow each gives you a very sore neck the next day * Bedroom fan rocks so violently when you turn it on was too scared to use it.

We got to the reception and politely pleaded with Gabriel to allow us a room in the main building ( not that it was anything great, but at least there was a reception, a little dining area, some signs of life and a sense of security about the place )...Mr Gabriel was rather unfriendly, kept shrugging his shoulders and (a) blamed his management (b) blamed us for arriving late ( we asked for a car to pick us up so its not like they didn't know we'll be reaching at 8pm) and (c) blamed it on some big group arriving the next day ( sure ! ). We were not allowed to call the manager and \"disturb\" him.

I had booked a single room, was given a reasonably-good sized room with a double bed and ensuite which was very clean and comfortable. A continental buffet breakfast was included and the selection of foods on offer was more than adequate and the coffee was great. Free wifi with computer was available in the breakfast room at any time which was appreciated.

Reception is manned 24hours/day and there is lift access from the ground floor. Rooms were serviced daily. The location was great - on a quiet street only about 10-15 minutes walk from the train station. The hotel was located about half way between the station and the Colosseum, and thus was not too close to the seedier places near the station and it was also on the 'better' side of the station. It was also only a 10-15 minute walk to the Colosseum (and 30 minutes walk to the Vatican), so very handy to get about Rome on foot which was my preferred method of exploring. I would agree with other posts that it appeared to be quite a safe location, I had no problem walking around in the evening finding places for dinner. The only 'negative' I could say about Rome is that 3 days was nowhere near enough time to spend there, but being a 1st time visitor to Italy it gave me a good taste.

Our room was small, but we had just enough room to open our cases next to the bed. The bathroom was relatively newly remodelled, but tiny and there was a definite smell of drains emanating from it.

We had breakfast in a separate room that seemed to be used only by the people staying on that floor (we were on another floor separate from the reception area).

Fodders had said the rooms were very small, clean and cheap. Which is all true. But when I looked up the hotel on line before I booked it, the rooms looked much different. On line, the two twin beds were separated (double occupancy room) and it looked bright and airy. Our room was not like that. Our beds were together and the furniture just looked very old. We did have a huge window, but no sun light came in. Our room was across the street from the lobby, which meant in order to use the internet and have breakfast, we had to walk across the street. The hotel does not use any kind of key card so in order to get into the front door of the building, you need to use a regular key... as well as another key to get onto your floor, and then another key to get into your room. When you got into your room, you had to lock the door behind you with the key. It took some getting used to. The hotel offers free internet in the lobby, but there is only one computer and every time I went to use it, someone was on it. The rooms do have free wi-fi but I was not traveling with my laptop. The hotel did experience two blackouts during our stay, but luckily since we were staying across the street, we were not effected by it. The Colesseum is about a 15 minute walk away.

After we arrived and received a warm welcome, we were taken to our room in the building across the street. The new part of the hotel is located on the 3rd floor. There is a lift, but we never used it. By the way, the 3 people at the reception desk that we ran into during our stay spoke English very well. And, there was someone always available. The room was small, but we expected that after lots of research and reading of reviews. It was fine with us, there was a double bed and a small desk and chair in the room. There was also a very small TV that would pick up CNN off and on. We were there right before the US election, so my husband would check in while we were in our room. The walls, however, are very thin, so you can hear people in the next room. No one was ever too loud. The bathroom was especially small, but there was always enough hot water for us both to take a shower in the morning. The was a hair dryer available, although it was a hose attached to the wall. The bed wasn't the most comfortable and there was a lot of street noise outside our window. We had earplugs and shut the window if it got too loud. With the window shut, the noise was muffled enough to go back to sleep. Breakfast was next to the lobby. There are 6 or 7 small tables in the room. During our stay, they served pastries, cereal, a yogurt and fruit mix and coffee, tea, or cappuccino. They also had a laptop in the lobby for guests to use for free. We used it a couple of times to check our email, which was the only way we kept in touch with family. We didn't bring cell phones. The location of the hotel to the sites is great, especially the Colosseum. It was a 15 minute walk there. We also used the Metro, Repubblica stop, when we were too tired to walk back or to go to Vatican City. The Metro is very easy to use and cost 1 Euro for 75 minutes of travel (on all public transportation). Buy your tickets from the machines, you can chose different languages.

The clerk said she was happy to help, and put us in a nice room in the main building. The room was actually fairly large for a European hotel, and had a decent bathroom (the shower leaked and the toilet seat was broken), but overall in good condition. The next morning we were told we had to move because a family wanted to stay all int he same area of the hotel. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, except for the following. They told us they would move our belongings if we packed them up. Instead, they left them sitting in the hall all day, and made us move our bags across the street. Which brings me to the bigger issue. The hotel advertises free internet available in ALL rooms. We were told the only way we could have internet access in the other building is if we could pull free access from the restaurant below. My husband's work allowed him to take off a day from work, as long as he completed some tasks (for which we needed internet access). Despite explaining this repeatedly to the staff, who spoke fluent English, we were told our only option was to stay in the room across the street. The clerk said that because I originally asked for the change in the reservation, they were not obligated to honor their advertising stating they have free internet in all rooms. I asked if I could cancel the reservation and book somewhere where they do no not have false advertising, and was told that my only option was to take the room they offered. In addition to no having internet access (which resulted in my husband having issues at his place of work, and ruined 2 full days of our holiday), the room they placed us in was about half the size of the original room, with a tiny, broken bathroom. The toilet seat was almost completely detached from the toilet, the shower nozzle wouldn't stay in it's casing, and sprayed water everywhere, and the room was so noisy from 6am-1am that we literally couldn't hold a conversation (I believe there was construction going on, in addition to the normal noise of a busy street in Rome). I was really disappointed because I thought for 140 Euros a night, I would have a little better service, and that I wouldn't have to put up with bad attitudes - the bottom line is, the hotel is okay, but the staff just simply didn't care about providing what they advertise, and made absolutely no attempt at offering alternatives - the best they could offer is that my husband could come over to the main room and use their laptop (thus inconveniencing all the other guests, and making him work in a busy, noisy room).", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cjust ok\u201d", "Author": "backfromeurope08", "ReviewID": "UR20764557", "Content": "overall not bad for Rome, but the room and bathroom is very small. the cab ride from the train station was a total rip off. 15 euro for a 5 min ride was a total waste, but it was night time and we didn't want to walk. breakfast selections were decent. the lady who was working at the front was friendly in a way you felt she had to be and almost ripped us off when questioning prices for entrances to some monuments that day (she was trying to sell us a tour package through the hotel). the walk from some of the sites at night is a stretch.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cClean, Friendly, Well Located Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SherryinChicago", "ReviewID": "UR20652747", "Content": "We recently returned to Hotel Italia when we visited Rome in early Sept with my parents and we once again were very happy with this clean, friendly, well located hotel.

The hair dryer worked but needed maintenance because it didn't stay put in its base. Also the shower leaked and got the floor wet but it wasn't a big deal. The breakfast selection was also typical Italian fare--yogurt, cereal, canned fruit, brioche, bread and nutella. The great thing was they served you beverages as if you were in a bar/cafe, so you could order freshly made cappuccino, hot chocolate, espresso, tea, etc. The room rate was extremely reasonable at Christmas. I believe it was about 90 EUR per night. Front desk staff was courteous and helpful. I saw in other reviews that the hotel building smelled when it rained. We did not experience this when it rained while we were there. Overall, this is a good hotel to stay at if you are passing through for a few days. It's certainly not spectacular but it is fine for travelers on a budget that would like nice, clean accommodations and free breakfast.

Room so small that we had to stack suitcases. Really could use a dresser -no towelbar so no place to hang wet towels. -Breakfast is skimpy.

There are plenty of eating places all around and an exceptional bakery just across the street. Just a tip, do NOT stay at the annexe building, (Italia 2) they call it. Getting in is a problem as its attached to another apartment building and you have to ring another hotel's buzzer to let you in unless the hotel provides you with a key. The other hotel doesn't like it. Also note, you have to pay 10 cents to use the elavator everytime in the annexe building and the hotel rooms are on the third floor. The rooms in the annexe are also smaller in my opinion. Have to mention that all the staff except the Manager are very nice and helpful, special mention to Gabriel, Nadine, Sabrina.

It was a big room with a wardobe and dresser, the bathroom was lovely and clean with a shower and fresh towels and a hairdryer. and just outside our room was an ice machine, not bad!! breakfast was served from 7am so if you want to eat early get there on the dot as there were about 7 tables and all filled really quickly. A lovely lady gets your tea or coffee and you help yourself to croissants, pastries, dried toast, cornflakes, fruit salad or yoghurt and juice. For what we paid thought this was fine. The hotel is near all the sights, trevi, spanish steps, forum, colleseum and the vatican is a bit further afield. We went for 4 days and visited most things and we always walked so take sensible shoes as the cobbles really make your feet ache. The colleseum has a joint ticket with the palintino but get to the colleseum early as it gets pretty busy. Try and buy all your food bits from the shop rather than the sellers as it costs a bomb. Watch out for the sales men selling anything from roses to umbrellas depending on the weather. Loads of restaurants, brushetta about 4 euros 1st course pasta approx 7 euro. Use the loos when you see them as there arent many!! also take an empty water bottle as there are plenty of fountains to fill them up.

It is not the easiest hotel to find, tucked away on Via Venezia, just off the Via Nazionale, so our first visit was via a taxi ride from the Termini. The hotel is on the second floor of the building, so entrance is via a communal front door. The first time we stayed our room was very small and had no natural light. It was also extremely noisy during the nights because it was situated next to the communal toilet / shower room which was in constant use all night. However during our second visit we were extremely pleased to find that our room was far bigger with a large double bed, two windows and air conditioning. The rooms / bathrooms are basic, but very clean. The staff are extremely helpful and the breakfast is a tasty continental selection.
