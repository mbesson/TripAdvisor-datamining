Room was comfortable and adequate for our needs. Hotel staff friendly and helpful with typical tourist information. Nigel in particular was informative and courteous and being an Englishman, communication was not an issue. Breakfast was adequate, cheese, cold ham, eggs,cereal, fake o/j, a variety of breads etc, coffee was good. The hotel has a bar where 3 euros will but you a tasty German beer. The hotel is situated in a pleasant area called Wilmersdorf, in the west of the city. An underground station is just outside the hotel and can take you to the central Charlottesburg station where you can travel anywhere in Berlin, cheaply and quickly. It is also in walking distance to the Kurfurstendam main shopping avenue, also with regular buses.

After researching, I booked this hotel on the basis of the TripAdvisor reviews believing that between those and the pictures on both TripAdvisor and the travel agency website we would be ok staying here. We thought we would be staying at a hotel that was a basic pension style hotel - clean and simple, but customer friendly. The proximity to the metro eventually sold us on the hotel and we made a booking. What a mistake! On arrival our first misgivings set in when we were greeted with what seemed like a Fawlty Towers sketch from the receptionist, except he wasn't joking and it wasn't a sketch! He seemed incredibly eager to return to the computer in the backroom behind the reception to whatever he may have been doing and after a rudimentary explanation of the breakfast and where our room was he left us to it. The overwhelming impression was that we were wasting his time. We had a room on the fourth floor. Other than having a bleak, bare and miserable aspect, our room was dirty, the lights didn't work, the tap in the bathroom didn't work, there were wires hanging from the ceiling light fitting, the cupboard was broken (shelves laying in the bottom of the cupboard) the bath was dirty and the laminate flooring was peeling. The taps hadn't been run for a very long time and the water when it finally exited the tap was deep brown and full of muck. To say that the room had an Eastern Bloc ambiance about it would be complimentary. The breakfast was very disappointing. I hadn't known it was possible to completely mess up a breakfast until I stayed here. Curled up frankfurters, weak warm coffee, dried out cold bread, sad looking fruit, the whole works! The lady serving the breakfast was also incredibly unhelpful. This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, including in the Third World and my boyfriend rates it as his personal worst, including from his extensive experience of hostels all over Europe and in Eastern Europe. We checked out after one night and moved elsewhere, abandoning the extra nights we had paid for. A 88 euros per night I didn't think this was a cheap hotel and especially not for what we got. This is not a hotel, it is a low grade hostel. The nightly rate should be about 10 euros a night. Do yourself a favour and DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL!", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cwow, a gem for the price\u201d", "Author": "shilo-ann", "ReviewID": "UR108781813", "Content": "We arrived not expecting much (given the price) but were pleasantly surprised.
