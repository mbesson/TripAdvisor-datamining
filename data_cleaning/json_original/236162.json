The new electric heater with a fan over the door was an improvement over the old hot water radiator and an electric kettle, cups, saucers plus tea bags and instant coffee were a welcome addition.

We spent about 10 days in Rome and walked almost everywhere from the hotel. The Gianicolo, a hill with statues of Garibaldi, his wife and followers, was very close by and was the start of a walk to St. Peter's Square. The botanical garden, more interesting in spring than in fall, was also nearby, as well as the Villa Farnesina and Palazzo Corsini Gallery. We walked to most of our other destinations and took public transportation the rest of the time. We bought food at the Billa supermarket (at the location of the Standa) which was well within walking distance.

We're shocked when we saw the room. It was about 12 by 8 feet, little bigger than my bathroom in New Jersey. Once enterd, no room to walk around. The bathroom was the Tiniest one you can imagine and not seen before. The bathroom had no door but had a curtain. My 170 lbs body couldn't fit in for a shower. Due to the fear of smell, we tried to use the toilet down the hallway, which was always occupied, you know why. There was a very old 12 inch TV with a broken remote control. Don't give up, keep pressing the remote control buttons and evantually you'll be switched another Italian channel. There was no English channel, in case you want to check the weather report. The paint was coming off the wall and there was an odor in the room. The bed was damp and very hard. My advise is do not jump into bed at Carmel. They could probably replcae the mattress with a couple of nights pay but didn't. What a shame. The place is on the second floor of an old building by a busy street, so it was very noisy round the clock, we had to buy ear cap in order to sleep. It's no where near any attraction; the closest one is 25 minutes away. The door closes at 8:00 PM, therefore, never forget the key or you'll be sleeping on the street. Checkout time is 11:00 AM sharp. The breakfast was a joke. You get two toasts, water and tea or coffee, which can't cost you more than two bucks in Rome. After the first day we never bothered to go back for the breakfast. It's about 20 minutes away from Trastevere restaurant and bar zone. The lady at the desk at the time of arrival was very cold, she only seemed to be interested to get the full payment ASAP. Marcelo was the only guy who seemed to be nice. Stay way from paying 100 Euro for such a nasty palce. There's no way such a room can be worth of 100 Euro.", "Date": "January 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful terrace garden\u201d", "Author": "Septemberhoneymooner", "ReviewID": "UR3998834", "Content": "Hotel Carmel was the first of five hotels that we stayed in whilst on our honeymoon in Italy. It was the least expensive pensione of our trip and exceeded our expectations. The map in Rome's Lonely Planet led us to believe that it was further out of Trestavere that it actually is - less than a two minute walk to the cafe filled streets and a pleasant walk over the bridge to the centre of Rome and all of the sights. We requested the room that opens onto the pretty terrace garden. The room was huge with sound proof glass on the windows which ensured a good nights sleep.

They have small refrigerators in each room but in one room it was not working. It's a good location, able to walk to major attractions. The breakfast in the cafe next door is wonderful and the people there were very friendly. I was a little disappointed with the hotel staff. Some of the staff in the hotel did not know the local area and didn't try to be very helpful. The nearby restaurants and squares are lively into the evening which was fun. Always felt safe walking around the area and even though we were on the street side, the windows were insulated so the noise did not keep us awake.
