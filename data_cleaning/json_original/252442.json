This is an excellent hotel for families, not so good for couples or mature people seeking a restful and relaxed stay.The problems: ELEVATORS... hotel has two elevators which were not upgraded when the property was converted to a Spring Hill Hotel. They are SLOW and this is a seven floor building. If you are on the upper floors....good luck! Families get on the elevators going up to get a spot so when the elevator arrives at the top, it is full. Horrible way to start the morning. BREAKFAST...a ZOO! Since there are so many families, this creates a shortage of tables and jams up the breakfast lines. Not a good experience! ENTRANCE: There is no way to get from the front parking lot to the hotel entrance without walking between parked cars...the parking space in front of the fountain should be \"off limits\" for parking to provide a walkway to the hotel. At 11:30PM we entered the hotel, forced to walk by the fountain and was showered by the sprinkler. Why have the sprinkler on at that time at the only entrance to the hotel.

The property itself is ok, we had a room with a couch, two dbl beds, a small kitchen, and one bathroom. It was relatively clean, and the breakfast was hot and included. It was recommended to us by our travel agent. Our troubles began the moment we tried to catch the complimentary shuttle to the hotel. We got off our flight around 8:00pm, trucked to the right place with our luggage, and watched as every other hotel chain in history had their shuttles flying by for an hour. We finally called the front desk to inquire about the shuttle and to ask them to let the driver know we were waiting. The person who answered the phone said that the shuttle comes every 30 minutes and that it was an all white 15 pac van. They did not call the driver. Frustrated we hung up and waited for another 30 minutes. When the shuttle arrived and we tried to get on, it was too full. The driver said he would be back in 30 minutes. At this time we had waited almost two hours and grabbed a cab. I was upset when we hit the hotel, and in their favour they did reimburse the cab ride but made no other offers. Checkout the next morning ran smoothly. When we arrived back after our cruise we wanted to go to South Beach and inquired at the front desk on the best way and least expensive way to get there. They suggested city transit and sent us wandering around the streets looking for the bus stop. No map or bus listing was offered. We finally stopped at the hyatt whose shuttle drive graciously offered to take us to the airport where we could catch a direct bus for $5. He then provided a list of buses, maps, and times, as well as his card to call when we were ready to go home and we weren't even staying at the hotel! When we arrived back at Miami Springhill suites we all wanted to show (8 adults sharing two adjoining rooms), and as we tried this the water would stop flowing in one shower for 5 minutes, flow in the other, and then back to the original one. Only one shower could work at a time. Upon calling the front desk they explained their plumber was unavailable and they would send someone up. No attention was given to the matter before we checked out. The next morning we needed the 5am shuttle for a 7am flight, and it was over capacity. Rather than making alternative arrangements, the hotel said he would be back in 30 minutes. Luckily we got on, but some didn't.

I do have to say though that breakfast issues are not always entirely to blame on the hotel, as some guests are stacking up huge amounts of food and either don't eat all of it or take it to their rooms. Also, young kids were experimenting with the waffles, so you were just standing there waiting until their games were over. The Springhill Suites chain typically offers a very good price on their nicely decorated and equipped rooms, so they have to save on something.........and that is the breakfast!

While he was placed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, my wife and I joined our daughter and her husband. The hospital recommended checking into Springhill Suites, where we ended up staying for 8 days. We were assigned two suites, one for each couple. The staff were superb -- kind, considerate (they knew the circumstances that brought us), responsive, thoughtful and effective. Each day the front desk staff asked after our grandson. Not knowing Miami, we had plenty of questions every day; these were answered comprehensively and helpfully. We were delighted with the complimentary breakfast. The accommodation was clean, spacious, comfortable and well appointed. As a place to base yourself for a visit to Miami, I emphatically recommend Springhill Suites. They are conveniently close to the airport, not far from downtown, provide what seemed very adequate parking (we had no vehicle but saw a reasonable number of unused spaces at all times) and can summon taxis from a nearby cabrank rapidly. You need to know that there is no restaurant, so you need to cater for lunch and dinner either by eating out or using the microwave oven in each suite. There is also no bar. However a shopping mall is located conveniently within half a mile of the suites and we made use of local takeaway services a couple of times. (The front desk has a list of recommended food providers.) Leila and Armando are but two of the names of staff I noted but frankly it is unfair to single out individuals -- all the staff who dealt with us (Reception, cleaner, breakfast attendants and management) were people Marriott can be very proud of.

I was tired, weery, and upset. I was staying at the Hilton Homewood sutes when I discovered bed bugs and was moved to this hotel at that point. My first impression was not as nicely deocorated as I would have liked, but very modern decor none the less. The man at check in Was Alvaro and he was completely welcoming and helpful. He searched for a crib that maintenance could not find anywhere. He was my hero that night when he showed up at my room shortly after check in with a portable playpen. Great, I may get some sleep. Really appreciated his efforts and it meant a lot to me that he didn't give up and found one. Truly great customer service fournd here. The room itself is more like a mini suite. Open concept where bed blocked by half wall, other side of half wall is a trendy couch. across from that was the kitchen/work office station. The kitchen consisted of a wet bar sink, mini fridge and microwave. The entire room was decently clean and decorated in an up to date contemporary style. I checked out the room and found the cleanliness adequate, did wipe down the kitchen area myself as some marks or stains were found on counter and in microwave. Otherwise good. Also, checked bed and couch for bed bugs and none were found. Very pleased about that as left the Hilton Homewood Suites for just that reason. The hotel offers free wifi internet and a business center. They have an onsite ATM machine as well. They have a small mini market that is open at all hours on the other side of the check in desk. They have nice laundry facilities that I took advantage of and were well priced. Cost me $5 total to do 1 load, including washer, dryer, detergent and softener. The machines are in good working order and everything came out clean and dry. The front desk employees were great. Very helpful and friendly. Didn't mind spending time down stairs in the lobby guest area. Also, in this area they provide complimentary coffee and tea. This hotel also offers free breakfast but I never took advantage of it for the two mornings I stayed. My granddaughter was not well and I too was becoming sick. Stayed in room and tried to rest. Had my own groceries for us to eat in room. I bought when I started out at the First hotel I stayed at (Ramada Airport North) that was close to amenities. I did look out at their pool area and it seemed boring with just a rectangular pool with some seating and a fence. Nothing fancy there. I would stay at this hotel pre cruise for one night and post cruise for one night. It is convenient for that and you can book shuttle to sea port for $12 each. Airport shuttle is free. I don't think I could stay longer here unless I were driving. This visit I was not and felt stranded here as there is no where to walk around, other than risking mine and baby's life and running over the freeway release lanes to the side walk on the other side. There were no side walks on this side of the hotel and I would not dare walk down the road. The drivers would never notice you as they drive fast down the exit lanes and there is a hill that would not allow for you to see the car or the car see you until it would be too late. My final opinion would be:I would stay again for a visit before or after cruise but not longer unless I was driving.

Also, of course, the Trip Advisor reviews were fine. I'd rate the hotel at 31/2 stars if I could. It's generally fine, staff helpful, the 'suite like' rooms a decent size, comfortable and everything worked. The free wifi was slow but adequate. What detracts: Well, our room needed a good deep clean. Carpets and sofa upholstery especially. Don't get me wrong, it's superficially clean but it's right on the edge of falling over into 'grotty' with stains on the carpet and so on. Secondly, as others have noted it gets *very* busy at breakfast. On Sunday morning I thought it was just Sunday, but the same was true on Monday and Tuesday. Finding seating is pure luck and it's a bit of a bun fight. Other points: The workout room is pathetic and they only offer king sized beds - there are no Queens although the sofa is a sofa bed. It's also not near anywhere. It's on a business park with nothing in sensible walking distance. As far as I could tell the nearest 'plaza' is about 1 mile away.

I called the hotel and asked them to call the Driver so that he can spin back around - they then told me the shuttle is on request. After 15 mins I called back the hotel and he was back at the hotel. I waited another 15 mins for the shuttle to return. RIDICULOUS! While waiting on the shuttle I was amazed at how often the shuttles for other hotels, some even further away from the airport and some lower budget, would run. On our way out the shuttle was late and we got to the airport and had to rush to catch our flights. Additionally the sign on the shuttle is very low and is on the driver's door making it difficult to spot. We stayed for 5 nights and eat the exact same breakfast every day including the same yogurt flavours (vanilla and blueberry). This was also echoed by the guests staying in the room next to us.

Nice HDTV in room. The hotel lost power for 5 minutes in the evening, and that was scary, but all was restored. The airport pickup service is nice but be careful....make sure you establish which hotel it is, and don't rely on the driver to confirm. Their English isn't that good, and as a result, I was left at the airport because of confusion over which SpringHill Suites by Marriott property this was. It was partially my fault (for not matching up the name with the shuttle) but the driver could have been better trained to answer my question. They are very good about providing shuttle service to/from nearby restaurants. The room temperature is challenging to control, although it wasn't terribly uncomfortable. They have in-room, in-wall units that work --- almost too well. The issue was controlling how cool the room became, without shutting off the unit entirely. In the end, I got a good night's sleep, which is all that matters, especially for the price. Breakfast is standard SpringHills suites stuff - substantial, with a large area to dine, and kept clean. Kudos! My only strong beef is that airport shuttle service from the hotel is only once an hour, on the hour. I believe this should either go two times per hour and/or on demand.

I quickly discovered the room had not been adequately cleaned when he found and tried to eat a bunch of pieces of broken plastic that were on the carpet. [Will upload picture.] Obviously, this room had not been vacuumed. Despite this disappointing start, I ended up being pleased with the hotel. We ordered in for a late dinner, and I appreciated that the front desk called to confirm that we had ordered food before sending the deliveryman up. The room had a small refrigerator, microwave, and sink, which I always find handy. The tv was a large wall-mounted flatscreen that could be pulled out and angled toward either the bed or the couch. The bed was comfortable, and despite the proximity to the airport, I did not hear any noise from airplanes. The included breakfast was good: breads, muffins, cereals, a couple of hot items...your usual hotel breakfast fare. It was nice that there was a highchair available, though the safety strap was broken. The breakfast area was very busy, and there was competition for chairs. As soon as my husband and I stood up, two different other groups of people lunged for our chairs! So you may find the breakfast area to be a bit crowded, but that's just due to the sheer number of people who are all getting ready to leave around the same time (for cruises). I'm sure the seating area would be adequate under normal circumstances. The hotel is convenient to the airport, but there's not much else in the immediate area, so don't plan on being able to walk anywhere.

The complimentary hotel shuttle picked us up from the MIA airport mid-afternoon. The driver was extremely courteous and professional. It was only a few minutes ride to the hotel. The hotel seems to have a deal with a shuttle company (Sunshine Shuttle or something like that--the main guy's name is Hector I believe) to take people to the Port of Miami for $10/person. This shuttle does not belong to the hotel. They told me that the earliest they could get us was noon, and we wanted to leave around 10 a.m. to be amongst the first to board. I had spoken with Hector several months earlier and we had agreed on a price of $30 total to take the two of us at 10 a.m. I told this to the woman at check-in, she called Hector, and after a lengthy conversation in Spanish, she informed me that the price was $35 and I'd have to contact him myself. The $5 was not important so much as the principle of a deal is a deal, so I called Hector from my room and he finally agreed to take us for $30. Not a big deal. The room was very nice. It was spacious and the bed was quite comfy. There was a nice couch when you walked in on the right and a kitchen/desk area on the left. Walking further into the room, the bed was on the right and a bathroom and outside vanity area on the left. There was plenty of space for my girlfriend and myself, and it was quite comfortable. We went down to the pool, but were a bit disappointed because (a) there was no hot tub (although I already knew this), (b) the building completely blocked the sun which was on the other side of the hotel, and (c) the water was a little dirty. However, none of this stopped my from jumping right in. Even though we weren't getting much of a tan, it was still nice to relax in the pool and on deck. I did not sleep much due to the overwhelming sense of excitement for our cruise, but that was no fault of the comfy bed. I went for a run in the morning--very nice. The major drawback of staying here is that it is not close to any other attractions, restaurants, etc. If you have a car this is not a big deal. If you are just staying for one night, it is not either. However, I would probably not stay here for more than a night or two--at least when on vacation--because there is not much to do at the hotel itself.

On the way to the hotel omar the driver informed me that he could take me and my husband to eat at an Italian restaurant free of charge which was excellent called (Anacapri by Bellacapri). Omar was able to drop us off and pick us up when we called to be taken back to the hotel which was wonderful. When we arrived at the desk upon check in and the young lady Jessica was very professional. She greeted us with a smile was so friendly answering all our questions about miami and the hotel like a pro!! Jessica is a great addition to the staff there at the Springhill Suites and i believe she should be rewarded for her generosity with the guests and not to mention she has amazing hospitality skills as well. I would hope management takes the time to read this and realize what great staff they have working for them.

I left miami feeling pleased with the decision I made for hotel accomodations and will never forget the level of service Jessica provided. Certainly the best stay and service ever!

We used this hotel to stay ahead of our cruise which was the next day - they had a rate that included transportation to the cruise terminal and included breakfast which was attractive to us. The shuttle driver \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Omar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was great and picked us up at the airport promptly. In addition, he was able to shuttle us both ways to a local restaurant for the evening (the hotel has no capacity of lunch and dinner dining). There really is nothing in walking distance of this hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everything is a short shuttle ride. The staffs at the front desk were very accommodating and courteous. The rooms were very clean and the beds very comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rooms were available upon arrival. For all of the above reasons, I will give this a favorable review. Areas of concern or needs improvement: There was a local \u00e2\u20ac\u0153music festival\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd going on during our stay. It appeared that the rooms were packed with maximum occupancy (if not more) and they all showed up for breakfast at the same time in the morning (around the 9:00 AM hour). The lines for the breakfast were longer than I would have liked and it put pressure on the staff to put out a sub-standard self-serve breakfast. In fact, the eggs were COLD. No worry though as there was plenty of other items to eat. In addition, the pool area had some garbage that could have been thrown out (although the water and pool were fine) and when I went into the workout facility someone had left their plate of chicken bones on one of the chairs. I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the hotel for this, as I think there were a bunch of slobs attending this music festival who just were to lazy to clean up after themselves. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the Ritz, and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the staff there to do hourly clean up of these areas, so my headline comment is you get what you pay for here.

My party booked three rooms, and all complained of \"stuffy\" rooms and HVAC systems that simply did not work properly.
