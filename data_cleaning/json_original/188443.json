The biggest attraction was the price. We were pleased with the great rates and the free parking (our entire stay with 4 adults was just over $100.00)! The rooms are plain, this is not a luxury hotel, but for our purpose(we were only in the room to sleep) it was a great deal. It was clean and there was a restaurant on site - The Swiss Pick. We enjoyed a fine breakfast there and one late night dinner. The food was good and reasonably priced; service was also fine; it was not at all busy when we were there dining.

The wireless did not work and even speaking with their help line and the desk clerk coming to our room and fiddling with some wires, it still didn't work. We ended up \"stealing\" a signal from somewhere local that was unsecured. I flushed the toilet and we left for dinner. When we returned, the toilet was still running. Dinner - oh my. Well, it appeared that the Swiss Pick Restaurant attached to the hotel really wasn't too interested in having any patrons. The waitress was more concerned about setting up the tables for the New Year's Eve function the next night. She asked us if we wanted to eat or just drink. If we wanted a drink, then we could sit at the bar. I said I thought I'd like some dinner and she begrudgingly led us to a table set up for diners. When we gave our order for a draft beer and a bowl of soup for my husband and a draft beer and a salad for me, her response was, \"Is that ALL?\" The voice inflection was all important. I had initially wanted a bowl of French onion soup, but the chef didn't have that. I could hear him say that he was too busy making Goulash soup for the next night's big function. The Caesar was delicious, though, I must admit. When we finally gave up on trying to get the wireless internet to work, we tried to watch TV. The TV remote didn't work. We were so tired and frustrated from a LONG day of travel that we just gave up and went to bed around 8:30. The remote probably needs new batteries, but why should we have to tell them this? Where was the room maintenance and upkeep person? Now about the heat - it was either oven hot set on LOW, or cold when we turned it off. There was no comfortable setting. It seemed to be an older style wall unit type of heater. When we were checking out, the desk clerk made the mistake of asking if everything had been all right. I answered NO. Now here comes a positive remark about this hotel. She gave me 20% off the stay. Also, another positive comment I can make is that our car was not damaged after being parked in this hotel's lot for a week. Other than that, I can't think of too much positive to say about this hotel. We won't stay here again. There are so many other places in Toronto close to the airport with shuttles to the airport for us to choose from. I would say that this hotel needs some maintenance. The room overall looked old and shabby. We did save about $100 over two nights and parking our car. I guess that's a positive as well, but I still wouldn't stay here to save $50/night.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSurprised - In a Good Way\u201d", "Author": "MuskokaTraveller32", "ReviewID": "UR120763332", "Content": "Hotel Service was great, room was very comfortable and suit us just fine.

The room was pretty tiny, the bed was small and felt shifty, the blankets had lots of rips, tears, and cigarette burns in them (classy). The pillows were awful balls of fluff. The TV didn't get very many channels. The hotel itself feels a little isolated. To use the internet you have to call down to the front desk to get a code.

We were going to a concert at Molson Ampitheatre and found this hotel to be reasonably close (about 12 miles) and cheap. We used a \"Friends & Family\" discount for Choice Hotels and got a rate of $55 per night. The hotel is less than a mile from Woodbine Racetrack (horse racing). We tried that out. It was my first experience going to the races. It was fun. Parking and entry are free. They also have slots downstairs. The Toronto Airport was about 5 miles away. You could see and hear the planes constantly. There's also a Burger King, Mc Donald's, and Harveys close by. Here are the pros and cons of this hotel: Pros: Price. Nice friendly desk staff. The room was clean and the cleaning staff did service the room again on day two which was nice. She made the bed, emptied the garbage, cleaned the bathroom, changed towels, and even offered to vacuum but we told her that was ok. The bed was a queen instead of the usual king bed but it was very comfortable. There were a lot of channels to choose from and reception was great for all of them. There were also alot of pay per view movies to choose from (12.99 - 14.99). Cons: The hotel interior is dated. The elevator was dirty (both floor and vents in ceiling). No big deal for us though. We only cared that it worked efficiently, which it did. The air conditioner in the room was very loud but worked great. The bathroom fan scared me when my husband turned it on. It was soooo loud. We couldn't leave it on because you couldn't hear the tv. The free Wireless Internet was hit and miss. Sometimes I could get right on and then other times it was impossible to get on. The pool was very small and weird shaped. The deep end was only 4 or 5 ft wide. The hot tub was fine. There was only one table with 4 chairs in the entire pool area. So if there were any more than 4 people down there at one time, you wouldn't have a place to sit. Also I did notice some mold on the pool deck. Kind of nasty. Overall it was okay. I've seen worse.
