We ask for an upgrade and they took us to a beach-front bedroom. The first one, the sliding glass door lock was broken. Then we got a third room. It was nice but the sheets were old and not fitted, as you move they came out. And NOOOO HOTTT WATER!!!!!!! at all. And the towels felt like sand paper. No coffe maker on the bedroom and we have to make our own coffe at the lobby . They don't even have coffe. La primera habitacion que nos dieron no tenia suficiente luz natural, parecia una cueva. Solicitamos algo mejor y nos dieron una habitacion frente al mar pero la puerta de cristal no cerraba el seguro estaba roto. La tercera habitacion que nos dieron estaba bastante bien pero las sabanas no ajustaban y se salian segun te movias. Si quieres una cama bien dura ese es el lugar para conseguirla. No habia NAAADDDAAA DE AGUA CALIENTE. nos dijeron que dejaramos el agua correr pero tampoco salio caliente. Las toallas parecian lija eran bien duras. No tiene cafetera en las habitaciones y tuve que hacer mi propio cafe en el lobby ya que ni tan siquiera tenian cafe.

The room was not inviting at all. In our 2nd day there we were resting and an employee knocked on our door asking us to remove our car from its parking place (we had parked on the spot with our room # on it) because his boss wanted to park her car there. My husband went to the front desk and inquired and went back to try to rest. Two hours later they knocked very hard again on our room door and told us to move our car.

I definitely would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve looked for another place had I taken the time to check this review site before making my reservation. Basically, all negative comments that are being said on here by other guests are accurate to the very last detail. The one guy that gave very positive reviews must\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been paid by the hotel to do so. The most mentioned negative comment I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen on here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hard mattresses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is very true. We first checked into one room but the hotel attendant offered us another room because we were having problems with a weak Internet connection, which only works in the front lobby and in the one room closest to the lobby. That first room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c close to the pool - had a king bed but it only had the hard box-spring over a wooden frame. The bed lacked the much softer mattress that goes on top needed for a pleasant night of sleep. The mattress also had dirty sheets and sperm-stained blankets, and it still had hair from the previous guests as if the sheets hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been replaced before our arrival. So we took the offer from the attendant and moved to the other room hoping not only for a better Internet signal but also for a smoother, cleaner bed. Well, I guess we were hoping for way too much. The bed was also filthy and stained; and the mattress was harder than concrete. A third room with two smaller beds that the attendant showed us was no different. That one even had roaches scrambling around over the beds. We had already paid for three days and two nights and the check-in agreement stipulates there is no refund for early departures so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like we had too many options other than stay put and make the best of it. The hotel attendant that night was very cordial (not her fault) and tried her best to help us but we cannot say the same about the raunchy-looking hotel owner. We saw him only a couple of times during our stay there but just judging by the rancid look in his face it is wiser to just stay away from there in the future. I hate having to come online to write this negative review but it absolute annoys me when I get fooled by deceiving advertising and false expectations. The Joyuda Beach Hotel is not worth a night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not even for $60 bucks a night. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be better off staying at a cheap motel. At least you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a microwave! Also, it is true what others say on this board. The pool is very tiny - like for a couple at a time - and it is only 5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deep. It was full of leaves and a disgusting bubbling foam as if it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned in a long time; and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have lighting in the water for use at night so it was pitch black the night we arrived. The beach was very small and shared with guests from an old-looking apartment condo next door. The beach sand was also filled with rocks all over so you can only take a few steps into the water bare feet. No ice machine available, though. An old dirty red cooler with more water than ice was available. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get caught bringing in your own beer from outside or a cooler because it is in the rules \u00e2\u20ac\u201c btw, rules that you only learn after you pay - that you will get slapped with a $250 fine if you dare. And if you ask for an additional towel you will get another $150 fine. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153motel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was about the size of a small paint cabin. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even consider eating there. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how pathetic it looked. One thing that sucked badly and that nobody mentions on this review site is that all room showers literally spray water all over the place except to the body of the person taking the shower. There was a similar problem with the bathroom sink. You have to open the valve very carefully because the water faucet has no meshing to control the flow and to distribute the stream evenly. Open it a little too much or too quickly and you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even need a shower. Stay away from this place, pitch in an extra 20 and find yourself another hotel. I, as a local Puerto Rican, DO NOT recommend this rat-stinking-hole to no tourists from abroad.", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cGood vacation for price paid\u201d", "Author": "Maryracing", "ReviewID": "UR37427625", "Content": "I read the other reviews after reserving my stay of 3 days 2 nights, and was very worried.
