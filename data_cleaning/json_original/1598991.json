This Apartment was right opposite the best food markets in this whole world, it was spotless, had a great view over the florist shops of La Rambla, and was close to absolutely everything. Really can't say much more - everything was there for us, and more reasonable in price than staying in hotels (I think) - my only negative - change that hairdryer - otherwise everything was absolutely perfect. Highly recommend it, and if were to get back to Barcelona - a most incredibly beautiful city, we would ask for this apartment again. Thanks Aspasios - it was great.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia, United States", "Title": "\u201cThis property nearly ruined our stay in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "rstrubin", "ReviewID": "UR128437861", "Content": "My friends and I were so excited to rent an apartment in Barcelona for the 6 nights we were there. We made arrangements with the company about what time we would be arriving at the apartment and when they should meet us with the key. They were over an hour late, leaving 3 obviously foreign girls on a street corner with tons of luggage. We kept calling our contact, to no avail. The person who finally showed up informed us that our original contact had gotten too drunk watching football. We were annoyed but ok. Then comes the fun part. Our apartment (though listed as a 4th floor unit) was technically on the 6th. There was an elevator, that held one person at a time. Getting all of our things to the 6th floor was arduous to say the least. Once we got into the apartment, it looked old, nothing like the pictures on the internet. The man who let us in was very disorganized. We had to ask many questions (internet password, how to check out, etc). About an hour after getting settled the power went out and we could not see anything. We called the landlord who asked if it was okay if they came in the morning to check it out.... unacceptable. She eventually ended up coming (an hour later) and called the power company and had the power back on in 2 hours. While we appreciated that, she seemed annoyed and very put out to have to help us. The next day we were determined to start fresh and enjoy the city. Except the elevators didn't work at all. Going down was no big deal.... but up 6 flights of steep stairs, with groceries and souvenirs got old. Every time we wanted to come and go, we had to deal with this. The shower head floods the bathroom.We found a work around, but it meant standing in the corner hovering under the faucet which we had to place against the wall. I would in no way stay here again.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cCentral location, very good rental apartment\u201d", "Author": "AlexSiqueira", "ReviewID": "UR125045141", "Content": "Tripadvisor classification of Apartments Aspasios is not adequate: in reality, it is not a hotel, but various rental apartments in different locations (services like bedroom cleaning, towels substitution etc, are not provided). My review refers to the Girona Design 1B apartment, where I stayed with my family (I, my wife, and 2 daughters - 1 adult and 1 children) from Jan 29th to Feb 2nd, 2012. It is constituted by 2 bedrooms, a living room with balcony, a kitchen (very well equiped, including also a washing machine) and a bathroom (shower only, no bathtub). Free wi-fi internet is provided, as well as a very useful safe in one bedroom. Location is very central (4 blocks from Plaza Catalunya), with easy walking access to various Barcelona main touristic atractions and to the public transport system. Apartments Aspasios personel was very helpful. I considered the overall experience as very pleasant and I'd certainly stay there again. It is worth to mention that there are accessibility restrictions to this apartment: if you need to use the lift, there are 4 steps from the building hall to the lift and the stair is somewhat tight. To end, I would strongly recommend to have a cell phone for contacts (as mentioned in maris09 review).", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cvery good apartment near the center of the city\u201d", "Author": "attelocin7", "ReviewID": "UR122819038", "Content": "in the room it was everything we needed... the location is good (1km to pl.catalunya) so we visited all the city without any type of transport, but only by walk", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGran Via A by Aspasios\u201d", "Author": "Jim M", "ReviewID": "UR121072601", "Content": "We stayed for seven days in Apt Gran Via A and found our stay wonderful and stress free.The apartment was presented as advertized and was clean and stylish with plenty of space and privacy for a family of four (two parents and two teenagers) The Apartment is located in a genuine Modernisme Building and is centrally located for easy access to all the major sites in Barcelona and was a real treat to stay in !!

The weekly cleaning service was nice but mediocre and should be treated as a perk rather than a decision factor.

FACILITIES:Perfect. - kettle, big fridge, electric stove, microwave, coffee maker - high speed internet - high tech washing machine, dryer. These are shared facilities in an easily accessible room. During our stay, not once did we had to wait for our turn, these machines were always available. CLEANLINESS:Immaculately clean. Judging by the spartan condition of the bed, cutlery, etc it seemed like they were just bought a day before we checked-in. They all looked new. QUIETNESS: The apartment is in a major street (Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes) but given that its on the 4th floor and the good quality windows, it was a peaceful apartment. SERVICE: Very professional. When we checked-in, a staff from the company Aspasios was there with all the paperwork, she explained everything thoroughly and clearly.

Not great options. We took the first. The only compensation they gave us was to transfer our bags to the second apartment on day 2. This messed up our stay in Barcelona - I would have expected a bit more for this mix up..Lycke who looked after us was very nice, but still we had to break up our day, move apartments etc - and we booked so long ago..surely double booking should not happen and I can only imagine they would do this if there was more money in it for them.
