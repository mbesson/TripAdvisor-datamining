All rooms are noisy (although worse if you face the freeway), so if you wanted to \"save\" time staying at this location, be sure you will not sleep comfortably. You are much better off having a good night sleep in any downtown hotel that adds only 10 mins of extra cab time to the airport (you will drive in the opposite direction of morning traffic!!), or at pricier Camino Real or NH right at the airport. The free shuttle adds only marginal value: it leaves ONLY once every hour and they INSIST you check in with their service 10 mins beforehand, leaving the hotel invariably 5 mins late for a 10 min ride, so it is not really time-saving (if you are downtown, an early-morning taxi ride will not take more than 15-20 mins vs the 25 min free ride of holiday inn).", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Maria Tonantzintla, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel close to airport\u201d", "Author": "txtootsie", "ReviewID": "UR122685653", "Content": "This is a great hotel, new and clean.

The hotel is clean and the rooms are very comfortable. I appreciated having a restaurant in the hotel. My \"european sandwich\" wasn't very good but the buffet looked nice. The return shuttle to the airport was very convenient and easy. I would stay here again just for the airport shuttle. Catching a cab from the DF airport can involve huge lines depending on when you fly in.

I have stayed at several hotels in Mexico. They have always been clean (I rely heavily on Tripadvisor ratings to ensure I am staying at a decent place)...but they are not typically anything to write home about. My flight into MEX was delayed, and thus I missed my connecting flight to Veracruz. It was late, I didn't have an internet connection, and I was at the mercy of the hotels that have small storefronts in Terminal 2 of the airport. It was so late that only two hotel desks were open. I picked the Holiday Inn and I ended up being very happy with the entire experience. Upon agreeing that I'd stay with them, a gentleman carried my bags out to the hotel shuttle. I was whisked to the hotel location, checked in quickly (friendly English speaking staff), and taken to my room. The hotel was beautiful (built on an Embassy Suite concept of an open atrium area that all rooms open to). My room was very modern, fresh smelling, and clean. The bed was comfortable, bottled water was supplied (at no additional cost, unlike USA hotels), the shower was powerful and hot, and the air conditioner kept the room very comfortable. Because I was simply grabbing a place to stay and my next flight was early the next morning, I didn't get to experience any other aspects of the hotel.
