They have a very chic & modern comfortable beds, I like the balcony - you can open it and look out onto the street and people watch. They have complimentary continental breakfast with cereals, breads etc. They have a funky shower with different coloured lighting, only has a curtain to the door from the shower to bedroom (where a wall should be) so if you're not comfortable with the person you're staying with and maybe peeking through the curtain, maybe get seperate rooms. The room is big and open, the tv has hepas of channels, only 1 in English. We had a terrace on our floor level with only 2 other rooms. Wifi access - which was strong the whole time. They have a laptop you can use downstairs and air con, but be careful because it turns off after a certain time so you can wake in the middle of the night to a hot room. As I said our floor level only had 2 other rooms, we could the room next to us get busy at midnight doing their thing, woke us up and the bed was moving, it virtually sounded like someone was moving house. We had a terrace on the floor that was not used by anyone we saw, we were there for four days and decided to wash our socks (we've been travelling for 4 weeks up till then) we washed 6 pairs of socks and put them behind the lounge chair on the terrace, absolutely no one would have seen them. Of course in the morning we woke to find our socks were gone, we asked the cleaners where they were and they said they were down with management. Well the manager then began to explain that the hotel wasn't a hostel and that you can't leave clothes out in the open. I'm sorry but these were socks, not undergarments or clothes or shoes, and no one, even if you wanted to use the lounge chair would have seen them. We put them there at night time & went to pick them up in the morning! Okay, what would you have us do, put them in the room to drip all over cables? He said they have a dryer and next time ask to use that instead of putting them outside. Again, because this is a no frills hotel, they have no information anywhere about the hotel or the \"free use\" of the dryer.

Excellent!\u201d", "Author": "Chris G", "ReviewID": "UR122786355", "Content": "My friend and I booked this hotel for a two night stay in order to see Madrid in our travels while in Spain. We stayed Jan 7-9, 2012, during the down season, so there were many hotels available to choose from. After reading Trip Advisor, I am sure glad we chose this hotel. First, upon check in, William was fantastic. We were early, he stored our bags, and then gave us DETAILED information on a map of what to see first, where to eat certain types of food, and what to do in the next two days. He was excellent. Throughout the stay when we would ask questions, the front desk was more than happy to help. Next, with a 55 euro hotel called \"Chic and Basic\" I sort of expected IKEA and lack-luster. While we were right about the extensive IKEA appointments, the linens were clean and comfortable, the water was hot and fast, and the room was exactly like the pictures portrayed (even the disco shower!). Finally, the location is everything that other travelers have mentioned. While Madrid seems to be a walking town, we were within seconds of the metro stop that brought us from the AVE high speed train (THIS IS A BIG, HUGE, PLUS for railway AVE passengers!!!). In addition, we were in 10 minutes walking from shopping, bars, and cultural sights. Definitely worth the price of paying for a cab from a further hotel. There is a \"help yourself\" area with simple teas, coffees, waters, and small eats (continental breakfast by some American standards). This was excellent upon returning from being out all day, or for a kick-off in the morning before venturing out. The hotel only seems to have about 20 or so rooms, so this area was NEVER over-ridden with other guests, and usually quite empty. Finally, the hotel has Wi-Fi which seems to be hit and miss on speeds at certain times, but I was able to use my iPhone at times when the computer and the Wi-Fi didn't seem to get along. Hopefully the hotel maintains the property for the next guests. I highly recommend this for a simple two night stay with a friend or partner. Great job William--color coated our map, fun to chat with, and helped us with places to avoid (tourist traps), and helped us with other Spanish areas.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cI recommend\u201d", "Author": "dianamorais", "ReviewID": "UR120129982", "Content": "Excellent location.

When we first opened the door to our room my heart sank at the cold austerity: a black vinyl floor, beds and a hard white plastic chair. Not exactly inviting and cozy.

We had just had a long train journey and wanted a cup of coffee...the downstairs free snack area was just perfect and we enjoyed real espresso, fruit and yoghurt in a little outdoor courtyard. Then we wanted a shower...the best shower I have had in a long time. The water pressure was massive, and the changing colour of the lights inside the shower was strangely relaxing. To finish off there was a real hairdryer (not one of those wall mounted ones that only waft tepid air). After dinner in the lovely neighbourhood we snuggled into our very comfortable duvet covered beds and were able to read with the really bright fibreoptic bedside lights. The next morning the free breakfast downstairs was extensive with toast, cheese, ham, fruit and pastries. By the end of our stay we had forgotten the initial chilly impression. It really did anticipate and meet all of the essential needs of a traveller. Probably better for a short stay than a long one. The lack of homey ambience would get to one after a while.

I chose it based in its location, price and I cannot lie that breakfast is a very important feature for me. Chic and Basic Mayerling was my choice because it had it all and free internet too! I made my reservation by the internet and have no problem concerning it. I followed the hotel tip to go from Barajas aiport to the hotel via metro. A trip costs two euros and involves three stations...no big deal if you arrive at a decent time of the day, I guess. The only thing is that if you have a lot or heavy luggages I wouldn't recomend it as there are obstacles (along the way you will find stairs and you will have to carry your luggage!). The trip to the station Tirso de Molina from the airport took me around fifty minutes and was easy. When you arrive at this station you won't be far from the hotel...easy, very easy. I am not really good with distances, but you won't take more then five minutes to reach the hotel. The station is in front of the Calle Conde de Romanones! The staff at the hotel couldn't be more attentive and nice. Althought the hotel does not make reservations for you (for excursions or tours) they will assist you to find out what and how to do it. The help yourself area is a plus. There at breakfast time you can find: yogurt, water, juice, fruits, milk, a machine with coffe, coffe and milk and cappucino, croissants and cupcakes, jam, butter, cheese and ham. More than enough for you to start a new day. At other times of the day you will find water, yogurt, coffe. Very nice. The room I stayed in was nice (large twin), well mantained and chic. There are separated areas for the toilet bowl, sink and shower....and what a shower! Very powerful! I found it spacious.

But then we had the last available room in the place, so probably not representative of what the best rooms are like. A key thing to know is that the shower is separated from the bedroom only by its clear glass wall. So this would not be a great feature if you are traveling with someone and want to maintain some mystery/modesty. that said, the shower itself was a good one, with nice pressure and an overhead rain-style. i especially liked the free all-hours access to espresso, juice, fruit, etc downstairs in the common area. and the location was great, easy walking distance to La Latina and elsewhere, but on a street that didn't feel touristy. This place was a great value, and I would recommend it, especially for younger (<35 or so) travelers. it seems aimed to a post-hostel, pre-grand-hotel type of crowd and definitely has enough good features that I would come back. Though next time would book earlier so I wouldn't be left with the last room in the place.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "buenos aires", "Title": "\u201cgreat value and service\u201d", "Author": "birdyba", "ReviewID": "UR62268072", "Content": "I stayed for a couple of nights at the Mayerling C&B. Great value for money! The hotel is small but nicely decorated and very well located. Tow blocks from Sol, three from Plaza Mayor, in short great to get anywhere walking or by metro. The rooms are neat, beds very confortable, large window and flatscreen. The bathroom is as other guests pointed out separated from the room by a glass wall. But there is a full size courtain you can draw while the other person is in the bathroom, no problem. There is a 24hour coffee, tea and beverage bar at the lobby where breakfast is also served. Finally, and one of the best things of this hotel, the staff is very friendly and helpful. Gave me great tips and helped me with my travel arragements.

Five minutes to the main plazas, and a metro stop is right down the street. The hotel is new, and well done. As with other chic&basic's, it has a table/seating area in the lobby. This one only serves breakfast from 7 - 11 AM. After that, the food is removed, and only juices, yogurt, coffee and fruit are available 24 hours. Breakfast is croissants, toast, ham & cheese. The staff was friendly and helpful, and spoke English. There is not a computer available for guest use, and I'm not sure about Wi-Fi. Our room was large, with a balcony facing the street. The interior design was very cool. The shower has a clear glass wall facing the room, with a blind you can close for the more modest. You can set the shower lights to change color while you bathe. The large sink had good lighting, and there was ample storage areas. The toilet was in it's own closet. The bed was comfortable, and the room fairly quiet. The hotel seems to be geared to adults.
