First because it is not a hotel. It is an appartment where you share rooms with others. You share even the bathroom and this bathroom does not appears very clean. Even the stuff for the rooms seems not very clean. The staff is very competent (Thank you Raul for your support) but nobody cleaned our rooms during the three nights we were there. Nobody made our beds,.... But the surrondings are perfect. Very near to everything in Rome. You can walk all the time to the main atractions. With good restaurants and cafes around. My positive suggestion: Use this appartment for a whole family (Occupying the three rooms od the whole appartment) or with friends and forget you are in a hotel and forget about the breakfast. If you want breakfast you wil have to use the kitchen and make it yourself. Considering the above, the solution can be very good. And remember you have to pay cash and in advance.

We met Raul, and checked in, and to make a long story short they had bed bugs. We could not sleep even an hour because of the bites and the scratching. We finally went out in the hall at 3 am and noticed a light on in the other room. A young couple from Sweden also had the same problem. We met Raul the next morning and he was very rude and turned very violent. We have never had such a terrible night in the many years we have been visiting Rome. Not only did it ruin the night, we ended up missing the Vatican because we were too tired from the lack of sleep.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Location!!! but not Clean....\u201d", "Author": "Shelleybeth", "ReviewID": "UR115102784", "Content": "Stayed here just 1 nite...The Host was a young man, Raul, Very nice, but, doesn't pay to have anyone clean the place, that is my personal observation....He is sitting on a Gold Mine..From our bedroom windows, you can see the Vatican Walls...Great Location!!!!.Why he doesn't paint the dirty scuff marks, did'nt feel comfortable sleeping in the sheets, there was no lock on the bedroom door (when you are in the room at nite). and since you are sharing the apt and bathroom with strangers, you should be able to lock the bedroom door when you are sleeping. Also, our feet were filty from the scum coating baked on the tiled floor..This is a shame, Pay a housecleaner to come in atleast once a week just to keep place kept up....I am just glad we were there for only 1 night....", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santiago, Chile", "Title": "\u201cNice host, good location but not so well taken cared off\u201d", "Author": "viajerochile21", "ReviewID": "UR107885325", "Content": "The host/manager was incredible we arrived late and couldnt enter(its an apartment with some rooms as hotel) the manager was waiting for us so that was a good start.
