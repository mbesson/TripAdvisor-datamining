We booked Ritz Carlton for a family trip and the service was amazing the second you arrive. The staff greeted us with personal attention, kept us comfortable during the check in process, which was speedy compared to Sands. Rooms were clean and spacious, had a cozy seating area for relaxation at the end of the day. The views from the bathroom tub was amazing. One thing that could be updated is the hairdryer, which was a bit dated. Breakfast selection and staff at the omelet and waffle stations were very professional, food was excellent at the pool area too. Hotel manager Lance was superb and 100% attentive to detail even after we left and discovered some billing error. He responded right away to our inquiry and followed up every detail. Concierge service may need more staffing as our questions regarding Sentosa venues were not addressed correctly.

The breakfast was a slight bit better than most but at $50 SGD it's ridiculous. I hate paying for wi-fi at hotels and at $30 SGD/day that is ridiculous as well.

Package comes with free upgrade to premier suite, breakfast, birthday ammenities and late check out for $495 including taxes. Having stayed at Pan Pacific a few weeks ago at half the price i had high expectations for Ritz given their reputation. They passed the tests with flying colours in terms of their service and the rooms and location but there are still some small areas which can still be improved to make it a perfect stay. LOCATION: Ritz Carlton probably have the best view amongst all the hotels in the marina area. They have unblocked view of the flyer, Sea and the marina bay sands. I stayed on the 27th floor and had a gorgeous view of the marina bay sands from the living room and the flyer from the bathtub. In terms of convenience they are conected to Marina square and Millenia walk, Suntec and a short walk via the underpass to the Cityhall MRT and circle line. This means that u have access to shopping, restaurants and train service connected to the hotel without having to worry about the weather. Full marks for location defintely! RESERVATION/CHECK IN: Booking the room was a breeze from the website. They had options for us to select most of the things that we needed like early checkin, cribs, high floor, king bed and non smoking rooms. There was no queue at the checkin counter and all our requests were taken care of which is great! There's even free flow of drinks at the lobby for guests which shows that Ritz take cares of the little things that makes guest feel at home. ROOM: We had a premier suite for our stay as part of the birthday package. This is definitely the highlight of our stay. The views of the room were gorgeous! We had amazing views of the flyer, Marina bay sands resort and the entire marina bay from our room, bath and the living room. The room were well designed and very clean. We really like the huge bathroom which had seperate shower, WC and bath plus two seperate sinks and even a walk in wardrobe. One thing that i am very impressed is the sound proofing of the rooms. This is probably the only hotel which i've stayed where the rooms were completely noise free! Maybe there's nobody staying beside, on top or below our room but there's definitely no noise. Like i said at the beginning everything about Ritz is probably perfect but there's some small things that can be improved to make it the perfect experience. One of them is the wooden flooring which at some location seems to be slightly damaged. The other is the fact that they do not have a guest information booklet that provides information on the room and how to use it. Most other hotels have such a handbook to guide the guests on how to get connected to the wireless internet, use the motorized blinds, inform them of the menu available for inroom dining etc. While there is a booklet on in room dining and breakfast and a card which instructs the guests on how the nespresso machine works there is nothing which tells me where the controls for the blinds are located and what are the programs that are showing in the tv channels. Apart from the lack of information on the gadgets i would say that the room is awesome. BREAKFAST: We had buffet breakfast at the greenhouse as aprt of the package. There was a short queue to get a seat but the wait was just a minute and we were brought to a table. First impression was that the greenhouse cafe was a little small to cater to all the guests coming for breakfast. We were seated at an area that seems to be somekind of makeshift area to accomodate the large breakfast crowd at the side of the cafe. In terms of spread i would say that the items are reasonable and unique. The greenhouse have the usual staple of eggs, ham, bread porridge, rice fruits, noodles that most normal buffet will have which should suffice most people. Unfortuntaely i'm a picky eater and alot of the stuff that they had just did not suit my tastes. For example i was looking for some noodles/beehoon for breakfast but for some reason they had what we call Sang mee which is fried noodles with sauce that is typically served during dinner. Not much live stations apart from a smoothies bar, egg and some kind of pancake station. They do had some unique items like japanese cold tofu and a variety of muesli bars which the wife liked...so while it did not meet my requirements i'm sure it will meet the standards of others who have different tastes. POOL: One of the activities that my kids enjoys most during a staycation is playing at the pool. We checked out the pool after breakfast and to be honest we were disappointed. It is standard rectangular pool more suited to swimming laps with some sort of jaccuzi at the side for those who wants to soak. If there's one thing that should be upgraded this is it. Clearly not a pool that fits the image of a luxury hotel...the one at Mandarain oriental looks much much better. SERVICE: We did not really tested the service of the staff at Ritz due to the fact that we only stayed for one night. But there were still interactions with the staff which gave us an indication of the kind of service that u can expect. I would say their front line team at the lobby are very well trained and customer oriented. The staff which checked out for me even asked me whether i had transport arranged for my flight...and gave me a complimentary parking coupon when i told him i was a local. Thumbs up for the inititiative. There was a turndown service and the cleaning lady offered us bottles of water and replenished our tea, coffee and towels another sign that the hotel takes cares of its guests' needs. Finally when we were exiting from the carpark leaving for home we had some issues with the complimentary carpark coupon. The hotel staff opened the gantry for us without much questions asked.The only negative thing that i noticed is that the housekeeping lady was not very fluent in English which might make it difficult to communicate with foreigners with special requests. SUMMARY: All in all the experience with Ritz Carlton was a very good one. They position themselves as a luxury hotel and delivered in terms of the quality of their rooms and the service that distinguish them as one of the top hotels in Singapore. The hotel gets top marks for its location, view and service but given the premium that it is charging i would expect everything to be perfect. Improving the breakfast and the pool area would be two items that can help the hotel would a big step forward towards nirvana. A bigger variety for breakfast and maybe a bigger capacity breakfast area would definitely enhance the breakfast experience. For the pool i would suggest some cabanas and a children play area for parents to lounge around under shade while the kids can have something to entertain themselves. Ritz is going to have strong competition in the later part of the year when Pan Pacific completes their major renovation if they do not constantly upgrade themselves based on my experience with the two hotels.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Strasbourg, France", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel with incredible view on the 32th floor\u201d", "Author": "jclinder", "ReviewID": "UR128028310", "Content": "I had not been in a Ritz Carlton for a very long time (probably around 10 years) but this short stay (1 night) will encourage me to add them to my list of selected hotel chains.

Although we were satisfied with the spacious rooms with good views, we were shocked by the poor service, overcrowded-ness and was disappointed overall. We checked-in at 2 pm, only to find about 20-25 people at the reception counter trying to check-in. There was a physical queue and the wait in line was long and unpleasant. The check-in process was long and alot of mistakes were made with our booking details, including the package quoted.. Eg, breakfast was supposed to be included but was not duly noted by the hotel. Fortunately this was rectified. Even after the check-in process, we had to wait till 3.15 pm to receive our room because the room was supposedly still under cleaning ( although check-in time is 2pm ). The hotel did not seem to be able to cope in full capacity. The breakfast at the greenhouse which was priced at $50 per head, was from 6.30-10.30. We were fortunate to get there at 8am in the morning. By 9am, there was a physical queue of 20 people at the restaurant door, waiting to enter as there were insufficient seats. This queue lasted till the end of the breakfast. There was also a queue, albeit shorter one, at the chihuly lounge for breakfast. The next morning, the hotel decided to hold the breakfast at an alternative location. The breakfast was moved to a level 1 area - reception area of the hotel ballroom. The hotel did not even open the ballroom but instead held the breakfast at this stuffy, cramp holding area outside the ballroom, with a buffet line that had much less variety and off poorer quality than the original greenhouse breakfast. The hotel employed temporary staff to wait during the breakfast. The temp staff was unprofessional and service was poor. The staff were idling in groups, chatting and using vulgarities at times, all within hearing distance of guests. They would shout across tables at themselves when trying to get help or giving instructions to one another. The entire breakfast experience was unpleasant to say the least and felt like a very low-budget hotel wedding; a far-cry from the peaceful, weekend getaway that we were hoping to have by paying for a supposedly 5 star hotel. We felt that the hotel should not have moved their breakfast venue to such a poor alternative and with admittedly poorer quality/ more limited variety of food, without first informing the guests or compensating them, especially since they were charging a substantial amount for it. We believe we are not the only guests to feel short-changed by the experience. I would definitely not consider a return visit to the Ritz as it seems their standards in terms of service quality and guest satisfaction have dropped tremendously.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cImpressive Hotel\u201d", "Author": "pamlSydney_Australia", "ReviewID": "UR127719851", "Content": "We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia in Singapore for 3 glorious nights and were completely blown away with the huge windows which overlook the fabulous Marina Bay Sands and all this fabulous complex has to offer.

We were there for the BMW Golf Tournament, and was basically spoiled by BMW in every which way. The Ritz is a beautiful venue and hotel, providing mostly typical Ritz Carlton service and accommodation in a location that give easy access to many areas of Singapore, either by foot, MTR or taxi. Concierge advice and front door service was very good in the times we used them - although getting chauffeured by BMW and their drivers can definitely help! I will criticize a number of miscues or shortfalls in what I see as a hotel that should be worth considering for business or holiday travellers alike. Room - comfortable beds, modern & new, and mostly roomy. A \"walk-in\" style closet which is actually a little small to actually walk-in - you kind of get stuck trying to manage in/out of the closet. Bathroom - beautiful except for a lack of hooks for bathrobes, towels, bathroom bags. A couple strategic hooks would make the experience much better. Had to use the shaving mirror to hang stuff. Breakfast buffet - mostly good selection and tastes, except for lack of a good noodle dish for breakfast. Throughout Asia, noodles are de rigeur and my preference - however here - most days not even one noodle dish!!?? On our return through Singapore, our reservation was missing. Before leaving our initial visit, we were pretty sure we made a reservation, even getting a call our last evening, from the desk to confirm the BMW rate for our return. While we didn't get a confirmation number (our mistake), we thought it was clear when we enquired/confirmed that we wanted a room - also making arrangements for storing bags, etc. In any case, when we tried to check back in the following week, no reservation - but available rooms! it took a painful 40-minutes to get a room. Computer was down, no non-smoking rooms, night manager not available to confirm rate, etc. When the manager showed up, she was very concerned and apologetic, but it still took an interminable time to actually get checked in. The lateness of our arrival (945pm) and the earliness of our next day departure (6:00am) contributed to the overall impression.

I asked the chambermaid who was cleaning the room next door to help. She said cannot open due to security, made a call and that's it. I approach another staff at the end of the corridor for help.

With all of the recent development in the Marina Bay area, it is very much the most convenient place to be if on holiday. The hotel is extremely comfortable and luxurious. We had two connecting rooms on the 15th floor with Marina view. Spectacular views, particularly at night when the light show was in action. I wouldn't get fixated with a really high floor as anything above floor 10 will give you a great panorama. The design of the hotel is rather strange in that none of the public rooms make use of the fantastic location to give a view out over the harbour. this is a real shame so the Marina view is a must. Rooms are very spacious, more like a junior suite in some other hotels, and the light colour scheme only makes them feel even larger. The bathrooms with the window are fantastic. Great shower and extremely comfortable bed. Service was excellent. The staff could not have done more. Breakfast staff remembered our names and those of our sons every day despite the fact that this is a huge hotel. Some staff really went out of their way. Breakfast was very good and we also tried the seafood buffet which was excellent. The only minuses were the pool needs a freshen up both in terms of the facility itself and the gardens around. Many people will be wondering whether to stay at the MO or the RC given that they are next to each other and in exactly the same price bracket.

If I had to choose, I'd take the Ritz but they are both excellent hotels.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cTHE BEST IN SINGAPORE?

Let's start with the bad first impression. The layout. The hotel's layout is not at all intuitive. The arrival experience isn't what you'd have expect for this class of hotel. No large impressive atrium with large reception to greet you. Instead you arrive, not sure which way the reception is as there are two passage ways, one to their all day dining and the other to the lounge and the reception is not visible at all. Then the nearest bank of lifts from the reception which by the way, you turn right towards the lounge, leads to the car park and not the rooms. So get to your room you'll wanting the bank of lifts that are the furtherest away. On entering the rooms I can't say I cared much for the fit out. Granted I was in the deluxe room, but the whole lay out with the beds right next to the door and the door finished with the same material as the walls made it feel a little like a cabin in a cruise ship. I'm not saying its a bad fit out, just not my taste. Now after all of my whining, the best bit about this hotel is its impeccable service. They've trained their staff extremely well and really try to personalise the service. I've stayed at the St. Regis, the Conrad, mandarin oriental and grand Hyatt (all in Singapore) and I must say the service here is the best. The rooms facing the marina bay also have spectacular views and of all the bathrooms of all the above mentioned hotels this is one of the largest and most well appointed, coming in a close second to St. Regis. Whilst I whined about the room's fit out, it's certainly large and extremely comfortable. Certainly for me, the whole experience here was great even if I didn't quite appreciate the aesthetics of the hotel.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nottingham", "Title": "\u201cFaultless Ritz Carlton.\u201d", "Author": "optom", "ReviewID": "UR126901814", "Content": "This is my seventh visit to the Ritz Carlton, each time staying for about a week. We have always enjoyed our stays here, but as in all hotels there have been little niggles. Last year we opted to go to the Pan Pacific for a change, but very quickly realised that the two hotels are a class- or a least a full star- apart, and returned to Ritz Carlton this year. Great decision. The rooms have been upgraded, new beds, TVs, but most importantly the rooms have been configured so it all makes sense, and you sit on the sofa and admire the view. New lighting, which is very clever, but also sensible as there is plenty of light to read. Bathroom has been retiled etc, but the stunning layout with bath under window remains. The rooms facing the Marina have the best view, but you pay a supplement for the view, and identical room. For that reason, I have only twice had Marina view, and am happy with my cheaper view of vibrant city and water. I don't know whether there has been a change of management, but service is now excellent. Whoever is in charge runs a tight ship! It is an example to other 5 star hotels. The pool is superb, both for swimming lengths and splashing around. Lots of loungers and parasols. The only food I ate in the RC was breakfast, and that was as good as ever. It has always been the best hotel buffet breakfast I have ever had. As the hotel is very well situated, with 2shopping malls just outside, and an MRT station to take you anywhere in Singapore, I always wanted to explore the fabulous Singapore food, rather than hotel food.

Most of those nights are spent at Marriott properties. Marriott usually treats us very well. Since the Marriott in Singapore was under construction we decided to stay at a sister property The Ritz Carlton. We were disappointed because the Ritz in Singapore doesn't honor Marriott status nor does it give points. We decided to stay anyway because I had always believed that it was a superior hotel chain. Boy was I mistaken. The location and views were grand but the customer service was some of the worst I've experienced in Asia. Not only did the hotel disappoint but the restaurant's service was pretty dismal. The food in the restaurant was very good but we had a hard time getting anyone's attention when we wanted plates cleared and more beverages. When we checked out of the hotel we were given a bill. Later they decided that they forgot a fee and called to say they were adding additional charges. They never forwarded an updated receipt for my husband's expense report. When we got home we contacted the hotel to tell them about our various problems. We were promptly called by a customer service representative named Victoria and while the representative was sympathetic she really didn't provide any solution other than a vague promise to contact her when we are returning to Singapore and she would like to make it up to us. It has been 3 months and we are returning to Singapore so I emailed her to see if we could get a reduced rate or some compensation. I have only received an email back saying she is out until the day we arrive in Singapore. When I forwarded an email to whomever is covering for her in Victoria's absence I did not receive a reply.

There was a minor leakage in the bathroom AC, but rectified within 30 minutes after being reported. They even offered to change my room after it was fixed!

The view overlooked where the Formula 1 drivers zipped by, along the harbor. The bathtub was nestled up against a window and afforded a view of the entire marina area (hope they couldn't see in!)--the luxe Acqua di Parma products were simply everywhere. The bed was so comfy; it simply enveloped you. All of the room furnishings were in excellent condition. The usual robes were cozy. Every amenity imaginable was either in the room, or available upon request. The staff were competent, smiling, kind... extremely helpful in making our arrangements (we invited our colleagues to the room: how could we not share?! :). The club room offered the most sumptous buffet I've ever seen in a Ritz: sashimi, fruits, yummy hot & cold apps, and a fresh duck offering prepared by a very kind chef wearing a very big hat. The champagne flowed endlessly. Breakfast the next morning was equally stunning and plentiful, with hand-carved fruit designs, made-to-order omlettes, and other 'Eastern' options which still remain a mystery, but were simply delicious. The location is very convenient to shopping, businesses, cultural sites as it is situated along the promenade. All in all a very special experience in a gorgeous venue.

The place is stunning, with great artworks throughout the lobby, beautifully appointed rooms with wonderfully panoramic views, large baths and showers, comfortable beds and great amenities. All the staff, from reception, concierge and the doormen to restaurant and room service waitstaff, were very professional, warm and helpful. The room servicing was without fault - housekeeping does a great job. The food was delicious, the breakfast buffet fresh and extensive and room service meals really good, I would strongly suggest picking some of the Indian dishes and the Singapore Noodles, Yummo! The hotel is also in close walking distance to a shopping centre with a food hall with the usual fare, such as burgers and chips if your children are craving something simpler. The only downside for us, and absolutely no fault of the hotel, was that on the way over our 4 year old daughter ended up in Singapore's Raffles hospital with a viral infection and on the way back our 1 year old son obviously picked up a tummy bug in Paris and became extremely sick on the plane just before we landed in Singapore and then continued to be rather sick for most of our stay. Needless to say, it was pure bad luck, and we really didn't get to enjoy the hotel's facilities outside the rooms such as the pool etc or get to walk to the harbour and check out the local parks etc, but we got to appreciate the hotel staff, who were very helpful and followed up with inquiries on how our daughter was doing (we didn't mention our son being very sick on the way back, we just wanted to run and hide in our rooms and have a good shower and bath). Anyway, it was a great place to stay, even with sick children. Incidentally, if you are sick and don't have travel insurance, don't go to Raffles Hospital - an overnight stay for our daughter, with a raft of tests, which was overkill, but apparently a usual practice in Singapore, cost $1900. Luckily our insurance covered it, but the price was still quite a shock. The hospital was pretty amazing though. I would also suggest, if you have the cash, to pay for a direct private transfer to the hotel, we used the Singapore Stopover bus service, and being squeezed into a very tight mini bus with loads of luggage, and lots of other people who are being dropped off at other hotels along the way, is excruciating. The Ritz Carlton is about the last drop off point, so with 2 young children it becomes a bit of a nightmare - especially if you have to wait a while at the airport for the pick up in the first instance, like we did. In summary, we will definitely stay at the Ritz Carlton again as we could not fault the hotel (except maybe to fault the extortionate price of its Japanese dishes in room service), and hopefully the next time the children remain healthy for the entire stay and we get to enjoy it more!", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, CO", "Title": "\u201cOver the top service with nice views\u201d", "Author": "BoulderTravelers5", "ReviewID": "UR121805828", "Content": "Just had a really nice stay at the Ritz Carlton-Singapore.

Ample use of natural light, white stone and white marble, accentuates the overall impression of fluidity. The restaurants and swimming pool are equally enticing.

Their huge size, making them closer to suites, is reinforced by the full-size windows and unobstructed views. The striking bathrooms have their own external windows. The overall decoration, modern for a Ritz-Carlton, makes use of warm materials such as leather panelling and richly colored clothing: it works well with the space to create a feel of refinement and comfort. While the place is not new, the high quality of the fixture makes it age quite gracefully so far. One has pleasure in staying in these rooms for extended periods, even during daytime. Not surprisingly, the room rate is at a premium to comparable hotels in Singapore (add about S$100-150 per night). Unfortunately, the Ritz-Carlton does not integrate with the rest of the city.

Walking to the colonial district takes a good 15 minutes, either boring in underground passes, or sweaty in the Singapore heat.

Our room was ready for us upon arrival and, as promised, had a spectacular view of the marina and city skyline. The room was refreshingly spacious and had recently been updated; the bathroom had the trademark octagonal window over the tub with another stunning view of the marina.

It was my first time staying in this part of Singapore, and while the location is not as central as Orchard road, being close to the Esplanade did have some perks. Overall, the hotel was \u201cabove average\u201d in quality. The hotel looks to have been renovated fairly recently, and had some of the most modernly comfortable rooms I have stayed in. However, this was in contrast to some other parts of the hotel, which remained a little dated. The staff were always helpful, and allowed us to use shower facilities at the health-club post check-out, but aside from that nothing in particular stands out in my mind. My chief complaint the BOTH times I stayed there was the general noisiness of the hotel, as both times my beauty sleep was interrupted by either loud noises outside, or by renovations taking place within the hotel. +++: Rooms: Spacious, and outfitted with modern amenities such as universal /USB outlets on the desk, iPod dock, large TV with multimedia system, and electrically controlled curtains, all of which were easy to use. The bathrooms were elegant and spacious, with a bathtub overlooking the city. Location: Walkable distance to Marina Bay Sands and Esplanade, and in a generally quieter part of town, which gives a little more relaxing feel. Short taxi ride away from main business districts. Bonus tip: try drinks at Orgo, which is the Esplanade\u2019s rooftop bar. If you can stand the heat, you will be rewarded with a great atmosphere and original drinks, and is truly a great way to enjoy/start a night out. Be warned, I have heard the food there is lacking though\u2026 ---: Location: Generally not considered as convenient as Orchard Road, and a little (I stress a little) further from districts such as Chinatown and little India. Noise: The first time I stayed, it was noise from outside the hotel that woke me, and it persisted through most of the morning. Since the hotel neighbours the Padang, it is understandable that sometimes rehearsals take place, so I was a little more understanding. The second time though, was more of a nuisance, as the persistent whirring of a drill came from WITHIN the hotel on both Saturday and Sunday from around 10am onwards \u2013 not the greatest complement to a mild hangover. Security system: Just an annoyance rather than a huge negative, but a friend stayed in the same hotel, and we were put on different floors. At this hotel, your card only has access to your particular floor, so it was impossible to get to a different floor without the help of staff, which in turn required guest name, room number AND a call up to the room to confirm with the guest.

Further, at $400+ a night I don't like getting nickel and dimed for little things. I expect a seamless experience that is hassle free. Even if my company is flipping the bill I can't excuse $30 dollar a day internet, $20 dollar bottles of beer or $45 dollar breakfasts. Pros: -Renovated rooms -Great view of Marina Bay (especially if you're a first timer in Singapore) -Comfortable bed and quiet -Nice pool area Cons: - Expensive internet access. Lame. It's 2011.

And if you're into colors, well, here's an opportunity to study which ones you shouldn't be using and how not to combine them. Check-in seems an issue at many Ritz-Carltons, they just seem to have too small check-in areas with too few staff. Not a good start for a nice stay having to queue.

The bathroom is the largest of any hotel I have ever seen and, as mentioned often, the bathtub offers a window through which you can view the Singapore skyline. I thought the pool was excellent. Apart from the main pool, there is also a warm jaccuzzi. The pool is shrouded by lots of trees which gives the feeling of peace and tranquility rather than being in a major metropolis. This is a good place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. The hotel is connected to a major shopping mall where you can eat cheaply and do your shopping. On the whole, the location is slightly out of the way as its a bit of a walk to the nearest MTR station. Most of the time you'll probably need a taxi to get to most attractions in Singapore.

The rooms are immaculate. The new rooms have leather paneled walls. Top quality material used in every part of the room. The entire room feels like the interior of an Aston Martin or Rolls Royce. Leather and high quality soft materials everywhere. The bed uses the top quality fabrics, making our sleep one of the most pleasant ever at a hotel.

The full wall view exists in the bath as well, providing for an amazingly romantic experience. Service is brilliant. Upon finding out about our anniversary, managment hand delivered a gourmet cake and fruit basket to our room, along with personally signed card. This was most well-timed since we had friends over to enjoy the view over bubbly. I'm figuring my friends were as impressed by this as much as we were. The management also made it their job to satisfy our every desire. The restaurant responded immediately to a slight comment I made about slow coffee service during breakfast. The next morning, it was abundantly clear that management listened and made sure my delicious coffee was re-filled at moments notice.

It\u2019s a 32-storey luxury hotel located in Marina Bay, next to the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay. Its ten minutes walk from the Orchard Street shops and only twenty minute taxi ride from the airport. And the walls are adorned with more than 4000 original pieces of modern art. It\u2019s quite something to see great art at every turn, from the bedroom to the bars. We arrived at nine at night and were pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome we received; everyone knew our names, no matter which floor or part of the hotel we visited. It was a welcome guaranteed to make you feel loved and important! It was very impressive \u2013 and the service lived up to that standard throughout our stay. We were taken up to the 26th floor to a Premier Suite, marvellous accommodation with access to the Club Lounge, When we arrived our body clock was lagging four hours we decided to drop into the Club Lounge and have a few nibbles and glasses of Moet before turning in for a duty free night cap in our luxury lounge and watch a movie on the 32 inch TV. The suite itself was the epitome of luxury and certainly ranks in the top five of rooms I\u2019ve stayed in, with 60 square metres of space, and an enormous bedroom which came compete with TV set and walk in wardrobe. When tiredness eventually set we sank into the huge king-sized bed with feather mattress, goose down doona, extra large king pillows and white cotton sateen sheets. The bathroom was equally impressive, with double wash basins, separate two-person shower, and a huge bath that sat in front of the one-way mirror windows that let guests see out and no-one see in. Not that it mattered much on the 26th floor. And all set in black marble, My wife was quick to comment on how good the toiletries were \u2013 White Tea by Bvlgari, no less Add to this the separate toilet and large walk-in wardrobe and lap-top size safe The lounge room was even bigger than the bedroom with a spectacular view over the bay, comfortable settee and chairs, plus the super flat screen TV. There were wine glasses to suit every drink, vases of live orchids and of course the complimentary fruit bowl. The hotel is close to the site of the new billion dollar resort and casino right next to the \u201cSingapore Flyer\u201d a massive Ferris wheel which is Singapore\u2019s answer to the London Eye. We could see these icons from the windows of the suite. It\u2019s worth an upgrade to club class for in the lounge up on the 32nd floor you get 360-degree views of the city-state from panoramic windows, eat complimentary breakfast and enjoy up to five different dining experienced during the day \u2013 champagne breakfast, mid-day snacks, afternoon tea, hors d\u2019oeuvre cocktails, and chocolates with cordials in the evening, After a day out in the shops or sightseeing it\u2019s a great place to have a nightcap and check out the views of the Marina Bay lights. There\u2019s even a private meeting room, which can accommodate up to eight, business centre services, free wireless broadband and a library. Nevertheless, we ate dinner on the lower floors in The Summer Pavilion for a signature Cantonese meal. You can do your shopping without leaving the air conditioning if you want to. A few metres from the hotel lobby is the Millennium Centre that links to several huge shopping arcades.

There are plenty of electric outlets in the rooms and suites, and I particularly appreciate the bedside controls that allow you command the entire room (or suite) without having to get up.

The gym was enormous with exercise equipment of every type. The lobby entertainment was subtle, unassuming, and gorgeous. It really is a pleasure to stay here at the \"Ritz.\" I'll be back there every time that I can. My only complaint would be the cost of the buffet breakfast. $55 SGD is too pricey for my blood, and after the first morning, I walked over the mall next door for food.

The staff are probably the best we've encountered, and as usual during our recent 2 week stay prior to leaving for good they were incredibly attentive. The rooms are wonderful, views can't be beaten, and the bathrooms..well, many reviewers have already said, they are amazing. We wouldn't hesitate to stay again but for one thing: suddenly, the price of incidentals has absolutely skyrocketed. It's ironic since the room rates are still very fair given the space, comfort, and service. But the in-room dining options are now absolutely ridiculous, and totally unjustifiable. Until recently one could always indulge in a late night bite to eat with drinks at a reasonable cost, so I don't know what's happened..perhaps we're indirectly paying for the recent bathroom upgrades. I won't embarrass the management by pasting the price of a small beer in this review (and that was before the triple plus !), but I was sorely tempted..let's see if there's a response to this message.

There is plenty going for it - grand, tasteful, great public spaces, nice pool, good rooms and light, great club floor and lounge, good restaurants and pride in cleanliness. Two things bothered me on my latest trip. The first was the noise from the open air stage on the marina and the traffic to the casino, the price of continued development of the area (and I was on a very high floor). The second was the seeming lapses in historically good service, for example, the inability to speed up check-in and check-out. I am not sure what it is but check-in was a 25 minute charade of going from front desk where I was front of queue to the club lounge where I waited 10 minutes for someone to show up. check out at the crack of dawn with no one in line took 15 minutes as some rookie fumbled through the steps while I needed to get off to the airport.

But once you've gotten over the hump of paying top dollar, you realize you get what you pay for. As it is, I found an excellent Club Room rate via Booking.com and was thoroughly pleased with my experience. I arrived at 1 pm and was told my room would be ready at around 230. Not very pleasant but I didn't want to be bothered. I dropped off my bag and walked to the adjacent mall...thirty minutes later, I got a call on my cellphone, saying my room was ready. I was brought to the 2nd highest floor in the building, the 31st and was shown the works. Looking at the pictures, you might think with all the beiges and pale woods that it's mostly plain and straight-forward design, almost Swedish in coldness. I'm here to tell you that the pictures do no justice to the finesse of materials and finish of the furnishings. Walls were covered in plush leather like coverings, the wood work was lacquered and burnished to high shine. The bathroom was immense with the most thoughtful of extras: a ziplock bag for carry-on toiletries, delicate face soaps alongside sturdier bath soaps, a bath tub pillow. The bathrobe was plush and warm at the same time, definitely tempting to take home. And yes, the slippers were the comfiest I had ever seen in an airconditioned room (not sure they will fare well in more humid climes). My rate included free Wifi which worked well and club access which was well worth every penny. The food offerings on the club floor were nonstop; from breakfast buffets to afternoon tea, to late evening chocolates and cordials. I enjoyed it a few times and cheered and toasted the view across to Marina Bay Sands. The pool is rather uninspired in this day and age of massive pools--but at least it was big and uncrowded and towels galore. The gym was quite complete and was hardly ever occupied when I was there. Public spaces were taken over by some giant business conference--suits pretty much filled the elevators at all hours but what can one do? If ever there was a gripe--it was with my toilet. It leaked on the first day. Engineering came quickly enough to fix it. However, the sorest point was left to discover late at night when I would hear the pipes from other rooms whooshing away. In mid-sleep one hardly wishes to be bothered--I reckoned my neighbors were away most of the daytime, but at night, the plumbing could be heard. Rather unacceptable in a room and rate of this level. Check out was smoothly handled on the club floor. I took a cab to the airport which took all of 17 minutes. A few days after I had filled up a review from the RC, I got a letter from the Manager apologizing for the plumbing with a kind offer to redress my discomfiture. I thought that was a great response and I look forward to returning.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service!

(5 year old Mandarin oriental Tokyo so much better or 4 star Sheraton Hong Kong hotel is perfect clean)) * location ( \u00a0promenade subway station exitA just behind hotel with marina bay view close to Marina bay sands just few walk.) * restaurant.

Yes, I try to find out why ? The answer is many tiny flaw.\u00a0But assemble be big problem. That you should know and accept before check in in this hotel Such as 1.Arrival and departure flaw \u00a0\u00a0- no upcoming message to me. \u00a0\u00a0- location of this hotel is the best,the most beautiful marina bay view , promenade subway station just only behind across 4lane one way road * However,\u00a0\u00a0I can't find entrance from the back door. No\u00a0any sign board or staff to help you. \u00a0I ask available staff but no proper answer and help ( first staff : lobby in 3rd floor you can go by elevator (where?) ( second : this lift is out of order you should go by walk up by stair case , with Luggage???? This six star hotel). Very lucky that \u00a0the door of grand ballroom \u00a0opened \u00a0( during decoration) I walk through and take the elevator to 3rd floor with myself) 2.Service flaw \u00a0- staff of this chain hotels call \" ladies and Gentlemen serve ladies an gentlemens\". This sentence made me decide select one to recieve this service. - when I touch to professional L&G. I feel special and true different other 6 star hotel . when i arrived to Lobby \u00a0from nervous @1st floor . Amaze with multiple separate counter L&G lead me to true Front with smile face in her eyes and lips. Introduce my room high as I request ( upgrade to club level floor ) and point to lift that I will go. ( no L&G came with me to introduce room ) and no wifi service introduce. - turn down service staff is very humble work very well in their job. - the conceirge is very best . I question the best way when I go to subway. Gentleman introduce and walk with me until end of hotel roof to point the way( the answer is \u00a0millennia walk through the PARCO mall). And when I receive my luggage (again I cannot find luggage-keeping area(it situate outside the hotel entrance). Lady in conceirge go for me to pick up luggage ( but cannot find luggage because staff in bell area are not there. I must go to find with myself and she made apologize ) - check out service \u00a0, I can wait queue it had gold tank of water and juice and glass with self service. L&G look busy and arrange me to right queue . At the \u00a0last sentence not is farewell and please visit again but only phrase \" NEXT PERSON \" I love this hotel. So MUCH . But I should consider myself that deserve to receive Ladies and Gentlemen service again or not. 3.room flaw\u00a0 - no welcome amenities (fruit or chocolate or gift box) - no greeting card, have letter about restaurant , breakfast service but to other people , not to me) -no manual to introduce room ( you must find out switch light curtain blind or any thing by yourself as hide and seek , curtain &blind switch are at bed head. - No featherbed as described in Internet and after send request , their bed made some hurt to me in the morning. - toiletries not is brand name. Distribute by hotels supply. 4.Restaurant flaw. At afternoon tea. I taste the best scone here. But very take time between tea and scones. L&G look continue work ( <5 persons) when I call and question about my dish . She came with it suddenly. I think this is problem about quantity of staff ( is not quality)[K' Shiki restaurant of Mandarin oriental Tokyo can serve 4 course lunch menu< half hour] All this flaws ruin reputation of Ritz-Carlton hotel chain.

As always, I'll address my gripes first, as those are what are most concerning to readers. Cons: No hallway to allow for privacy once doors are open... I like the way that there is hallway that leads to the bedroom area in a normal hotel room, but the doors in most standard deluxe rooms opens right into the sleeping area, with the bed right next to the doorway. Also, I find that the doors do not shut very easily. To the hotels credit, they on three occasions stopped by to notify me that the door was not fully closed, but I think that the engineers should ensure that doors that swing shut, should do so. Add the first two points together, and it's not a very comfortable room arrangement. Tough to find the safe. Slight mustiness/funny smell. I was in Room 2319.

Everytime. This hotel is mediocre not JUST because of the renovations, I think the guys that designed and trained the staff here don't really know the first thing about hotels. Zia the reception cannot give us non smoking king bed rooms that we booked for, and my wife actually called the day before. He KNOWS that we asked for it, because he said 'yes I received the notice'. He can do nothing but give us upgraded rooms on a smoking floor, and the floor when extensive renvation work is being done. Thank you. His version of double beds turns out to be twin beds. So we came all the way down to the reception to complain and he changed us one of the room to king beds. (that we asked for confirmed). Called room service, ordered the steak and two hot waters, naturally you will get ice cold waters. Room service was much below the standards of mandarin oriental.

The service was great and the late night room service selection (late night arrival) very good. Further the room service isn't served on a plate but on a set table (on wheels) complete with flowers. The room was technically advanced with plugs for everything and a massive window over the bath made for a great view. Both the room and bathroom were generously sized. The lobby and eating areas are also lavishly decorated, very pleasant albeit busy. There are better pool facilities in other hotels and this was the only area where the service was a little slow, but this is nonetheless pleasant and green.

I know that most that choose this hotel will love this feature... but I am a bit of a land- lover... so never mind me! It was very pretty to bathe in the moonlight, and seeing the city's lights, after a typical sticky and humid day! I did like it there, however, I prefer to reside in places that display more of whatever city's authentic charm. I was able to find some, poolside. It was small (in a good way) and loaded with beautiful and lush vegetation along the patio and surrounding areas. The sushi restaurant inside the hotel was the most incredible sushi I have ever tried. Very high quality. One thing that I must confess to not being fond of, is staff related. The hotel is rather large, and therefore hyper- staffed. Every time I would walk in or out, I felt obliged to speak. Normally, this would be a positive thing, but when you literally pass about ten to fifteen staff members, that from the moment you hit the lobby elevator, to your driver outside, that's a lot of obligatory dialogue! I know that they are trained to be hospitable, but after a long flight- and a difficult adjustment to the new time zone, I recall wishing that I could get from point A to point B, without practically speaking in my sleep!

I had a marina view room with an amazing view of central Singapore. The staff helped me to my room and showed me all of its features. The Room: My room was huge, as was the bathroom!

A nice walk-in closet and also a great workspace - probably the best of any hotel I've stayed at. Overall the room was amazing and I couldn't fault a thing. Amenities: I used the laundry service a couple of times and it was great. The pool area was very nice and also had great service from the staff. I did not use any other amenities. Dining: I ate twice at the Greenhouse buffet, which I would say was average for the price (over S$100 with drinks). The selection was good and items were re-stocked on a regular basis. As a solo traveller I didn't feel very welcome though. This was probably my only real complaint. Location: The location is good, but not great. The MRT is not very convenient, and it's not easy to walk in or out of the hotel (you have to walk on the road). This place clearly wasn't designed with pedestrians in mind. With that said, it was always easy to get a taxi, and additionally, I was able to walk to several shops and the MRT without much hassle. The hotel is very convenient for the Marina Bay Sands casino.

Ritz now offers a wonderfully updated room, automatic blinds, lights, electronics coupled with new bedding, carpeting and IPTV.

I told him it was okay but he insisted to secure my luggage for a while. at the payment, apparently there was a bit mistake on the bill so I was charged wrongly and I realized that when I was at the airport already. surprisingly, the reception man contacted me both through e-mail and phone, saying that they have charged the wrong bill. they have phoned the bank and without matter of minutes, corrected the bill and he even sent me 2 copies of transcript through PDF document. I was speechless yet happy. he even sent me another e-mail apologizing for the mistake. what a true top class services they have given.

We did have an evening meal there at 50% off because of the airline agreement. It was reasonable - not great.

Particularly impressive was the fact that, thanks to another large window in the equally elegant bathroom, this breathtaking view of the city could also be enjoyed whilst relaxing in the bath! The overall decoration of the hotel is stylish and it has been looked after well. Staff were helpful and attentive and the pool was of a good size. However, we got the impression that the place was very focused on extracting as much money from you as possible. We were charged for breakfast even though we had not asked for it and had not taken it, although to be fair this was remedied promptly after bringing it to their attention. The fact that Internet access is not included in the room charge, and even worse is overpriced, was also disappointing.

I loved many aspects of the property, the club lounge, the pool the service and warmth of the staff. It was what one would expect from a top brand name hotel nothing more, or nothing less. My main disappointment with the Ritz Carlton on this stay (and other top 5 star properties anywhere in the world on other stays) are the extorionate rates they charge for the use of a computer to check an email. The charge 15SG$ an hour to use a computer in their business center is a rip off. Thus I paid another 100SG$ per night to upgrade to a club room to have access to a computer. This antagonised me and would only encourage me to choose another property on a future visit. Please remember that not all people are on expense accounts and the facility to check an email is as important to some customers as a morning shower. As long as the Ritz Carlton or any other hotel for that matter continue to charge outrageous rates for the use of an internet I will not in principle use that facility again. Having said all that this hotel proved itself to be in a category and class of its own when something went wrong. Let me briefly tell you the story. I always travel with an Ipod and listening to music is an important feature of my holiday. On the day before I left I could not find my Ipod. I checked at the swimming pool to see if I had left it there, but to no avail. One hour after reporting it missing, I received a phone call from the head of housekeeping. They had indeed found my ipod. I had left it on my bed. It was removed with linen and towels and sadly went into the wash. This was my own fault for not taking better care of my own property. However the Ritz took complete responsibility for the damage that was done. The head of housekeeping offered to replace the Ipod, and she understood fully that I would miss my music on a long flight back to europe and was not going to allow that to happen. She bought tapes of all my favourite songs and artists. Over 300 songs were downloaded (in her own time) on to the new Ipod for me and then graciously given to me with a written apology, a bottle of wine and a sincere thank you, for my understanding that what happened was an unintentional accident. I am still over the moon with the graciousness by which the Ritz in Singapore handled this problem. The service provided to me with regard to this matter was beyond all reasonable expectations of what a hotel should deliver when something goes wrong. The matter was handled magnificently and the head of housekeeping is a credit to this beautiful hotel. I will never have a problem staying here again for such a service delivered with real quality and style.

Their standards of service and hospitality force you to feel yourself the most important guest \u2013 a member of the family. We made reservation with Singapore stopover holidays and upgraded for additional payment on Club suite with Marina Bay view. First time we lived in standard Club room and this time we wanted to try difference. I like luxury and I really got it here. When our taxi approached the hotel we were greeted and invited on the club floor where during we were sipping Champaign Moet and Chan don, staff made our check in. Here I first time tried club service and understood that it is very comfortable and worth money, because you get exclusive service and \u201cfree\u201d breakfast, internet, appetizers during the whole day and alcoholic drinks. Besides, now trying different Club Lounge services in many hotels, I can say that so far Ritz Club standards are faultless. So we were accompanied in our suite on the 29 floor. It was exquisite accommodation: two rooms \u2013 large and spacious drawing room and bed room with huge king size bed. Bathroom was extraordinary large with windows, 2 sinks, bath and shower. The only complaint was very small toilet room comparing to such grand size of bathroom. It was such pleasure to lay in bath and enjoy watching what happened outside. The bed was very comfy, linen was excellent. The view of Marina bay was breathtaking. Big LCD with DVD was in bed room and one more LCD in drawing room. All furniture, design was top notch. Room cleaned of course very efficient. As for me, I liked our room very much. Club staff and the dishes which offer in Club lounge costs additional attention. I still remember some of them Fadly, Jallee and Amira \u2013 they do their best to satisfy your needs. They gave me a good advice what to see and where to dine and which club to visit. Very, very pleasant people. Breakfast and dishes during the whole day are changing every day. The chef offers every day something new. Everything was very delicious. Their evening appetizers and dishes were enough for us and we didn\u2019t go to other restaurants. We didn\u2019t visited Gym but saw that it was large and well equipped with training apparatus. Swimming pool had rather large size and enough quantity of Chaise lounges around. Some people don\u2019t like the location of Ritz Carlton, but I think they have a very comfortable one. Near Krys Flyer, Marina Bay \u2013 10 minutes walk from nearest MRT station. And you have outstanding view from your room either Marina Bay or Callang Bay.

Esplanade Mall (with a few restaurants) and a few other malls are within walking distance. Next door to Mandarin Oriental and Pan Pacific. Free wifi in public areas and was able to use free internet and printing in business center as well. Requested a late check out (for at least one room) and got one free of charge for one room until 4 pm, even though Good Friday seemed like a busy day with lots of arrivals. Speedy, correct check out.

The food at the buffet breakfast was extensive in choice and quality to taste (I couldn't stay away from the multitude of cheeses offered). The best part of our stay at the Ritz though was the attention to detail, the small things. For example, the turn down service which included putting cute little book marks on our bed and turning the tv on and turning it to face the bed for our return. Also, greeting us by name on occasion which we didn't expect in a large capacity hotel. Sitting us at a booth at breakfast each morning because they remembered we prefered that.

Let me start off by commenting on the arrival and check-in. The lobby does give you that grandeur and 'Ritz-Carlton' feel and I must say the only hotel lobby in Singapore that is able to match will be the Fullerton. I was escorted to the lobby check-in desk and offered a drink. When checking in I was told that since I have booked a Club Room my check-in will be on the Club Floor. Check-in on the Club Floor was nice, sitting comfortably in the Club Lounge while waiting for the staff to bring me my room key. I was also granted a late check-out at 3 pm. Everything was perfect till I stepped into my room. The moment I entered the room, the first thought was the room looks much smaller than I had perceived, and it did not help that the room although looks very clean and tidy, is mediocre at best and does not feel opulent at all. The only comfort thing was the bathroom bathtub, which give you an unobstructed view of the marina and it was really heavenly to soak in the bathtub with a view at night. I must say the bath amenities was also abit disappointing, where they come in miniscule size and not very well stocked. The pressure on the shower head was another glitch for me, as it was not stable and throughout my shower I have to constantly adjust the pressure. I must give credit to the bed, very very comfortable with lots of pillows. They do have pillow menu but I couldn't be bothered to change. One of the nicest Club Lounge I have been to. They have private rooms if you want some privacy or engage in meeting. The Club Lounge have five servings of food per day, along with unlimited flow of champagne. I was not too impressed with the selection of food as they are quite limited, but the quality was good. The check-out was done in a manner where other hotels could follow. All you need to do is to tell any staff on the Club Floor you are checking out, and then just take a sit and enjoy your food and champage, while the staff prepare your bill and bring it personally to you desk. No unnecessary queue you will experience (see my other review on Conrad Singapore). Overall it was a great experience and if it is your first time in Singapore looking for luxurious hotel stay this is a must try, provided that you spend abit more to stay in the Club Lounge.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "JAKARTA", "Title": "\u201cTired Rooms in need of renovation, not Ritzy\u201d", "Author": "BENLEE123", "ReviewID": "UR56743224", "Content": "I had a short one night stay in Singapore on transit and decided to try out the Ritz Carlton Millenia. One of Ritz Carlton first few properties in Asia, the design of the hotel was groundbreaking during the time of it\u2019s opening in the 90s and among the distinctive feature is the famed bathroom with a view. During that time, Singapore had very limited selection of contemporary luxury hotels and the Ritz Carlton Millenia was a pioneer. Arrival I arrived by taxi from the airport and a friendly but a bit robotic female staff escorted me first to the counter for check-in. Later I was told I should check-in at the club level because I booked a club room. However, at the club lounge, I was told to wait while she apparently go looking for the staff that can help me with the check-in. There is no dedicated check-in desk at the club lounge for some strange reasons. After like a 5 to 10 mins wait ( too long for me ), I got the keys and another staff escorted me to my room. The Room Well, the room might be described flatteringly as \u201cunderstated luxury\u201d but to me, it\u2019s very dull and plain. To put it critically, it\u2019s worn out, tired, faded and in other words, not \u201cRitzy\u201d. Don\u2019t get me wrong, all the basics are there. There\u2019s a comfortable king size bed with quality linens, a sofa seating area and a good-size work desk. The air condition is quiet and work well. The bathroom, which the RC Singapore is so famous for also fail to impress me. Sure, the bathtub with the Octagonal window by the side remains an eye-catching and distinctive design feature. But it\u2019s not a full ensuite. There\u2019s only a single basin. The shower cubicle doesn\u2019t have rainforest shower or shower stick. Toiletries (Bvlgari) are of the miniscule type. The marble is worn out and faded. This is a bathroom that had seen better days. At least the towels are fluffy and the water pressure adequate. There are also major problems with the design and layout of the room. Starting with the Tv ( a 37\u201d LCD ) that was chucked inside a armoire and positioned in such a awkward position that the only place to watch the Tv comfortably is from the working desk. The plugs are awkwardly positioned at the back of the sofa chair and the back wall of the desk. Why aren\u2019t these plugs positioned at the side of the table or build into the work desk? For a Ritz Carlton room, I am seriously unimpressed. The room does not convey any sense of luxury to me. It\u2019s more like a 3 or 4 star hotel room from appearance. Really, the whole room is just crying out for a renovation and it has not been renovated and refreshed since the 90s. One thing good is that the view is very nice, perhaps the nicest I\u2019ve seen in Singapore. The room I booked has a great view of the Kallang bay area with a six lane highway. I can only assume the Marina Bay view will be much better but the room rate is also corresponding much higher. The Club Lounge The Ritz Carlton Millenia has the reputation of hosting one of the best club lounge in Singapore. Overall it\u2019s a reasonably good size lounge and is nice and cozy and served a good selection of food and drinks during meal times. But it doesn\u2019t have the size and grandeur of the better club lounges that I have experienced, including it\u2019s sister property in Jakarta. I\u2019ve only tried their evening cocktail which is just OK. There\u2019s also free flow of champagne for those that are interested in this. It gets a bit crowded too because frankly speaking, the lounge isn\u2019t that large, again just knock down a few rooms and converted into a club lounge kind of thing. The Common Areas This is one area that the hotel is holding up quite well. Those giant hanging structures are quite impressive. The hotel also house an impressive art collection ( more than 4,500 pieces I was told ). The gym is well equipped with the latest technogym equipment. Swimming pool area has a resort feel to it with cabanas but I feel the size is a bit on the small side. Service Other than the initial check-in hiccups, service is otherwise prompt and efficient. I didn\u2019t need to wait for anything. Most of the staff are consistently polite and friendly although I notice the club lounge staff do seems a bit more friendly towards the Caucasian guests. However, as this is a short stay so to be fair, I can\u2019t say too much of the service. Conclusion For a premier luxury hotel of the Ritz Carlton chain, this hotel is distinctly average. Perhaps the hotel\u2019s age explained the less than glamorous room condition but the equally old Four Seasons have rooms in much better condition. And if compare with the way more luxurious and brand new St Regis, it seriously fall short. Until the hotel decided to renovate or at least refresh the rooms, I\u2019ll give it a 3/5.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Africa / UK", "Title": "\u201cThe best in Singapore - period.\u201d", "Author": "deepfriedpuppy", "ReviewID": "UR56202442", "Content": "Having travelled extensively to Singapore and eventually living there for 3 years, I will tell you in my opinion this is the best 5* hotel in Singapore.

They allow you to stay in the club lounge even after checkout - you have to ask - very useful when your departing flight is at 11:00PM, and you can relax in the lounge. The biggest annoyance was stale drinks in the lounge - the staff reuse open cans of soft drink, so when ordering a drink - you can expect stale coke with your whisky.

If we'd known in advance what we know now we would have spent much more time in Singapore and less in Bali. The staff at Check-in were very friendly and upon finding out we were there for our honeymoon upgraded our room to one with a city view and on a higher level. The view itself was quite stunning, especially at night, looking out over the new casino construction, the Marina Bay and the Singapore CBD. The room itself was quite spacious, but the TV was in an odd position relative to the bed and the sofa, and couldn't really be comfortably viewed from either of them. My wife found the bed to be a little bit too hard for her liking, I however thought it was just fine. The wonderful windows next to the bath were a nice touch. I would suspect that certain rooms might have some privacy issues, however given the position of our room I didn't find this to be a problem, and there are blinds that can be drawn if you're so inclined. I did quite enjoy luxuriating in the tub with a book looking out over Singapore. We didn't eat in the hotel as there were many restaurants and stalls that we wished to try out in our too short time in the city state. However when I was down at the pool I looked at the menu there and thought the pricing to be rather excessive... Seriously, S$10 for a glass of soft drink?? I would suspect this pricing to be standard through-out the hotel. The daily charges for internet access were again rather expensive, however it does seem to be in keeping with charges at similar level hotels around the world. The hotel itself is a short walk away from the Marina Plaza, which was described as shabby by my guide book. We thought it was quite good and it did satiate my desire for Carl's Jr... Yes, I went to Singapore and got an American hamburger... Cheaper than flying to the US for it! The walk to the SMRT is longer but not unreasonably so. From there it's easy to reach most of the city. It's also a short walk to the Singapore Flyer, which we enjoyed on both occasions that we rode it (once at night and then again during the day).

One comes straight off the East Coast Parkway from the airport almost directly to the hotel, after passing the Marina Square and Raffles Link malls, and as one approaches one comes up an impeccably manicured driveway closed off from the city by tropical shrubbery, providing a sense of privacy. The lobby is very impressive, with the entrance backlit by light streaming in from a huge hexagonal window from behind. Turning to the check-in area to the right, one is reminded of a cross between a classical European palace and the modernist impression of a train station, with a long, decoratively paneled vaulted arch running the length of the corridor (think of the Bank of China's lobby in Hong Kong, but suffused with light instead of in darkness). I've been staying at this hotel off and on for a decade, since it opened. When it opened it was at the frontier of hotel design, with its rooms having broad ceiling-to-floor windows, wooden veneer floors, and iconic bathrooms with Death Star-like huge hexagonal windows for its bathtubs, now overlooking the massive (but actually rather quiet) construction site that is the Las Vegas Sands Venetian Hotel going up further up the Marina Bay. The site does not dominate the view, mind, and is still a wonderful spectacle of the Singapore CBD, particularly at night. The hotel still sets standards in terms of the functionality as well as the attractiveness of the room's design, and it still appears relatively modern, and the flooring has been kept to a high standard with no wear and tear. But truth be told the design is now no longer avant garde, and to retain its original design cachet the hotel will at some point need to update its rooms' design touches in order to recapture the original magic. But I still think its triangular shaped showers are the best designed I've seen, roomy and preventing spillage of water into the rest of the bathroom, while still being able to turn on the water from the outside. And hard to beat the tubs for a soak in any business hotel. The staff are so obliging and helpful to a fault, and they genuinely seemed to anticipate my needs, from the patient check-in staff, the business center personnel, or the kind server in the Greenhouse restaurant in the morning that remembered that I liked a cappuccino with my breakfast. The gym is not huge but was very attractive and had modern machines, as well as the cold towels and fruit flavored iced waters that are becoming de rigeur in Asian hotels. The breakfast by the way does have a lovely mix of western and singaporean dishes, as well as the obligatory japanese and congee sections. I do still genuinely love this hotel, and found that despite it being primarily a business hotel, the staff were very accommodative to parents with young children.

Stayed for a week in early August 2009. We took 2 rooms on the Marina Bay side as these were the only ones which offered a \"connecting\" option. Unlike most hotels, this means that your rooms open into a small vestibule-like area which then has another set of doors that lead to the main corridor. Useful for us as we had a place to stash strollers, outside shoes, brollies etc and it gave the kids a bit more space to rampage. Thumbs up for the size of the rooms as well. Unfortunately this meant that we had to deal with a little bit of noise from the casino construction going on out in the Marina Bay as well as a bit more (unexpected) noise from the National Day rehearsals taking place on a large stage just opposite our room. We were on the 17th floor and could still hear the dance music/songs etc. To be fair, they stopped by about 10 pm but our 3+ year old and not quite 2 year old sleep fairly early (and lightly!). Still, it was fun to watch especially when the kids were in the bath. Agree that the interiors of the guest rooms need a thorough refurb. Wood floor panels were starting to rise a little in the bedroom and the curtains need a good yank (with resulting rope burn!) to open and close. Minor stains on the sofas. We enjoyed the flat screen tvs (no probs with watching from either the bed or the sofa as they swivel) and the DVD player was great. Hotel volunteered to put humidifiers in each of our rooms (as we were on a smoking floor) - which was terrific. Except we had to remind them every night to top up the water. I suppose we could have done it ourselves but I wasn't keen on messing about with the hotel's machines. Thought it would've been part of the normal evening turndown service but we had that only on our first night. For the rest of our stay, there was no evening turndown. Surprising for a Ritz Carlton. Service was generally inconsistent. We had great service some days and indifferent service on others. On the indifferent days, my husband said it reminded him of how some hotels in Europe hire college students to do the housekeeping - it's not quite the same, somehow. Some days the rooms didn't get done till lunch time. One evening, I was bathing the kids and didn't hear the door bell. I then found a card pushed under our door saying that housekeeping had tried to provide us with \"evening service\" but were unable to do so. No issue with that. However, the card said that they had called round at 7.30 pm. But it was only 6 pm when I found the card. Perhaps someone wanted to finish her evening round early? Broadband connection in the rooms was fast and stable and included in our corporate rate. Bed - comfy and lots of pillows. Duvet was strangely not in a duvet cover but sandwiched between 2 sheets. The airconditioning was a little temperamental too. Toiletries varied in quality. Some days, we got generic Ritz Carlton packaged stuff. Others, we got Bulgari. As I said earlier, inconsistent. Water pressure in the separate shower cubicle was poor but it was excellent in the bath tub. And there was a very useful bath tub pillow for soaking. Sanitaryware definitely needs an overhaul. Complimentary buffet breakfast was OK. Not great and not Ritz Carlton standard. Egg station had a single man (coping magnificently - I must say) to deal with the breakfast hordes. Surely the Ritz Carlton could afford to put another person on to help? The poor chap had to keep apologising for keeping people waiting (though there wasn't too much of a wait). Also there was the odd bluebottle or 2 in residence. Some local breakfast options would've hit the spot eg. roti canai, thosai, nasi lemak, chee cheong fun. We didn't check out the swimming pool or the gym. Lobby and most public areas were great.

Definitely better 5 star hotels out there.\u201d", "Author": "WattsyHK", "ReviewID": "UR35206937", "Content": "My husband has stayed here numerous times on business over the past 6m months, this is my 3rd visit. Food is OK, but not great considering the price. Have noticed decline in quality of produce used. Not good taste/quality. Still well presented and cooked, but not hte quality of ingredients you would expect in a 5 star place. You can see the cost cutting in a few areas is really affecting the guest experience. The main areas are big and were once grand, but seem dull and unwelcoming to me. Staff here are always great and helpful with a good standard of care. But even that does make up for being unable to fix problems. The biggest disappointment is the rooms. Big, nice bathroom but otherwise a letdown. We are on our 3rd room in a 6 night stay. First room, the noise was so bad from construction that my husband had to move during the middle of the night to try and get some rest. Loud construction noise at 2am - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. The hotel has no excuse for not warning you in advance that there may well be noise for the Harbour facing rooms. Also it was not possible to change the temperature in the room. So next day I arrive to join my husband while he was at work. He had left instructions that were agreed to that the hotel staff would move his posessions to the new room at some point during the day and that when I arrived late afternoon I would be sent to the new room, not the old one .Guess what, I arrived, the hotel had done nothing and I was sent to the old room. I thought it was odd that I was facing right onto the noisy construction and my husband had packed his case, so luckily rather than unpacking all my stuff I phoned my husband to check. Lucky I did. So I called the front desk and asked why I was sent to the wrong room and would they please sort it out. So a member of staff came to take me and all our luggage to the new room. New room was at least facing the city so less noisy. But again be warned, all the rooms are very noisy from people walking down the corridors, shouting, and room doors slamming loudly. No soundproofing. So new room was even more shabby and run down than the last one. It seems they all are to some degree or another. They are being refurbished soon I hear. They are 3 star quality right now, so would suggest staying here once that is done. Not only that, but this room was also dirty, The carpet had what I can only describe as a big crusty vomit stain on it. Like another reviewer I did NOT want to walk on the carpet with bare feet, it was nasty. All rooms are very worn out. Chipped and flaking, peeling etc. Bads design and layout. Cannot view TV from the bed, half the picture is cut off. also bad picture on TV. Cannot watch from the sofa either as its 90 degrees to one side. the bed in this room also had nasty nasty stains on the headboard, very clear what they were. Revolting. Once again the air conditioning does not work. Does not matter what temperature you set the unit to, it stays at 22 degrees. The clock in the the room has a thermostat so it was pretty hard for the dumb staff to continue arguing with us that it was working and fixed. But they tried bless them. Oh yes, all fixed. Really. So we moved rooms again! The filth and stuffy air was too much. This time the THIRD room was a bit less dirty, but just as tired and guess what - aircon fixed at 22 degrees. Finally a manager admitted that it is not possible to change the temperature in the rooms. At which point my husband was very upset as they had pushed us around to 3 different rooms by now -eating into our holiday time. They could have said the aircon was set and saved us all that hassle. Disgraceful way to treat guests. So now we are stuck in our stuffy room with no windows and no way to change the temperature. Very clear they try and cover up the fact that the aircon temp iS FIXED in every room to try and save money. And we got a random unknown phone call in the middle of the night to wake us up. Then on Sunday morning, at 7.30am we were loudly awoken by a PA system right below our window. Went on for a few hours as triathlon runners headed off. Would have been a nice sight if it wasn't for the fact we needed some sleep due to the construction noise, night time phone call, noisy guests and lack of fresh air! The toiletries in the room are very poor, quality, unusable. So make sure you bring your own. Cocktails down by the pool were terrible, Bad ingredients, super expensive, badly made and tasted vile. All served in a plastic cup and not even a cherry floating in the muck for the price! But the pool, trees, loungers and gym are all nice. Last night we had 2 cocktails in the bar area and they were great. This place must be losing regular customers a lot. A senior manager just called me volunteering to listen to the tale of woe. He offered us dinner in the hotel restaurant tonight for the two of us. I said great, but please please can someone just fix the air conditioning?? We have been here 6 days in 3 rooms and still nothing. I am prepared to ignore the 'manly' stains on the headboard and carpet. But I just want to have some cool air and get some sleep.

That morning on our second day we came out the elevator and were addressed by name by a staff member of the hotel. This is a large hotel and such an experience I had never had before. This month I returned for the first time and that experience ten years ago was only a small peak of the superior service I have experienced during this visit. In fact I was so overwhelmed by the service in this hotel that I canceled and changed my travel plan, just to return to this hotel a few days later and enjoy it's spectacular environment, facilities, staff and service for another four days. During both stays we stayed in a gorgeous one bedroom suite facing the harbor. The rooms are exceptionally spacious, with walk in closet, beautiful bathroom, tasteful and classy furnishings and spectacular comfy bed. I understand that an overhaul of the rooms is under way, but I have to say it is quite remarkable that after 12 or 13 years (since the hotel opened) the decor has kept up to be tasteful and stylish withstanding fashion and decoration trends of the last decade. Something that can not be said of most hotels. What may have colored my experience at this hotel is the fact that I booked the club floor. I am familiar to the club-floor concept, but the Ritz Carlton Singapore has given me new meaning to the club-floor-experience. The Club Lounge on the top floor of the building is exceptionally well appointed with beautiful furnishings and fabrics. It is spacious and offers different areas, both table seating and comfortable lounge seating. Check-in takes place here as well. Food servings are of very high quality and despite having spent here about 7 days in the last month I never had a feeling the the food offer was repetitive. On many occasions there is a chef in the lounge preparing fresh food right there and then. The food is themed by day, giving it a good variation. Despite the lounge being busy one day with a large group the food offer was always ample. I must say that I sampled some of the best food from the region here at the lounge. In addition the lounge provides drinks all day long including champagne from breakfast to the late evening. Not just any champagne: Moet & Chandon, how classy! Although the hotel surpassed my expectations in all the above ways, the real and fundamental difference to any experience I have ever had before at any other hotel is the Club floor staff. During my stay I met some of the warmest, most gracious, professional and funny people. The Club floor team is what really makes this hotel to a one of a kind. I felt no reason to venture out into Singapore. I kept returning to the lounge for breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner, desert, cocktails. At all times the staff made me feel comfortable, happy and I do not remember having had so many laughs with hotel employees ever before. The passion in the people that work here can not be trained, it is clear to me that they really enjoy their work, form an exceptionally close team and are driven by passion, professionalism, ambition and happyness. What a difference to the average hotel. At the same time the staff was very observant and always looked for ways to exceed our expectations. Little things like informing housekeeping when you walk in for breakfast so your room is made while you have breakfast, anticipating your specific needs in every way, just incredible. Other than the room and the club lounge I really enjoyed the pool. It's gorgeous, large, lush and exceptionally well designed. Remarkably empty for such a large hotel, only during the weekends it seemed a bit busier. Pool staff was lovely and providing water, a friendly talk or there to assist in any way. Although I have a rigid gym routine and the hotel has fantastic Cybex equipped gym, I didn't make it to the gym once.. I was simply to relaxed. Also during my staff I kept being approached by the very friendly people of guest relations addressing me by name informing about my stay or just having a chat. I felt so looked after by. But other staff as well, from front door to health club, all are so warm, friendly and funny. There seems a looseness in their approach and manners that you would not expect in such a 'formal' hotel, yet it works its magic. Leaving this hotel was hard, especially when seeing all the club floor staff lined up at the front door to say good bye. Now that was just unbelievable. All I can say is, if you want to be blown away by a hotel experience, book this hotel and definitely go for the club floor. It is exceptional value. There will be no regrets only a strong feeling wanting to return to this hotel paradise.", "Date": "June 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cUnderwhelmed by the whole experience\u201d", "Author": "faithz17", "ReviewID": "UR31212575", "Content": "maybe my expectations were too high, but i was disappointed with my stay as it's a supposedly 6 star hotel. it's ok for a 5 star hotel but just not there yet as a 6 star. somehow the service wasn't personal, like the smiles all not really warm if there were smiles in the first place... and they couldn't even get a simple thing right like the fact that breakfast was included in our reservation, not once but TWICE... room wise, we had a kallang bay view room... room was big, but somehow the furnishings were a bit plain, like it's nice but doesn't show luxury, definitely not what one would expect to pay for SGD$350++... but it was spacious, even with a living room area, had my 2 brothers- and 2 sisters-in-law and 4 kids over at one point and still had enough space to host everyone... bed wise, surprisingly normal... linens were good, but the bed itself a bit too firm almost hard, prefer my bed to have be full down so it's comfy yet gives enough back support... (in fact i would say the bed in The Sentosa is much nicer... see my other review) another thing, the bed side clock was slow by 20 mins... it's a small thing you can forgive in a 3 star hotel, but for a 6 star, i feel that the attention to detail is lacking. one thing nice, was the evening turndown service, where they placed a bookmark on the duvet for your bedtime reading, which i thought was a nice touch. Bathroom on the other hand, was FANTASTIC... full marble furnishings, bathtub with a view of the kallang bay (we were on the 19th floor)... though hubby had a bit of problem with the blinds, they will refuse to close facing down and will auto open up a bit... maybe the setting was to ensure that our view is not blocked, but hubby was very conservative! lol... not sure if there's supposed to be a protective film layer to prevent others on the surrounding buildings from looking in... Pool was honestly disappointing... when we reached there, it was like, that's it? it's a 1.4m deep pool, seemed a little worn... but one nice touch was the heated jacuzzi... service wise, i'm surprised that towels were just placed on a table for guests to help themselves, rather than having a pool assistant to offer them to guests, which was what i experienced in a 4 star hotel previously... don't see why a 4 star hotel can provide such service and a \"6 star\" hotel cannot? overall, if the rate is like around $200, maybe will stay again, but most likely will prefer to try Oriental or Pan Pac... but the cheapest internet rate is like $350++ no breakfast, definitely not worth it...", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai, India", "Title": "\u201cFantastic rooms + Great view + Excellent Staff & Service = Heaven !\u201d", "Author": "Indian_Star", "ReviewID": "UR30570717", "Content": "We stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Early April 09.

The third time I have been there. Now Ritz does not go overboard on loyal customers...ie, the second time I was there six months ago no one recognised me but this time they did. It helped that I had mailed in earlier ! I like the way the hotel has created a small tropical island feel by planting thick foliage around the hotel. Its not too much but enough to create a sense of greenery. Most hotels manage their customer interactions quite well but Ritz does it cleanly and professionally. There is a sense that you are being looked after and cared for. The rooms are perhaps the best part of the Ritz, particularly the Club level. The Marina Bay view and the bathrooms are to die for. The bathtubs open out completely and you can look at the city as you are bathing. The only hitch is that my room was facing the Kallang Bay side which in turn has the Singapore Flyer or Singapore's London Eye turning silently. The lady checking me in told me that be careful, \"people carry binoculars in the Flyer and they look this side too.\" The view is again outstanding. The only hitch is that Singapore's casino (part of Las Vegas Sense group) is also being built on one side of the bay so while you see the skyline on the right side, the left side is a maze of ugly cranes and half constructed buildings - three big ones. At some point (next year I thought I heard) it will become a glittering complex. The other good part is the location. The Ritz is just half an hour away from the airport and everything in turn is close by (guess everything in Singapore is). So its a great location to base yourself.) There is one good restaurant on the ground floor, its good, nothing outstanding or memorable, in Singapore one tends to go out to do the adventerous stuff like the open carts a walking distance away, or Clarke Quay and Boat Quay. One did breakfast at the Club level dining room on the 32nd floor. Where again the feeling is like a private dining room in parts with a great view... The pool looks nice from above but I didn't use it. Its surrounded by trees and plants so once again a nice feel. All in all, I would recommend a stay, for relaxation or if you are visiting Singapore for shopping and other things. Overall, its good value for money as long as they keep the rates under, say $400 - $500 Sing a room per night.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk, UK", "Title": "\u201cAlmost fabulous . . .\u201d", "Author": "Pausanias", "ReviewID": "UR27732423", "Content": "On our outward journey to New Zealand we had chosen the Mandarin Oriental (qv), an old favourite of ours, though this time we found its brutalist 1980s lobby and inward-looking restaurants a little dated. So, nine weeks later, on our return journey, we went next door to the Ritz and were given deluxe corner suite 926 with breakfast and a late check-out of 8pm. All for S$450. Not bad huh? The suite was essentially magnificent, blessed with Cinerama views of the Marina and the anchorage beyond. The legendary Ritz bathroom did not disappoint, there were two TVs, a separate sitting room, deep sofas, a proper writing desk, free internet, a walk-in wardrobe etc etc etc. There were a few niggles - slight scuffing everywhere and an absence of electric plug sockets so you had to put your kettle on the floor. Not that the kettle worked. Nor did the battery-powered weighing scales. And there were only two tissues in the box. Apart from this, it was fabulous. While this hotel might be a huge tower block, it\u2019s quite sympathetic to look at and the public areas and restaurants are airily spectacular. The buffet breakfast was par for the course, not historic, and the Chinese food was decidedly in the artsy modern vogue, rather than the traditional and arguably tastier Cantonese style. A hamburger the next day was horrible. Service was on the cusp of kowtowing groveldom. From our room to the breakfast I reckon we were bowed to and given a \u2018Good morning!\u2019 by at least 20 members of staff. One of the main reasons we chose the Ritz was the pool, a lovely green and largely shaded oasis that seemed a better prospect than the Mandarin. And so it was, for an hour. Then the screaming kids arrived and wars over sunbeds broke out. We endured it for another hour. And not once did anyone offer us water, or coffee or anything.

My room was ready at around 11am and my bags had been delivered. The room was an end of a corridor and I think larger due to this. I loved it and the bathroom especially. I had read so much about the bathrooms but I was not disappointed. Each evening I sat in the bath with the light out and enjoyed the view which was fantastic. I never take a bath at home but the sheer atmosphere was not to be missed. I showered in the morning and this was also large with good water pressure. The bed was wonderful so comfortable and with fine linens. The sofa and the rugs were a little worn but for me this was not a major problem. There was a large TV and tea and coffee facilities which I was delighted to see. I didn't eat in the hotel but chose to explore and found many interesting places to eat. I had booked afternoon tea at Raffles and this was the highlight of the trip for me. I enjoyed my time in Singapore and staying at the Ritz especially.

On my final afternoon I used the outside facility to sit in the sun and relax as I had an overnight flight to Auckland. Very comfortable loungers! I had a problem with a phone card I purchased. I was told that I could use it from my room both by the Concierge and one of the Hotel receptionist. On checking out I had a huge bill of around $140. Apparently I didn't know that when I used an outside line there was a local call charge for this. I told them that this had not been explained to me and also I had made many mistaken calls due to the code etc. The Receptionist spoke to several people and I was then told that this charge would be removed. An excellent response and during the time I was waiting I was again offered coffee and juice. The staff were extremely apologetic and I can't praise them highly enough. I had my bags collected from my room and they were stored in a safe place when I came to check out. A very nice young man again. Whilst waiting for my taxi to the Airport I was offered a seat inside as it was very hot outside and given a bottle of iced water. Another nice touch.

This festive season, treat your loved ones to a unique ice-skating experience in Kallang Ice World before returning to the luxurious confines of our guestrooms. The Christmas On Ice package includes: * A one-night stay in a Deluxe Kallang Bay View Room * Buffet breakfast for two adults and two children (below 12 years of age) * Colouring book and crayon set for the children (maximum of 2 sets per reservation) * In-room Christmas amenity * 15 percent off The Ritz-Carlton Gift Collection * 20 percent off Kallang Ice World entry fee for adults and complimentary tickets for two children (below 12 years of age) Seems worth it right? WRONG! First thing when we were checking in, the front desk officer who was serving us looked like she couldn't be bothered to serve another fellow singaporean. While all the other officers actually made an effort to escort the other guests(in front of our eyes) to the elevator, she just told me and my husband that our room is on the 5th floor. Yeah small matter, i know where the elevator was but it made me feel inferior. Nevermind that, when we got to the room, it was crap. The room was crap, the view was crap and half of the rug had a stain that looked like a dog had just relieved itself on it.The wooden floor creaked so loudly when i walked. The tv was not LCD and come on, it was the 5th floor!The hotel lobby is on the 3rd floor so my room was practically the first storey of guest rooms. I requested for a higher floor when i made the reservation and i was really unhappy. So, i made some calls to the front desk to request a higher floor and we waited for like more than 2 hrs to be upgraded to the 29th floor marina view room. Compliments to Mr Manjit for that:) To be honest yes, the room was excellent. The view was splendid. The bathroom was nice but half of the furniture looked a little old.They really need to do some upgrading to their furniture.Anyways, so it was my husband's bday and they sent us a little bday cake for us to enjoy. Thank you for that. However, we were promised some christmas amenity as shown on the package and some vouchers for the ice skating thing but they gave us nothing except for the bday cake. So, i called front desk to enquire and they told me the bday cake was actually the christmas amenity. WHAT. THE. CRAP. When I went to pan pac recently for my bday they actually gave me a bday cake without having me to book some stupid christmas package. So, all in all what I actually got for CHRISTMAS ON ICE package was a 1 night room stay and buffet breakfast. Funny, i would have thought BED AND BREAKFAST would be a better name for the package.

We included breakfasts in our tariff and for a hotel of this class in this location I feel they are good value.

Hours passed, we didn't get a call back. We finally tried the Menu on the TV and it was working. At night when the engineer finally called, we told them the TV has been fixed. Friday night - we're at the club enjoying our in-room dining food. They turned off the lights because the fireworks were about to start. A club staff asked if we could still see okay. We said we're fine, and we'll just wait a while since the fireworks would only take 15 minutes. We're able to enjoy the fireworks because it was dark in the clubroom - there's no glare from the mirrors. There's some music that was being played, and it was timed nicely with the fireworks. Saturday night - we're at the club again, waiting for the fireworks. The lights were never turned off/dimmed. And there's no music like it was on Friday. We're seeing our reflections in the mirror because of the lights in the club. While we're checking out on Sunday, I mentioned this to one of the male club staff. And he said, \"because some of our guests were still eating, we could not turn off the lights.\" We then said,\" well we were eating on Friday night, but you turned off the lights anyway.\" He repeated the same comments, and we left it at that. I'm assuming there's some VIP guest that 'reserved' the corner dining area at the Club. I noticed the staff were surrounding the couple with the baby and everyone kept greeting them. I'm guessing the lights were left on for them. I don't think this is fair for the other Club guests. If there's a VIP guest with special requests, then the VIP guest should dine in his room instead of sacrificing everyone's enjoyment at the Club. I think it's a selfish gesture and I don't understand why the Club staff obliged the request. The lights should be dimmed for the fireworks as it was on Friday night. So, we've decided we're not returning to Ritz Carlton Singapore, since we don't feel that we're being fairly treated as other guests. It's quite sad actually, we've always loved the Ritz and we've been going there for years, but I guess it's time to move on and find a better place.", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington, dc", "Title": "\u201cBeware the Marina view rock concerts\u201d", "Author": "singapore9", "ReviewID": "UR19005628", "Content": "This is a beautiful hotel with top notch staff overall and an excellent fitness facility.

The hotel itself is pretty old, as if it reached its top in the 90s and never rejuvenated thereafter. The room is spacious but the d\u00e9cor was so wrong. The sofa and TV was laid in-line meaning that I had to turn my head 90 degree in order to watch it. Bedside table was so tiny and was occupied with some stuff i.e telephone, note pad and chucky lamb which didn\u2019t provide me enough light to read. Working table , again filled with bulky stuff like unusable lamp, hotel/city guide. There are not enough outlets to charge my cell-phone, laptop and digital camera. I went into the bath room, of course the bathtub sits right next to the large window but I was recommended by the hotel staff to put the shade down as the near by buildings are infamous of peeping hotel\u2019s guest. The toiletry was the worst I\u2019ve ever seen in the 6-stared hotel. It came in colorful / cheap packaging. I asked house keeping if they had other kinds of shampoo/soap. The answer is no. So, I had to go out and bought my own relyable shampoo at Watson store. The shower was nothing but ordinary. The weighing scale was broken. The blanket was smelly, some kind of stir-fried food. It was my bad luck that the construction was next to my window. Even though I was on 26 fl. I was irritated by the rumbled machine at nite. This is not the hotel\u2019s false, but they should have warned me about this so I opted to stay on the other side or perhaps change the hotel. The breakfast stunned me most. Well, I have the Fullerton to compare to; especially they charge exactly the same price. The breakfast is cheap, they have the muesli with canned fruits and this is not acceptable. The pasty is noting special. All I have to say the service is superb though. The breakfast lunge looked a bit dim with weird d\u00e9cor especially the creepy green alien-liked installed on the wall. I have no sense of Art, perhaps. I stayed only 2 nites instead of 9 and I moved to the Fullerton. Seemed like The Fullerton had it all; I didn\u2019t have to turn my neck to watch tv, I had enough space on my desk. The wash room is very nice with large round showerhead of rain-dome type. The toiletry was not that superb but better than the ritz. The pillow and blanket smelled good and comfy. The breakfast was superb where the freshly squeezed juice \u2018s available. I scraped the honey out of honeycomb. And above all, I could sit out side and enjoyed the view of the Boat Quey. I guess it\u2019s enough about my comments.

The driver from the airport had even stated that it was a 6 star hotel so therefore I was convinced that we had been put in some unrenovated room by mistake and even went down to reception to request viewing another. I couldn't believe that they all looked like this, but they did! Whilst the service remained impeccable, the hotel is sorely in need of a refurb . If we hadn't paid in advance we would have relocated immediately and only the thought of paying for two hotels a night disuaded us from doing. Although I did contact my travel agent to continue to explore this option the Ritz Carlton wouldn't consider reducing our stay or refunding any monies. I would go as far as saying the hotel spoiled our enjoyment of Singapore as we hated coming back home at the end of the day and my husband refused to walk around in bare feet on the carpet because if looked and felt so dusty. What has happed to Ritz Carlton chain? I know of at least two hotels in Australia where their establishment used to be top notch and are now way down the rung. I will never take the risk at another one.

Ground-breaking architecture and stunning bathrooms with windows overlooking the skyline were a real draw when the property opened 10 years ago, but a decade of wear and tear are starting to take their toll. My room on the 24th floor overlooked the harbor with its superb view. However, know that if you stay on this side of the hotel, the 24 hour construction noise from the casino project (still only just finishing the foundations) means a high noise level. The hotel's ventilation system also produces a low-pitched rumbling which can be annoying. Stains on carpets and furniture, peeling wallpaper in a few places, and filthy blinds above the 'bathtub window' are signs of the threads of decay being spun. The rooms are spacious & comfortable, but poor design means that the room doors open directly into the room (no foyer or hall) by the bed. Slamming doors and any noise in the hall can be extremely disruptive. Thoughtful staff and deftly-served room service, but the food is as expensive as London and small in portions (one piece of toast constituted a toast order, and note you pay $5 extra if you want 'premium' maple syrup with your waffles/pancakes instead of sugar syrup). The hotel lacks a cozy bar or place where a solitary traveler can relax; the lounge for drinks/tea is hard by the reception desks, and requests for a light meal there brought baffled stares. The Chinese restaurant is excellent; the other choice being the noisy, large buffet-oriented restaurant, always jammed with Singaporean families. Generous buffet, but $55 is steep. Limited ala carte menu & slow service. I've stayed at the Ritz Carlton many times over the years since it opened, and you can chart its subtle decline by the change in clientele, which now seems to consist mostly of package tourists and conventioneers, as opposed to the top-drawer business people when the property opened. Location will be great when the new circle line underground opens in early 2008, but right now it's a very long hoof to the nearest MRT station, and taxis can be hard to come by.", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cGood service but ok room and ok food only.\u201d", "Author": "Gingersnaps", "ReviewID": "UR11471459", "Content": "My husband & I visit S'pore 2 to 3 times a year because of my family and friends.

It's true -- it's big, with a glorious view of the city from the massive window by the large bathtub. The bathtub is spiffily designed too, with the taps along the outer edge of the tub so that you don't have to lean in to manipulate them. There are nice little extras like a hairbrush, mouthwash, a loofah and bath salts. The lighting isn't very good though, not being bright enough for the size of the room. And while you may enjoy the view while soaking naked in the tub, be aware that anyone in the nearby office building can easily see you. There's a separate shower, which is always nice, but the shower head, while looking very impressive, is lacklustre in performance. The room itself isn't particularly impressive. I certainly expected better of the Ritz and for the price I paid. The floor is wooden and largely uncarpeted, which means it's not very soundproof or child-friendly either. The bed is higher than normal, which means it also isn't very child-friendly. Housekeeping is disappointingly inefficient, not attending to one's room even when one is gone for several hours. And if you're wondering where the kettle is (and the measly number of complimentary tea bags), look under the TV in the cabinet. Don't expect it to be near the ice bucket, the drinking glasses, or the fridge. Breakfast was disappointing too. The selection was mediocre, as was the quality. Nothing compared to the range at Swissotel The Stamford, which even included salmon. The stuff on offer at the Ritz was average, and much of it was cheap. The staff were very courteous though.

Better still was the bathroom, which, unlike the vast majority of hotels, had a window. And what a window: from my bath, I was able to enjoy a sweeping vista across the city, over the marina and out to sea; perfect after a hard day of slogging round town. And all for a price that wouldn't get you 3 stars in most of the world's major cities. Furthermore, the staff are second to none for charm and efficiency. In this context, the few small niggles seem so minor that I'm almost embarassed to list them. But in the interests of completeness I'll do so anyway: for a hotel that prides itself on its art collection, the expanse of unadorned, beige walls in my room was faintly depressing, and made the room appear unfinished; a squashed fly on the wall of my bathroom when I arrived on Monday was still there when I checked out on Friday; and breakfast - a few third rate pastries and a limited selection dull fruit (mostly from tins) - was a pretty poor effort.

The staff go above & beyond, to make you feel welcome. The rooms are unquestionably grand, the location is good & I cannot think of anything negative to say about this stay.

The room was nice and spacious which is a definite plus point. However, given that it is the Ritz, I would have expected their bed linens to be more pristine.

I thought they could have paid a little more attention to tiny details, such as the 2 broken lights in our bathroom as well as the broken light bulb in room. Housekeeping came 3 times to fix the lights but if they paid more attention they would have noticed the broken lights. Most 5-star hotels in Asia will provide 2 bottles of complimentary mineral water every day, some will provide 2 bottles every morning and every evening (total 4 bottles a day). We are happy to purchase our own but this hotel gave us 2 very small bottles of complimentary mineral water on Day 1 and that was it! If you're the Ritz Carlton you don't want your guests to remember you as the hotel who was too cheap to give their guests complimentary mineral water (yes, I know the tap water is safe to drink in Singapore). We asked guest services if any hawker centers were open for breakfast and the words that came out of the lady's mouth was, \"it's the 2nd day...\" It's the 2nd day of WHAT? When you're the Ritz Carlton you may wish to consider thinking about your response from the guest's point of view before responding with just any response. You want to your guests to feel like you understand them and you've gone out of your way to help them. That lady definitely needs more training on how to handle guest inquiries. When we checked out the lady who checked us out spent half the time talking on her mobile telephone with someone else and asked me for my room number twice (although I had given her my room number when I approached the desk). She obviously couldn't multi-task (I wasn't expecting that) but I would have been happy to wait for her the finish her very important telephone call. BTW, the 3 other people manning the check out desk weren't doing anything and I would have been happy to have someone else assist us. Again, that left a bad impression. Finally, when we arrived at the airport we discovered that the taxi we took was the more expensive type, flat rate SGD35 for the ride. As we are not from Singapore the bell captain did not inform us that there were two types of taxis (regular vs luxury).

I've stayed in a number of hotels around Europe and Asia, and this was by far the best. The Ritz-Carlton is certainly grand inside and has lovely comfortable rooms which are incredibly spacious and equipped with excellent facilities. However the best thing about this hotel is the service which is absolutely outstanding in every regard. Check-in was a breeze, and I was even offered a soft drink whilst they were allocating my room. The attention to detail is spectacular, combined with a genuinely warm and friendly attitude. This applies to every one of the staff I met at the hotel. The receptionist kindly walked me to the lift and provided a lot of useful information. It is immediately evident that the staff are so well trained and are always on the lookout for opportunities to help guests. Even if someone cannot help directly, they will ensure that your problem or request is dealt with as quickly as possible. The breakfast buffet is fairly costly at around SGD 44 including taxes if you compare it to the cost of meals outside of the hotel. However it's actually fairly reasonable compared to other 4* and 5* hotels in the vicinity. The Ritz-Carlton is only a few dollars pricier than other hotels but the quality and variety in the buffet is outstanding. Combined with superb service, I highly recommend having breakfast at the hotel. At the end of one of my breakfasts I completed a comments card that I was given. I was pleasantly surprised to find that a member of staff came over to thank me for my time and was interested in what I had written. I had suggested that the hotel might want to add a few more vegetarian options, such as Roti Prata. She let me know that they did in fact serve this as an a la carte option. I said I'd be returning the following morning to try this, and I was amazed to find that when I arrived, the same lady greeted me and remembered our conversation the day before. I had a wonderful breakfast - Roti Prata served with Tek Tarik - the latter isn't even on the menu but she arranged for the chef to prepare it specially. The health club facilities are also superb - a fully equipped gym, swimming pool and jacuzzi. When I went to the gym on the second occasion the staff even remembered my name - now that's impressive! Going back to the rooms - widescreen flat-panel TV, enormous king-size bed (one of the most comfortable I have ever come across), elegant furnishings and a good sized desk really make the accommodation here stand out from other hotels. The bathroom is incredible too - an ultra-powerful shower, and a bathtub with an amazing view. Everything is just so well thought out and appropriately positioned to make one's stay as comfortable as possible. I only have a couple of minor suggestions for improvement. The wireless internet access is extremely costly. It would be great if the hotel could provide free wireless internet access at least in the lobby areas. In addition, the rooms could do with a master light switch. Can't wait to return to Singapore and to the Ritz-Carlton Millenia again - a delightful hotel that really makes its guests feel special.

We were met at the airport and quickly whisked away along the east coast parkway to the hotel. On arrival at the hotel we were taken straight up to the Club lounge as we had booked a club room. Unfortunately, the club manager informed us that our room wasnt available immediately. He asked if we would object to being upgraded to a one bedroomed suite instead. That didnt take much thought! The suite was enormous and overlooked Marina Bay. A fascinating view by day with all the activity but by night it is even more impressive with views over the bay, the Fullerton, the financial district and along the Singapore river to Boat Quay. The club lounge had been extended since our last visit. There are still 5 food and beverage presentations per day. So basically, should you wish , you can eat all your meals here.( Meals are buffet type though). A very nice addition is the Martini bar which overlooks the city of Singapore. Here, May makes absolutely wonderful martinis, several of which we sampled. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to City Hall MRT which links you with the rest of the island. You can walk to it via shopping malls and links so rarely have to go outside in the sticky heat. Taxis are also plentiful outside the hotel. We only used them once and I think we chose badly. The taxi driver was very disgruntled when we asked to go to the Stamford hotel, about 5 mins away and grumbled all the way there. The staff are very friendly, especially in the club lounge.

During the first two years of operation I felt that the Ritz-Carlton was the best hotel in Singapore hands down.

On two seperate check in occasions the staff was brisk in replies to the point of being discourteous. In the past I sent my clients, family and friends to this hotel. The emergence of several excellent boutique hotels and serviced apartments in Singapore make the Ritz Carlton a less attractive proposition. If a premium price is to be charged, the serivce had better be up to the level. It isn't. As a result I cannot recommend this hotel as a first choice. If I pay a premium I want premium service, it's as simple as that. The interior upholstery fabrics, carpets, and lighting scheme could use a refresh as well; they're looking tired. The Ritz-Carlton is still better than average; it's just not as good as it used to be. On a plus point, the bathrooms are still the most romantic and breathtaking in Singapore.

Firstly as you come into the hotel the immediate view is one of a staircase going down into the basement, certainly no wow factor, as you look to the left a huge open plan (not romantic at all) restaurant that would seat around 100 people, go to the right and there is a large open lounge area (that I later realised is the bar too, go figure??) this also doubles as the reception, which was weird I thought, having people trundling though with luggage and bags whilst people are sitting around in their finery. I didn't like it at all. Room was a nice size, bed lovely, and bathroom amazing with THOSE windows but the decor is all a bit bland and because of this you see lots of scuff marks everywhere, carpets are bland and dirty too. All in all, I think this place needs to have a serious designer in to revamp the entire hotel, especially the bar/lounge/reception area, that was the biggest disappointment.

We stayed at Raffles the Plaza, The Ritz-Carlton, The Four Seasons and the Shangri-La. Our second stop was the Ritz-Carlton Millenia - A luxury hotel but with fading elegance. ROOM We reserved the Deluxe Room with the Panoramic Marina Bay view. The room itself was very spacious and luxuriously appointed. There was a large LCD TV, a writing desk with Internet access, a sitting area with a huge Marina view window, and a walk-in closet. The room was very bright and cheerful, but the yellow paint and the octagonal windows looked a bit too silly! The bed was very comfortable and the hospital-white bed sheets were acceptable. The room was clean, but it looked old and somewhat shabby in my opinion. BATHROOM The bathroom was luxurious, but again it was very \"old\" luxury - The brown marble etc, was stained in places with age. The toilet was in a separate room connecting to the bathroom. There was a separate shower cubicle and the famous view baths offering beautiful views of the Singapore Marina. The no-name Ritz-Carlton branded amenities were disappointing of a hotel of this calibre. But I did read in their hotel magazine that they'll be switching to Bvlgari Amenities in the near future. HOTEL FACILITIES/RESTAURANTS The hotel offered a fitness centre/Spa and a pool, but we didn't use these facilities. There were numerous restaurants to choose from, but we only had afternoon tea the Chihuly Lounge - The tea and the cozy atmosphere were enjoyable. However, the lounge which is opposite the lobby is also looking it's age. There were some stains on the carpets and there was an overall slightly worn look to the whole lobby/lounge area. SERVICE There were no service-related problems. The staff were are very friendly and courteous. The only complain I have is that the Ritz Carlton group doesn't offer any affinity/frequent guest/frequent flyer programs even though it's owned by the Marriot Group. Furthermore, their tendency to use internationally unrecognised geographic names (i.e. \"Arabian\" Gulf as opposed to the correct \"Persian Gulf\") in their brochures can be insulting/politically insensitive to certain guests. SURROUNDINGS The hotel itself is a bit out of the way from the city centre (but an easy taxi ride away). For entertainment and shopping, there is direct access to the Marina Shopping Complex. You can also walk and explore the area's numerous other shopping areas. CONCLUSION This is a great hotel, but it's definitely showing it's age.

At the City Hall area I got my compass out and since it was a beautiful evening I decied to walk to the hotel along the bay tugging my carry-on behind me. The walk was about a half a mile. Longer than I hoped but the sidewalks in Singapore are very good. At the hotel, I was relieved of my luggage an pointed to the reception desk. I was promptly checked in and was given a room on the 22 floor with a bay view as requested. This hotel was built in 1997 and a big deal was made about the bathroom, which has a large octangular window over the tub. Wow! Here I was in this large bath with a specatular view of the skyline of Singapore over a bay. I don't usually use the tub, but this evening was special. Took a bath after dinner. Unfortunatly the tub had a faulty drain and I could not drain it. It was fixed the next day as I was out. For dinner I walked over to the adjacent regional shopping mall (recently renovated) and found a fast food place to my take-out. This mall is open until 10:30 PM. Note that much of Singapore isn't open until 11 AM. (Do not bother visiting Chinatown in the morning). This 608 room hotel is large in scale. The room is big, the bath tub is big, the separate shower is big and the bed is big. A tall person would love this place. As usual with luxury hotels, the hotel room was quiet and well equipped. I did find that the pillows flattened out during the night. Westin's hotel \" heavenly bed\" was not beat by this hotel. I expected the hotel to be too expensive for breakfast so I walked over to the adjacent mall for my modest requirements. The next evening I checked on the pool. It was a bit sterile but once you got there, it is rather private. No major grounds like at the Shangri -La. I wanted to visit the famous Singapore Zoo. The consierge was helpful. Gave me an accurate estimate of the cab fare. You can't ask for more than that. Singapore is a difficult for a non-local to get around in as there isn't much of a grid system to the streets.

I would never stay here again.", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cThmbs Up for the Service\u201d", "Author": "rome1", "ReviewID": "UR4250171", "Content": "Stayed at the Ritz Millenia Singpore for 4 nights on business. Probably the best Ritz I've stayed at service wise. I arrived at around 5 am and they did their best to get me fed and accomodated until the room was ready at 7 am. Valet left the hotel and went into town to get me a phone card so I could make some calls, and then was embarressed when I tipped him. I should also point out that the restaurant (buffet) was fantastic and the rooms were very cool-- light hardwood floor, tiger eye marble-- Very contemporary, yet Asian feel. Also, the hotel seems to be a hot spot for the local well heeled, so at night it gets very busy in the lounge and has quite a buzz, which to me was a plus.", "Date": "December 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "Tui65", "ReviewID": "UR4164544", "Content": "We stayed four nights at the Ritz Carlton in a corner executive suite, and it was fantastic. The views over the bay were magnificent and you could stand in the shower and look out both the bathroom and lounge windows at the same time. The room was extremely spacious, and with the high ceilings made it seem even bigger. The bed was extremely comfortable and had marvellous pillows - always a plus. The bathroom was fantastic, wonderfully appointed with all sorts of things - soaps, bubble bath and bath oil, shower gel, shampoo etc and the towels and robes were nice and fluffy. We ate quite a bit in their restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. You have the choice of a buffet at every meal, which looked great or like us you could order off the menu. I was very impressed - the food was hot, tasty and fresh - what more could you ask for. They had quite a well set up gym overlooking the pool and in the early morning when you can't sleep, it's great to go down and have a workout. I didn't use the pool but it did look very inviting. The staff were excellent! Always said hello and eager to help. I've stayed in a number of 5 star hotels and while not quite having the understated quiet elegance of the Singapore Four Seasons, I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "December 6, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d302231-Reviews-Ritz_Carlton_Millenia_Singapore-Singapore.html", "Price": "$375 - $641*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7 Raffles Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">039799</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "302231", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/43/e3/1b/deluxe-marina-bay-view.jpg"}}
